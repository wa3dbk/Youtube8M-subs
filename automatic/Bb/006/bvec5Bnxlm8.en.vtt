 which already offers its maximum value to 1750 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.960
 revolutions per minute and keeps it 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.960
 until 3000 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.050
 the available driving force is 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.700
 moves to the front wheels by 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.040
 means of an automatic gearshift 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.020
 double clutch and six relations and it 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.520
 has the system this to be of 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.370
 automatic stop and start in 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.230
 arrests there are also some cams after 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.500
 the steering wheel to make the changes in 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.090
 sequential manual mode the changes are 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.010
 fast and the system works well 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.630
 although it is a little rough to low 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.630
 speed especially cold 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.110
 a control in the center console 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.560
 called terry semel allows you to choose

 between several driving programs 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.270
 normal sport of sporty eco 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.040
 economic and individual a program that 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.069
 allows the driver to combine the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.469
 adjustments to your liking 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.879
 depending on the selected program the 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:01.249
 engine management allows some 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.109
 more or less dynamic accelerations and the 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:05.480
 engine noise that reaches the passenger compartment 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.340
 is more or less intense also vary the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.989
 assistance to address the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.060
 availability of the stop and function 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.060
 start and the air conditioning settings 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.169
 the benefits are good for 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.879
 treatment of this version with a 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.979
 Acceleration from 0 to 100 kilometers per 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:29.530
 time in 82 seconds and a speed 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.530
 maximum of 230 kilometers per hour 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.840
 the average consumption mounted by Skoda is 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.280
 5 liters per 100 km who our 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.130
 test conducted with driving 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.350
 dynamic we have measured 6.8 liters each 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.480
 100 kilometers the figure in conditions 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.980
 real is superior to the homologated 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.300
 correct for a car of this size 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.300
 power of benefits 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.860
 the body has been lowered in 13 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.870
 millimeters with respect to combining badly 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.450
 and the morons of the suspension are more 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.400
 hard the rear axle mounts a 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.350
 suspension of the multi arm type and there 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.350
 stabilizer bars on both axes 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.040
 of series is counted on the blockade 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.660
 electronic differential xds that is 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.240
 integrated into the electronic program of 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.340
 Sp stability and improves the capacity of 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.930
 traction at the exit of the curves at 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.510
 time that reduces the tendency to 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.920
 understeer 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.530
 the address has the assistance 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.420
 progressive electric and brakes with 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.620
 large front ventilated discs 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.620
 they perform well with their function 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.450
 the car offers a remarkable efficiency 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.520
 and a very fast cornering step with a 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.020
 minimum rolling of the body but 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.730
 maintains a reasonable comfort of the 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.070
 march and bumps or joints 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.610
 dilatation do not turn into a dry 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.610
 shake 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.590
 materials and adjustments offer a good 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.360
 appearance with sporty details and the rs 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.050
 on the knob of the gear lever and on 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.050
 the headrest 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.870
 the front seats have a design 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.819
 sports with fabric and leather upholstery 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.249
 red stitching and headrest 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:25.770
 integrated and with a striking line 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:29.300
 Red holds the body very well and counts 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.300
 with mechanical lumbar adjustment 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.710
 there is an effective support platform for 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:41.689
 the left foot and the pedals in 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.689
 aluminum and rubber with a specific design 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:50.039
 but what we liked the most was 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:52.080
 the functionality and the huge volume of 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:55.219
 boot and the benefits and the 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.219
 roadholding 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.970
 what we liked the least was a 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.790
 rear center square and abruptness 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.820
 of the change dsg of the maneuvers to low 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.820
 speed 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.729
 yes
