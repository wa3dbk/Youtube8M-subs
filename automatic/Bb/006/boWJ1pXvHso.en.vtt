these you can either take a shot in the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.230 
these you can either take a shot in the
moment<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.869> choose<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.110> photo<00:01:47.240> so

we're<00:01:48.329> going<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.570> ahead<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.869> i'm

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
we're going to go ahead and do that i'm

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.340 
we're going to go ahead and do that i'm
going<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.560> choose<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.020> snapshot<00:01:52.020> from

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
going to choose this a snapshot from

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.530 
going to choose this a snapshot from
another<00:01:52.619> application<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.119> looked<00:01:54.360> at<00:01:54.479> a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
another application that we looked at a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.330 
another application that we looked at a
couple<00:01:54.810> days<00:01:55.140> ago<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.530> may<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.710> done<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
couple days ago and may have done and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.700 
couple days ago and may have done and
then<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.000> choose<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> thumbnail<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.200> let's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
then you can choose a thumbnail so let's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.010 
then you can choose a thumbnail so let's
do<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.270> obviously<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> circle

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
do this obviously this is a circle

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.020 
do this obviously this is a circle
thumbnail<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.530> opposed<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.070> say<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> square<00:02:02.850> one

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
thumbnail as opposed to say a square one

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.450 
thumbnail as opposed to say a square one
like<00:02:03.210> you'd<00:02:03.360> see<00:02:03.390> on<00:02:03.540> facebook<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:05.310> i'm<00:02:05.369> gonna

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
like you'd see on facebook so i'm gonna

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.010 
like you'd see on facebook so i'm gonna
go<00:02:05.520> ahead<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.700> hit<00:02:05.880> done<00:02:06.180> with<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.990> then

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
go ahead and hit done with that and then

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.779 
go ahead and hit done with that and then
you<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:07.740> set<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.129> view<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.459> bubble

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
you can set you can view the bubble

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.490 
you can set you can view the bubble
you've<00:02:08.879> got<00:02:09.030> everyone<00:02:09.509> all<00:02:09.750> my<00:02:09.899> friends<00:02:10.349> or

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
you've got everyone all my friends or

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500 
you've got everyone all my friends or
select<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.459> friend<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.940> actually<00:02:12.090> send

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
select a friend so you actually send

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.490 
select a friend so you actually send
these<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.840> specific<00:02:13.290> p

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
these to specific p

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.900 
these to specific p
or<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:13.800> can<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:14.040> dump<00:02:14.310> them<00:02:14.490> straight<00:02:14.760> to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
or you can just dump them straight to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.820 
or you can just dump them straight to
the<00:02:15.000> geotag<00:02:15.360> location<00:02:15.440> which<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.560> what<00:02:16.710> we're

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
the geotag location which is what we're

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.950 
the geotag location which is what we're
going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.100> do<00:02:17.220> here<00:02:17.780> obviously<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.840> can

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
going to do here obviously you can

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.600 
going to do here obviously you can
either<00:02:19.080> keep<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:19.770> or<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.040> create<00:02:20.430> it

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
either keep it here or you can create it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.100 
either keep it here or you can create it
in<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.850> bag<00:02:21.120> which<00:02:21.390> will<00:02:21.540> show<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:21.900> a

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
in a bag which will show you in just a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.390 
in a bag which will show you in just a
second<00:02:22.440> but<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.590> basic<00:02:22.830> idea<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.310> that

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
second but the basic idea here is that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.060 
second but the basic idea here is that
it<00:02:23.580> once<00:02:23.760> you've<00:02:23.910> created<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.390> bubble<00:02:25.070> there

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
it once you've created a bubble there

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.500 
it once you've created a bubble there
you<00:02:26.190> go<00:02:26.280> my<00:02:26.460> bubble<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.850> now<00:02:26.970> floating<00:02:27.270> around

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
you go my bubble is now floating around

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.420 
you go my bubble is now floating around
let<00:02:27.990> me<00:02:28.020> see<00:02:28.080> if<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.260> can<00:02:28.380> turn<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.560> GPS<00:02:29.070> signal

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
let me see if I can turn this GPS signal

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.100 
let me see if I can turn this GPS signal
thing<00:02:29.610> off<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:32.790> does<00:02:33.000> not<00:02:33.209> look<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.900> I

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
thing off it does not look like it I

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.580 
thing off it does not look like it I
don't<00:02:34.170> know<00:02:34.350> why<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.070> sorry<00:02:35.430> guys

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
don't know why I have that sorry guys

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.570 
don't know why I have that sorry guys
but<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.680> basic<00:02:37.920> idea<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.220> once<00:02:38.400> you've

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
but the basic idea is that once you've

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.949 
but the basic idea is that once you've
created<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:39.060> bubble<00:02:39.240> it's<00:02:39.480> geo<00:02:39.720> tagged

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
created a bubble it's geo tagged

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.300 
created a bubble it's geo tagged
specifically<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.709> location<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.220> was

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
specifically to the location it was

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.910 
specifically to the location it was
created<00:02:41.640> at<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.209> will<00:02:42.360> bounce<00:02:42.510> around<00:02:42.990> to

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
created at and it will bounce around to

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.290 
created at and it will bounce around to
give<00:02:44.040> an<00:02:44.130> example<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.700> can<00:02:44.820> hit<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.060> button

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
give an example you can hit this button

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.220 
give an example you can hit this button
and<00:02:45.570> then<00:02:46.230> see<00:02:46.650> all<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:48.720> know<00:02:48.780> nearby

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
and then see all of the you know nearby

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.660 
and then see all of the you know nearby
bubbles<00:02:49.650> which<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:49.920> not<00:02:50.100> doing<00:02:50.340> because<00:02:50.520> my

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
bubbles which is not doing because my

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.810 
bubbles which is not doing because my
GPS<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.239> freaking<00:02:51.570> out<00:02:51.660> for<00:02:51.840> some<00:02:52.020> reason<00:02:52.820> but

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
GPS is freaking out for some reason but

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
GPS is freaking out for some reason but
it<00:02:53.880> will<00:02:53.970> actually<00:02:54.090> show<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.510> bubbles

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
it will actually show you the bubbles

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.050 
it will actually show you the bubbles
nearby<00:02:55.260> see<00:02:56.070> there<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.250> go<00:02:56.370> we're<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:56.910> a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
nearby see there you go we're in a

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.910 
nearby see there you go we're in a
Colorado<00:02:57.630> right<00:02:57.870> there<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.380> there's<00:02:58.860> a

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
Colorado right there and there's a

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.070 
Colorado right there and there's a
single<00:02:59.340> bubble<00:02:59.489> outside<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.180> boulder<00:03:00.510> which

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
single bubble outside of boulder which

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.520 
single bubble outside of boulder which
would<00:03:01.200> be<00:03:01.320> me<00:03:02.060> on<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.270> note<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.690> user<00:03:04.170> base

it's geotag to this location and then

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.630 
it's geotag to this location and then
you<00:03:30.540> simply<00:03:30.690> snag<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.350> if<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:31.980> can<00:03:32.040> slap<00:03:32.459> the
