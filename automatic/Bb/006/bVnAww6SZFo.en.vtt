 Hello, my name is Joe and I'm 26. I'm born in Surrey. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 I started playing drums at the age of 13. Playing Wembley is .. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 can not be compared to anything I have done so far. And, in fact, I've never been here 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 and I have not seen shows. The first time I walk here and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 I go on stage and play "When in Rome". 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 I just can not describe what I'm feeling. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 I'm still clinging and I'm shocked by this amazing thing that's happening to me. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 We shot in many different places 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 and there was a scene where a boy was with his girlfriend in the background. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 He goes to the school where I teach - The Modern Music Academy in Glouford. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 When the auditions for this ad began, this boy came to me and told me he would have to leave early so he could go to a casting. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 I studied what was going on, but I still was not sure whether to let it go or not. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 After all, I let him go, and here they are on TV! I'm very glad for him.
