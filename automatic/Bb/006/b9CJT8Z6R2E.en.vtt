00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.320
 product that has reached us by

 June and the day has come good 23 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.770
 So it was 11 days of transfer 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.180
 from the USA what we ask is a cable 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.250
 for our microphone that will go 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.900
 connected to our camera fairly and 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.230
 well let's start with this little 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.510
 a box for it good we're going to open it 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.010
 for this part of here we are going to put the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.010
 scissors in this way 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.240
 here we have it 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.840
 and this piece of singing is free 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.119

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.159
 the links of this product and the 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.409
 others that we have designed is in 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.200
 the description of the video and well I'm 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.630
 in a box in a bit quick and here 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.630
 well this would not be here 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:33.950
 well here we have the packaging that comes 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.549
 by amazon part of the shipment 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.369
 globally we can here we can see it and 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.549
 well let's see what it is that 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:49.509
 First of all, here we would have 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:52.490
 our cable by technology 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.700
 here we have our invoice this 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.810
 part of amazon.com here we can 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.869
 see is the invoice in total 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.120
 and well what we have here is 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.440
 protection 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.780
 and well let's see what it is that 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.030
 contains the case that we have here is 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.400
 the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.069
 is a cable that as we can see them 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.680
 I explain quickly it becomes a 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.160
 balanced analog signal from a microphone 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.020
 professional to a similar signal but 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.209
 dual is to say that in the two channels 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.510
 both on the left and the right we're going 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.340
 to hear the same sound this for 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.050
 connect as well we said to the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.250
 beginning our professional microphone 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.550
 which in this case is going to be a south 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.380
 pg 58 to our camcorder or 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.610
 we can also connect it to cameras 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.680
 dslr and good also in the case as the 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.060
 that we are using focused on 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.830
 video especially then we're going to 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.459
 open this cut the bottom part of 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.459
 this form 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:10.349
 we would have it and ready in this case we have 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.450
 ordered a 15-foot version here what 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.650
 we can see and well here we have it very 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.090
 simple this is the the excel r connection 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.579
 balanced and good here we have it 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.560
 the 3.5 mm connection good so 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.959
 this has been in a boxing of this 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.239
 product of osa technologies and good that 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.299
