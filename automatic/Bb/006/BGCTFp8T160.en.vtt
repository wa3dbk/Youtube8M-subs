00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 the State Duma is preparing two 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.540
 amendments to the law on education which 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.519
 will be obliged to introduce free wifi on 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.110
 the territory of educational institutions one of 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.969
 amendments will force universities using 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.370
 own funds set in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.139
 educational buildings of the access point is old 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.340
 will obligate to introduce free wifi in 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.400
 schools that can use 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.960
 teachers and students the goal of amendments is to equalize 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.029
 the right of students to access information 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.730
 because not everyone has the opportunity 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.680
 pay wireless internet about 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.630
 how wi-fi can change the process 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.250
 learning by example of one Kuban 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.380
 school figured out Anna Sorokina 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.420
 In order for the school appeared Wi fi 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.280
 It does not require too much connection to 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.290
 Internet cable a few and routers and 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.450
 computer that will play a role 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.760
 server and filter student access to 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.850
 World Wide Web sites dignity 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.850
 this technology represents in 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.610
 Generally what about the cost 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.250
 equipment comparable to wired us 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.629
 no need to lay wires 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.449
 accordingly, much less is about 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.640
 the cost of these here we are extra 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.380
 one wifi access point works 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.630
 may cover approximately 3 school 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.850
 cabinet and about 20 computers let 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.160
 sometimes not the fastest but free 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.320
 wifi for a short time changes the process 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.270
 learning is particularly excited about innovation 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.950
 high school students truth on their state exam 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.289
 do not use the wireless network 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.539
 will be able to access wi-fi in this time 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.460
 school off but with 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.380
 using the wireless network to prepare for 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.539
 exams become more comfortable 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.820
 We are buying all sorts of little books out there for all CSE 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.390
 all this here but we have already decided them 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.710
 therefore, we are more comfortable with any 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.990
 teens are certainly more comfortable with 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.909
 computers themselves for this in some 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.040
 schools there are so -called mobile 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.869
 classes are essentially a closet and on wheels 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.430
 which along with laptops and dot 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.070
 Internet access can travel 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.259
 on cabinets besides school wi-fi 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.000
 helps distance learning with those 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.890
 pupils who because of health problems 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.830
 can't attend classes 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.900
 teachers communicate on skype such a property 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.120
 air use people when 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.430
 swim in one 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.530
 Masha Mishchenko please remember 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.540
 school wi-fi gave another development 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.820
 new e-journal and diary 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.830
 that is, the teacher writes all the data not 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.360
 only on paper as before 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.490
 but also on a special site where 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.980
 read the estimates of the schedule 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.080
 topics of lessons and homework can 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.850
 and students and their parents need only 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.490
 special password by the way do 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.930
 the assessment is so simple the Losers will fail 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.730
 x to fix a bad grade 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.710

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.430
 wireless internet is possible and in

 it is possible through which you can connect well 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.120
 it can help people prepare for 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.390
 any control and verification 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.000
 work

 video from the Internet almost 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.080
 each classroom interactive whiteboards 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.720
 very convenient to use 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.760
 internet lesson programs and for that 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.030

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.970
 wireless internet access in 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.680
 this year, another 110 server conflicts 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.260
 equipment already purchased will be 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.620
 installed and its needles will be 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.379
 expand so that both teachers and u
