00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.260 
light for me the consistency is very
very<00:02:21.990> watery<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.040> use<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.490> lot<00:02:23.910> and

this conditioner and my hair did not
feel<00:03:27.810> very<00:03:27.840> good<00:03:28.080> after<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.710> came<00:03:28.830> out<00:03:29.160> from

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
feel very good after I came out from

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.490 
feel very good after I came out from
under<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.640> dryer<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:30.300> was<00:03:30.420> very<00:03:30.720> very<00:03:31.140> dry

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
under the dryer it was very very dry

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.800 
under the dryer it was very very dry
feeling<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.400> was<00:03:32.520> really<00:03:32.880> dull<00:03:33.090> I've<00:03:33.300> tried<00:03:33.660> it

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
feeling it was really dull I've tried it

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.810 
feeling it was really dull I've tried it
multiple<00:03:34.260> times<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.070> can't<00:03:35.520> seem<00:03:35.760> to

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
multiple times and I just can't seem to

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.670 
multiple times and I just can't seem to
get<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.150> moisture<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.840> I'm<00:03:37.200> looking<00:03:37.350> for

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
get the moisture that I'm looking for

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.350 
get the moisture that I'm looking for
from<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.160> conditioner<00:03:38.580> so<00:03:38.910> I'm<00:03:39.030> thinking

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
from the conditioner so I'm thinking

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.390 
from the conditioner so I'm thinking
that<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:39.900> too<00:03:40.230> light<00:03:40.410> for<00:03:40.470> me<00:03:40.770> I<00:03:40.980> have

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
that it's just too light for me I have

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.970 
that it's just too light for me I have
used<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:41.820> my<00:03:41.970> boys<00:03:42.150> hair<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.590> mica<00:03:43.590> has<00:03:43.950> a

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
used it on my boys hair and mica has a

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.970 
used it on my boys hair and mica has a
thicker<00:03:44.310> hair<00:03:44.580> type<00:03:44.820> than<00:03:45.540> Gabriel<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.830> it

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
thicker hair type than Gabriel and it

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.410 
thicker hair type than Gabriel and it
doesn't<00:03:47.310> really<00:03:47.400> work<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.850> great<00:03:48.000> on<00:03:48.180> Micah

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
doesn't really work that great on Micah

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.810 
doesn't really work that great on Micah
either<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:49.110> does<00:03:49.590> work<00:03:49.890> better<00:03:50.190> for<00:03:50.460> Gabriel

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
either it does work better for Gabriel

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.660 
either it does work better for Gabriel
but<00:03:51.120> it's<00:03:51.600> still<00:03:51.900> not<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:53.250> best<00:03:53.430> and

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
but it's still not the best and

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.490 
but it's still not the best and
moisturizing<00:03:54.210> their<00:03:54.330> hair<00:03:54.480> either<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:55.020> also

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
moisturizing their hair either I also

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.800 
moisturizing their hair either I also
noticed<00:03:55.920> that<00:03:56.070> with<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.340> leave-in

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
noticed that with this leave-in

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.630 
noticed that with this leave-in
conditioner<00:03:57.810> my<00:03:57.960> hair<00:03:57.990> is<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.740> lot<00:03:59.370> prettier

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
conditioner my hair is a lot prettier

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.700 
conditioner my hair is a lot prettier
than<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.180> normally<00:04:00.330> is<00:04:00.690> I'm<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:01.320> it's<00:04:01.410> kind<00:04:01.620> of

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
than it normally is I'm so it's kind of

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.160 
than it normally is I'm so it's kind of
more<00:04:02.460> out<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.640> control<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.600> I'm<00:04:03.690> not<00:04:03.780> too<00:04:03.960> sure

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
more out of control so I'm not too sure

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.260 
more out of control so I'm not too sure
what<00:04:04.310> ingredient<00:04:05.310> is<00:04:05.370> causing<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:05.910> maybe

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
what ingredient is causing that maybe

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.850 
what ingredient is causing that maybe
it's<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.540> pH<00:04:06.810> or<00:04:06.960> the<00:04:07.050> product<00:04:07.410> I'm<00:04:07.560> not<00:04:07.710> too

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
it's the pH or the product I'm not too

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.430 
it's the pH or the product I'm not too
sure<00:04:08.010> what<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.310> pH<00:04:08.460> level<00:04:08.910> is<00:04:09.110> but<00:04:10.110> my<00:04:10.230> hair

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
sure what the pH level is but my hair

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.860 
sure what the pH level is but my hair
definitely<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.220> way<00:04:11.850> more<00:04:12.030> frizzy<00:04:12.330> because<00:04:12.630> I

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
definitely is way more frizzy because I

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.930 
definitely is way more frizzy because I
have<00:04:13.050> quite<00:04:13.200> a<00:04:13.320> bit<00:04:13.380> less<00:04:13.710> I'm<00:04:14.430> going<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.730> start

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
have quite a bit less I'm going to start

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.729 
have quite a bit less I'm going to start
trying<00:04:15.210> to<00:04:15.330> pair<00:04:15.570> it<00:04:15.600> with<00:04:15.750> other<00:04:16.260> products<00:04:16.680> to

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
trying to pair it with other products to

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.320 
trying to pair it with other products to
