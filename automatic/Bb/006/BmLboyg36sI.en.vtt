00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.340
 this year they have given the golden drum I 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.730
 few times have I seen so excited and 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.880
 so impacted with an environment 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.949
 good thing is that for those of there then it is 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.509
 I thought as a child that it was the prize 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.090
 more important that they could give one 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.650
 neither the nobel nor the pulitzer nor the oscar 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.120
 nothing for me the drum now 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.460
 since I was little I saw it and think it was 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.730
 the most important and, fortunately, 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.739
 I was able to receive this year and it was a great 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.510
 honor and that's why it was a very day 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.180
 exciting for me and his father wanted 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.280
 that his children were soccer players not me 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.559
 I think that I do not believe that 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.079
 I wanted us to be responsible 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.870
 We wanted him to want us to be serious 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.680
 already in what we did from home like this 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.800
 what 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.470
 especially my mother did us a lot 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.000
 emphasis and they got us that first thing in 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.280
 the studies that football then that 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.750
 Of course there was this but there was 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.340
 to take well the studies that had 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.340
 that be responsible 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.040
 the first the first and the only time 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.390
 suspended a subject then because 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.920
 that I did not try it on, they worried him with 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.520
 football that is what touches your heart 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.520
 to severe 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.430
 well I do not know little new things 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.610
 small details, I'll tell you now 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.730
 because my daughter started me the first 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.620
 little step and you are much more excited 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.660
 small things because they are what I 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.250
 touch now 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.750
 and then from nearby people who 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.070
 I have which was the first person to the 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.470
 who called xabi alonso when he signed his 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:54.790
 contract with madrid that said dad 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:56.890
 mom my wife and my wife because we had 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.870
 I've been living everything 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.780
 well all summer so intensely and 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.630
 when they were solved 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.319
 we are already done and then to my 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.179
 parents and arrives at santiago rodeo 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.540
 I believe that santiago bernabéu are 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.249
 older words I think that what 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.099
 imposes when you enter the bernabéu when 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:21.310
 is the empty bernabéu is impressive and 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.739
 then when the baby starts to 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.329
 roar when there is good atmosphere when the 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.260
 People are enjoying when they push 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.280
 true then it is already a delight 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.760
 can play 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.319
 it's a 1 is a demanding stadium 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.390
 but that when the team responds and 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.310
 when it works well he knows how to appreciate 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.080
 which has been the best adversary to which 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.080
 he has faced we know in his career 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.390
 I what I started when I started 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.390
 the desire 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.240
 I believe that this is an example of what 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.130
 is football in what many of us 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.590
 learn many things but good life 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.690
 from one as you see them see the team to 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.010
 these three months in which the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.870
 real madrid 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.030
 I see it well, I think the team 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.540
 is a good dynamic is in a 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.540
 good line 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.300
 with open fronts 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.410
 and hungry and eager to compete not 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.550
 and what can you give to this wardrobe 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.140
 mourinho for these decisive sections 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.070
 man then for key moments to 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.930
 eliminatory or final matches must be 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.850
 know how to prepare matches very well and 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.670
 then that preparation that analysis of 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.920
 cancer and then apart from knowing how to work 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.330
 much the psychological side the side 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.620
 emotive emotional and he 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:46.500
 in him in that aspect he knows how to connect 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.780
 with us motivate us 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.760
 and hopefully it will be used for 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.990
 let's get important things always 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.520
 they say a coach has to do 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.380
 grow his players in what he has done 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.090
 grow mourinho knows the 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.970
 I believe that we are I am learning 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.540
 much 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.250
 and makes you be a better soccer player and know 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.290
 how has to face better the 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.569
 games you have to know how to read better 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.140
 parties and in that sense the mister is 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.500
 very good in the tactical preparation 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.690
 and also how do I use the theme 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.190
 psychological emotional is the one that wins 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.169
 a lot on the expensive face 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.550
 tell me about young players that all the 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.250
 world right now is talking about them 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.950
 Mesut Ozil 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.770
 well, mesut is one of those players 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.210
 specials that you see very occasionally 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.240
 and has the touch 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.009
 of doing things in spaces so 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.130
 reduced that is what makes them 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.990
 unique in between lines knowing how to play 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.800
 also having the touch so tempered 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.350
 of that very measured touch and that vision of 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.390
 game then it's what 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.490
 because what there are not so many players 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.300
 nowadays and that's why he's such a player 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.920
 so special 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.540
 Warrior said how easy it is to play 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.070
 to know them 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.160
 Pirate man is a phenomenon 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.620
 when I have it, I appreciate it because 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.990
 because because we get along very well and 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.040
 then I think that in the field he 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.130
 He plays great football is 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.020
 footballer soccer player of those of the 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.240
 that does all things well those that 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.370
 can read the game of those who have a 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.530
 great touch of the ball that is associated 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.910
 well of those that makes the collective 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:30.720
 work well and I think it will not be 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.720
 a very important player
