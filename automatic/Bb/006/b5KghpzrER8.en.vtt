00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.500
Hi, I'm Hal McMillin and I want to welcome you to Southwest Louisiana.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.320
We're in a rice field north of Welsh, Louisiana.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.040
We've got a good group of buddies out here.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.500
We're gonna be shooting some teal

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.820
I've been hunting in this area for over 50 years.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.540
And it is "Sportsman's Paradise."

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.260
Mallards, pintails, teal, wigeon, gray duck. A lot of different species migrate down to

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.300
Central and Mississippi Flyway.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.440
"duck call sounds"

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.000
Forever. Since I can remember,  here in Southwest Louisiana

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.560
My big brother has taken me hunting.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.560
I want to introduce to you, my brother, Mickey McMillin.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.560
One of the best outdoors man I know

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.900
in all of Southwest Louisiana.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.900
We're in Southwest Louisiana, this morning, north of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.300
of Welsh, taking advantage  of the blue-winged teal population

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.680
harvest and special September teal season.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.380
It's a great time to hunt.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.380
Good harvest, weather's nice.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.380
Conditions in Louisiana were perfect

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.360
for blue winged teal this year.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.900
These birds fly down to Southwest Louisiana this time of year

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.900
being neotropic migrates, they're here early

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.600
so the early teal season takes advantage of these birds

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.380
before they move on down the flyway, and winter in Mexico

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.500
and Central America.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.140
Another thing in Southwest Louisiana,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.720
a tradition of hunting with families

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.940
but also we have great Labradors.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.940
The retrievers make a real difference in your hunt.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.560
You don't have the weights to be gained and it great to watch them work.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920
They are a tremendous dog.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.960
Today we had Miley and Louie working with us

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.960
while we were on the levee. Shooting the bird is one thing,

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.380
but watching the dogs work is another.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740
So, always try and get yourself a good

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.300
retriever when hunting here in Southwest Louisiana.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.100
Right here in Southwest Louisiana

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.500
we have tremendous guide services.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.640
And for the folks who might not need a guide,

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.820
we have two national wildlife refuges.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.680
Both Sabine and Lacassine.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.680
If you want to get out and do some hunting

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.060
in the national wildlife refuges, it's open to the public.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.360
I tell you what,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.980
there's no greater place on earth

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.700
to be, right here in Southwest Louisiana.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.820
Sportsman's Paradise.
