00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.220
 mountain pine is a very interesting plant 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.280
 because these pine cones are already there 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.799
 open however it is necessary to collect when 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.529
 they are so you will see they make this color 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.779
 from the reds because at the moment we say 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.330
 that are mature and that contain many or 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.550
 fit in many essential oils 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.340
 what you do with these pine cones you take 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.230
 these pine cones are put in a jar with 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.210
 the large one fills up you put the sugar 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.910
 they cover themselves completely with sugar yes 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.670
 closes and gets in the sun for a month 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.210
 two until the sun warms up slowly 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.809
 practically the heat that is created 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.450
 in this vase melts it 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.700
 sugar dissolves resins oils 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.910
 essentials practically creates one 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.430
 very interesting syrup for 0 100 years 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.350
 it can be assumed because it really has a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.930
 emollient and balsamic effect 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.989
 exceptional so there is no 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.670
 dvd problem of taking the flavor is 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.150
 pleasant because logically there is 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.530
 sugar should be used moves to one 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.210
 cup and you will find a book by 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.549
 sugar and otherwise to the index loves me 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.180
 however, when there are problems with the eyes 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.220
 especially when there is a dry cough 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.280
 that classic cough that starts right 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.619
 the pain the cecco cane stand to make 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.229
 this is what the qatar will mature 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.409
 syrup is truly exceptional must 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.329
 do it in winter then when you use it 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.159
 in winter you have to warm it up 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.290
 pochettino even put that in a 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.900
 little bit of milk for children therefore 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.420
 sweet milk is created a little bit more 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.770
 more pleasant and is used in a manner 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.170
 very interesting 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.530
 many use it even if a 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.170
 little bit even though gems and gemar 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.350
 plants is not never nice though 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.329
 some low side gem that is wrong 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.250
 to ruin the plant you can 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.399
 pick up the spring when they are 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.520
 long those 3 4 cm put it in the vase 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.479
 why year 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:11.530
 minimum vitamin C content therefore 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.569
 pine cones plus some side buds not 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.330
 the apical ones that if not really for 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.040
 grow a plant and that's it 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.860
 this product let's say this syrup 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.900
 homemade but has its effect 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.900
 really interesting
