00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:09.270
 you know 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.270
 known 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.580
 the fear also the hitman row 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.200
 would follow a current trend and 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.509
 in the direction of his action 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.509
 Orienteers busy many fans of 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.029
 series in our preview we reveal 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.770
 you something with hitman 5 absolution 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.419
 really approaching you we could 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.880
 a good third of the game several times 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.460
 we start playing with one of the 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.690
 major criticisms of the action 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.579
 that will be in ships 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.219
 but told with between sequences 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.620
 various logic holes interspersed agent 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.210
 47 receives the order a breakaway 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.530
 to turn off colleague 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.749
 with him some of his 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.670
 past connects in spite of some 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:51.829
 little pangs of conscience so much 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.629
 pointed boilers he does this also looks 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.649
 but then in the duty a little 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.239
 to protect girls 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.629
 that in the obhut of the straight 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.159
 murdered was 47 motivation 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.649
 hard to understand and also at 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.659
 some minor story details it falls short 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.640
 with the logic for that are the 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.710
 The actual mission just as exciting 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.320
 Entertaining and as hoped for so hard 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.770
 like the developers of io interactive 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.869
 had promised 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.350
 As always, it's secretly 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.939
 proceed to turn 47 victims off 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.009
 sacrifice is to be understood as singular because 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.439
 ideally we only really switch 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.810
 the target person from how we do that 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.219
 it's all up to us 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.360
 almost half a dozen different 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.210
 possibilities 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.920
 especially spectacular when 47 his 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.820
 environment exploits the murder like one 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.820
 accident 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.800
 By the way, we can give that a warning 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.110
 Game does not bump the player like 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.090
 fears that these approaches will solve the problem 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.920
 discoverer fun is preserved everything 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.510
 you have to find out for yourself 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.490
 but not overly heavy either 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.500
 is there at the push of a button 47 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.330
 killer instinct can activate the us 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.130
 discreet on interesting surroundings 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.650
 details villa beaten gas pipes 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.180
 or fairings indicates no fear 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.740
 this does not make the game a reality 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.000
 self-runner and on the higher 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.250
 degrees of difficulty is the 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.050
 killer instinct is blocked in general 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.730
 the difficulty but happig 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.380
 the opponents react extremely 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.240
 suspicious and at a loss 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.970
 we will go to a previous checkpoint 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.790
 all opponents are active again 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.990
 free store is not in it 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.300
 In general, their secret is ours 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.920
 The better the game performs 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.720
 always book about our action and 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.310
 awards min points for each passers-by 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.930
 who discovers us or anyone 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.700
 downcast opponent 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.770
 pluses are there for hidden ones 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.330
 corpses and evicted from the path 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.100
 the more points we collect around 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
 faster we ascend a step and 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.110
 for example, increase ours 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.060
 lebensenergie 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.670
 that in turn is for the battles 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.130
 valuable this animated in spectacular 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.420
 and are about small quick-time events 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.209
 settled and of course they should 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.350
 actually be avoided 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.239
 In addition we earn money 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.420
 better equipment and put us that way 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.400
 for example, silencer too beside 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.920
 sneaking and melee is an agent 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.019
 47 also dealing with a total of 19 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.239
 firearms are familiar with the firefights 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.070
 are superbly staged and wear 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.320
 much to the coolness of our anti hero 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.570
 especially if instincts 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.610
 Mode that happens in slow motion 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.769
 the brutality of this battles is 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.780
 but another reason for the 18 years 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.519
 release of the title of the in germany 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.610
 after all uncut appears 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.140
 new is the contract mode this 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.640
 between tasks we are busy 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.440
 as long as the actual 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.090
 campaign and use the same 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.580
 However, maps introduce us to new ones 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.650
 tasks for this mode can be user 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.880
 own by means of an editor 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.340
 create missions 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.230
 our conclusion hitman absolution is like 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.840
 always extremely heavy and yet straight 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.760
 tremendously motivating by the point system 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.620
 it's fun the same section 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.320
 to play over and over again 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.700
 perfect way to find but also with 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.350
 Smoking colts by the level 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.750
 agree can work 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.650
 the new contract mode evaluates the title 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.650
 also on
