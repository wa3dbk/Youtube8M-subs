 green 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.229
 let's start the first thing we will do is 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.790
 frosting the cupcake 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.940
 I just cast it and spread it with the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.909
 I'm going to prepare a little mountain 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.220

 Perfect butter to use in sleeves 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.330

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.660

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:49.710
 This is my absolute favorite. Its flavor is 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.800
 phenomenal it looks great and it's fabulous 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.570
 to work with her they can see that 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.880
 I'm giving it the shape of a dome 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.490
 doing as nice and as smooth as possible 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.290
 that you find something that looks like this 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.470
 way 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.710
 well now I grab my three pills 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.710
 mint and I just put them here 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.710
 a 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.959
 and 3 all in a nice line 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.909
 with these mint leaves what I'm going to 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.460
 do is cut off the tip with the 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:27.890
 Scissors can eat it if they want 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.580
 and now put them in the cupcake as in 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.250
 angle in this way in such a way that 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.790
 they look pointed, protruding from 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.790
 cupcake 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.470
 I'm a little low so the 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:46.170
 I move a little up 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.060
 we want them like at eye level 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.220
 perfect 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.860
 now we grab the twist seller and with 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.920
 We will cut the scissors, not what 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.280
 we want so long and then we cut it 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.709
 in half throughout 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.720
 and we use only one of the two pieces 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.380
 to put it up here to do 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.380
 the antenita 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.880
 and now let's use our chocolate 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.800
 melted 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.300
 we put it inside the sachet 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.060
 hermetic and block 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.760
 make sure you get all the air and 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.680
 close it very well we do not want the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.760
 chocolate comes out and spoils us 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.680
 our beautiful work well cut him 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.470
 a little tip turning my 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.540
 airtight bag in a small sleeve and 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.370
 I'm going to put three dots on the 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:44.400
 mints to make her eyes one and two 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.800
 three these little aliens have 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.900
 a lot of different expressions like that 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.790
 that for example to this here I put 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.830
 like a chocolate ball for your mouth 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.260
 and this one I'm going to draw a small 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.540
 a little confused smile is drawn 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.240
 with his little sleeve making a line 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.490
 wavy and here they have their cupcake 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.300
 finished with a 'toy' alien 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.740
 story ' 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.470
 I think they agree that it is 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.510
 super easy super cute and safe in 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.770
 singing lovers 'Toy Story' in 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.310
