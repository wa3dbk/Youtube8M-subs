00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
Chevrolet I wanted to make a table for

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.120 
Chevrolet I wanted to make a table for
the<00:00:12.330> patio<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:13.110> could<00:00:13.290> be<00:00:13.410> used<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.920> pot

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
the patio that could be used to pot

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.910 
the patio that could be used to pot
plants<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.990> so<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.020> went<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.440> Home<00:00:16.590> Center

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
plants in so I went to the Home Center

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.840 
plants in so I went to the Home Center
and<00:00:17.300> found<00:00:18.300> some<00:00:18.539> really<00:00:18.779> awesome<00:00:19.080> cedar<00:00:19.850> here

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
and found some really awesome cedar here

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.980 
and found some really awesome cedar here
I'm<00:00:21.000> just<00:00:21.240> sanding<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.109> all<00:00:22.289> smooth<00:00:23.990> since

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
I'm just sanding it all smooth since

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.740 
I'm just sanding it all smooth since
cedar<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:26.010> soft<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:26.820> kept<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.210> belts<00:00:27.539> in

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
cedar so soft I just kept the belts in

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.080 
cedar so soft I just kept the belts in
or<00:00:27.960> moving<00:00:28.349> constantly<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.550> wouldn't<00:00:29.849> plow

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
or moving constantly so it wouldn't plow

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.760 
or moving constantly so it wouldn't plow
into<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:32.239> so<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.270> bought<00:00:33.600> some<00:00:33.630> 3-inch<00:00:34.410> screws

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
into it so I bought some 3-inch screws

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.979 
into it so I bought some 3-inch screws
and<00:00:35.100> decided<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> go<00:00:36.180> ahead<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.570> drill<00:00:36.750> pocket

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
and decided to go ahead and drill pocket

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:37.520 
and decided to go ahead and drill pocket
holes

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
holes

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.850 
holes
I<00:00:38.329> think<00:00:39.329> pocket<00:00:39.690> holes<00:00:39.840> work<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.320> fine<00:00:40.590> when

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
I think pocket holes work just fine when

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.229 
I think pocket holes work just fine when
you<00:00:40.980> go<00:00:41.129> ahead<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.460> use<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> blue<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
you go ahead and use the blue with the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.819 
you go ahead and use the blue with the
screws<00:00:44.360> we've<00:00:45.360> had<00:00:45.570> some<00:00:45.780> nice<00:00:45.989> warm<00:00:46.500> sunny

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
screws we've had some nice warm sunny

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.090 
screws we've had some nice warm sunny
days<00:00:47.219> lately<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.960> felt<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.350> good<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.980> get

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
days lately and it felt so good to get

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.970 
days lately and it felt so good to get
outside<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.930> build<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.110> project<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
outside and build this project on the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.639 
outside and build this project on the
driveway<00:00:53.280> instead<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.120> being<00:00:54.989> cooped<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.440> in

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
driveway instead of being cooped up in

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.299 
driveway instead of being cooped up in
the<00:00:55.739> garage<00:00:57.050> here's<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.350> another<00:00:58.440> angle<00:00:59.129> of

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the garage here's just another angle of

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.740 
the garage here's just another angle of
the<00:00:59.489> pocket<00:01:00.300> holes

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the pocket holes

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.399 
the pocket holes
I<00:01:01.789> set<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.969> jig<00:01:03.239> back<00:01:03.539> from<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> edge<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
I set the jig back from the edge of the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.359 
I set the jig back from the edge of the
board<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.010> didn't<00:01:05.820> adjust<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> stop<00:01:06.600> collar

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
board and didn't adjust the stop collar

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.010 
board and didn't adjust the stop collar
because<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:08.939> see<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.810> first

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
because as you can see here the first

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.170 
because as you can see here the first
inch<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> shank<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.340> three<00:01:11.640> inch<00:01:11.820> screw

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
inch of the shank of a three inch screw

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.710 
inch of the shank of a three inch screw
is<00:01:12.570> smooth<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.369> think<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.460> got<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> pretty<00:01:15.299> equal

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
is smooth I think I got a pretty equal

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.260 
is smooth I think I got a pretty equal
amount<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.170> screw<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.040> both<00:01:17.580> boards<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.150> each

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
amount of screw and both boards of each

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.490 
amount of screw and both boards of each
joint<00:01:19.400> using<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.580> six<00:01:21.210> inch<00:01:21.450> tip<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.200> those

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
joint using that six inch tip and those

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.700 
joint using that six inch tip and those
three<00:01:22.860> inch<00:01:23.040> screws<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:24.320> found<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> hard<00:01:25.590> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
three inch screws I found it hard to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.929 
three inch screws I found it hard to
keep<00:01:26.009> everything<00:01:26.369> turning<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> right

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939

somehow I managed to get it all screwed
together<00:01:31.860> though<00:01:32.900> because<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> pocket

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
