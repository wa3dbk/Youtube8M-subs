00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.710 
and Anwar it's I guess their new town
where<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.199> start<00:00:25.500> off<00:00:26.119> it's<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.359> region's

which<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.480> also<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.949> new<00:00:31.949> add-ons<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.790> which

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
which is also to new add-ons to it which

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.290 
which is also to new add-ons to it which
is<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:34.550> don't<00:00:35.550> know<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.640> guess<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.910> scale

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
is like I don't know I guess a scale

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.479 
is like I don't know I guess a scale
this<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.870> say<00:00:37.110> Fallout<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.040> these<00:00:38.370> are

this is I say Fallout and these are
sectioned<00:00:38.940> off<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:40.260> fairly<00:00:40.440> small<00:00:40.800> for

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
sectioned off so it's fairly small for

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.650 
sectioned off so it's fairly small for
what<00:00:41.129> you're<00:00:41.370> looking<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.149> uh<00:00:42.890> it's<00:00:43.890> got

I guess they're sort of saying already

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.950 
I guess they're sort of saying already
that<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.000> found<00:01:42.150> key<00:01:42.420> coats<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.840> this

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that they have found key coats of this

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.649 
that they have found key coats of this
game<00:01:43.170> which<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.790> kind<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.880> disappointing<00:01:45.000> but

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
game which is kind of disappointing but

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.600 
game which is kind of disappointing but
um<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.670> mean<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.970> hope<00:01:48.649> hope<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.130> know<00:01:50.399> they

um I mean I hope hope that you know they
sort<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.939> change<00:01:51.180> things<00:01:51.420> around<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:51.899> there's

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
sort of change things around but there's

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.260 
sort of change things around but there's
more<00:01:52.409> combat<00:01:53.159> areas<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.000> now

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
extremely close um I mean it's obviously

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.479

an<00:03:13.520> RPG<00:03:17.019> for<00:03:18.019> most<00:03:18.200> people<00:03:18.560> i<00:03:18.769> mean<00:03:18.950> RPGs<00:03:19.459> are

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
an RPG for most people i mean RPGs are

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
an RPG but some people I guess can go

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.030 
an RPG but some people I guess can go
off<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:23.810> accidentally<00:03:24.500> by<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.680> game<00:03:24.920> they

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
off and accidentally by the game they

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.430 
off and accidentally by the game they
don't<00:03:25.160> want<00:03:25.400> but<00:03:25.670> I'm<00:03:25.790> honestly<00:03:26.090> if<00:03:26.570> that<00:03:27.350> were

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
don't want but I'm honestly if that were

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.229 
don't want but I'm honestly if that were
to<00:03:27.530> happen<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.890> could<00:03:28.370> be<00:03:28.519> too<00:03:28.700> disappointing

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239

it<00:04:18.500> for<00:04:18.739> now<00:04:23.680> which<00:04:24.680> is<00:04:28.600> $14<00:04:29.600> ninety-four

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
it for now which is $14 ninety-four

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.810 
cents so you can see how bad of a game
it<00:04:33.950> actually<00:04:34.130> turned<00:04:34.490> out<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.639> be<00:04:36.669> some<00:04:37.669> new

it actually turned out to be some new
things<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.389> guess<00:04:38.570> you<00:04:38.750> can<00:04:38.900> look<00:04:39.080> forward<00:04:39.320> to

is<00:04:39.680> they're<00:04:39.860> going<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.070> try<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:40.450> minimally

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
is they're going to try and minimally

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.590

take<00:04:41.840> away<00:04:42.110> as<00:04:42.290> much<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.970> cheating<00:04:44.450> is

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
take away as much of the cheating is

RPG<00:06:16.639> in<00:06:17.169> which<00:06:18.169> makes<00:06:18.409> sense<00:06:18.590> but<00:06:18.919> on<00:06:19.069> that

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:19.819 
RPG in which makes sense but on that

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:22.779 
RPG in which makes sense but on that
sort<00:06:20.180> of<00:06:20.330> like<00:06:20.479> the<00:06:20.599> new<00:06:20.719> battle<00:06:21.050> system<00:06:21.080> a<00:06:21.789> lot

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
sort of like the new battle system a lot

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.180 
sort of like the new battle system a lot
of<00:06:22.819> different<00:06:23.539> maneuvers<00:06:24.440> that<00:06:24.949> you<00:06:25.009> can

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
of different maneuvers that you can

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.740 
of different maneuvers that you can
shouldn't<00:06:25.490> take

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
shouldn't take

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.690 
shouldn't take

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
that would be the older class you can

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.900
