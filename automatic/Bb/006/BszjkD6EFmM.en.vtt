00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.750
 hi friends from youtube I am to be 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.020
 tourist thank you very much for visiting my 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.020
 channel 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.650
 today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.060
 delicious and creamy yogurt the 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.810
 ingredients that we will need are 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:22.000
 the next 1 liter and a half of water 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.449
 30 large spoons of milk powder 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.449
 complete 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.599
 some firm natural yogurt 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.050
 we start by heating the water 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.340
 With the help of a thermometer check 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:46.140
 that the temperature is not less than 50 nor 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:47.790
 highest 60 degrees centigrade we passed the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.829
 water from the pan to a container of 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.019
 glass and we start beating the milk 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.690
 important that goes also so that it does not 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.670
 no residue left 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.219
 more pointed cities by the edges by 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.660
 the fund to make sure it is 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.519
 all well mixed 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.490
 This yogurt can be used for 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.740
 wives can make smoothies add 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.470
 cereal fruits or just eat it 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.580
 so it's important to do this fast 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.580
 so that the water does not cool 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.290
 and some of the milk that we just 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.840
 beat and add natural yogurt and what 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.280
 we mix very well I repeat that you do not 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.280
 there should be no group 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.830
 best 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.479
 Now let's pour this mixture into the milk 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.219
 because we do this the yogurt is a 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.929
 mixture of dairy products with bacteria 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.179
 bacteria to reproduce need 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.129
 be present in milk and the only 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.080
 way to get those bacteria is to 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.760
 through another yogurt that is ready 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.530
 we mix very well to join 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.480
 all the ingredients and now we 're going 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.040
 to cover we wrap to another container with 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.049
 an English towel to keep the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.819
 temperature we let it rest about 10 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.830
 hours and then we take it to the fridge 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.989
 approximately for three or four hours 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.870
 rather we are going to uncover our yogurt 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.370
 and look how it looks is firm and elastic 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.890
 if they want it to be thicker they can 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.290
 add more milk if you want to get a 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.180
 Greek yogurt can filter this same 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.079
 to vote the serum and that even more 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.940
 creamy 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.610
 note the firm texture of this yogurt 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.470
 it's excellent 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.750

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.820
