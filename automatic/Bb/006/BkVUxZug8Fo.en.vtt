 game was catching a lot in the game 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.399
 normal in practice was very bad for 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.020
 I did not know what it was like to be mine. 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.239
 internet or if it was something in my 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.030
 here or in the game itself 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.890
 praising the VOD isa training with 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.089
 clan my brother nando gave me a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.699
 here in game play a configuration 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.519
 that he saw somewhere that helped 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.159
 He's fucking bullshit, and I went to play in the 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.710
 My, and it was very good for me. I 'm 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.960
 recording to be able to pass to you 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.960
 perhaps most have already done so 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.020
 I've already moved, but there's a lot 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.050
 people who went unnoticed or maybe 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.450
 I did not know, I do not know that there are many people. 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.329
 is also playing this week and bf 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.340
 you can not imagine that there are 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.290
 these things here to play the game and 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.810
 It helps a lot the game was very bad. 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.810
 and it was light, it was cool as hell. 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.229
 quick reflex was good 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.810
 so you will come here oh you will see 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:36.130
 gameplay goes down there and 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.950
 update of high frequency networks 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.060
 My how I have bad internet via 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.009
 radio here I played bass 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.759
 played bass because they heard some 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.890
 place that hot internet is bad had 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.899
 that put on the low and hot internet 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.210
 I was on the top do not know if it is 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:59.350
 truth did not work 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.600

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.939
 I do not know how it here to 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.950
 I have not seen anyone explaining the right to 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.619
 difference between one another and 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.539
 know the banjo but I really liked the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.540
 because someone told me to put you down. 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.640
 on the down and there was a lot and here the fact 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.180
 network view only 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.569
 I would put it there in the 80th sincere 80 70 or 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.900
 90 was high here a number of these here 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.980

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.079

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.659

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:39.159
 It happened to put the network update 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:41.319
 on top and the fact of the update of 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.920
 high- frequency networks at the top and 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:50.109
 fact that its network smoothing from scratch 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:54.909

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:57.969
