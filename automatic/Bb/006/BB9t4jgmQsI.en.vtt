00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.359 
fact I've had I've had a church split
over<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.780> I'm<00:01:13.020> real<00:01:13.320> hesitant<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
over it so you know I'm real hesitant to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.910 
over it so you know I'm real hesitant to
do<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.850> or<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> ever<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.869> even<00:01:16.740> though<00:01:16.890> I

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
do it or to ever do it even though I

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.219 
do it or to ever do it even though I
have<00:01:17.280> some<00:01:17.549> viewpoints<00:01:18.090> today<00:01:18.450> ask<00:01:18.780> me<00:01:18.990> again

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
have some viewpoints today ask me again

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.800 
have some viewpoints today ask me again
next<00:01:19.380> year<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.400> see<00:01:20.820> what<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.090> what<00:01:21.780> I

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
next year and that and see what I what I

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.200 
next year and that and see what I what I
believe<00:01:22.259> I'm<00:01:22.950> not<00:01:23.250> being<00:01:23.430> wishy-washy<00:01:23.970> I

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
believe I'm not being wishy-washy I

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.330 
believe I'm not being wishy-washy I
think<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.750> more<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.110> grow<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.740> more<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.070> learn

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
think the more we grow the more we learn

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.700 
think the more we grow the more we learn
the<00:01:27.030> more<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.270> learn<00:01:27.720> about<00:01:27.750> God's<00:01:28.380> grace

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the more we learn about God's grace

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.300 
the more we learn about God's grace
about<00:01:29.310> his<00:01:29.490> judgment<00:01:30.060> about<00:01:30.210> his<00:01:31.040> capacity<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
about his judgment about his capacity to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.460 
about his judgment about his capacity to
love<00:01:32.520> unconditionally<00:01:33.420> all<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.960> those<00:01:34.110> things

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
love unconditionally all of those things

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.190 
love unconditionally all of those things
and<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.640> more<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:35.970> grow<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.570> experience

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and the more we grow in that experience

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.319 
and the more we grow in that experience
I<00:01:37.380> think<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.619> more<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.130> grow<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:39.060> our

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
I think the more we grow in our

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.850 
I think the more we grow in our
viewpoint<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.380> man-made<00:01:41.329> theology<00:01:42.680> as<00:01:43.680> some

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
viewpoint on man-made theology as some

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.469 
viewpoint on man-made theology as some
of<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.070> say<00:01:44.280> well<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:44.759> man-made<00:01:45.030> it's

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
of you say well it's not man-made it's

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.420 
of you say well it's not man-made it's
biblical<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.470> course<00:01:46.710> both<00:01:46.920> sides<00:01:47.220> would

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
biblical and of course both sides would

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.359 
biblical and of course both sides would
argue<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.020> but<00:01:49.020> I'm<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:49.979> gonna<00:01:50.189> go
