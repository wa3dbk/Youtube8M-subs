00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.750 

now<00:03:20.200> this<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.560> rotating<00:03:21.010> between<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.310> C<00:03:21.550> major

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
now this is rotating between a C major

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.520 
now this is rotating between a C major
chord<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.270> then<00:03:22.390> an<00:03:22.540> F<00:03:22.780> with<00:03:23.020> a<00:03:23.050> C<00:03:23.260> in<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.440> bass

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
chord and then an F with a C in the bass

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.350 
chord and then an F with a C in the bass
so<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.590> plan<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.430> see<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:28.090> then<00:03:28.240> you

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
so you plan to see and then you

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.820 
so you plan to see and then you
basically<00:03:28.570> move<00:03:28.990> your<00:03:29.140> second<00:03:29.410> finger<00:03:29.530> over

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
basically move your second finger over

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.430 
basically move your second finger over
to<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.730> third<00:03:31.030> string<00:03:31.450> there<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.930> second<00:03:32.230> fret

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
to the third string there to second fret

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.900 
to the third string there to second fret
and<00:03:32.470> then<00:03:32.710> lay<00:03:32.890> your<00:03:33.070> little<00:03:33.400> finger<00:03:33.610> down<00:03:33.640> at

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
and then lay your little finger down at

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.900 
and then lay your little finger down at
the<00:03:34.000> third<00:03:34.240> fret<00:03:34.540> on<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.750> D<00:03:35.020> string

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
the third fret on the D string

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.840 
the third fret on the D string
and<00:03:37.450> then<00:03:37.570> access<00:03:38.500> see

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.790 

keep<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.090> hands<00:03:42.240> stable<00:03:42.690> they're<00:03:42.840> so

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.370 

on<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:48.920> upstroke<00:03:49.340> I<00:03:49.400> was<00:03:49.580> hitting<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:49.820> F

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.270 

you

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.490 

you

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.820 

all<00:05:08.430> right<00:05:08.610> so<00:05:08.880> we'll<00:05:09.350> watch<00:05:10.350> out<00:05:10.560> for<00:05:10.680> those

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
all right so we'll watch out for those

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.740 
all right so we'll watch out for those
things<00:05:11.070> when<00:05:11.190> they<00:05:11.280> do<00:05:11.400> this<00:05:11.520> little<00:05:11.670> into<00:05:12.570> the

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
things when they do this little into the

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.900 
things when they do this little into the
six<00:05:13.020> to<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.500> first<00:05:13.800> but<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.520> it's<00:05:14.850> just

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
six to the first but the it's just

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.800 
six to the first but the it's just
basically<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.450> G<00:05:15.810> major<00:05:16.020> chord<00:05:16.140> again<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:18.630> the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
basically the G major chord again to the

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.160 
basically the G major chord again to the
app<00:05:19.080> but<00:05:19.500> instead<00:05:19.740> of<00:05:19.800> plan<00:05:19.980> to<00:05:20.100> see<00:05:20.280> here<00:05:20.640> move

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
app but instead of plan to see here move

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.400 
app but instead of plan to see here move
it<00:05:22.170> up<00:05:22.290> to<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.500> 8th<00:05:22.650> fret<00:05:22.680> here<00:05:24.320> then<00:05:25.320> he

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
it up to the 8th fret here then he

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.660 
it up to the 8th fret here then he
starts<00:05:25.680> doing<00:05:25.860> that<00:05:27.410> ok<00:05:28.410> so<00:05:28.470> that's<00:05:28.830> a<00:05:29.070> pretty

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
starts doing that ok so that's a pretty

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.330 
starts doing that ok so that's a pretty
quick<00:05:29.790> just<00:05:30.060> down<00:05:30.210> up<00:05:30.420> down<00:05:30.570> up<00:05:30.630> so<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:32.100> best

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
quick just down up down up so the best

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.500 
quick just down up down up so the best
way<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.610> kind<00:05:32.880> of<00:05:32.940> get<00:05:33.060> comfortable<00:05:33.360> doing

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
way to kind of get comfortable doing

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.980 
way to kind of get comfortable doing
that<00:05:33.780> stuff<00:05:34.200> is<00:05:34.650> to<00:05:35.520> raise<00:05:36.450> your<00:05:36.480> wrist<00:05:36.870> a

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
that stuff is to raise your wrist a

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.570 
that stuff is to raise your wrist a
little<00:05:37.080> bit<00:05:37.290> in<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.560> picking<00:05:37.980> hand<00:05:38.100> so<00:05:38.370> if

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
little bit in the picking hand so if

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.030 
little bit in the picking hand so if
it's<00:05:38.820> Brad<00:05:39.210> kind<00:05:39.660> of<00:05:39.720> hardik<00:05:39.960> that<00:05:40.140> speed<00:05:40.530> if

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
it's Brad kind of hardik that speed if

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.570 
it's Brad kind of hardik that speed if
you<00:05:41.100> raise<00:05:41.160> this<00:05:41.520> wrist

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.080 

you<00:05:45.389> just<00:05:45.569> brush<00:05:45.720> at<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:45.930> top<00:05:46.139> of<00:05:46.229> the<00:05:46.289> screen

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
you just brush at the top of the screen

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.820 
you just brush at the top of the screen
it<00:05:48.090> just<00:05:48.659> makes<00:05:48.990> it<00:05:49.080> a<00:05:49.139> little<00:05:49.199> bit<00:05:49.349> easier<00:05:49.710> to

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
it just makes it a little bit easier to

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.320 
it just makes it a little bit easier to
kind<00:05:49.949> of<00:05:50.069> get<00:05:50.220> this<00:05:50.370> those<00:05:50.849> rapid<00:05:53.270> loosens<00:05:54.270> up

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
kind of get this those rapid loosens up

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.760 
kind of get this those rapid loosens up
the<00:05:54.389> wrist<00:05:54.629> a<00:05:54.719> bit<00:05:54.750> all<00:05:55.319> right<00:05:55.439> so<00:05:55.560> he<00:05:55.620> does

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
the wrist a bit all right so he does

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:06.140 
the wrist a bit all right so he does
that<00:05:55.949> twice

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.640
