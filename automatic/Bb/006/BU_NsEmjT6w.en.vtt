00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hi everyone, here we are with a new one 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.600
 video and here we are with the unboxing of a 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.440
 game released today April 30 and is an in 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.420
 question is the beautiful child of light 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.880
 there is the dub like he immediately caught me 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.490
 from the trailers a very nice title 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.050
 very visually artistically 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.320
 delicious really delicious nice thriller 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.300
 there was that fairytale thing 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.660
 that immediately captured the eyes and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.000
 anything and for sure I'm sure 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.050
 that will really take the game for me 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.660
 it should be about 78 hours then there are those 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.800
 he says 10 16 8 and I say if there is desire to 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.539
 play slowly slowly taste it full 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.579
 even if it is a game that lasts only an hour 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.370
 everyone looks at all things 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.860
 look at every little minute thing you can 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.770
 last 30 hours and enjoy yourself at the same time 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.739
 so then let's start immediately with 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.190

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.180

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.470

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.590
 radio in college 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.780

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.610

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.560

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:20.180
 chain of god nudity in quotation marks and the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.370
 version instead smooth only code at 14 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.320
 euro and 99 therefore it is convenient for i 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.400
 Contains this deluxe collector 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.190
 edition 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.050
 we begin immediately with the unpacking 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.020
 but then already opened comes from capri ma 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.010
 how does a video live and so I already know that 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.170
 however we start the most material thing 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.290
 of this collector and this beautiful 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:47.270
 beautiful keychain because why it is 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:50.450
 imi kouros mikulov bulhoes that the 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.880
 character of the game and this 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.540
 keychain lights seemed sure to 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.010
 little for expected vain diano here it does if 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.940
 you have to keep all day 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.230
 I'm keyring so I took the 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.610
 tab in the green collection video 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.459
 have not yet been a tongue 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.470
 because I thought I didn't do this not 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.090
 there was the ceo I really wanted wanted 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.120
 keep an intact instead I tried 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.360
 because and it is very beautiful ie j at the end 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.310
 we light up if I have to find the keys but 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.070
 I will never use it I think how 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.860
 keychain will always remain here beautiful 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:29.030

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:33.010
 appreciated and very beautiful then the two 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.019
 parties perhaps more interested in the game 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.860
 code butcher which eto'o tuscia qua 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.510

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:05.420
 then then because it is not over offers us 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.900
 enough good content almost bit 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.159
 of this part 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.799
 in the contents that seeing it also with 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.259
 the eyes is really really nice maybe 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.329

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:25.080
 touch to understand that it is beautiful 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:27.150
 poster of a beautiful artwork we see 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.550
 if I can get to see everything does not make 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.539
 obviously however as I said in the video of 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:38.490
 vinh collection fr mo bellissimo looks like 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:40.610
 a painting looks like a painting on canvas 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.220
 nice nice 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:48.090
 entranced to look at it is proposed well 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.810
 we hope this game and then the like thing 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:55.260
 I always said the other video the artwork 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.849
 not hardback but they see it falls within 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.910
 charges of this collector at a price 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:05.220
 lower than the usual one hundred flights that 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:10.380
 repeat all we say I'll do it 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:16.349

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:18.300
 settings and many beautiful things 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.349
 beautiful proposes itself as I was saying 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.180
 a nice game 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:27.030
 I hope to play with desire and with that 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:34.020
 I'll get the story right away and I hope too 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:38.639
 than thinking of having paid this beauty 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:41.580
 edition little I hope it's worth it 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:46.919
 in the sense both a game and 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:49.379
 I'm passionate about it and I don't like it 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.240
 that I wouldn't play only once but that 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:54.120
 i would keep playing like that 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.069
 so many titles and even now the game 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.960
 although I have played them 100 thousand years ago 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:00.060
 I thank you for seeing this 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.159
 short video this time I was short 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.889
 I've been there to make a box six minutes 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:07.400
