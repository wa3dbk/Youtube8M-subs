00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.980
 the new macbook a white has undergone a design change and a change of 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.250
 Features is now manufactured in one piece of white polycarbonate 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.429
 that will bring a robustness and a line to where the faithful before 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:18.390
 that previously did not have 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.970
 also incorporates an intel core 2 duo 2 processor with 26 gigahertz with 2 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.430
 gigas of series ram a 250 gig hard drive amount of 500 gigs 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.259
 and a 13-inch screen I promise you illuminated with bright colors 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.789
 and intense totally ideal for any student anyone 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.249
 to start the mac eye because not any user who wants a 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.870
 nice and powerful and fast laptop 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.320
 we have served as the trackpad inherited from the pro macocos has been added 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.970
 now fully configurable with one or two fingers I conclude three fingers so that 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.040
 let's do everything we want with him 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.730
 we see the connections you have two ports your s once you have an ethernet port a 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.660
 mini displayport output and of course link and near isaiah currents 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.650
 audi 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.140
 as last detailed if we see that the Latin battery integrated within the 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.290
 Own laptop with an approximate autonomy of seven hours 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.190
 the new macbook comes to us in this box 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.680
 that we are going to open for you and we are going to show that it has included that 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.700
 take inside to show us what it is that you find 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.260
 with those that already exist a few 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.930
 we are presented to the new team wrapped perfectly and we see how 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.850
 nothing else to catch it we already noticed the robustness 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.920
 how the feeling of holding it in the hand has changed 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.500
 homes to its unibody technology its new manufacturing 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 we see how eliana created as a kind of 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.550
 rough material below 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.430
 so that they do not slip behind our hands and one or more than six changed their design 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.320
 We will show you how 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.350
 is different but totally magnetic like the previous ones so that we 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.380
 We stumble then ploper to the team but it comes off automatically simple 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.009
 little propaganda 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.749
 includes of course the installation disks after that noble or 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:13.479
 pair 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.479
 ita - include the multimedia package there they did 9 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.599
 in its magnetic closure 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.280
 and of course as you can see in the video some lines totally 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.699
 rethought ma similar to what is the pucpr or aluminum 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.430
 and here we show you in more detail the connections that you know and 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.479
 not the porto cervo to 400 leaving them these short vcb 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.739
 and that rugged material that will prevent falls and accidental landslides
