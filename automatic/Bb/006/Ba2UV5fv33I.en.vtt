00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.270 

now<00:01:20.799> that

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.080 

from<00:01:24.280> there<00:01:24.400> we'd<00:01:24.520> be<00:01:24.610> going<00:01:24.700> into<00:01:24.940> a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
from there we'd be going into a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.060 
from there we'd be going into a
pre-chorus<00:01:25.690> part<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.290> our<00:01:26.380> pre-chorus<00:01:26.920> is

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
pre-chorus part and our pre-chorus is

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.819 

it<00:01:31.780> can't<00:01:32.020> work<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.320> in<00:01:32.470> some<00:01:33.040> alternatives

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.880 

bigger<00:01:36.829> mine

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
bigger mine

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.660 
bigger mine
or<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> B<00:01:38.580> minor<00:01:38.760> 7
