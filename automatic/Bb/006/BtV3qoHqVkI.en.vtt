like<00:02:29.390> Earth<00:02:30.040> Mount<00:02:31.040> Erie<00:02:31.550> as<00:02:32.060> well<00:02:32.630> as<00:02:32.900> that

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
like Earth Mount Erie as well as that

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.920 
like Earth Mount Erie as well as that
last<00:02:33.500> women<00:02:34.100> record<00:02:34.520> public's<00:02:35.030> trained<00:02:35.480> you

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.290 
last women record public's trained you
know<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.320> combination<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.460> ideas<00:02:37.610> like<00:02:38.150> I

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
know the combination of ideas like I

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.790 
know the combination of ideas like I
said<00:02:38.510> on<00:02:38.690> this<00:02:38.840> album<00:02:39.050> is<00:02:39.380> pretty<00:02:39.620> surprising

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
said on this album is pretty surprising

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.360 
said on this album is pretty surprising
it's<00:02:40.720> attractive<00:02:41.720> it's<00:02:41.990> interesting<00:02:42.440> but<00:02:43.220> the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
it's attractive it's interesting but the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.190 
it's attractive it's interesting but the
combination<00:02:43.670> is<00:02:44.090> one<00:02:44.270> thing<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.690> feel<00:02:44.930> like<00:02:45.050> the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
combination is one thing I feel like the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
combination is one thing I feel like the
execution<00:02:45.710> on<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:47.030> record<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.540> totally

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
execution on this record is a totally

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.980 
execution on this record is a totally
different<00:02:49.220> monster<00:02:49.760> for<00:02:50.420> one<00:02:50.600> I'm<00:02:50.810> not<00:02:50.960> a

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
different monster for one I'm not a

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.440 
different monster for one I'm not a
really<00:02:51.230> huge<00:02:51.620> fan<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.130> vocals<00:02:52.550> not<00:02:53.120> only

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
really huge fan of the vocals not only

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.090 
really huge fan of the vocals not only
do<00:02:53.600> they<00:02:53.750> feel<00:02:53.990> too<00:02:54.320> distant

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
do they feel too distant

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.440 
do they feel too distant
which<00:02:55.490> I<00:02:55.610> feel<00:02:55.760> like<00:02:55.820> could<00:02:56.150> have<00:02:56.240> been

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
which I feel like could have been

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.870 
which I feel like could have been
overcome<00:02:56.720> if<00:02:57.380> they<00:02:57.890> had<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.340> bit<00:02:58.850> more

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
overcome if they had a bit more

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.390 
overcome if they had a bit more
personality<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.320> them<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.710> just<00:03:00.830> don't<00:03:01.100> find

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
personality to them I just don't find

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.550 
personality to them I just don't find
the<00:03:01.580> vocals<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.060> be<00:03:02.270> all<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.660> good<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.380> guess

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
the vocals to be all that good I guess

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.230 
the vocals to be all that good I guess
on<00:03:03.800> a<00:03:03.830> lot<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.070> tracks<00:03:04.400> who<00:03:04.580> they<00:03:04.760> just<00:03:04.970> feel

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
on a lot of tracks who they just feel

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.860 
on a lot of tracks who they just feel
kind<00:03:05.930> of<00:03:05.960> flat<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.410> kind<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.400> lifeless<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.360> I

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
kind of flat and kind of lifeless and I

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.270 
kind of flat and kind of lifeless and I
just<00:03:09.050> end<00:03:09.260> up<00:03:09.350> feeling<00:03:09.650> no<00:03:10.240> emotions<00:03:11.240> for<00:03:11.720> them

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
just end up feeling no emotions for them

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.130 
just end up feeling no emotions for them
whatsoever<00:03:13.420> sometimes<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.630> me<00:03:14.750> some<00:03:14.960> of<00:03:14.990> the

whatsoever sometimes to me some of the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.040 
whatsoever sometimes to me some of the
more<00:03:15.370> singer-songwriter<00:03:16.370> based<00:03:17.300> songs<00:03:17.630> just

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
more singer-songwriter based songs just

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.350 
more singer-songwriter based songs just
feel<00:03:18.260> okay<00:03:18.740> to<00:03:18.800> me<00:03:19.160> on<00:03:19.280> here<00:03:19.580> as<00:03:19.700> well<00:03:19.970> like<00:03:20.209> the

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
feel okay to me on here as well like the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.800 
feel okay to me on here as well like the
track<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.780> woods<00:03:21.050> electric<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.810> atmosphere

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
track the woods electric the atmosphere

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.900 
track the woods electric the atmosphere
is<00:03:24.080> really<00:03:24.290> pretty<00:03:24.650> but<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.130> song<00:03:25.550> itself

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
is really pretty but the song itself

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.030 
is really pretty but the song itself
they're<00:03:26.150> really<00:03:26.330> meandering<00:03:27.050> vocal<00:03:27.590> melody

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
they're really meandering vocal melody

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.880 
they're really meandering vocal melody
the<00:03:28.220> repetitive<00:03:28.850> guitar<00:03:29.770> arpeggio<00:03:30.770> is

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
the repetitive guitar arpeggio is

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.320 
the repetitive guitar arpeggio is
another<00:03:31.130> huge<00:03:31.400> complaint<00:03:31.820> I<00:03:31.910> have<00:03:32.060> with<00:03:32.209> this

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
another huge complaint I have with this

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.160 
another huge complaint I have with this
LP<00:03:32.720> is<00:03:32.810> just<00:03:33.190> overall<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.340> flow<00:03:34.850> of<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.690> mean

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
LP is just overall the flow of it I mean

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.680 
LP is just overall the flow of it I mean
this<00:03:36.560> album<00:03:36.980> doesn't<00:03:37.190> flow<00:03:38.000> so<00:03:38.300> much<00:03:38.450> as<00:03:38.570> it

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
this album doesn't flow so much as it

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.900 
this album doesn't flow so much as it
just<00:03:38.720> kind<00:03:39.080> of<00:03:39.280> detours<00:03:40.280> from<00:03:40.670> one

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
just kind of detours from one

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.600 
just kind of detours from one
distraction<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:42.230> another<00:03:42.800> that<00:03:43.370> more

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
distraction to another that more

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.270 
distraction to another that more
post-hardcore<00:03:44.300> influence<00:03:45.170> track<00:03:45.500> crumbling

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
post-hardcore influence track crumbling

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.580 
post-hardcore influence track crumbling
house<00:03:46.550> coming<00:03:47.360> right<00:03:47.570> after<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:47.959> very<00:03:48.140> quiet

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
house coming right after the very quiet

house coming right after the very quiet
the<00:03:48.860> woods<00:03:49.070> electric<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.940> change<00:03:50.270> was<00:03:50.540> so

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
the woods electric the change was so

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.660 
the woods electric the change was so
different<00:03:51.110> that<00:03:51.500> I<00:03:51.770> actually<00:03:52.130> thought<00:03:52.520> I<00:03:52.580> was

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
different that I actually thought I was

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.180 
different that I actually thought I was
listening<00:03:53.270> to<00:03:53.300> a<00:03:53.480> different<00:03:53.989> band<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.709> I<00:03:54.980> had

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
listening to a different band and I had

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.420 
listening to a different band and I had
to<00:03:55.489> go<00:03:56.360> back<00:03:56.600> and<00:03:56.930> just<00:03:57.050> double<00:03:57.860> check<00:03:58.280> and

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
to go back and just double check and

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.710 
to go back and just double check and
make<00:03:58.489> sure<00:03:58.640> that<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.030> was<00:03:59.180> actually<00:03:59.540> on<00:03:59.690> the

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
make sure that I was actually on the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.410 
make sure that I was actually on the
same<00:04:00.050> record<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.709> I<00:04:01.190> did<00:04:01.640> that<00:04:01.850> more<00:04:02.209> than

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
same record and I did that more than

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.380 
same record and I did that more than
once<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.560> track<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:03.980> drone<00:04:04.310> itself<00:04:05.120> is<00:04:05.360> a

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
once the track the drone itself is a

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.960 
once the track the drone itself is a
contrast<00:04:06.080> in<00:04:06.350> that<00:04:06.410> it<00:04:06.709> builds<00:04:07.160> up<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.670> very

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
contrast in that it builds up to a very

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.580 
contrast in that it builds up to a very
abrasive<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.320> doom<00:04:09.950> riff<00:04:10.610> Laden<00:04:11.600> finish<00:04:12.140> but

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
abrasive and doom riff Laden finish but

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.370 
abrasive and doom riff Laden finish but
the<00:04:12.739> end<00:04:13.010> just<00:04:13.580> cuts<00:04:14.120> off<00:04:14.330> suddenly<00:04:14.750> in<00:04:15.110> a<00:04:15.200> very

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
the end just cuts off suddenly in a very

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.940 
the end just cuts off suddenly in a very
kind<00:04:15.680> of<00:04:15.820> Abbey<00:04:16.820> Road<00:04:17.200> sort<00:04:18.200> of<00:04:18.320> way<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.709> just

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
kind of Abbey Road sort of way and just

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.130 
kind of Abbey Road sort of way and just
gives<00:04:19.489> way<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:19.730> this<00:04:20.030> very<00:04:20.239> quiet<00:04:20.720> acoustic

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
quietly and has a slow and subtle build

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.100 
quietly and has a slow and subtle build
toward<00:04:57.800> it's<00:04:57.920> very<00:04:58.150> apocalyptic<00:04:59.150> end<00:04:59.450> and<00:04:59.870> the

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
toward it's very apocalyptic end and the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.320 
toward it's very apocalyptic end and the
track<00:05:00.380> bell<00:05:00.740> when<00:05:01.220> it<00:05:01.340> stops<00:05:01.640> in<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.090> middle

track bell when it stops in the middle

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.730 
track bell when it stops in the middle
and<00:05:02.450> kind<00:05:02.600> of<00:05:02.690> transitions<00:05:03.410> into<00:05:03.710> a

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
and kind of transitions into a

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.280 
and kind of transitions into a
completely<00:05:04.190> different<00:05:04.340> thing<00:05:04.910> is<00:05:05.180> is<00:05:05.750> a<00:05:05.990> nice

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
completely different thing is is a nice

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.740 
completely different thing is is a nice
little<00:05:06.650> segue<00:05:07.340> too<00:05:07.580> but<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.270> song<00:05:08.480> to<00:05:08.630> me

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
little segue too but the song to me

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.660 
little segue too but the song to me
doesn't<00:05:09.020> really<00:05:09.050> get<00:05:09.350> all<00:05:09.560> that<00:05:09.740> enthralling

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
doesn't really get all that enthralling

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.570 
doesn't really get all that enthralling
until<00:05:11.240> it<00:05:11.420> really<00:05:12.200> starts<00:05:12.560> rocking<00:05:13.040> out<00:05:13.190> you

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
until it really starts rocking out you

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.860 
until it really starts rocking out you
know<00:05:13.670> I<00:05:13.700> think<00:05:13.820> these<00:05:14.090> guys<00:05:14.300> have<00:05:14.600> pulled

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
know I think these guys have pulled

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.860 
know I think these guys have pulled
together<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.230> nice<00:05:15.530> equal<00:05:16.190> mix<00:05:16.520> of<00:05:16.850> of<00:05:17.120> quiet

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
together a nice equal mix of of quiet

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.710 
together a nice equal mix of of quiet
soft<00:05:18.560> and<00:05:18.890> pretty<00:05:19.370> sounds<00:05:20.030> combined<00:05:20.510> with

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
soft and pretty sounds combined with

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.020 
soft and pretty sounds combined with
some<00:05:20.990> very<00:05:21.200> heavy<00:05:21.530> abrasive<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.460> extreme

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
some very heavy abrasive and extreme

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.330 
some very heavy abrasive and extreme
sounds<00:05:23.720> but<00:05:24.200> I<00:05:24.230> think<00:05:24.560> dweller<00:05:24.950> on<00:05:25.070> the

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
sounds but I think dweller on the

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.900 
sounds but I think dweller on the
threshold<00:05:25.690> definitely<00:05:26.690> has<00:05:27.160> more<00:05:28.160> prowess

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
threshold definitely has more prowess

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.510 
threshold definitely has more prowess
when<00:05:29.120> it<00:05:29.240> comes<00:05:29.450> to<00:05:29.660> one<00:05:29.980> versus<00:05:30.980> the<00:05:31.130> other

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
when it comes to one versus the other

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.620 
when it comes to one versus the other
but<00:05:32.210> if<00:05:32.480> these<00:05:32.780> guys<00:05:32.960> continue<00:05:33.530> to<00:05:33.650> maintain

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
but if these guys continue to maintain

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.409 
but if these guys continue to maintain
this<00:05:35.630> array<00:05:36.350> of<00:05:36.500> influences<00:05:37.370> as<00:05:38.060> I<00:05:38.270> will

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
this array of influences as I will

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.300 
this array of influences as I will
definitely<00:05:38.990> be<00:05:39.140> checking<00:05:39.380> out<00:05:39.680> their<00:05:39.950> next

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
definitely be checking out their next

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.940 
definitely be checking out their next
record<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:40.940> be<00:05:41.150> very<00:05:41.960> interested<00:05:42.710> in<00:05:42.800> where

record and be very interested in where

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.670 
record and be very interested in where
they<00:05:43.100> kind<00:05:43.280> of<00:05:43.430> take<00:05:43.729> this<00:05:43.970> varied<00:05:44.360> style<00:05:44.870> into
