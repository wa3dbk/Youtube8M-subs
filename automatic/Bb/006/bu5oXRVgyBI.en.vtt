00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
vertical then we're going to switch

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.129 
vertical then we're going to switch
direction<00:00:08.450> horizontal<00:00:09.450> vertical<00:00:09.630> horizontal

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139

vertical<00:00:10.980> we're<00:00:11.849> going<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.030> start<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.360> nice

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
vertical we're going to start it nice

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.270 
vertical we're going to start it nice
and<00:00:12.750> slow<00:00:13.019> just<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.530> chest<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.040> then<00:00:14.130> we're

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
and slow just the chest and then we're

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.250 
and slow just the chest and then we're
going<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.429> go<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.000> take<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.599> up<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.750> speed<00:00:16.109> with

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
going to go and take it up to speed with

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.960 
going to go and take it up to speed with
the<00:00:16.440> hips<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:16.859> right<00:00:17.300> front<00:00:18.320> left<00:00:19.320> back<00:00:20.250> let's

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
the hips so right front left back let's

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.570 
the hips so right front left back let's
do<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.210> undulation<00:00:21.630> again<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.560> up<00:00:22.830> roll

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
do that undulation again it's up roll

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.130 
do that undulation again it's up roll
back<00:00:23.789> pop<00:00:24.859> one<00:00:25.859> more<00:00:25.920> time<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:27.119> roll<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:27.900> down

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
back pop one more time up roll it down

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.040 
back pop one more time up roll it down
pop<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.210> going<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.390> follow<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.869> same

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
pop and this is going to follow the same

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.569 
pop and this is going to follow the same
timing<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.560> we've<00:00:31.679> used<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> previous

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
timing that we've used for the previous

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.709 
timing that we've used for the previous
three<00:00:32.610> movements<00:00:33.290> five<00:00:34.290> six<00:00:35.160> pop<00:00:35.760> seven<00:00:36.210> hold

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
three movements five six pop seven hold

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.900 
three movements five six pop seven hold
eight<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.620> you've<00:00:37.770> got<00:00:37.920> four<00:00:38.250> holds<00:00:38.700> through

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
eight so you've got four holds through

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.209 
eight so you've got four holds through
this<00:00:39.030> whole<00:00:39.239> 16<00:00:39.660> count<00:00:39.870> combination<00:00:40.530> now<00:00:41.040> as

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
this whole 16 count combination now as

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.400 
this whole 16 count combination now as
we<00:00:41.460> turn<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> other<00:00:42.270> profile<00:00:42.840> we're<00:00:43.290> going

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
we turn to the other profile we're going

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.010 
we turn to the other profile we're going
to<00:00:43.469> take<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.430> tahitian<00:00:44.940> box<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.450> actually<00:00:45.629> go

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
to take the tahitian box to actually go

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.630 
to take the tahitian box to actually go

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
to the left front left front left back

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.930 
to the left front left front left back
chest<00:00:50.640> lock<00:00:50.879> down<00:00:51.210> chest<00:00:51.660> lock<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.940> okay

that's<00:01:00.120> very<00:01:00.480> important<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.109> remember

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that's very important to remember

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.170 
that's very important to remember
because<00:01:01.800> when<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.070> add<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.460> hips<00:01:02.699> there<00:01:02.969> isn't

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
because when we add the hips there isn't

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.640 
because when we add the hips there isn't
going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> pause<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> hips<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> hips

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
going to be a pause in the hips the hips

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
going to be a pause in the hips the hips
are<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.159> keep<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.460> steady<00:01:05.700> rhythm<00:01:06.030> for<00:01:06.330> us

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
are going to keep a steady rhythm for us

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.080 
are going to keep a steady rhythm for us
at<00:01:06.659> halftime<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:08.220> let<00:01:08.369> me<00:01:08.460> show<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.880> half

so<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.759> heard<00:01:17.970> us<00:01:18.090> talk<00:01:18.330> about<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.350> concept

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
so you heard us talk about the concept

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.530 
so you heard us talk about the concept
of<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.220> metronome<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.790> really<00:01:21.240> want<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> get

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
of a metronome you really want to get

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.880 
of a metronome you really want to get
that<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.840> your<00:01:21.990> head<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.409> again<00:01:22.619> because

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that in your head here again because

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.679 
that in your head here again because
your<00:01:23.040> hips<00:01:23.280> need<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.670> stay<00:01:23.850> steady<00:01:24.180> they're

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
your hips need to stay steady they're

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.330 
your hips need to stay steady they're
not<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> pause<00:01:25.680> when<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> feet

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
not going to have a pause when the feet

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.289 
not going to have a pause when the feet
have<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> pause<00:01:26.930> right<00:01:27.930> left<00:01:28.439> right<00:01:28.740> left<00:01:29.299> let's

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
have a pause right left right left let's

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.830 
have a pause right left right left let's
try<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.750> couple<00:01:30.810> times<00:01:31.220> five<00:01:32.220> six<00:01:33.090> five

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
try that a couple times five six five

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.830 
try that a couple times five six five
six<00:01:33.950> seven<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.130> right<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:36.000> left<00:01:36.479> left
