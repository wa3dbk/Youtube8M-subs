00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:21.050

and<00:00:14.599> this<00:00:15.599> wig<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.560> called<00:00:17.400> barra<00:00:18.180> da<00:00:19.080> RA<00:00:20.060> and

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and this wig is called barra da RA and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.490 
and this wig is called barra da RA and
it's<00:00:21.210> synthetic<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.170> isn't<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.650> 1<00:00:22.949> B<00:00:24.500> so

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
it's synthetic and this isn't a 1 B so

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.640 
it's synthetic and this isn't a 1 B so
this<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.400> nano<00:00:26.730> platinum<00:00:27.480> crown<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.470> guess
