the<00:01:33.710> Seine<00:01:33.950> armar<00:01:34.310> didn't<00:01:34.520> quite<00:01:34.700> meet<00:01:34.909> our

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
the Seine armar didn't quite meet our

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.880 
the Seine armar didn't quite meet our
expectations<00:01:35.240> we<00:01:36.170> feel<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.679> Seine

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
expectations we feel that the Seine

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.830 
expectations we feel that the Seine
armbar<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:37.490> integral<00:01:38.060> part<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.569> look<00:01:38.690> and

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
armbar is integral part to the look and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.749 
armbar is integral part to the look and
feel<00:01:38.990> of<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.200> Dragon<00:01:39.440> Ball<00:01:39.530> Z<00:01:39.560> universe<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:40.640> we

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
feel of the Dragon Ball Z universe so we

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:41.830
