00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
all those crazy patches that have

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.830 
all those crazy patches that have
basically<00:00:50.610> given<00:00:50.730> us<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.239> different<00:00:51.420> game

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
basically given us a different game

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.260 
basically given us a different game
every<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.829> three<00:00:53.070> months<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:53.640> whatever<00:00:53.789> so

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
every like three months or whatever so

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360 
every like three months or whatever so
it's<00:00:54.510> been<00:00:55.199> quite<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> journey<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> scar

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it's been quite a journey for the scar

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.920 
it's been quite a journey for the scar
and<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.670> actually<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.180> enjoy<00:00:57.390> using<00:00:57.719> this

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and I actually do enjoy using this

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.689 
and I actually do enjoy using this
weapon<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.320> slices<00:00:58.829> through<00:00:58.980> people<00:00:59.399> pretty

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
weapon it slices through people pretty

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.090 
weapon it slices through people pretty
quickly<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.440> suppressor<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:01.890> it

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
quickly and I like the suppressor on it

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.290 
quickly and I like the suppressor on it
still<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.340> think<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.730> kind<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.030> tames<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
still I think it kind of tames the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.299 
still I think it kind of tames the
recoil<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.350> does<00:01:04.530> limit<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.189> can

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
recoil of it it does limit what you can

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.100 
recoil of it it does limit what you can
do<00:01:05.610> with<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.090> gonna<00:01:06.240> hurt<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.689> hipfire

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
do with it it's gonna hurt that hipfire

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.080 
do with it it's gonna hurt that hipfire
a<00:01:07.140> little<00:01:07.409> bit<00:01:07.530> more<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:07.979> honestly<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.000> don't

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
a little bit more but honestly I don't

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.670 
a little bit more but honestly I don't
really<00:01:09.240> care<00:01:09.510> about<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.900> because<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
really care about that because I like to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.050 
really care about that because I like to

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
is on PC a lot of the servers are

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.100 
is on PC a lot of the servers are
running<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:50.369> little<00:01:50.820> bit<00:01:51.030> glitch<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.630> squads

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
are super huge because if you look at my

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.700 
are super huge because if you look at my
spawn<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.540> screen<00:01:54.780> when<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.960> do<00:01:55.049> die<00:01:55.380> I

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
spawn and screen when I do die I

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.039 
spawn and screen when I do die I
actually<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> ton<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.299> people<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.899> my

actually have a ton of people in my
squat<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.590> what<00:01:59.159> does<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.579> mean<00:01:59.670> I

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
squat and what does that really mean I

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.980 
squat and what does that really mean I
mean<00:02:00.000> why<00:02:00.210> would<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.509> really<00:02:00.689> matter

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
mean why would that really matter

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.050 
mean why would that really matter

the<00:02:08.610> same<00:02:08.759> squad<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:10.080> cause<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> lot<00:02:10.530> of

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the same squad that can cause a lot of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.680 
the same squad that can cause a lot of
problems<00:02:11.009> because<00:02:11.370> they<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.940> spawn<00:02:12.420> on

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
problems because they can spawn on

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.760 
problems because they can spawn on
anyone<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.560> there

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
anyone so there

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.320 
anyone so there
a lot<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.100> people<00:02:14.220> for<00:02:14.610> them<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> spawn<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.300> I

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
a lot of people for them the spawn on I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.300 
a lot of people for them the spawn on I
mean<00:02:15.600> that's<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.140> pretty<00:02:16.470> big<00:02:16.770> deal<00:02:17.040> as

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
mean that's that's a pretty big deal as

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.910 
mean that's that's a pretty big deal as
I<00:02:17.460> start<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:17.880> game<00:02:17.910> like<00:02:18.270> 11<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.870> 11<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.710> one

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
I start this game like 11 and 11 and one

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.010 
I start this game like 11 and 11 and one
I<00:02:19.950> believe<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.700> pretty<00:02:21.300> good<00:02:21.420> start<00:02:21.630> with<00:02:21.900> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
I believe so pretty good start with the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.920 
I believe so pretty good start with the
scar-h<00:02:22.350> silenced<00:02:23.510> that's<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.600> lot<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.780> people

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
scar-h silenced that's a lot of people

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.080 
scar-h silenced that's a lot of people
have<00:02:25.170> spot<00:02:25.380> on<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.740> what<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.040> get<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.880> get

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
have spot on so what you get is you get

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.120 
have spot on so what you get is you get
really<00:02:27.600> clustered<00:02:27.990> areas<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.740> really

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
really clustered areas and you really

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.620 
really clustered areas and you really
have<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.490> play<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> little<00:02:29.850> bit<00:02:30.060> more<00:02:30.180> campy<00:02:30.600> a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
have to play a little bit more campy a

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.930 
have to play a little bit more campy a
lot<00:02:30.960> more<00:02:31.110> camping<00:02:31.470> than<00:02:31.500> not<00:02:31.710> I<00:02:31.890> really<00:02:32.370> like

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
lot more camping than not I really like

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.820 
lot more camping than not I really like
to<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.540> more<00:02:33.660> tactical<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.380> have<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.710> be

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
to but it's more tactical you have to be

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.830 
to but it's more tactical you have to be
smart<00:02:35.130> about<00:02:35.250> your<00:02:35.460> movements<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.540> really

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
smart about your movements you really

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.690 
smart about your movements you really
have<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.170> hold<00:02:37.380> down<00:02:37.470> portions<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.310> map<00:02:38.520> in

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
have to hold down portions of the map in

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.180 
have to hold down portions of the map in
order<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.030> be<00:02:39.150> successful<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:40.500> that's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
order to be successful and that's

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.010 
order to be successful and that's
something<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.940> can't<00:02:42.180> emphasize<00:02:42.330> enough<00:02:42.660> I

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
something I can't emphasize enough I

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.250 
something I can't emphasize enough I
mean<00:02:43.230> when<00:02:43.440> one<00:02:43.740> person<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.790> alive<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.960> squad

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
that means six other eight other people

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.030 
that means six other eight other people
can<00:02:48.720> spot<00:02:48.990> on<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.140> person<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.770> that's

can spot on that person and that's

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.680 
can spot on that person and that's
that's<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.430> lot<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.610> people<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.060> mean<00:02:51.240> before<00:02:51.510> you

know you've got like six or seven people
just<00:02:53.490> popping<00:02:53.880> out<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.180> corner<00:02:54.540> where<00:02:55.470> you

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
just popping out of a corner where you

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.050 
just popping out of a corner where you
thought<00:02:55.740> there<00:02:55.950> was<00:02:56.040> only<00:02:56.100> one<00:02:56.400> guy<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:56.880> that's

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
thought there was only one guy so that's

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.130 
thought there was only one guy so that's
that's<00:02:57.210> something<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.570> really<00:02:57.870> have<00:02:58.020> to

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
that's something you really have to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.230 
that's something you really have to
consider<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.560> these<00:02:58.680> maps<00:02:59.000> that's<00:03:00.000> why<00:03:00.120> they

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
consider on these maps that's why they

it because it's fun running around in
these<00:03:27.690> warehouses<00:03:27.959> with<00:03:28.470> weapons<00:03:28.890> like<00:03:28.950> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
these warehouses with weapons like the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.770 
these warehouses with weapons like the
scar-h<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.610> mean<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.820> scar-h<00:03:30.060> does<00:03:30.420> 30<00:03:30.660> damage

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
scar-h I mean the scar-h does 30 damage

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.360 
scar-h I mean the scar-h does 30 damage
so<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.290> do<00:03:31.440> have<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.620> potential<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.160> get<00:03:32.310> a

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
so you do have the potential to get a

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.590 
so you do have the potential to get a
two-shot<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:32.820> mean<00:03:33.030> if<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.209> shoot<00:03:33.360> them<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.570> the

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
two-shot I mean if you shoot them in the

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.420 
two-shot I mean if you shoot them in the
head<00:03:33.690> twice<00:03:33.959> they're<00:03:34.709> gonna<00:03:34.830> die<00:03:35.100> because

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
head twice they're gonna die because

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.820 
head twice they're gonna die because
it's<00:03:35.580> doing<00:03:35.820> 60<00:03:36.270> damage<00:03:36.600> per<00:03:36.810> shot<00:03:36.840> because

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
it's doing 60 damage per shot because

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.680 
it's doing 60 damage per shot because
this<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.220> 30<00:03:38.520> damage<00:03:38.760> weapon<00:03:39.209> as<00:03:39.300> you<00:03:39.390> see<00:03:39.570> me

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
this is a 30 damage weapon as you see me

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.530 
this is a 30 damage weapon as you see me
get<00:03:39.840> one<00:03:40.080> shot<00:03:40.320> there<00:03:40.590> by<00:03:40.740> AEK<00:03:41.370> but<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.120> AEK

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
get one shot there by AEK but the AEK

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.300 
get one shot there by AEK but the AEK
tends<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.990> do<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.140> because<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.740> has<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:43.890> crazy

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
tends to do that because it has a crazy

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.590 
tends to do that because it has a crazy
fire<00:03:44.670> rate<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.150> can<00:03:45.300> kind<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.540> just

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
fire rate that you can kind of just

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.780 
fire rate that you can kind of just
spray<00:03:46.110> from<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.470> hip<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.860> get<00:03:47.220> lucky<00:03:47.459> head

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
shots but that was a bit unfortunate

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.290 
shots but that was a bit unfortunate

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.050 
glitch I don't want to play this but
it's<00:04:22.800> actually<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:23.130> lot<00:04:23.250> of<00:04:23.400> fun<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.580> mean<00:04:23.820> if<00:04:23.970> you

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
it's actually a lot of fun I mean if you

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.219 
it's actually a lot of fun I mean if you
if<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.330> just<00:04:24.360> want<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.720> go<00:04:24.840> in<00:04:24.960> there<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.140> get

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
if you just want to go in there and get

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.530 
if you just want to go in there and get
a<00:04:25.290> lot<00:04:25.470> of<00:04:25.500> kills<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:27.030> got<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.300> be<00:04:27.390> a<00:04:27.419> little

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
a lot of kills you got to be a little

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.100 
a lot of kills you got to be a little
bit<00:04:27.690> more<00:04:27.810> tact

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
bit more tact

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.779 
bit more tact
and<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:28.740> think<00:04:28.919> that's<00:04:29.069> where<00:04:29.189> the<00:04:29.250> suppressor

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
and I think that's where the suppressor

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.939 
and I think that's where the suppressor
comes<00:04:30.000> into<00:04:30.210> play<00:04:30.530> keeping<00:04:31.530> them<00:04:31.710> from

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
comes into play keeping them from

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.499 
comes into play keeping them from
knowing<00:04:32.250> exactly<00:04:32.550> where<00:04:33.060> you're<00:04:33.180> coming<00:04:33.210> from

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
knowing exactly where you're coming from

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.260 
knowing exactly where you're coming from
hi<00:04:34.289> that's<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.740> big<00:04:34.949> advantage<00:04:35.069> it<00:04:35.550> also<00:04:35.759> tames

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
hi that's a big advantage it also tames

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.600 
hi that's a big advantage it also tames
the recoil<00:04:36.990> on<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.259> scar<00:04:37.500> age<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:37.979> even

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
the recoil on the scar age so even

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.040 
the recoil on the scar age so even
though<00:04:38.729> this<00:04:38.759> loadout<00:04:39.270> is<00:04:39.479> a<00:04:39.509> little<00:04:39.870> bit

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
though this loadout is a little bit

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.320

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
little strategy behind my gameplay and

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.190 
little strategy behind my gameplay and
