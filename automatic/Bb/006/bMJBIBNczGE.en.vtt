00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
then not getting cable now this does not

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.540 
then not getting cable now this does not
make<00:00:42.989> any<00:00:43.170> sense<00:00:43.199> because<00:00:43.739> if<00:00:44.160> you're<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.520> of

to<00:00:55.109> buy<00:00:55.320> cable<00:00:55.769> and<00:00:56.070> where<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.460> becomes<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
to buy cable and where this becomes a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.750 
to buy cable and where this becomes a
problem<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.109> experience<00:00:58.559> when<00:00:59.429> I<00:00:59.460> went

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
problem is in my experience when I went

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.939 
problem is in my experience when I went
to<00:00:59.850> gamestop<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:01.079> first<00:01:01.289> Game<00:01:01.440> Stop<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.769> went

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
to gamestop the first Game Stop I went

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.490 
to gamestop the first Game Stop I went
to<00:01:02.070> didn't<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.850> any<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.449> stock<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.140> then<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to didn't have any in stock and then the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.020 
to didn't have any in stock and then the
second<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> went<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.280> actually<00:01:05.430> bought<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
second one I went to actually bought the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.270 
second one I went to actually bought the
last<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.660> in<00:01:06.750> stock<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.890> was<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.250> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
last one in stock so it was just a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.860 
last one in stock so it was just a
little<00:01:08.490> irritating<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.360> know<00:01:09.510> two<00:01:09.570> days

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
little irritating you know two days

little irritating you know two days
Amazon<00:01:10.500> shipping<00:01:10.740> would<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.790> worst<00:01:12.150> case

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
Amazon shipping would be the worst case

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.050 
Amazon shipping would be the worst case
scenario<00:01:12.990> which<00:01:13.620> still<00:01:14.160> isn't<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.640> bad<00:01:14.850> but

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
scenario which still isn't that bad but

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.300 
scenario which still isn't that bad but
still<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> big<00:01:16.110> inconvenience<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.220> would

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
still a big inconvenience and it would

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.040 
still a big inconvenience and it would
have<00:01:17.400> been<00:01:17.520> fixed<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.270> by<00:01:18.390> them<00:01:18.570> putting<00:01:18.870> it

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
have been fixed just by them putting it

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.970 
have been fixed just by them putting it

the top part of the screen was a little
wobbly<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.100> kind<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.340> see<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.640> right

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
wobbly and you can kind of see it right

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.590 
wobbly and you can kind of see it right

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.560 
opinion the 3d experience is so much
better<00:02:49.650> on<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.190> new<00:02:50.340> 3ds<00:02:50.730> than<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.150> old<00:02:51.330> one

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
better on the new 3ds than the old one

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.360 
better on the new 3ds than the old one
on<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> old<00:02:52.110> one<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.620> was<00:02:52.770> one<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:52.980> those<00:02:53.160> people

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
on the old one I was one of those people

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.340 
on the old one I was one of those people
that<00:02:53.520> literally<00:02:54.209> could<00:02:54.540> not<00:02:54.600> play<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.140> for

fatigue no headache no nothing it was

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.350 
fatigue no headache no nothing it was
just<00:03:03.900> phenomenal<00:03:04.520> also<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.700> realized<00:03:06.239> that

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
just phenomenal also I realized that

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.420 
just phenomenal also I realized that
this<00:03:06.600> one<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.050> little<00:03:07.440> bit<00:03:07.650> latter<00:03:08.040> than<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
this one is a little bit latter than the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.679 
this one is a little bit latter than the
old<00:03:08.700> 3ds

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.289 

it<00:03:14.689> has<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:14.930> faster<00:03:15.500> CPU<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.340> more<00:03:16.670> RAM<00:03:16.730> than

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
it has a faster CPU and more RAM than

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.420 
it has a faster CPU and more RAM than
the<00:03:17.420> last<00:03:17.659> version<00:03:17.959> allowing<00:03:18.680> it<00:03:18.799> to<00:03:18.829> open<00:03:19.310> up

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
the last version allowing it to open up

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.000 
the last version allowing it to open up
optimized<00:03:20.090> games<00:03:20.510> faster<00:03:21.230> now<00:03:21.469> especially

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
optimized games faster now especially

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.770 
optimized games faster now especially
games<00:03:22.430> that<00:03:22.579> are<00:03:22.670> downloaded<00:03:23.120> on<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.450> device

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
games that are downloaded on the device

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.099 
games that are downloaded on the device
itself<00:03:24.260> load<00:03:24.769> extremely<00:03:25.760> quickly<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.390> even

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
itself load extremely quickly and even

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.360 
itself load extremely quickly and even
when<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.290> was<00:03:27.439> playing<00:03:27.590> like<00:03:27.799> say<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.189> new

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
when I was playing like say the new

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.000 
when I was playing like say the new
Zelda<00:03:28.819> I<00:03:28.969> noticed<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.659> significant<00:03:30.590> difference

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
Zelda I noticed a significant difference

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.619 
Zelda I noticed a significant difference
in<00:03:31.129> the<00:03:31.219> loading<00:03:31.489> time<00:03:31.670> it<00:03:31.909> was<00:03:32.000> almost<00:03:32.359> 2

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
in the loading time it was almost 2

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.020 
in the loading time it was almost 2
times<00:03:32.870> faster<00:03:33.469> than<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.799> old<00:03:33.980> version<00:03:34.069> so

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
times faster than the old version so

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.080 
times faster than the old version so
