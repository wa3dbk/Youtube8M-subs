to see over Ferris wheel wheel looked

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.290 
to see over Ferris wheel wheel looked
incredible<00:00:56.230> all<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.980> lights<00:00:57.699> are<00:00:57.910> bouncing

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
incredible all the lights are bouncing

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.829 
incredible all the lights are bouncing
off<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.600> rails<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:01.000> interesting<00:01:01.390> because<00:01:01.719> I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
off the rails it's interesting because I

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.280 
off the rails it's interesting because I
think<00:01:01.899> it's<00:01:02.170> six<00:01:02.470> rows<00:01:02.769> of<00:01:02.800> LEDs<00:01:03.430> but<00:01:04.390> when

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
think it's six rows of LEDs but when

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.719 
think it's six rows of LEDs but when
they're<00:01:05.470> spinning<00:01:05.740> that<00:01:05.950> fast<00:01:06.009> it<00:01:06.460> looks<00:01:06.610> like

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
they're spinning that fast it looks like

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.249 
they're spinning that fast it looks like
a<00:01:06.759> million<00:01:07.030> LEDs<00:01:07.509> there's<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.899> whole<00:01:08.020> wheel

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
a million LEDs there's the whole wheel

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.380 
a million LEDs there's the whole wheel
lights<00:01:08.500> up<00:01:08.799> so<00:01:09.399> I<00:01:09.430> think<00:01:09.729> that<00:01:10.060> people<00:01:10.210> a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
lights up so I think that people a

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.789 
lights up so I think that people a

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
so when they spin they could light up
