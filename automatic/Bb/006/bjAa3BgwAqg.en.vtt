maybe<00:02:14.130> around<00:02:15.120> 22<00:02:15.810> ish<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:18.060> rest<00:02:18.090> is

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330

maybe around 22 ish so the rest is
history<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.750> guess<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.160> end<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.550> a

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
history I guess so that is the end of a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.030 
history I guess so that is the end of a
question<00:02:21.240> one<00:02:21.660> for<00:02:22.080> 30<00:02:22.290> days<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.560> courses<00:02:22.860> and
