imaging<00:00:00.810> in<00:00:00.930> terms<00:00:01.140> of<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.350> center<00:00:01.680> is

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
imaging in terms of the center is

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.480 
imaging in terms of the center is
probably<00:00:02.820> arguably<00:00:03.780> crisper<00:00:04.410> depending<00:00:05.400> on

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
probably arguably crisper depending on

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.930 
probably arguably crisper depending on
the<00:00:05.609> foot<00:00:06.000> you're<00:00:06.150> playing<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:07.340> but<00:00:08.340> the

the foot you're playing and but the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
expense of that is that it shrinks it

goes<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.790> model<00:00:12.120> T<00:00:12.210> I'm<00:00:12.960> exaggerating

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
goes to model T I'm exaggerating

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.620 
goes to model T I'm exaggerating
slightly<00:00:13.679> under<00:00:14.130> test<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.460> go<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.639> model<00:00:15.059> and

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
slightly under test to go to model and

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.060 
slightly under test to go to model and
yes<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:15.990> hear<00:00:16.170> something<00:00:16.529> key<00:00:16.680> stuff<00:00:16.890> out

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
yes you hear something key stuff out

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
yes you hear something key stuff out
here<00:00:17.400> that's<00:00:18.210> not<00:00:18.500> that's<00:00:19.500> not<00:00:19.740> common<00:00:20.160> but

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
here that's not that's not common but

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.820 
here that's not that's not common but
because<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.080> kind<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.350> shape<00:00:22.529> that's

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
because of this kind of shape that's

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.710 
because of this kind of shape that's
what's<00:00:23.010> gonna<00:00:23.160> happen<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.760> does<00:00:24.150> happen<00:00:24.180> I

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
what's gonna happen and it does happen I

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.240 
what's gonna happen and it does happen I
put<00:00:24.990> there<00:00:25.140> Kestrel<00:00:25.529> stuff<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.920> here<00:00:26.070> some<00:00:26.220> of

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
put there Kestrel stuff on here some of

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.170 
put there Kestrel stuff on here some of
the<00:00:26.340> stuff<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.640> right<00:00:26.820> here

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
the stuff like right here

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.099 
the stuff like right here
purposely<00:00:27.900> was<00:00:28.230> really<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
purposely was really to do with the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.000 
purposely was really to do with the
width<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> sounds<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.099> happen<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:34.010> what

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
width of the sounds to happen and what

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.100 
width of the sounds to happen and what
you<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.250> see<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.850> go<00:00:36.000> off<00:00:36.210> axis<00:00:36.719> and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
you can see that if you go off axis and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.650 
you can see that if you go off axis and
I<00:00:37.200> set<00:00:37.410> these<00:00:37.530> up<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.040> they're<00:00:38.250> as<00:00:39.149> fear

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
I set these up so that they're as fear

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.180 
I set these up so that they're as fear
as<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.050> possibly<00:00:40.170> make<00:00:40.440> them<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.860> told<00:00:40.920> them

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
as I can possibly make them I told them

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.779 
as I can possibly make them I told them
in<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:42.120> you're<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.450> axis<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.020> both<00:00:43.200> cases<00:00:43.789> but

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
in so you're on axis in both cases but

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.010 
in so you're on axis in both cases but
if<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.030> were<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.210> walk<00:00:45.390> around<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.840> room

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
if you were to walk around the room

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.340 
if you were to walk around the room
you're<00:00:46.800> gonna<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.250> hole<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.200> if<00:00:49.200> you

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you're gonna have this hole and if you

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.860 
you're gonna have this hole and if you
look<00:00:49.500> at<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:50.520> you've<00:00:50.730> been<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> reverb

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
look at the if you've been to a reverb

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.500 
look at the if you've been to a reverb
room<00:00:52.489> that<00:00:53.489> sums<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> total<00:00:54.390> energy

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
room that sums up the total energy

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.290 
room that sums up the total energy
output<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.170> system<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:57.059> that

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
output of a system and you can see that

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.819 
output of a system and you can see that
that's<00:00:57.899> gonna<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> problem

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
that's gonna have a problem

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.469 
that's gonna have a problem
you<00:00:59.730> know<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.570> you're<00:01:00.719> gonna<00:01:00.809> get<00:01:05.090> you<00:01:06.090> compare

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
you know so you're gonna get you compare

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.060 
you know so you're gonna get you compare
that<00:01:06.659> against<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> xr-50

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that against the xr-50

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.120 
that against the xr-50
now<00:01:08.939> that's<00:01:09.180> zero<00:01:09.659> degrees<00:01:10.049> thirty<00:01:10.590> or

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
now that's zero degrees thirty or

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.480 
now that's zero degrees thirty or
virtually<00:01:11.580> identical<00:01:12.950> 60<00:01:13.950> degrees<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
virtually identical 60 degrees is the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.390 
virtually identical 60 degrees is the
next<00:01:14.729> line<00:01:14.850> down<00:01:15.619> not<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.650> much<00:01:16.979> different

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
next line down not that much different

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.289 
next line down not that much different
and<00:01:17.790> ninety<00:01:18.750> degrees<00:01:19.189> it's<00:01:20.189> down<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:21.150> it's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
and ninety degrees it's down but it's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.719 
and ninety degrees it's down but it's
virtually<00:01:21.869> flat<00:01:22.080> way<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.890> extreme

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
virtually flat way out to extreme

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.210 
virtually flat way out to extreme
frequency<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.799> actually<00:01:25.920> move

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
frequency so you can actually move

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.350 
frequency so you can actually move
around<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.729> lot

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
around a lot

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.050 
around a lot
fifty-fifty<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:29.100> you're<00:01:29.340> gonna<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> very

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
fifty-fifty and you're gonna have a very

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.240 
fifty-fifty and you're gonna have a very
wide<00:01:30.299> stage<00:01:30.810> you're<00:01:31.740> gonna<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> very

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
wide stage you're gonna have a very

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.969 
wide stage you're gonna have a very
neutral<00:01:32.700> sound<00:01:33.200> almost<00:01:34.200> no<00:01:34.470> matter<00:01:34.680> where<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
neutral sound almost no matter where you

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.940 
neutral sound almost no matter where you
are<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.280> room<00:01:35.430> obviously<00:01:36.180> blow<00:01:36.890> when<00:01:37.890> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
are in the room obviously blow when you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.230 
are in the room obviously blow when you
get<00:01:38.070> into<00:01:38.250> room<00:01:38.490> modes<00:01:38.700> you're<00:01:38.909> gonna<00:01:39.030> have

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
get into room modes you're gonna have

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.850 
get into room modes you're gonna have
those<00:01:39.420> always<00:01:40.200> going<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.590> those<00:01:40.710> no

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
those always going to have those no

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.560 
those always going to have those no
matter<00:01:41.009> what<00:01:41.159> system<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:42.210> far<00:01:42.390> as<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
matter what system but as far as the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.230 
matter what system but as far as the
articulation<00:01:43.170> goes<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.310> these<00:01:44.939> are

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
articulation goes you know these are

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.280 
articulation goes you know these are
kept<00:01:45.780> away<00:01:45.930> from<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.380> woofers<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.810> don't

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
kept away from the woofers the I don't

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.950 
kept away from the woofers the I don't
know<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.710> mentioned<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:51.329> BMW<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
know if I mentioned but the BMW is a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.010 
know if I mentioned but the BMW is a
two-way<00:01:52.229> system<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.600> that<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
two-way system and that one of the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.539 
two-way system and that one of the
problems<00:01:55.409> was<00:01:55.530> two-way<00:01:55.770> system<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.310> can't

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
problems was two-way system is you can't

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.940 
problems was two-way system is you can't
necessarily<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.390> articulation<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.710> a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
necessarily get the articulation in a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
narrow driver to get the dispersion you

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.910 
narrow driver to get the dispersion you
need<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.329> wider<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.810> driver<00:02:04.079> the

need because the wider the driver the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.499 
need because the wider the driver the
narrower<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> dispersion<00:02:06.030> pattern<00:02:06.329> as<00:02:06.420> you

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
narrower the dispersion pattern as you

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.719 
narrower the dispersion pattern as you
go<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.840> frequency<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.829> that's<00:02:08.129> purposely

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
go up in frequency and that's purposely

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.499 
go up in frequency and that's purposely
why<00:02:08.910> these<00:02:08.970> two<00:02:09.300> inch<00:02:09.450> drivers<00:02:09.840> are<00:02:09.989> used

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
why these two inch drivers are used

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.149 
why these two inch drivers are used
to<00:02:11.200> keep<00:02:11.439> that<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.549> it's<00:02:12.670> very<00:02:12.939> broad

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
to keep that so that it's very broad

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.530 
to keep that so that it's very broad
