00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 or 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.650
 I'm Elijah Church Steffen Chief 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.200
 dead steakhouse and today I 'm going to 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.269
 show how to make lamb chops 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.040
 perfect first choose chops that 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.259
 have at least one or one and a half 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.210
 inches thick that have a color 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:22.119
 bright red and abundant fat 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.950
 intramuscular intramuscular fat are 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.590
 the fat particles through the 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.960
 meat and that they will give juice and flavor 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.939
 can season the meat with salt 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.870
 seasoned or simply with salt and 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.149
 pepper as you prefer 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.550
 pull out the lamb chops so 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.649
 less two hours before cooking and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.390
 Leave them at room temperature that avoids 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.460
 that the chops are charcoal and you do not take 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.530
 a lot of time cooking them and in these 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.739
 gas grills make sure it's at 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.210
 high fire so they cook very 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.989
 quickly so it follows all the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.449
 juices inside and more importantly 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.220
 close the lid when closing the lid they go 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.829
 to cook the chops from all 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.769
 angles keeping the heat so that the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.070
 meat do not get hard this step should 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.300
 take about three to four minutes 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.160
 make sure the chops have a 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.229
 good bark on one side that goes to 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.250
 keep all the juices and flavors in the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.250
 interior of the chops 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.660
 after four minutes you're chops 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.210
 they should be ready to flip the and 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.550
 remember do not use a fork but a 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.350
 pincers it's not good to chop the meat and leave 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.479
 get out all those juices that you're 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.450
 trying to keep inside when 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.280
 you turn the chops closed again 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.890
 give him at least another four minutes 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.220
 for a medium term and six for a 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.400
 half cooked term after four 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.140
 minutes you're chops will be ready the 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.110
 way easier to know if the meat 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.000
 is ready is like a trick the chop 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.920
 it must have the same feeling as the 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.410
 base of the thumb for medium term 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.330
 so we're going to compare the feeling 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.119
 in the chop with the base of your finger 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.340
 fluffy thumb with bounce to term 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.000
 medium should be felt as the center of 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.000
 the palm of your hand 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.660
 cute red center 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.620
 so lamb chops are made 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.620
 advantage
