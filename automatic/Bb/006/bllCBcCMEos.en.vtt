is<00:02:00.099> really<00:02:00.340> badass<00:02:00.840> he<00:02:01.840> also<00:02:01.989> comes<00:02:02.319> with<00:02:02.470> this

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
is really badass he also comes with this

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.800 
is really badass he also comes with this
pistol<00:02:03.250> right<00:02:03.459> here<00:02:03.759> which<00:02:04.179> doesn't<00:02:04.509> have<00:02:04.630> any

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
pistol right here which doesn't have any

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.050 
pistol right here which doesn't have any
really<00:02:05.050> good<00:02:05.349> detail<00:02:05.619> as<00:02:06.160> far<00:02:06.429> as<00:02:06.550> paint<00:02:06.849> but

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
really good detail as far as paint but

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.550 
really good detail as far as paint but
it's<00:02:07.179> sculpted<00:02:07.630> very<00:02:07.810> nicely<00:02:08.020> pretty<00:02:08.410> much

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
it's sculpted very nicely pretty much

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.800 
it's sculpted very nicely pretty much
like<00:02:08.709> everything<00:02:09.069> else<00:02:09.190> on<00:02:09.340> this<00:02:09.429> figure<00:02:09.810> he

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
like everything else on this figure he

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.330 
like everything else on this figure he
comes<00:02:11.050> with<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.349> rifle<00:02:13.470> same<00:02:14.470> flat<00:02:14.800> gray<00:02:15.130> that

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
comes with a rifle same flat gray that

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.949 
comes with a rifle same flat gray that
I'm<00:02:15.489> not<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.700> big<00:02:15.849> fan<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.030> but<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.540> does<00:02:16.750> have

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
I'm not a big fan of but it does have

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.420 
I'm not a big fan of but it does have
like<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.170> silver<00:02:17.530> wash<00:02:17.860> right<00:02:18.099> here<00:02:18.250> on<00:02:18.340> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
like a silver wash right here on the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.800 
like a silver wash right here on the
butt<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.700> gun<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.360> think<00:02:19.480> that's<00:02:19.750> very

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
butt of the gun so I think that's very

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.320 
butt of the gun so I think that's very
cool<00:02:20.140> thing<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.130> dope<00:02:21.550> comes<00:02:22.180> with

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
cool thing that dope comes with

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.940 
cool thing that dope comes with
interchangeable<00:02:22.510> heads<00:02:23.020> his<00:02:23.290> helmet<00:02:23.800> also

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
interchangeable heads his helmet also

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.920 
interchangeable heads his helmet also
comes<00:02:24.370> off<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.849> think<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:25.239> is<00:02:25.390> really<00:02:25.599> nicely

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
comes off I think this is really nicely

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.809 
comes off I think this is really nicely
detailed<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.620> see<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.860> silver<00:02:27.069> strap<00:02:27.579> or

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
detailed to see the silver strap or

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.300 
detailed to see the silver strap or
silver<00:02:28.180> buckle<00:02:28.510> right<00:02:28.599> there<00:02:28.870> on<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.799> helmet

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
silver buckle right there on the helmet

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.950 
silver buckle right there on the helmet
I<00:02:30.340> think<00:02:30.670> that's<00:02:30.849> dope

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
I think that's dope

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.800 
I think that's dope
the<00:02:31.990> head<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.260> removable<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:34.270> this<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.630> one

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
the head is removable so this is the one

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.320 
the head is removable so this is the one
with<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.080> head<00:02:35.740> strap<00:02:36.130> thing<00:02:36.460> so<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.120> there's

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
with the head strap thing so and there's

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.930 
with the head strap thing so and there's
this<00:02:37.480> other<00:02:37.660> one<00:02:37.810> right<00:02:38.110> here<00:02:38.700> both<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.790> them

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
this other one right here both of them

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.670 
this other one right here both of them
are<00:02:40.030> pretty<00:02:40.180> cool<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.630> really<00:02:41.170> liked<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.410> flesh

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
are pretty cool I really liked the flesh

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.930 
are pretty cool I really liked the flesh
tone<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.070> they<00:02:42.160> did<00:02:42.310> for<00:02:42.490> this<00:02:42.580> figure

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
tone that they did for this figure

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.940 
tone that they did for this figure
compared<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.870> Tony<00:02:44.080> Stark<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.710> comes

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
compared to the Tony Stark that comes

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.070 
compared to the Tony Stark that comes
with<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.340> Iron<00:02:45.610> Man<00:02:45.730> 2-pack<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.570> I<00:02:46.810> just

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
with the Iron Man 2-pack and I just

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.140 
with the Iron Man 2-pack and I just
think<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.410> it's<00:02:48.220> very<00:02:48.670> slight<00:02:49.120> difference

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
think this it's very slight difference

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.230 
think this it's very slight difference
but<00:02:50.110> uh<00:02:50.170> uh<00:02:50.770> uh<00:02:51.190> what<00:02:51.640> do<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.790> get<00:02:51.880> this<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.210> a

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
but uh uh uh what do you get this is a

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.360 
but uh uh uh what do you get this is a
lot<00:02:52.480> more<00:02:52.630> plasticy<00:02:53.230> prototype<00:02:53.860> looking<00:02:54.190> and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
lot more plasticy prototype looking and

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.310 
lot more plasticy prototype looking and
this<00:02:54.490> one<00:02:54.700> looks<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.390> lot<00:02:55.570> better<00:02:55.720> now<00:02:56.050> like<00:02:56.170> the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
this one looks a lot better now like the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.600 
this one looks a lot better now like the
hair<00:02:56.530> detail<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.280> actually<00:02:57.550> the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
hair detail and this is actually the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.680 
hair detail and this is actually the
only<00:02:57.640> part<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.120> figure<00:02:58.240> that<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.450> think

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
only part of the figure that I think

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.960 
only part of the figure that I think
actually<00:02:58.990> has<00:02:59.140> paint<00:02:59.500> detail<00:02:59.890> very<00:03:00.640> hard<00:03:00.880> to

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
actually has paint detail very hard to

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.970 
actually has paint detail very hard to
pick<00:03:01.120> up<00:03:01.300> but<00:03:01.450> there<00:03:01.570> are<00:03:01.690> differences<00:03:02.170> in<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
pick up but there are differences in the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.970 
pick up but there are differences in the
blond<00:03:03.670> there<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:05.140> there's<00:03:05.290> darker<00:03:05.770> and

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
blond there so there's darker and

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.650 
blond there so there's darker and
lighter<00:03:06.010> colors<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.670> can<00:03:06.820> see<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.540> you

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
lighter colors you can see it and you

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.020 
lighter colors you can see it and you
can<00:03:07.870> see<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.490> mostly<00:03:09.490> have<00:03:09.670> them<00:03:09.790> displayed

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
can see it I mostly have them displayed

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.450 
can see it I mostly have them displayed
with<00:03:10.360> this<00:03:10.570> head<00:03:10.990> on<00:03:11.020> I<00:03:11.440> think<00:03:11.980> this<00:03:12.130> one<00:03:12.280> looks

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
with this head on I think this one looks

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.160 
with this head on I think this one looks
pretty<00:03:12.550> cool<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.090> someday<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.780> do<00:03:13.900> want<00:03:14.140> to

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
pretty cool and someday I do want to

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.590 
pretty cool and someday I do want to
make<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.350> custom<00:03:15.010> commander<00:03:15.940> Rogers<00:03:16.330> like<00:03:16.480> an

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
make a custom commander Rogers like an

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.530 
make a custom commander Rogers like an
iam<00:03:16.780> reg<00:03:16.990> did<00:03:17.260> with<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.560> head<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.910> that'd<00:03:19.510> be

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
iam reg did with this head so that'd be

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.680 
iam reg did with this head so that'd be
pretty<00:03:19.810> sweet<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:22.090> sculpt<00:03:22.450> on<00:03:22.540> this

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
pretty sweet and the the sculpt on this

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.060 
pretty sweet and the the sculpt on this
thing<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:23.050> just<00:03:23.230> really<00:03:23.500> really<00:03:23.620> amazing<00:03:23.920> my

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
thing is just really really amazing my

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.620 
thing is just really really amazing my
only<00:03:24.340> real<00:03:24.520> complaint<00:03:24.760> about<00:03:25.120> this<00:03:25.360> guy<00:03:25.570> is

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
only real complaint about this guy is

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.060 
only real complaint about this guy is
that<00:03:25.870> he<00:03:25.990> doesn't<00:03:26.140> have<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.500> paint<00:03:26.740> detail

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
that he doesn't have the paint detail

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
and like I've probably said already like

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.780 
and like I've probably said already like
three<00:03:28.690> times<00:03:28.990> but<00:03:29.740> it's<00:03:29.890> very<00:03:30.280> very<00:03:30.580> well

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
three times but it's very very well

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.670 
three times but it's very very well
sculpted<00:03:31.120> it's<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.570> brand<00:03:31.810> new<00:03:31.900> sculpt<00:03:32.530> and

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
sculpted it's a brand new sculpt and

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.140 
sculpted it's a brand new sculpt and
they<00:03:33.250> did<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.430> great<00:03:33.760> job

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
they did a great job
