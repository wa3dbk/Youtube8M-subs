00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
bunch of other projects have just been

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.360 
bunch of other projects have just been
waiting<00:00:11.550> for<00:00:11.940> some<00:00:12.660> final<00:00:13.110> touches<00:00:13.349> which<00:00:14.219> I

now this was a quick build

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.450 
now this was a quick build
especially<00:00:19.260> compared<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.859> Zeta<00:00:20.220> Gundam

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460

especially compared to the Zeta Gundam
the<00:00:20.990> Destiny<00:00:21.990> was<00:00:22.230> quick<00:00:22.820> straightforward

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the Destiny was quick straightforward

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.029 
the Destiny was quick straightforward
easy<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.510> put<00:00:24.630> together<00:00:24.720> not<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> lot<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.710> flaws

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039

easy to put together not a lot of flaws
in<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.400> actual<00:00:26.760> build<00:00:27.029> not<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> lot<00:00:27.840> of

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
in the actual build not a lot of

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.710 
in the actual build not a lot of
difficulties<00:00:28.560> now<00:00:29.400> what<00:00:29.609> I've<00:00:29.789> done<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.359> just

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
difficulties now what I've done is just

difficulties now what I've done is just
an<00:00:30.840> out-of-the-box<00:00:31.470> assembly<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.969> I've<00:00:33.270> done

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
an out-of-the-box assembly and I've done

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420 
an out-of-the-box assembly and I've done
a<00:00:33.450> little<00:00:33.540> bit<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.780> panel<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.200> mean<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.649> put<00:00:35.280> on

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
a little bit of panel I mean and put on

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.840 
a little bit of panel I mean and put on
almost<00:00:36.120> all<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:37.140> stickers<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.860> seals

almost all of the stickers and seals
that<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.050> get<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.610> with<00:00:41.610> one<00:00:41.640> major

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that you do get with it with one major

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.590 
that you do get with it with one major
exception<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.469> get<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> series<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.600> bright

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
exception you get a series of bright

exception you get a series of bright
shiny<00:00:46.520> silver<00:00:47.520> stickers<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.660> go<00:00:48.809> along<00:00:49.020> here

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
shiny silver stickers that go along here

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.700 
shiny silver stickers that go along here
they<00:00:50.370> don't<00:00:50.579> stay<00:00:50.789> down<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.350> Bandai<00:00:52.350> has<00:00:52.559> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
they don't stay down and Bandai has to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
they don't stay down and Bandai has to
know<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.860> stickers<00:00:53.579> seals<00:00:54.000> whatever<00:00:54.480> they

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
know that stickers seals whatever they

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.470 
know that stickers seals whatever they
don't<00:00:54.989> go<00:00:55.320> around<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> corners<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:57.390> not

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
don't go around the corners and it's not

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.389 
don't go around the corners and it's not
a<00:00:57.510> big<00:00:57.660> deal<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.899> mean<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.350> want<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:59.010> over

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
a big deal I mean if you want it's over

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.670 
a big deal I mean if you want it's over
super<00:00:59.760> easy<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.000> paint<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
super easy to paint but it's just one of

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.619 
super easy to paint but it's just one of
those<00:01:01.739> things<00:01:02.039> where<00:01:02.399> when<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:03.059> include

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
those things where when they include

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.509 
those things where when they include
something<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.290> I've<00:01:04.949> got<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.369> think

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
something like that I've got to think

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.090 
something like that I've got to think
you<00:01:05.729> know<00:01:06.140> what<00:01:07.140> are<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.350> thinking<00:01:07.770> Bandai

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
you know what are you thinking Bandai

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.690 
you know what are you thinking Bandai
because<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.520> doesn't<00:01:09.150> work<00:01:09.979> now<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.549> a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
because it doesn't work now that's a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.679 
because it doesn't work now that's a
very<00:01:12.000> minor<00:01:12.420> gripe<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:13.049> most<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.689> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
very minor gripe because most of the the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.179 
very minor gripe because most of the the
little<00:01:15.930> stickers<00:01:16.290> pick<00:01:16.530> out<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> details

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
little stickers pick out the details

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.690 
little stickers pick out the details
quite<00:01:17.580> nicely<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
quite nicely and I really do like the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.520 
quite nicely and I really do like the
look<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> Destiny<00:01:21.509> Gundam<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> most

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
look of the Destiny Gundam for the most

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.830 
look of the Destiny Gundam for the most
part<00:01:22.830> he<00:01:23.610> does<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:24.450> giant<00:01:25.350> clown<00:01:25.920> feet<00:01:26.840> which

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
part he does have giant clown feet which

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.880 
part he does have giant clown feet which
are<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.590> little<00:01:29.009> bit<00:01:29.189> off-putting<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:30.890> assume

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
are a little bit off-putting I assume

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.380 
are a little bit off-putting I assume
they<00:01:32.070> did<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.640> he<00:01:32.759> balances<00:01:33.240> up

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
they did that so that he balances up

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.240 
they did that so that he balances up
because<00:01:33.600> he's<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> really<00:01:34.259> back<00:01:34.590> heavy<00:01:34.860> unit

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
because he's a really back heavy unit

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.030 
because he's a really back heavy unit
however<00:01:36.079> once<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.229> got<00:01:37.409> him<00:01:37.530> up<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> stand

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
however once you got him up on a stand

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.649 
however once you got him up on a stand
it's<00:01:38.250> kind<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.759> moot<00:01:38.970> point

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
it's kind of a moot point

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.370 
it's kind of a moot point
so<00:01:39.810> that's<00:01:40.259> too<00:01:40.619> bad<00:01:41.810> if<00:01:42.810> that's<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
so that's too bad if that's just a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.560 
so that's too bad if that's just a
design<00:01:43.979> choice<00:01:44.430> then<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.060> strange<00:01:45.420> one

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
design choice then it's a strange one

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.289 
design choice then it's a strange one
because<00:01:45.869> they<00:01:46.020> really<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.649> stick<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.299> it's

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
because they really do stick out it's

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.590 
because they really do stick out it's
too<00:01:48.509> bad<00:01:48.860> now<00:01:49.860> with<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.460> aside<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> think<00:01:51.390> all

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
too bad now with that aside I think all

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.749 
too bad now with that aside I think all
the<00:01:51.810> other<00:01:51.840> proportions<00:01:52.500> are<00:01:52.799> really<00:01:53.549> nice

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
the other proportions are really nice

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.270 
the other proportions are really nice
and<00:01:54.149> if<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.259> camera<00:01:55.590> will<00:01:55.680> focus<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.250> think

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and if the camera will focus I think

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.450 
and if the camera will focus I think
