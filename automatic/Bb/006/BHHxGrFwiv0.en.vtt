sandy puts on Marathon and heads

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 
sandy puts on Marathon and heads
straight<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.720> green<00:01:21.990> car<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:23.130> his

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
straight to this green car and in his

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.950 
straight to this green car and in his
livestream<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.729> watched<00:01:24.030> him<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> lot<00:01:24.570> -<00:01:24.750> this

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
livestream I watched him do a lot - this

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.719 
livestream I watched him do a lot - this
seems<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.320> his<00:01:25.590> standard<00:01:26.070> opening<00:01:26.520> route

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
seems to be his standard opening route

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.090 
seems to be his standard opening route
and<00:01:26.970> he<00:01:27.509> uses<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:27.930> green<00:01:28.170> car<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.619> cover<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and he uses this green car for cover and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.520 
and he uses this green car for cover and
then<00:01:29.490> that's<00:01:29.700> sort<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.060> critical<00:01:30.570> thing<00:01:30.750> if

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
then that's sort of a critical thing if

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.740 
then that's sort of a critical thing if
you<00:01:32.430> don't<00:01:32.700> watch<00:01:32.880> him<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.210> lot<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.630> you

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
you don't watch him a lot or if you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.819 
you don't watch him a lot or if you
don't<00:01:33.930> watch<00:01:34.079> him<00:01:34.259> carefully

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
don't watch him carefully

is one of the nicer way nicer ways to

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.440 
is one of the nicer way nicer ways to
work<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.740> man<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.190> other<00:03:17.310> team<00:03:17.580> has<00:03:17.760> BC<00:03:18.209> and

top of the hill there the team had a

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.640 
top of the hill there the team had a
good<00:03:22.830> idea<00:03:23.220> but<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.930> know<00:03:25.050> look<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.410> guy's

good idea but you know look this guy's

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.010 
good idea but you know look this guy's
hard<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.010> spawn<00:03:26.220> trap<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.660> know<00:03:27.720> that's

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
hard to spawn trap and you know that's

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.370 
hard to spawn trap and you know that's
what<00:03:28.170> happens<00:03:28.500> when<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.709> try<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:28.980> trap<00:03:29.250> sandy

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
what happens when you try to trap sandy

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.470 
what happens when you try to trap sandy
so<00:03:31.380> on<00:03:31.620> again<00:03:32.250> he's<00:03:32.550> working<00:03:32.880> if<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.120> see<00:03:33.300> he

working his way from cover to cover and
let's<00:04:11.190> take<00:04:11.310> another<00:04:11.459> look<00:04:11.760> at<00:04:11.880> that

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
let's take another look at that

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.020 
let's take another look at that
so<00:04:13.800> Sandy's<00:04:14.160> trying<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.459> figure<00:04:14.670> out<00:04:14.730> where<00:04:14.910> to

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
so Sandy's trying to figure out where to

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.940 
so Sandy's trying to figure out where to
drop<00:04:15.180> his<00:04:15.360> airstrike<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:15.989> he<00:04:16.320> spots<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.739> kick

drop his airstrike and he spots the kick

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.140 
drop his airstrike and he spots the kick
the<00:04:17.070> other<00:04:17.190> team<00:04:17.400> has<00:04:17.549> an<00:04:17.669> enemy<00:04:17.790> care<00:04:18.120> package

the other team has an enemy care package
right<00:04:18.780> there<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.280> he<00:04:20.280> wisely<00:04:20.519> decides<00:04:20.970> to

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
right there and he wisely decides to

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.940 
right there and he wisely decides to

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
move the airstrike over to right on top

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.200 
move the airstrike over to right on top
of<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.160> care<00:04:23.340> package<00:04:23.669> because<00:04:23.880> those<00:04:24.030> things

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
of the care package because those things

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.240 
of the care package because those things
are<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.419> honeypot<00:04:24.720> at<00:04:25.289> least<00:04:25.620> one<00:04:25.890> guy<00:04:26.070> is<00:04:26.130> going

and oftentimes whole teams of people I
mean<00:04:30.510> this<00:04:30.600> is<00:04:30.750> ground<00:04:30.990> war<00:04:31.230> right<00:04:31.410> we<00:04:31.920> could

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
mean this is ground war right we could

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.830 
mean this is ground war right we could
have<00:04:32.220> three<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.760> four<00:04:33.030> people<00:04:33.390> rushing

you know if you're about to call in a
Harrier<00:04:37.560> then<00:04:38.070> it's<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.310> good<00:04:38.490> idea<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.880> drop<00:04:39.060> it

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
Harrier then it's a good idea to drop it

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.970 
Harrier then it's a good idea to drop it
there<00:04:39.420> it's<00:04:39.930> better<00:04:40.050> than<00:04:40.260> some<00:04:40.470> random<00:04:40.500> place

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
there it's better than some random place

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.800 
there it's better than some random place

going to be but the care package is a

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:55.070 
going to be but the care package is a
good<00:04:46.200> choice<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.620> proved

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.409 

so<00:04:55.860> he<00:04:56.009> gets<00:04:56.159> a<00:04:56.280> double<00:04:56.550> kill<00:04:56.729> and<00:04:57.000> on<00:04:57.090> top<00:04:57.270> of

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
so he gets a double kill and on top of

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.779 
so he gets a double kill and on top of
that<00:04:57.509> the<00:04:57.750> hitmarker<00:04:58.229> with<00:04:58.650> with<00:04:59.370> his<00:04:59.520> Harrier

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
that the hitmarker with with his Harrier

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.070 
that the hitmarker with with his Harrier
strike<00:05:00.030> which<00:05:00.210> isn't<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.479> greatest<00:05:00.750> you<00:05:01.020> know

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
strike which isn't the greatest you know

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.450 
strike which isn't the greatest you know
the<00:05:01.229> most<00:05:01.379> impressive<00:05:01.680> one<00:05:01.889> you'll<00:05:02.039> ever<00:05:02.129> see

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
the most impressive one you'll ever see

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.550 
the most impressive one you'll ever see
but<00:05:03.030> it<00:05:03.750> was<00:05:03.780> certainly<00:05:04.110> better<00:05:04.259> than<00:05:04.409> a

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
but it was certainly better than a

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.170 
but it was certainly better than a
random<00:05:04.740> pick<00:05:05.069> and<00:05:05.400> now<00:05:05.520> he<00:05:05.580> had<00:05:05.759> his<00:05:05.879> chopper

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
random pick and now he had his chopper

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.760 
random pick and now he had his chopper
gunner<00:05:06.360> so<00:05:06.569> he's<00:05:06.690> going<00:05:06.870> for<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.110> nuclear<00:05:07.590> and

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
gunner so he's going for a nuclear and

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.680 
gunner so he's going for a nuclear and
what<00:05:08.639> do<00:05:08.699> you<00:05:08.789> do<00:05:08.909> you<00:05:09.240> know<00:05:09.300> when<00:05:09.449> you<00:05:09.509> got

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
what do you do you know when you got

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.080 
what do you do you know when you got
this<00:05:09.810> thing<00:05:10.020> what<00:05:10.470> sandy<00:05:10.860> does<00:05:11.039> is<00:05:11.610> he<00:05:11.759> goes<00:05:11.940> to

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
this thing what sandy does is he goes to

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.029 
this thing what sandy does is he goes to
the<00:05:12.210> safest<00:05:12.629> area<00:05:12.960> of<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.229> man<00:05:13.379> can<00:05:13.590> possibly

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
the safest area of the man can possibly

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.119 
the safest area of the man can possibly
can<00:05:14.250> his<00:05:14.970> own<00:05:15.120> team<00:05:15.300> is<00:05:15.479> spawning<00:05:15.720> Charlie<00:05:16.199> so

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
can his own team is spawning Charlie so

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:18.619 
can his own team is spawning Charlie so
it's<00:05:17.280> really<00:05:17.490> unlikely<00:05:17.940> that<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.270> other<00:05:18.419> team

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:18.629 
it's really unlikely that the other team

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.200 
it's really unlikely that the other team
is<00:05:18.750> going<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:18.930> come<00:05:18.990> back<00:05:19.259> here<00:05:19.560> and<00:05:20.060> he<00:05:21.060> goes

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
is going to come back here and he goes

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.600 
is going to come back here and he goes
into<00:05:21.449> the<00:05:21.539> chopper<00:05:21.840> gunner<00:05:22.099> so<00:05:23.099> this<00:05:23.340> footage

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
into the chopper gunner so this footage

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.899 
into the chopper gunner so this footage
is<00:05:23.729> sped<00:05:23.970> up<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.240> some<00:05:24.419> extent<00:05:24.449> but<00:05:25.409> I<00:05:26.009> watched

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
is sped up to some extent but I watched

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.490 
is sped up to some extent but I watched
him<00:05:27.090> when<00:05:27.449> we<00:05:27.599> used<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:27.840> chopper<00:05:28.139> gunner<00:05:28.319> and

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
him when we used the chopper gunner and

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.469 
him when we used the chopper gunner and
he<00:05:28.560> uses<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.889> a<00:05:29.069> lot<00:05:29.099> like<00:05:29.400> he<00:05:29.520> does<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:29.819> ac-130

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
he uses it a lot like he does the ac-130

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.080 
he uses it a lot like he does the ac-130
he<00:05:30.690> tries<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:31.080> locate<00:05:31.409> the<00:05:31.560> enemy<00:05:31.680> spawn<00:05:32.129> get

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
he tries to locate the enemy spawn get

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.969 
he tries to locate the enemy spawn get
some<00:05:33.300> kills<00:05:33.539> and<00:05:33.840> then<00:05:34.139> kill<00:05:34.379> them<00:05:34.560> right<00:05:34.590> as

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
some kills and then kill them right as

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.649 
some kills and then kill them right as
they<00:05:35.159> respawn<00:05:35.490> so<00:05:36.000> that<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.270> key<00:05:36.449> thing<00:05:36.629> about

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
they respawn so that the key thing about

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.050 
they respawn so that the key thing about
killing<00:05:37.050> them<00:05:37.319> as<00:05:37.500> they<00:05:37.680> spawn<00:05:37.919> is<00:05:38.219> twofold

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
killing them as they spawn is twofold

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.920 
killing them as they spawn is twofold
one<00:05:39.300> you<00:05:39.930> get<00:05:40.080> a<00:05:40.110> nice<00:05:40.770> lump<00:05:41.129> of<00:05:41.340> people<00:05:41.669> and<00:05:42.539> to

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
one you get a nice lump of people and to

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.990 
one you get a nice lump of people and to
the<00:05:43.500> people<00:05:43.650> that<00:05:43.830> have<00:05:44.069> just<00:05:44.310> respawned<00:05:44.729> are

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
the people that have just respawned are

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.550 
the people that have just respawned are
the<00:05:45.270> ones<00:05:45.449> most<00:05:45.659> likely<00:05:45.840> to<00:05:46.139> have<00:05:46.409> their

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
the ones most likely to have their

I hate to bring up this whole xbox ps3

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.869 
I hate to bring up this whole xbox ps3
thing<00:05:51.330> but<00:05:51.900> Xbox<00:05:52.319> players<00:05:52.590> are<00:05:52.860> super<00:05:53.370> fast<00:05:53.580> to

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:53.879 
thing but Xbox players are super fast to

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:57.619 
thing but Xbox players are super fast to
respawn<00:05:54.449> with<00:05:54.750> their<00:05:54.960> stingers<00:05:55.349> and<00:05:56.479> you<00:05:57.479> have

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:57.629 
respawn with their stingers and you have

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:58.939 
respawn with their stingers and you have
to<00:05:57.750> be<00:05:57.870> aware<00:05:58.080> of<00:05:58.139> that<00:05:58.289> if<00:05:58.440> someone<00:05:58.710> recently

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
to be aware of that if someone recently

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.100 
to be aware of that if someone recently

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
spawn while there's air power up there's

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.779 
spawn while there's air power up there's
a<00:06:01.199> really<00:06:01.590> good<00:06:01.710> chance<00:06:01.770> that<00:06:02.310> they<00:06:02.460> respawn

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
a really good chance that they respawn

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.959 
a really good chance that they respawn
with<00:06:03.180> a<00:06:03.210> stinger<00:06:03.599> in<00:06:03.719> their<00:06:03.840> hand<00:06:04.050> and<00:06:04.969> you

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.120 
know he has that in mind and working the
kill<00:06:07.919> so<00:06:08.550> now<00:06:08.669> he<00:06:08.729> has<00:06:08.849> a<00:06:08.909> nuke<00:06:09.120> and<00:06:09.860> he's<00:06:10.860> got

happens to the to the best of them
that's<00:06:23.310> just<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.550> way<00:06:23.699> it<00:06:23.819> is

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
that's just the way it is
