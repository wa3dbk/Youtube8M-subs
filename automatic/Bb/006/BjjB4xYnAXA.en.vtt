 what a mess you have made with your 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.370
 own emotions so all stirred up not 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.879
 do they work 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.730
 look you would have to separate them and place 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.030
 each of them vote them if you want 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.969
 I will help you 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.510
 let's start with joy shines like the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.899
 sun when you're happy laughs jump 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.610
 you dance you play and you want to share your 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:03.050
 Joy with everyone else 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.870
 instead the sadness is soft 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.930
 like the rainy days when you're 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:14.290
 sad you hide and want to be alone 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.290
 and you do not feel like doing anything at all 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.940
 this is the radio 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.890
 that burns hard and is difficult and turn off 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.860
 when you are angry you want to download 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.690
 the anger in others but that's never 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:36.080
 sleep and fear is fear coward 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.170
 hides and united very fast when you feel 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.420
 fear you become small and little thing and 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.600
 you think you can not do what you do 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.600
 asks 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.460
 instead the calm is calm as the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.810
 trees light as a leaf in the wind 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.650
 when you are calm 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.490
 you breathe little by little and deeply you 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.490
 you feel at peace 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.250
 pepe these are your emotions 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.070
 each one has a different color and 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.610
 tidy they work much better you see that 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.470
 all are well in place so 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.440
 you'll have it much clearer if you know 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.950
 identify each one of your emotions 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.950
 but and now if you can know what's wrong with you
