three es some of the environments are

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.980 
three es some of the environments are
ugly<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.520> hell<00:01:32.730> but<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.210> most<00:01:33.420> part<00:01:33.540> it

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990

looks<00:01:34.470> pretty<00:01:34.740> good<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.550> art<00:01:35.790> design<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.330> also

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
looks pretty good the art design is also

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:47.060 
looks pretty good the art design is also
wonderful<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.350> that's<00:01:37.470> always<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.800> plus

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.160 

gameplay-wise<00:01:48.070> it's<00:01:48.790> very<00:01:49.030> mixed<00:01:49.450> for<00:01:49.570> me<00:01:49.690> to

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
gameplay-wise it's very mixed for me to

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.200 
gameplay-wise it's very mixed for me to
fun<00:01:50.500> idea<00:01:50.830> is<00:01:50.920> halted<00:01:51.430> by<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.580> control<00:01:52.030> scheme

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.120 
fun idea is halted by the control scheme
that<00:01:52.540> I<00:01:52.600> really<00:01:53.140> just<00:01:53.320> can't<00:01:53.560> get<00:01:53.740> used<00:01:53.800> to

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
that I really just can't get used to

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.730 
that I really just can't get used to
even<00:01:54.550> after<00:01:54.880> hours<00:01:55.270> of<00:01:55.450> play<00:01:55.660> first<00:01:56.530> let's

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.960 
even after hours of play first let's
talk<00:01:56.950> about<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.280> better<00:01:57.430> portion<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.910> the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
game and also the better control portion

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.670 
game and also the better control portion
the<00:02:00.220> fly<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:01.120> flying<00:02:01.390> portions<00:02:01.930> are<00:02:02.080> on<00:02:02.410> rail

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
but it works well enough with the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.910 
but it works well enough with the
control<00:02:04.600> scheme<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:05.020> will<00:02:05.140> fly<00:02:05.380> around<00:02:05.560> the

really seem to pick up on the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.190 
really seem to pick up on the
touchscreen<00:02:22.210> so<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.660> have<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.080> use<00:02:23.170> that

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
touchscreen so you have to use that
