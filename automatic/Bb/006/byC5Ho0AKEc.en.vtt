00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.900
 hello combis, well, let's go with the 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:12.340
 today's last review of tobacco and is 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:16.059
 very corresponds to the Presbyterian 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.450
 the presbytery in mixture of william p 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.450
 solomon 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 produced by plant 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.250
 and good to say it is an English mix 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.250
 of virginia and orientals 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.970
 according to the brand with a small amount 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.400
 from latakia 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.670
 a work with little nicotine 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.519
 and 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.519
 well we would say that it is of medium strength 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:57.440
 many people are in doubt with each other 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:59.780
 in considering it an attack ado 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.570
 or an oriental with latakia me 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.120
 I do not particularly consider it a 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.380
 example 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.510
 almost the most the maximum expression of a 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.210
 oriental mix 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.340
 for the amount of orientals that 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.340
 contains and by the quality of them 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.420
 remember a lot when reading reads when reading 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.049
 anfield morning pipe 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.220
 but maybe this one has a tone 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.090
 we could say more mysterious 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.730
 I find it like that 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.910
 good 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.520
 or discussion about whether or not it was wearing 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.440
 I carried latakia to the house that 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:53.100
 clear mark that yes wearing latakia 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:57.490
 in small quantity and that was Syrian 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.490
 I particularly do not think that 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.520
 and that leads to latakia but a minimum 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.110
 amount rather like to round the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.190
 mixture 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.200
 but in no time at any time 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.790
 dominate 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:20.319
 latakia and I say if you have a 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.379
 very small amount and in fact there 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.580
 Sometimes good depends the pinches 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:30.750
 that you take to load the bowl 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.750
 it's practically that you notice me 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.270
 good about cold smell 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.450
 good come evra in ribbon 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.980
 and well they distinguish themselves quite well 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.140
 the different the different tobaccos 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.790
 the brown sugar mill and then by the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.790
 orientals a little darker 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.080
 good 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.170
 some in particular because black 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.740
 in different color ranges some 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:09.350
 leaves of a greenish brown color 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.350
 where you see a different amount of 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.330
 of virginia and orientals 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.470
 of humidity is good 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.970
 and regarding cold oil 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.300
 Well, we'll say it could be a 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.300
 mixture 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.620
 well as of 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.620
 wet leather 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:46.290
 very very ripe fruit to the point 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.290
 that almost looks like last fruit 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.310
 has a very very distant vinegar souvenir 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.470
 is at least what I take out 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.470
 and good 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.150
 It is a complex smoke to provide 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.030
 a smoke 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:17.200
 at the same time intense complex 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:20.980
 to form it at the end of the day 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.570
 with all things already finished or as 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.610
 minimum 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.960
 I have also trained him at 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:32.320
 noon but at least very quiet 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.570
 a very relaxed slow 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.770
 to extract could we say between 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.770
 quotes all the juice of 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:45.719
 of what it contains because of what 

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:48.240
 otherwise we become a tobacco if the 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:50.600
 we are fast in this tobacco in 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.240
 particular is very noticeable 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.390
 if I put it fast it becomes 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.970
 completely flat and we can not 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:04.000
 unfold all the nuances and all the 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.000
 flavors or to be able to appreciate it the aromas 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.850
 for me in particular it's a very tobacco 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.850
 mysterious does not have 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.840
 at the time of smoking has some shades 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.840
 subtle as incense 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.880
 putting in the poetic we could say 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.140
 what's wrong with it 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.140
 and a few touches 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.990
 a few rancid touches 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.230
 like those of the sacred christmas 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.230
 Saint oil 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:49.270
 have that memory, however, they are 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.920
 nice rancid touches has a flavor 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.000
 old 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.000
 to old books 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:02.360
 and we could even say stays of 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:06.280
 century-old wood 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.280
 this was the first mix that 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:12.080
 that I asked outside of Spain- of this 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:17.199
 very heavy style of orientals 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.199
 and the first time I smoked it 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:23.279
 transported me to the 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:25.649
 I was smoking it I closed my eyes and I 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:27.260
 transported to the same name abbey 

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:29.650
 of the rose ' 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.850
 and we could say that it was something like 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.820
 like when baskerville william 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:40.400
 discover the hidden library of the 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:41.600
 bay and as you start to walk by 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.460
 she realizes all the 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.150
 instances that there must be and all 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.590
 the books that there must be and says 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.960
 how many rooms plus how many more books 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.090
 Well, something like that was what I 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.420
 never happened so much until then there was 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:07:00.740
 tried a mixture of this style and the 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:03.249
 true that I keep that memory and already 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:08.669
 it is where I am transferred 

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:08.669
 as I say a very mysterious mixture 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:16.810
 and good and the only thing I do not like is 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:19.180
 which is that although it comes from humidity 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.800
 right and it comes without problems 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.400
 when you open lara is well wrapped in 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.530
 a plastic in a plastic plus a 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.330
 open plastic without any kind of 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.490
 enclosure 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:34.860
 I do not think it's the best of the 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:37.790
 ways to contain a tobacco but good 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:40.670
 I have no problems with him 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.920
 but but I do not like you to come and 

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:46.730
 content and well then ultimately 

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:50.650
 this is the presbyterian review I think 

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.650
 that a tobacco 

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.530
 summit in his style 

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:01.500
 Well, thank you very much for watching and a 

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.500
 I hope you like me silva
