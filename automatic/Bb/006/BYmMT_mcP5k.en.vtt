00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
it something like upper overcoat project

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.789 
it something like upper overcoat project
so<00:02:38.879> that<00:02:38.909> I'll<00:02:39.120> remember<00:02:39.299> which<00:02:39.750> base<00:02:40.049> I<00:02:40.349> based

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
so that I'll remember which base I based

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.699 
so that I'll remember which base I based
it<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:43.790> I'll<00:02:44.790> now<00:02:45.060> save<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.690> opacity<00:02:46.079> as<00:02:46.650> a

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
it on I'll now save the opacity as a

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.840 
it on I'll now save the opacity as a
JPEG

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.760 

and<00:02:54.390> now<00:02:54.480> we'll<00:02:54.660> go<00:02:54.810> ahead<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.080> open<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.560> bike

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
and now we'll go ahead and open a bike

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.640 
and now we'll go ahead and open a bike
loan<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.870> we'll<00:02:58.020> load<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.290> opacity<00:02:58.770> map<00:03:00.650> now

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
loan and we'll load the opacity map now

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.260 
loan and we'll load the opacity map now
we<00:03:01.680> have<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.980> good<00:03:02.160> feel<00:03:02.400> for<00:03:02.640> what<00:03:02.700> our<00:03:02.910> outfits

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
we have a good feel for what our outfits

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.520 
we have a good feel for what our outfits
going<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.540> look<00:03:03.690> like

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.870 

so<00:03:08.530> I've<00:03:08.650> gone<00:03:08.860> ahead<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.190> combined<00:03:09.670> the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
so I've gone ahead and combined the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.510 
so I've gone ahead and combined the
layers<00:03:10.090> for<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.540> outer<00:03:10.690> shirt<00:03:11.080> has<00:03:11.980> one<00:03:12.280> layer

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
layers for the outer shirt has one layer

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.270 
layers for the outer shirt has one layer
and<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:13.120> inner<00:03:13.270> shirt<00:03:13.540> as<00:03:13.750> another<00:03:13.780> layer<00:03:14.280> so

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
and the inner shirt as another layer so

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.010 
and the inner shirt as another layer so
starting<00:03:15.580> with<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.850> outer<00:03:16.000> shirt<00:03:16.360> I'm<00:03:16.720> going

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
starting with the outer shirt I'm going

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.290 
starting with the outer shirt I'm going
to<00:03:17.200> just<00:03:17.440> use<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.800> magic<00:03:18.160> wand<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.730> highlight

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
to just use the magic wand and highlight

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.440 
to just use the magic wand and highlight
the<00:03:19.830> different<00:03:20.830> elements<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.940> then<00:03:22.360> we're

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
the different elements and then we're

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:32.340 
the different elements and then we're
going<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.630> fill<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:22.960> with<00:03:23.080> a<00:03:23.110> pattern

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.290 

I'm<00:03:32.800> going<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.040> do<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.280> same<00:03:33.490> thing<00:03:33.760> now<00:03:33.940> for

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
I'm going to do the same thing now for

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:47.940 
I'm going to do the same thing now for
the<00:03:34.390> inner<00:03:34.540> shirt

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.339 

so<00:03:48.670> we'll<00:03:48.819> go<00:03:48.970> ahead<00:03:49.120> now<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.450> save<00:03:49.870> this<00:03:50.110> as

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
so we'll go ahead now and save this as

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.660 
so we'll go ahead now and save this as
our<00:03:50.470> diffuse<00:03:50.860> map

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:02.660 

as<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.209> jpeg

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.070 

and<00:04:03.670> then<00:04:03.790> we'll<00:04:03.910> go<00:04:04.030> back<00:04:04.239> in<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:04.599> Cologne<00:04:04.900> now

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
and then we'll go back in I Cologne now

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:12.360 
and then we'll go back in I Cologne now
and<00:04:05.290> we'll<00:04:05.410> apply<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.739> diffuse<00:04:06.190> map

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.339 

so<00:04:12.940> that<00:04:13.090> looks<00:04:13.269> pretty<00:04:13.360> good<00:04:13.720> but<00:04:13.780> let's<00:04:14.080> give

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
so that looks pretty good but let's give

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:20.009 
so that looks pretty good but let's give
it<00:04:14.379> a<00:04:14.500> little<00:04:14.650> more<00:04:14.769> detail<00:04:18.690> I'm<00:04:19.690> just<00:04:19.810> going

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
it a little more detail I'm just going

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.569 
it a little more detail I'm just going
to<00:04:20.079> cut<00:04:20.229> out<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.350> shape<00:04:20.470> now<00:04:20.919> that<00:04:21.250> would<00:04:21.400> be

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
to cut out a shape now that would be

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.700 
to cut out a shape now that would be
where<00:04:21.790> the<00:04:21.970> buttons<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:22.900> center<00:04:23.440> seam

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
where the buttons and the center seam

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:34.970 
where the buttons and the center seam
would<00:04:23.919> be<00:04:25.080> I'm<00:04:26.080> just<00:04:26.260> doing<00:04:26.470> this<00:04:26.620> really<00:04:26.949> fast

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.820 

and<00:04:35.460> once<00:04:35.670> again<00:04:35.790> I'm<00:04:36.060> using<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.570> lasso<00:04:37.020> tool

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.440 

and<00:04:41.400> then<00:04:41.490> I'm<00:04:41.580> going<00:04:41.730> to<00:04:41.760> add<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:42.210> same

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
and then I'm going to add the same

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.500 
and then I'm going to add the same
pattern<00:04:42.960> as<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.260> shirt<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:48.210> i'm<00:04:48.270> going<00:04:48.450> to

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
pattern as the shirt so i'm going to

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.150 
pattern as the shirt so i'm going to
double-click<00:04:48.840> now<00:04:49.200> on<00:04:49.410> that<00:04:49.560> layer<00:04:49.800> that<00:04:50.100> i

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
double-click now on that layer that i

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.920 
double-click now on that layer that i
just<00:04:50.490> cut<00:04:50.700> out

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.600 

I'm<00:04:57.590> going<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:57.800> add<00:04:57.919> a<00:04:57.949> drop<00:04:58.280> shadow<00:05:00.490> so<00:05:01.490> I'm

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
I'm going to add a drop shadow so I'm

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.129 
I'm going to add a drop shadow so I'm
going<00:05:01.759> to<00:05:01.789> save<00:05:02.030> this<00:05:02.210> diffuse<00:05:02.600> map<00:05:02.810> and<00:05:03.080> go

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
going to save this diffuse map and go

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:17.399 
going to save this diffuse map and go
back<00:05:03.350> into<00:05:03.380> iclone<00:05:04.009> to<00:05:04.190> see<00:05:04.340> how<00:05:04.460> it's<00:05:04.669> looking

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.760 

so<00:05:18.409> the<00:05:18.529> drop<00:05:18.709> shadow<00:05:19.009> is<00:05:19.309> a<00:05:19.339> bit<00:05:19.610> harsh<00:05:20.770> so

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
so the drop shadow is a bit harsh so

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.309 
so the drop shadow is a bit harsh so
back<00:05:21.949> in<00:05:22.099> photoshop<00:05:22.639> i<00:05:22.909> softened<00:05:23.899> it<00:05:24.080> and

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 
back in photoshop i softened it and

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.249 
back in photoshop i softened it and
added<00:05:24.649> some<00:05:24.679> buttons<00:05:25.159> I<00:05:25.569> also<00:05:26.569> added<00:05:26.869> a<00:05:27.050> bump

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259 
added some buttons I also added a bump

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.709 
added some buttons I also added a bump
map<00:05:27.439> and<00:05:27.709> a<00:05:27.770> blend<00:05:28.009> map<00:05:28.279> from<00:05:29.029> the<00:05:29.089> library

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 
map and a blend map from the library

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:31.239 
map and a blend map from the library
that<00:05:29.929> real<00:05:30.139> illusion<00:05:30.379> supplies<00:05:30.919> with<00:05:31.159> the

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:31.249 
that real illusion supplies with the

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:34.659 
that real illusion supplies with the
program<00:05:32.649> earlier<00:05:33.649> I<00:05:33.800> repeated<00:05:34.429> the<00:05:34.520> same

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
program earlier I repeated the same

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.659 
program earlier I repeated the same
steps<00:05:35.029> for<00:05:35.149> the<00:05:35.389> lower<00:05:35.599> and<00:05:36.129> I<00:05:37.129> filled<00:05:37.429> it<00:05:37.639> with

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
steps for the lower and I filled it with

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.959 
steps for the lower and I filled it with
the<00:05:37.909> same<00:05:38.089> pattern<00:05:38.569> as<00:05:38.719> the<00:05:38.779> shirt<00:05:39.169> I<00:05:39.969> also

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:40.969 
the same pattern as the shirt I also

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.359 
the same pattern as the shirt I also
exported<00:05:41.809> the<00:05:41.959> texture<00:05:42.349> map<00:05:42.529> for<00:05:43.009> one<00:05:43.189> of<00:05:43.279> the

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:43.369 
exported the texture map for one of the

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:45.850 
exported the texture map for one of the
other<00:05:43.490> pairs<00:05:43.819> of<00:05:43.999> fit<00:05:44.149> jeans<00:05:44.479> and<00:05:44.839> I'm<00:05:45.619> using

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
other pairs of fit jeans and I'm using

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.749 
other pairs of fit jeans and I'm using
that<00:05:46.039> for<00:05:46.369> a<00:05:46.399> bump<00:05:46.639> map<00:05:46.849> to<00:05:47.179> add<00:05:47.300> some<00:05:47.569> wrinkle

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
that for a bump map to add some wrinkle

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.129 
that for a bump map to add some wrinkle
additionally<00:05:49.759> i'll<00:05:49.909> add<00:05:50.119> a<00:05:50.149> blend<00:05:50.509> like<00:05:50.839> i<00:05:50.959> did
