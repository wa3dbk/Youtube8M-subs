this<00:00:27.720> morning<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.199> want<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> talk<00:00:28.560> about

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
this morning I want to talk about

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.200 
this morning I want to talk about
something<00:00:28.949> slightly<00:00:29.310> different<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.179> think

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
something slightly different and I think

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.550 
something slightly different and I think
it's<00:00:30.480> an<00:00:30.570> important<00:00:30.990> point<00:00:31.140> though<00:00:31.380> because

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
it's an important point though because

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.740 
it's an important point though because
it<00:00:31.800> does<00:00:31.980> tie<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.730> bit<00:00:32.880> too<00:00:33.120> when<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.360> talk<00:00:33.600> to

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
it does tie in a bit too when I talk to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.340 
it does tie in a bit too when I talk to
you<00:00:33.899> guys<00:00:33.930> about<00:00:34.790> your<00:00:35.790> mentality<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.899> lot

work<00:05:02.030> like<00:05:02.210> with<00:05:02.450> children<00:05:02.840> or<00:05:02.870> you<00:05:03.140> can<00:05:03.290> just

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
work like with children or you can just

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.690 
work like with children or you can just
beat<00:05:03.590> them<00:05:03.740> down<00:05:03.890> and<00:05:04.160> da<00:05:04.310> bless<00:05:04.550> is

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
beat them down and da bless is

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.750

established<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:05.360> they<00:05:05.480> quit<00:05:06.190> so<00:05:07.190> it's<00:05:07.520> just

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
established and they quit so it's just

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.070 
established and they quit so it's just
there's<00:05:07.940> an<00:05:08.060> age<00:05:08.240> gap<00:05:08.480> difference<00:05:08.900> and<00:05:09.020> I

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
there's an age gap difference and I

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.660 
there's an age gap difference and I
think<00:05:09.290> it's<00:05:09.470> a<00:05:09.560> lot<00:05:09.800> of<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.980> younger<00:05:10.190> guys<00:05:10.310> in

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
think it's a lot of the younger guys in

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.760 
think it's a lot of the younger guys in
the<00:05:10.760> fitness<00:05:10.940> world<00:05:11.120> are<00:05:11.450> not<00:05:11.840> at<00:05:12.110> that<00:05:12.260> age<00:05:12.440> of
