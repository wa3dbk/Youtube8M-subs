 general it is 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.530
 it's stories that happened to me 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.430
 most of the time or so these are 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.560
 completely out of context illustrations 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.910
 just like that and sometimes I also speak 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.530

 will start with the gloves yes good 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.840
 that's when we were at my mother's and my 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.820
 given not long ago and they are 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.230
 old enough and if you ask the question 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.470
 where they are a real animal one so 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.540

 and his double self-dubbed to a super 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.790
 quality and what's great is that 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.100
 as in my family we have all 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.070

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.370
 impregnating serigraphy then we pass 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.360
 at the bottom then the shirt which is so a 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.880
 man's shirt completely covers 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:14.200
