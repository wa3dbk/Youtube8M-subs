so<00:00:10.210> far<00:00:10.450> we<00:00:10.600> have<00:00:10.720> seen<00:00:10.930> what<00:00:11.170> our<00:00:11.320> simple<00:00:11.710> and

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
so far we have seen what our simple and

let<00:00:55.690> us<00:00:55.719> see<00:00:55.960> how<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.200> two<00:00:56.500> more<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.660> here<00:00:58.870> you

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
let us see how the two more so here you

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.400 
let us see how the two more so here you
can<00:00:59.110> see<00:00:59.320> as<00:00:59.530> the<00:01:00.520> worm<00:01:00.760> rotates<00:01:01.270> then<00:01:01.899> every

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
can see as the worm rotates then every

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.510 
can see as the worm rotates then every
rotation<00:01:03.070> of<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.550> one<00:01:04.140> pushes<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.920> spur<00:01:06.220> gear

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
rotation of the one pushes the spur gear

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.380 
rotation of the one pushes the spur gear
or<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.759> worm<00:01:07.060> wheel<00:01:07.240> by<00:01:07.690> one<00:01:07.990> tooth<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.280> if<00:01:09.759> the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
or the worm wheel by one tooth so if the

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.250 
or the worm wheel by one tooth so if the
worm<00:01:10.630> feed<00:01:10.869> has<00:01:11.140> 32<00:01:11.979> teeth<00:01:12.300> then<00:01:13.300> for<00:01:13.750> all<00:01:13.990> of

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
worm feed has 32 teeth then for all of

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.230 
worm feed has 32 teeth then for all of
them<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.770> advance<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.520> complete<00:01:16.000> one

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
them to advance and complete one

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.649 
them to advance and complete one
rotation<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.680> worm<00:01:17.950> will<00:01:18.159> have<00:01:18.369> to<00:01:18.549> rotate<00:01:18.729> 32

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
rotation the worm will have to rotate 32

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.980 
rotation the worm will have to rotate 32
times<00:01:20.049> so<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:21.010> gear<00:01:21.280> reduction<00:01:21.760> here<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.210> one

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
times so the gear reduction here is one

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.580 
times so the gear reduction here is one
is<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:23.530> 32<00:01:24.250> which<00:01:25.119> is<00:01:25.150> a<00:01:25.479> very<00:01:25.750> large<00:01:25.990> reduction

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
is to 32 which is a very large reduction

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.429 
is to 32 which is a very large reduction
not<00:01:26.979> possible<00:01:27.549> by<00:01:27.880> using<00:01:28.030> simple<00:01:28.450> spur<00:01:29.140> gears

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
not possible by using simple spur gears

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.230 
not possible by using simple spur gears
let<00:01:30.040> us<00:01:30.159> now<00:01:30.310> look<00:01:30.490> at<00:01:30.640> some<00:01:30.700> of<00:01:31.090> the

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
let us now look at some of the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.580 
let us now look at some of the
variations<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:31.869> are<00:01:32.020> made<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.470> this

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
variations that are made to this

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.090 
variations that are made to this
arrangement<00:01:32.890> in<00:01:33.280> practice<00:01:34.150> so<00:01:34.810> here<00:01:35.439> is<00:01:35.619> the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
arrangement in practice so here is the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.120 
arrangement in practice so here is the
first<00:01:36.340> variation<00:01:37.000> where<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.840> one<00:01:38.080> has<00:01:38.770> not

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
first variation where the one has not

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.910 
first variation where the one has not
one<00:01:39.610> but<00:01:39.880> three<00:01:40.689> threads<00:01:41.020> in<00:01:41.229> general<00:01:41.680> such

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
one but three threads in general such

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.399 
one but three threads in general such
worms<00:01:42.460> are<00:01:42.700> called<00:01:42.939> multi<00:01:43.420> start<00:01:43.780> worms<00:01:44.110> here

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
worms are called multi start worms here

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.320 
worms are called multi start worms here
we<00:01:44.530> have<00:01:44.619> three<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:45.460> called<00:01:45.670> three

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
we have three so it is called three

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.410 
we have three so it is called three

all these Hollis's are identical so they

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:53.880 
all these Hollis's are identical so they

are just copies of each other
rotated<00:01:54.400> by<00:01:54.549> 120<00:01:55.030> so<00:01:55.360> they<00:01:55.509> don't<00:01:55.689> intersect

it's<00:02:18.799> between<00:02:19.189> the<00:02:19.819> worm<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.360> worm<00:02:20.390> wheel<00:02:21.019> and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
it's between the worm and worm wheel and

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.319 
it's between the worm and worm wheel and
increasing<00:02:22.310> number<00:02:22.579> of<00:02:22.610> contacts<00:02:23.180> will

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
increasing number of contacts will

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.319 
increasing number of contacts will
increase<00:02:23.629> contact<00:02:24.200> area<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:26.120> would

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
increase contact area and that would

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.100 
increase contact area and that would
allow<00:02:26.840> us<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:27.200> carry<00:02:27.409> greater<00:02:28.010> loads<00:02:28.959> here<00:02:29.959> is

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
allow us to carry greater loads here is

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.080 
allow us to carry greater loads here is
another<00:02:30.409> variation<00:02:30.799> done<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.879> same

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
another variation done to the same

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.539 
another variation done to the same
purpose<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.829> increase<00:02:33.829> the<00:02:34.040> load<00:02:34.220> carrying

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
purpose to increase the load carrying

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.720 
purpose to increase the load carrying
capacity<00:02:34.700> over<00:02:35.420> here<00:02:36.379> you<00:02:36.829> will<00:02:36.950> see<00:02:37.159> the<00:02:37.489> worm

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
capacity over here you will see the worm

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.270 
capacity over here you will see the worm
wheel<00:02:38.030> is<00:02:38.620> having<00:02:39.620> its<00:02:39.920> very<00:02:40.250> very<00:02:40.549> cut<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.659> a

called as an hourglass and because of

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.309 
called as an hourglass and because of
this<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:49.010> contact<00:02:49.459> area<00:02:49.700> between<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:51.079> worm

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
this the contact area between the worm

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.490 
this the contact area between the worm
and<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.590> worm<00:02:52.489> wheel<00:02:52.730> can<00:02:53.000> be<00:02:53.030> stepped<00:02:53.659> up<00:02:53.870> so

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
and the worm wheel can be stepped up so

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.680 
and the worm wheel can be stepped up so
let<00:02:54.709> us<00:02:54.739> look<00:02:54.980> at<00:02:55.159> this<00:02:56.030> arrangement<00:02:56.599> in

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
let us look at this arrangement in

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.800 
let us look at this arrangement in
cross-section<00:02:56.989> over<00:02:57.590> here<00:02:57.970> so<00:02:58.970> on<00:02:59.359> the<00:02:59.420> left

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
cross-section over here so on the left

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.990 
cross-section over here so on the left
you<00:03:00.260> see<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.739> cross<00:03:01.220> sectional<00:03:01.519> ordinary

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
you see a cross sectional ordinary

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.610 
you see a cross sectional ordinary
arrangement<00:03:02.420> right<00:03:02.690> here<00:03:02.989> it<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.319> the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
arrangement right here it is the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.740 
arrangement right here it is the
hourglass<00:03:04.220> arrangement<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.849> you<00:03:04.879> see<00:03:05.510> there

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
hourglass arrangement and you see there

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.660 
hourglass arrangement and you see there
is<00:03:05.870> some<00:03:06.139> additional<00:03:06.859> contact<00:03:07.370> area

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
is some additional contact area

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.789 
is some additional contact area
therefore<00:03:08.450> allowing<00:03:08.989> us<00:03:09.139> some<00:03:09.530> additional

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
therefore allowing us some additional

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.750 
therefore allowing us some additional
load<00:03:10.519> carrying<00:03:10.939> capacity<00:03:11.659> and<00:03:12.430> finally<00:03:13.430> here

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
load carrying capacity and finally here

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.240 
load carrying capacity and finally here
is<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.299> last<00:03:14.720> variation<00:03:15.639> where<00:03:16.780> we<00:03:17.780> have<00:03:18.250> this

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
is the last variation where we have this

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.430 
is the last variation where we have this
worm<00:03:20.079> inclined<00:03:21.079> to<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.799> plane<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:23.389> v1p

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
worm inclined to the plane of the v1p

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.150 
worm inclined to the plane of the v1p
so<00:03:24.859> let<00:03:25.190> us<00:03:25.220> see<00:03:25.579> how<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:26.540> two<00:03:26.780> are<00:03:27.160> arranged

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
so let us see how the two are arranged

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.589 
so let us see how the two are arranged
in<00:03:28.699> space<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.980> you<00:03:31.040> will<00:03:31.190> see<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:32.030> plane<00:03:32.329> of

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
in space so you will see the plane of

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.930 
in space so you will see the plane of
the<00:03:33.079> worm<00:03:33.290> wheel<00:03:33.530> is<00:03:34.329> making<00:03:35.329> some<00:03:35.569> angle<00:03:36.079> with

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
the worm wheel is making some angle with

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.259 
the worm wheel is making some angle with
the<00:03:37.940> worm<00:03:38.389> axis<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.049> this<00:03:39.859> allows<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:41.000> worm

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
the worm axis and this allows the worm

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.159 
the worm axis and this allows the worm
thread<00:03:42.049> to<00:03:42.799> align<00:03:43.159> well<00:03:43.519> with<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:44.389> worm<00:03:44.900> wheel

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
thread to align well with the worm wheel

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.979 
thread to align well with the worm wheel
teeth<00:03:45.430> thus<00:03:46.430> increasing<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.150> contact<00:03:47.810> area

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
teeth thus increasing the contact area

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.939 
teeth thus increasing the contact area
the<00:03:48.979> angle<00:03:49.370> over<00:03:50.120> here<00:03:50.510> is<00:03:50.659> called<00:03:51.260> as<00:03:51.560> the

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
the angle over here is called as the

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:55.479 
the angle over here is called as the
lead<00:03:52.190> angle<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:53.750> think<00:03:54.169> of<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.470> simply<00:03:54.889> you<00:03:55.250> can

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
lead angle to think of it simply you can

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.559 
lead angle to think of it simply you can
remember<00:03:56.329> that<00:03:57.079> any<00:03:57.560> helical<00:03:58.419> element<00:03:59.419> is

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
remember that any helical element is

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.680 
remember that any helical element is
like<00:04:00.319> an<00:04:00.560> inclined<00:04:01.010> plane<00:04:01.120> round<00:04:02.120> around<00:04:02.449> a

that<00:04:06.199> plane<00:04:06.470> is<00:04:06.739> nothing<00:04:07.370> but<00:04:07.489> this<00:04:07.699> lead

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
that plane is nothing but this lead

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.869 
that plane is nothing but this lead
angle<00:04:08.449> if<00:04:09.319> you<00:04:09.470> want<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.739> can<00:04:09.889> follow<00:04:10.609> this

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
angle if you want to can follow this

link here and look up the screw jack
which<00:04:15.859> is<00:04:15.979> nothing<00:04:16.159> but<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.849> simple<00:04:17.209> machine

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:17.599 
which is nothing but the simple machine

because of this commonality it gives us

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.760 
because of this commonality it gives us
the<00:04:26.419> idea<00:04:26.779> of<00:04:26.960> using<00:04:27.469> even<00:04:27.950> this<00:04:28.190> arranged

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
the idea of using even this arranged

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.550 
the idea of using even this arranged
as<00:04:28.949> a<00:04:29.009> simple<00:04:29.490> machine<00:04:29.639> so<00:04:30.629> let<00:04:30.990> us<00:04:31.020> see<00:04:31.319> that

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
slowly if it moves slower

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.649 
slowly if it moves slower
it<00:04:48.990> must<00:04:49.470> be<00:04:49.590> receiving<00:04:50.009> a<00:04:50.159> larger<00:04:50.970> force<00:04:51.389> and

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
it must be receiving a larger force and

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.960 
it must be receiving a larger force and
that<00:04:52.259> is<00:04:52.409> the<00:04:52.710> mechanical<00:04:53.220> advantage

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
that is the mechanical advantage
