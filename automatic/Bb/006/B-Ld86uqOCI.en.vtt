we<00:02:33.150> have<00:02:33.269> another<00:02:33.569> new<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:33.959> that's<00:02:34.140> called

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
we have another new one that's called

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.339 
we have another new one that's called
cider<00:02:34.769> visuals<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.660> if<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.870> click<00:02:37.080> on<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
cider visuals so if we click on the

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.369 
cider visuals so if we click on the

cider visuals folder there's

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.320 
cider visuals folder there's
under-the-sea<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.430> that's<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.790> sample<00:02:42.209> that

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
under-the-sea and that's the sample that

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.580 
under-the-sea and that's the sample that
we<00:02:42.510> down<00:02:42.690> one<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.140> ones<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:43.530> we

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
we down one of the ones that we

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.190 
we down one of the ones that we
downloaded<00:02:44.239> if<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:45.390> can<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:45.720> drag<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.170> drop

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
downloaded if I can just drag and drop

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.050 
downloaded if I can just drag and drop
I'll<00:02:46.739> drag<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.250> drop<00:02:47.310> into<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.760> video<00:02:48.030> in

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
I'll drag it and drop into the video in

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.039 
I'll drag it and drop into the video in
scratch<00:02:49.190> panel<00:02:50.190> into<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.549> sample<00:02:50.790> pad<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.450> if

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
scratch panel into the sample pad and if

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.789 
scratch panel into the sample pad and if
I<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.200> press<00:02:52.920> play<00:02:53.340> on<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.640> sample<00:02:54.650> we<00:02:55.650> get

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
I just press play on the sample we get

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.030 
I just press play on the sample we get
some<00:02:56.010> nice<00:02:56.160> visuals<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.910> some<00:02:57.890> tropical<00:02:58.890> fish

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
some nice visuals of some tropical fish

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.170 
some nice visuals of some tropical fish
swimming<00:02:59.370> around<00:03:01.549> but<00:03:02.549> what<00:03:02.760> about<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
swimming around but what about the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.309 
swimming around but what about the
analog<00:03:03.750> 6-pack<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.120> analog<00:03:06.390> 6-pack<00:03:07.049> is<00:03:07.290> a

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
analog 6-pack so the analog 6-pack is a

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.460 
analog 6-pack so the analog 6-pack is a
pack<00:03:07.739> of<00:03:07.769> samples<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.930> can<00:03:10.079> do<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.290> same

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
pack of samples and you can do the same

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.229 
pack of samples and you can do the same
thing<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.920> can<00:03:11.099> just<00:03:11.280> drag<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.700> drop<00:03:11.849> any<00:03:12.060> of

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
thing you can just drag and drop any of

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.910 
thing you can just drag and drop any of
those<00:03:13.280> onto<00:03:14.280> any<00:03:14.459> sample<00:03:14.970> pad<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.620> press<00:03:16.620> play

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
those onto any sample pad and press play

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.160 
those onto any sample pad and press play
and<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.519> visual<00:03:18.000> will<00:03:18.239> play<00:03:18.510> on<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.870> screen

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
and the visual will play on the screen

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.759 
and the visual will play on the screen
or<00:03:20.030> since<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.299> pack<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.930> can<00:03:22.590> actually

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
or since it's a pack you can actually

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.830 
or since it's a pack you can actually
scroll<00:03:23.340> through<00:03:23.579> your<00:03:23.730> sample<00:03:24.180> bank<00:03:24.389> and<00:03:24.660> it's

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
scroll through your sample bank and it's

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.009 
scroll through your sample bank and it's
created<00:03:25.260> its<00:03:25.470> own<00:03:25.650> analog<00:03:26.430> 6-pack<00:03:27.060> bag<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.810> all

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
created its own analog 6-pack bag so all

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.559 
created its own analog 6-pack bag so all
these<00:03:28.350> samples<00:03:28.620> are<00:03:28.980> already<00:03:29.340> in<00:03:29.489> there<00:03:29.760> you

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
these samples are already in there you

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.229 
these samples are already in there you
just<00:03:30.690> have<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:31.489> click<00:03:32.489> on<00:03:32.670> any<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:33.000> them<00:03:33.260> and

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
just have to click on any of them and

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.670 
just have to click on any of them and
they<00:03:36.239> will<00:03:36.389> play<00:03:36.540> they're<00:03:37.260> all<00:03:37.290> grouped

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
they will play they're all grouped

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
they will play they're all grouped
together<00:03:38.480> already<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:39.810> if<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.160> play<00:03:41.160> one<00:03:41.459> and

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
together already so if you play one and

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.360 
together already so if you play one and
then<00:03:42.540> turn<00:03:42.780> another<00:03:42.989> one<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.889> first<00:03:44.160> one

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
then turn another one on the first one

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.500 
then turn another one on the first one
will<00:03:44.519> stop<00:03:44.760> playing<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.090> should<00:03:51.389> give

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
will stop playing so that should give

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.509 
will stop playing so that should give
you<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.690> pretty<00:03:51.780> decent<00:03:52.290> idea<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.250> how<00:03:53.459> to
