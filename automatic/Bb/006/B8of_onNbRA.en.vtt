00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
to take first spot and that's

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.280 
to take first spot and that's
frustrating<00:01:05.729> man<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.689> hence<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> big<00:01:07.110> man

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
frustrating man and hence the big man

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.380 
frustrating man and hence the big man
with<00:01:08.070> racing<00:01:08.460> right<00:01:08.610> now<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> turn

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
with racing right now you have to turn

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.690 
with racing right now you have to turn
on<00:01:09.479> slipstream<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.110> turn<00:01:10.830> ketchup<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.340> just

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
on slipstream and turn ketchup on just

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.039 
on slipstream and turn ketchup on just
because<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.150> people's<00:01:12.450> mistakes<00:01:12.659> with

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
because of people's mistakes with

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.890 
because of people's mistakes with
contact<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.939> at<00:01:15.119> least<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> chance<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
contact so you at least have a chance to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.710 
contact so you at least have a chance to
get<00:01:16.049> back<00:01:16.259> into<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.650> race<00:01:16.860> right<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
get back into the race right so the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.050 
get back into the race right so the
thing<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.990> even<00:01:19.530> though<00:01:19.560> ketchup<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.400> right

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
thing is even though ketchup is on right

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.539 
thing is even though ketchup is on right

think<00:02:53.070> of<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.250> in<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.430> comment<00:02:53.730> section

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
think of this in the comment section

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.090 
think of this in the comment section
once<00:02:54.510> again<00:02:54.660> this<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.230> within<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.709> playlist

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
once again this is within the playlist

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.500 
once again this is within the playlist
so<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.220> could<00:02:56.459> add<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.730> whole<00:02:56.850> playlist<00:02:57.120> to

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
so you could add the whole playlist to

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.270 
so you could add the whole playlist to
your<00:02:57.840> game<00:02:58.230> through<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.920> link<00:02:59.160> in
