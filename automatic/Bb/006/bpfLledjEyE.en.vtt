00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
that a nice batch of shower

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.400 
that a nice batch of shower
passing<00:04:27.890> through<00:04:27.920> and<00:04:28.510> by<00:04:29.510> golly<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:30.050> warm

front could pass north of here and the

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.630 
front could pass north of here and the
latest<00:04:32.600> gfs<00:04:33.350> is<00:04:33.530> suggesting<00:04:34.070> we<00:04:34.190> might<00:04:34.400> see<00:04:34.610> a

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
latest gfs is suggesting we might see a

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.090 
latest gfs is suggesting we might see a
high<00:04:34.850> of<00:04:34.880> 70<00:04:35.780> on<00:04:35.930> Saturday<00:04:35.960> I<00:04:36.530> think<00:04:36.830> that's<00:04:36.980> a

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
high of 70 on Saturday I think that's a

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.100 
high of 70 on Saturday I think that's a
little<00:04:37.310> overdone<00:04:37.820> but<00:04:38.090> I<00:04:38.390> do<00:04:38.510> think<00:04:38.780> we<00:04:38.960> reach

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
little overdone but I do think we reach

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.380 
little overdone but I do think we reach
the<00:04:39.320> 60s<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.010> again<00:04:40.850> there<00:04:40.940> might<00:04:41.090> even<00:04:41.150> be

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
the 60s and again there might even be

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.960 
the 60s and again there might even be
some<00:04:41.660> thunder<00:04:42.050> with<00:04:42.260> this<00:04:42.560> is<00:04:42.830> there<00:04:43.760> will<00:04:43.850> be

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
some thunder with this is there will be

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.150 
some thunder with this is there will be
a<00:04:44.000> touch<00:04:44.270> of<00:04:44.420> surface-based<00:04:45.020> instability<00:04:45.980> oh

a touch of surface-based instability oh

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.460 
a touch of surface-based instability oh
how<00:04:46.580> we<00:04:46.640> can<00:04:46.910> go<00:04:47.090> from<00:04:47.270> five<00:04:47.570> degrees<00:04:48.080> to

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
how we can go from five degrees to

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.950 
how we can go from five degrees to
having<00:04:49.340> a<00:04:49.400> chance<00:04:49.670> of<00:04:49.850> thunder<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.480> a<00:04:50.750> few
