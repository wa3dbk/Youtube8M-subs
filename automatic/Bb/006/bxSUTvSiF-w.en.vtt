00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
sort of consistency to this from the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.000 
sort of consistency to this from the
consistency<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.020> unique<00:00:43.020> 115<00:00:43.620> equal<00:00:43.920> is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
consistency to the unique 115 equal is

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.459 
consistency to the unique 115 equal is
really<00:00:44.250> soft<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.789> creamy<00:00:45.170> but<00:00:46.170> when<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.440> put

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
really soft and creamy but when you put

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.680 
really soft and creamy but when you put
your<00:00:46.620> brush<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.370> will<00:00:47.520> take<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.910> bit<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
your brush in it will take up a bit of

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.380 
your brush in it will take up a bit of
liner<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.770> then<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.090> try<00:00:51.329> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
liner and then you have to try and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.090 
liner and then you have to try and
scrape<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.870> off<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> side<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.920> don't

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
scrape it off the side so that you don't

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
scrape it off the side so that you don't
take<00:00:53.250> too<00:00:53.309> much<00:00:53.610> out<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> pot<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.989> that's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
take too much out of the pot so that's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.080 
take too much out of the pot so that's
one<00:00:55.559> drawback<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.489> make<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.059> I

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
one drawback to the to make one that I

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.229 
one drawback to the to make one that I
don't<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.079> sequence<00:00:58.710> and<00:01:00.260> the

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
applicators that come with some ideas

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.649 
applicators that come with some ideas
you<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.790> these<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.180> every<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.640> pot

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659
