all<00:00:45.320> right<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:45.620> we<00:00:45.710> have<00:00:45.860> that<00:00:46.040> that<00:00:46.970> play<00:00:47.240> that

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
all right so we have that that play that

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.270 
all right so we have that that play that
was<00:00:47.540> the<00:00:47.690> steering<00:00:48.170> it<00:00:48.350> was<00:00:48.470> up<00:00:48.650> down<00:00:48.920> side<00:00:49.250> to

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
was the steering it was up down side to

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.660 
was the steering it was up down side to
side<00:00:49.460> I<00:00:50.030> took<00:00:50.540> apart<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.840> steering<00:00:51.260> wheel<00:00:51.670> it

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
side I took apart the steering wheel it

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.360 
side I took apart the steering wheel it
looked<00:00:52.850> like<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:53.180> was<00:00:53.270> kind<00:00:53.780> of<00:00:53.870> a<00:00:54.370> bearing

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
looked like it was kind of a bearing

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.410 
looked like it was kind of a bearing
that<00:00:55.700> her<00:00:56.180> pushing<00:00:56.870> or<00:00:57.260> something<00:00:57.680> I<00:00:57.800> don't

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
that her pushing or something I don't

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.630 
that her pushing or something I don't
this<00:00:59.420> wasn't<00:00:59.660> seating<00:01:00.050> quite<00:01:00.200> right<00:01:00.500> I<00:01:01.070> think

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
this wasn't seating quite right I think

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.299 
this wasn't seating quite right I think
was<00:01:01.880> when<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:02.060> did<00:01:02.270> my<00:01:02.450> body<00:01:02.690> lift<00:01:03.309> it

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
was when I did my body lift it

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.570 
was when I did my body lift it
overextended<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.000> steering<00:01:05.890> column<00:01:06.890> shaft

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
overextended the steering column shaft

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.330 
overextended the steering column shaft
and<00:01:08.380> kind<00:01:09.380> of<00:01:09.440> pushed<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.860> steering<00:01:10.220> wheel

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
and kind of pushed the steering wheel

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.800 
and kind of pushed the steering wheel
too<00:01:10.520> far<00:01:10.790> into<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.540> cockpit<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.810> shaft

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
too far into the cockpit so the shaft

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.910 
too far into the cockpit so the shaft
wasn't<00:01:15.140> sitting<00:01:15.260> quite<00:01:15.530> right<00:01:15.710> on<00:01:15.830> the

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
wasn't sitting quite right on the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.210 
wasn't sitting quite right on the
bearing<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:17.119> solve<00:01:17.330> this<00:01:17.510> problem<00:01:18.190> what<00:01:19.190> I

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
bearing so it solve this problem what I

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.080 
bearing so it solve this problem what I
did<00:01:19.520> was<00:01:19.820> pulled<00:01:20.420> out<00:01:20.540> pulled<00:01:21.260> off<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.619> airbag

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
did was pulled out pulled off the airbag

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.330 
did was pulled out pulled off the airbag
when<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.150> do<00:01:23.270> that<00:01:23.450> just<00:01:23.720> make<00:01:23.869> sure<00:01:24.050> you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
when you do that just make sure you

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.969 
when you do that just make sure you
unplug<00:01:25.340> your<00:01:25.700> battery<00:01:26.560> there's<00:01:27.560> some

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
unplug your battery there's some

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.800 
unplug your battery there's some
specific<00:01:28.820> amount<00:01:29.090> of<00:01:29.150> time<00:01:29.240> you're<00:01:29.540> supposed

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
specific amount of time you're supposed

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.300 
specific amount of time you're supposed
to<00:01:29.960> wait<00:01:30.140> for<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.500> capacitors<00:01:31.010> everything

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
to wait for the capacitors everything

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.100 
to wait for the capacitors everything
discharged<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.850> system<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:34.690> I<00:01:36.640> didn't<00:01:37.640> wait

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
discharged the system and I didn't wait

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.030 
discharged the system and I didn't wait
but<00:01:39.190> I'm<00:01:40.190> not<00:01:40.280> saying<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.700> shouldn't<00:01:42.040> so

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
but I'm not saying you shouldn't so

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.480 
but I'm not saying you shouldn't so
there's<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.430> airbag<00:01:43.820> I<00:01:44.210> believe<00:01:44.869> that<00:01:45.200> was<00:01:45.530> a

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.200 

5/16<00:01:49.490> inch<00:01:49.899> so<00:01:50.899> I<00:01:50.960> could<00:01:51.140> took<00:01:51.350> care<00:01:51.590> of<00:01:51.619> that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
5/16 inch so I could took care of that

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.190 
5/16 inch so I could took care of that
yeah<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:53.270> was<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.450> 5/16<00:01:54.289> inch<00:01:54.679> socket<00:01:54.820> two<00:01:56.200> bolts

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
yeah it was a 5/16 inch socket two bolts

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.960 
yeah it was a 5/16 inch socket two bolts
holding<00:01:57.319> an<00:01:57.560> end<00:01:57.740> one<00:01:57.950> right<00:01:58.160> there<00:01:58.429> and<00:01:58.700> then

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
holding an end one right there and then

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.660 
holding an end one right there and then
one<00:01:59.240> right<00:01:59.270> there<00:01:59.979> just<00:02:00.979> on<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.280> back<00:02:01.460> of

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
one right there just on the back of

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.490 
one right there just on the back of
steering<00:02:02.060> wheel<00:02:02.210> so<00:02:02.660> every<00:02:02.960> bag<00:02:03.080> comes<00:02:03.319> right

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
steering wheel so every bag comes right

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.700 
steering wheel so every bag comes right
off<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.679> couple<00:02:03.920> plugs<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.429> pulls<00:02:04.610> out<00:02:05.410> so<00:02:06.410> from

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
off a couple plugs it pulls out so from

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
I just kind of want the piece of wood to

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.630

down<00:02:43.220> or<00:02:43.370> side<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.760> side<00:02:43.790> clay

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
down or side to side clay

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.840 
down or side to side clay
