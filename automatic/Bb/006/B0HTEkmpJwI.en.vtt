yeah well they made it work as far as

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.049 
yeah well they made it work as far as
though<00:00:07.259> they<00:00:07.440> defended<00:00:08.040> very<00:00:08.069> well<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:08.760> me

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
though they defended very well and in me

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.910 
though they defended very well and in me
that<00:00:09.179> hard<00:00:09.360> for<00:00:09.480> us<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.660> break<00:00:09.780> them<00:00:09.960> down<00:00:09.990> but

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
that hard for us to break them down but

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.890 
that hard for us to break them down but
apart<00:00:11.580> from<00:00:11.730> one<00:00:11.910> opportunity<00:00:12.210> too<00:00:12.630> hard<00:00:12.809> I

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
apart from one opportunity too hard I

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.509 
apart from one opportunity too hard I
think<00:00:12.960> we<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.530> had<00:00:13.650> much<00:00:13.799> control<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.340> game

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
think we we had much control of the game

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.010 
think we we had much control of the game
so<00:00:15.089> pleased<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.570> thought<00:00:15.750> we<00:00:15.809> played<00:00:15.870> well

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
so pleased I thought we played well

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.529 
so pleased I thought we played well
thought<00:00:16.470> we've<00:00:16.590> done<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> lot<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.920> good<00:00:17.039> things

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
thought we've done a lot of good things

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.880 
thought we've done a lot of good things
you<00:00:18.539> know<00:00:18.630> hopefully<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.410> goals<00:00:19.590> will<00:00:19.740> come

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
you know hopefully the goals will come

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.510 
you know hopefully the goals will come
with<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.160> as<00:00:20.220> well

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
with it as well

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.370 
with it as well
they<00:00:20.880> were<00:00:20.939> stubborn<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.900> first<00:00:22.170> half

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
they were stubborn in that first half

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.720 
they were stubborn in that first half
and<00:00:22.619> despite<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> play<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.250> you'd<00:00:23.519> had

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
and despite the play that you'd had

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.490 
and despite the play that you'd had
restricted<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.480> number<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.720> clear<00:00:25.019> chances

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
restricted the number of clear chances

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.200 
restricted the number of clear chances
that<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.710> had<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.890> mean<00:00:26.070> robin<00:00:26.640> van<00:00:26.730> persie

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
that you had I mean robin van persie

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.029 
that you had I mean robin van persie
trashing<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.050> shot<00:00:28.230> against<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.619> crossbar

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
trashing that shot against the crossbar

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.009 
trashing that shot against the crossbar
then<00:00:29.490> we<00:00:29.640> had<00:00:29.849> what<00:00:30.449> was<00:00:30.570> really<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> key

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
then we had what was really the key

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.720 
then we had what was really the key
points<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.439> whole<00:00:31.590> match<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.340> penalty

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
points in the whole match the penalty

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.580 
points in the whole match the penalty
almost<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> stroke<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.930> half-time<00:00:34.079> what's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
almost on the stroke of half-time what's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.260 
almost on the stroke of half-time what's
your<00:00:34.739> your<00:00:35.100> view<00:00:35.399> or<00:00:35.460> your<00:00:35.730> opinion<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.180> what

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
your your view or your opinion and what

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.700 
your your view or your opinion and what
you've<00:00:36.390> seen<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.630> bit<00:00:36.840> well<00:00:37.380> there<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.559> two

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
you've seen a bit well there was two

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.380 
you've seen a bit well there was two
incidents<00:00:38.160> before<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:38.790> well<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.270> that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
incidents before that as well so that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.850 
incidents before that as well so that
referee<00:00:39.660> had<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> few<00:00:40.079> incidents<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.559> had<00:00:40.770> to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
referee had a few incidents we had to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.010 
referee had a few incidents we had to
deal<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.430> think<00:00:42.360> he's<00:00:42.480> just<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.750> bit<00:00:42.899> cold

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
deal with I think he's just a bit cold

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.750 
deal with I think he's just a bit cold
the<00:00:43.200> more<00:00:43.320> correct<00:00:43.530> I've<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.309> been<00:00:44.489> speaking

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the more correct I've just been speaking

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.610 
the more correct I've just been speaking
to<00:00:44.910> something<00:00:45.149> who<00:00:45.300> said<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.600> real<00:00:45.750> time<00:00:46.050> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
to something who said in real time it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.860 
to something who said in real time it
was<00:00:46.739> probably<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> right<00:00:47.370> call<00:00:47.780> looking<00:00:48.780> at

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
was probably the right call looking at

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.630 
was probably the right call looking at
it<00:00:48.989> slowed<00:00:49.260> down<00:00:49.289> exactly<00:00:49.980> then<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.309> may<00:00:50.430> just

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
it slowed down exactly then it may just

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.549 
it slowed down exactly then it may just
have<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:50.969> started<00:00:51.449> outside<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> box<00:00:52.289> but

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
have just started outside the box but

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.709 
have just started outside the box but
for<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> referee<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.879> call<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> think

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
for the referee to call that and I think

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.170 
for the referee to call that and I think
he<00:00:54.780> looks<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.199> help<00:00:55.649> from<00:00:55.829> his<00:00:55.949> assistant<00:00:56.180> so

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
he looks for help from his assistant so

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.299 
he looks for help from his assistant so
the<00:00:57.719> two<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.989> them<00:00:58.079> they<00:00:58.440> made<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> decision

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the two of them they made a decision

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.979 
the two of them they made a decision
that<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.640> was<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.789> penalty<00:01:00.000> kick<00:01:00.300> eleven

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that it was a penalty kick eleven

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.299 
that it was a penalty kick eleven
against<00:01:01.379> ten<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.980> hold<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
against ten then for the hold of the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.880 
against ten then for the hold of the
second<00:01:02.670> half<00:01:02.850> lots<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.510> attacking<00:01:03.870> play<00:01:04.290> but

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
second half lots of attacking play but

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.600 
second half lots of attacking play but
they<00:01:05.760> were<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.090> stubborn<00:01:06.470> yeah<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.159> done<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
they were so stubborn yeah but we done a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.859 
they were so stubborn yeah but we done a
lot<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.850> good<00:01:09.030> things<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:09.390> well<00:01:09.510> we<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.780> think

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
lot of good things as well we just think

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.289 
lot of good things as well we just think
quicker<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> goals<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.970> was<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.150> lot<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
quicker the goals but it was a lot a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.810 
quicker the goals but it was a lot a
good<00:01:12.479> play<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.229> dug<00:01:14.159> deep<00:01:14.369> made<00:01:14.640> sure<00:01:14.790> it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
good play and they dug deep made sure it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.090 
good play and they dug deep made sure it
was<00:01:14.970> hard<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.270> break<00:01:15.420> them<00:01:15.600> down<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.950> had

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
was hard to break them down but we had

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.520 
was hard to break them down but we had
with<00:01:17.460> more<00:01:17.700> control<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> game<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.570> no<00:01:19.409> we

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
with more control of the game and no we

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.320 
with more control of the game and no we
probably<00:01:19.770> share<00:01:20.070> scored<00:01:20.310> more<00:01:20.430> goals<00:01:20.490> an

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
probably share scored more goals an

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.999 
probably share scored more goals an
excellent<00:01:21.689> free-kick<00:01:22.080> from<00:01:22.110> Wayne<00:01:22.530> Rooney<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
excellent free-kick from Wayne Rooney to
