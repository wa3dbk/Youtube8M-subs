milk and I use whole milk not 2% or
fat-free<00:02:48.400> because<00:02:49.180> home<00:02:49.330> looks<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.690> lot<00:02:49.840> more

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
fat-free because home looks a lot more

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.870 
fat-free because home looks a lot more
richer<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.620> course<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:50.980> has<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.220> lot<00:02:51.310> more<00:02:51.610> fat

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
richer of course it has a lot more fat

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.770 
richer of course it has a lot more fat
in<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.120> as<00:02:52.299> well

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780
