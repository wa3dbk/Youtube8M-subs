core<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.940> bet<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.390> may<00:00:54.570> actually<00:00:54.780> work<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
core I bet this may actually work for a

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.880 
core I bet this may actually work for a
5-series<00:00:55.800> ball<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.789> RG<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.480> core<00:00:57.719> 2.5<00:00:58.590> to

got<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.840> huge<00:01:43.049> back<00:01:43.320> end<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.680> you'd<00:01:43.829> expect

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
got that huge back end that you'd expect

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.450 
got that huge back end that you'd expect
to<00:01:44.220> see<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.850> an<00:01:44.970> A<00:01:45.119> Series<00:01:45.540> ball<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.460> why

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
to see out of an A Series ball and why

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.950 
to see out of an A Series ball and why
don't<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.790> Mitch<00:01:48.030> show<00:01:48.270> us<00:01:48.390> exactly<00:01:48.570> what

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
don't we have Mitch show us exactly what

00:01:48.960 --> 00:02:50.580 
don't we have Mitch show us exactly what
it<00:01:49.020> looks<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> lanes

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.270 

alright<00:02:51.590> we<00:02:51.650> just<00:02:51.799> got<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.920> chance<00:02:52.099> to<00:02:52.189> watch

going to complement or compare to it

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.940 
going to complement or compare to it
well<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.879> 50<00:03:05.209> a<00:03:05.329> day<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:06.079> going<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.560> get<00:03:06.769> a

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
well the 50 a day is going to get a

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.830 
well the 50 a day is going to get a
little<00:03:07.129> further<00:03:07.370> down<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.790> lane<00:03:07.970> in<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.180> 607

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
little further down the lane in the 607

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.720 
little further down the lane in the 607
a<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.439> create<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.799> little<00:03:10.010> bit<00:03:10.129> more<00:03:10.280> angle

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
a and create a little bit more angle

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.819 
a and create a little bit more angle
down<00:03:10.970> lane<00:03:11.239> when<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.930> lane<00:03:12.079> start<00:03:12.379> to<00:03:12.470> dry<00:03:12.680> up

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
down lane when the lane start to dry up

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.640 
down lane when the lane start to dry up
a<00:03:12.950> little<00:03:13.220> bit<00:03:13.370> right<00:03:13.670> so<00:03:14.420> it's<00:03:14.569> a<00:03:14.750> it's<00:03:15.109> more

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
a little bit right so it's a it's more

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.910 
a little bit right so it's a it's more
of<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.829> true<00:03:16.099> medium<00:03:16.549> ball<00:03:16.819> or<00:03:17.599> the<00:03:17.629> 607<00:03:18.319> handles

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
of a true medium ball or the 607 handles

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.039 
of a true medium ball or the 607 handles
a<00:03:18.980> little<00:03:19.220> medium<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:19.730> medium<00:03:19.760> heavy<00:03:20.180> yeah<00:03:20.870> so

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
a little medium the medium heavy yeah so

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.420 
a little medium the medium heavy yeah so
this<00:03:21.139> ball<00:03:21.379> the<00:03:21.500> front<00:03:21.920> legs<00:03:22.099> are<00:03:22.220> should<00:03:22.340> go

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
this ball the front legs are should go

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.309 
this ball the front legs are should go
away<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:23.329> ball<00:03:23.389> starts<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.900> check<00:03:24.139> up<00:03:24.260> a

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
away this ball starts to check up a

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.140 
away this ball starts to check up a
little<00:03:24.470> early<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:24.709> doesn't<00:03:25.069> lose<00:03:25.430> its<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.849> look

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
little early and doesn't lose its a look

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.420 
little early and doesn't lose its a look
the<00:03:26.989> 500<00:03:27.290> 80s<00:03:27.530> be<00:03:27.650> perfect<00:03:28.010> it's<00:03:28.190> gonna<00:03:28.280> be<00:03:28.400> a

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
the 500 80s be perfect it's gonna be a

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.559 
the 500 80s be perfect it's gonna be a
little<00:03:28.489> bit<00:03:28.670> clearer<00:03:28.849> through<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.060> front<00:03:29.269> and

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
little bit clearer through the front and

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.599 
little bit clearer through the front and
still<00:03:30.139> maintain<00:03:30.290> that<00:03:30.530> same<00:03:30.769> angularity<00:03:31.250> that

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
still maintain that same angularity that

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.559 
still maintain that same angularity that
you<00:03:31.730> were<00:03:31.849> seeing<00:03:32.090> with<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:32.359> 607<00:03:34.480> tell<00:03:35.480> us

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
you were seeing with the 607 tell us

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.629 
you were seeing with the 607 tell us
something<00:03:35.690> different<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:36.079> be<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.230> 508<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.950> in<00:03:37.519> the

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
something different to be a 508 a in the

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.259 
something different to be a 508 a in the
500<00:03:37.940> 3<00:03:38.209> seat<00:03:38.420> well<00:03:39.409> the<00:03:40.010> 50<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.489> day<00:03:40.639> is<00:03:41.060> going<00:03:41.239> to

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
500 3 seat well the 50 a day is going to

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.539 
500 3 seat well the 50 a day is going to
be<00:03:41.420> much<00:03:41.690> more<00:03:41.720> angular<00:03:42.230> down<00:03:42.680> lane<00:03:42.980> than<00:03:43.430> the

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
be much more angular down lane than the

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.539 
be much more angular down lane than the
503<00:03:43.970> see<00:03:44.629> well<00:03:45.169> and<00:03:45.560> it's<00:03:45.889> also<00:03:46.099> going<00:03:46.489> to

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
503 see well and it's also going to

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.059 
503 see well and it's also going to
cover<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.879> couple<00:03:47.090> more<00:03:47.419> boards<00:03:47.840> because<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.859> is

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
cover a couple more boards because it is

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.129 
cover a couple more boards because it is
so<00:03:49.400> much<00:03:49.609> stronger<00:03:49.849> off<00:03:50.209> of<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.599> spot<00:03:50.870> down

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
so much stronger off of the spot down

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.039 
so much stronger off of the spot down
the<00:03:51.290> lane<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:52.040> 503<00:03:52.459> is<00:03:53.000> much<00:03:53.269> more<00:03:53.540> controlled

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
the lane the 503 is much more controlled

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.039 
the lane the 503 is much more controlled
smooth<00:03:54.650> shape<00:03:55.099> so<00:03:55.970> this<00:03:56.299> ball<00:03:56.569> is<00:03:56.690> better<00:03:56.870> for

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
smooth shape so this ball is better for

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.050 
smooth shape so this ball is better for
when<00:03:57.169> the<00:03:57.230> back<00:03:57.379> ends<00:03:57.680> are<00:03:57.799> stronger<00:03:58.310> but<00:03:58.879> when

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
when the back ends are stronger but when

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.699 
when the back ends are stronger but when
the<00:03:59.150> back<00:03:59.329> ends<00:03:59.690> aren't<00:03:59.870> strong<00:04:00.139> enough<00:04:00.199> or

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
the back ends aren't strong enough or

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.619 
the back ends aren't strong enough or
the<00:04:01.160> smalls<00:04:01.459> leading<00:04:01.849> a<00:04:01.879> lot<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.120> flat<00:04:02.299> tens

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
the smalls leading a lot of flat tens

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.390 
the smalls leading a lot of flat tens
and<00:04:02.989> go<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:03.290> this<00:04:03.500> ball<00:04:03.769> gets<00:04:03.980> around<00:04:04.310> the

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
and go to this ball gets around the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.369 
and go to this ball gets around the
corner<00:04:04.699> strong<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:05.840> gets<00:04:05.959> your<00:04:06.049> character

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
corner strong and it gets your character

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.349 
corner strong and it gets your character
back<00:04:06.799> up<00:04:06.980> yeah<00:04:07.370> this<00:04:07.519> will<00:04:07.639> allow<00:04:08.060> you<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.239> play

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
back up yeah this will allow you to play

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:09.430 
back up yeah this will allow you to play
a<00:04:08.389> little<00:04:08.480> bit<00:04:08.660> closer<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.079> friction

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
a little bit closer to the friction

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.619 
a little bit closer to the friction
where<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.699> 50<00:04:10.910> ways<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.120> let<00:04:11.329> you<00:04:11.419> get<00:04:11.540> away

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
where the 50 ways to let you get away

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.449 
where the 50 ways to let you get away
from<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:11.959> get<00:04:12.169> in<00:04:12.319> and<00:04:12.590> throw<00:04:13.069> away<00:04:13.099> from<00:04:13.400> the

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
from it get in and throw away from the
