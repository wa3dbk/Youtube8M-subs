00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.969 

have<00:05:19.610> noticed<00:05:20.119> that<00:05:20.239> if<00:05:20.629> I<00:05:20.929> do<00:05:20.989> an<00:05:21.529> avocado

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
have noticed that if I do an avocado

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.639 
have noticed that if I do an avocado
treatment<00:05:22.669> before<00:05:22.789> I<00:05:23.059> do<00:05:23.119> a<00:05:23.269> twist<00:05:23.659> out<00:05:23.869> that

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:24.649 
treatment before I do a twist out that

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:28.149 
treatment before I do a twist out that
my<00:05:24.919> twist<00:05:25.909> out<00:05:26.089> is<00:05:26.360> more<00:05:26.719> defined<00:05:27.019> and<00:05:27.439> shinier

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 
my twist out is more defined and shinier

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.669 
my twist out is more defined and shinier
so<00:05:29.119> I<00:05:29.149> don't<00:05:29.419> know<00:05:29.539> if<00:05:29.779> it<00:05:30.050> has<00:05:30.229> something<00:05:30.439> to

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:30.679 
so I don't know if it has something to

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:32.469 
so I don't know if it has something to
do<00:05:30.949> with<00:05:30.979> me<00:05:31.309> doing<00:05:31.459> the<00:05:31.610> avocado<00:05:32.029> treatment

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
do with me doing the avocado treatment

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.719 
do with me doing the avocado treatment
but<00:05:32.599> I<00:05:32.629> definitely<00:05:33.289> think<00:05:34.039> that<00:05:34.189> it<00:05:34.519> it

definitely<00:05:35.659> helps<00:05:36.079> so<00:05:36.559> I<00:05:36.589> do<00:05:36.709> recommend<00:05:36.979> this
