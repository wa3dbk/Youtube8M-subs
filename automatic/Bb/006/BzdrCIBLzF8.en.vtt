right I don't I can't put my finger on

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.380 
right I don't I can't put my finger on
it<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.159> don't<00:01:41.579> look<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.240> then

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it they just don't look right and then

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.780 
it they just don't look right and then
you<00:01:42.509> add<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:44.070> game<00:01:44.399> takes

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
you add to that that this game takes

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.120 
you add to that that this game takes
place<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.720> guess<00:01:45.990> what<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.799> would<00:01:46.950> call

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
place and I guess what you would call

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.240 
place and I guess what you would call
old-time<00:01:47.880> Chicago<00:01:48.720> because<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.680> windy<00:01:50.130> as

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
old-time Chicago because it's windy as

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.580 
old-time Chicago because it's windy as
hell<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.909> I'm<00:01:51.420> standing<00:01:51.810> there<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.470> I'm

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
hell and I'm standing there and I'm

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.920 
hell and I'm standing there and I'm
looking<00:01:53.009> at<00:01:53.189> my<00:01:53.579> character<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.540> his<00:01:54.630> hair<00:01:54.899> is

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
looking at my character and his hair is

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.990 
looking at my character and his hair is
just<00:01:55.110> sitting<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:56.040> these<00:01:56.189> trees<00:01:56.640> are

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
just sitting there but these trees are

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.539 
just sitting there but these trees are
just<00:01:57.090> blowing<00:01:58.079> back<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.530> forth<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.189> they're

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
just blowing back and forth like they're

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.030 
just blowing back and forth like they're
in<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.790> tornado<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.140> don't<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.590> his

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
in a tornado and I don't like that his

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.580 
in a tornado and I don't like that his
hair<00:02:02.310> should<00:02:02.549> be<00:02:02.610> blowing<00:02:02.990> everywhere<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
hair should be blowing everywhere if the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.670 
hair should be blowing everywhere if the
tree<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.219> whole<00:02:05.549> tree<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.210> shaking<00:02:06.439> like<00:02:07.439> it's

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
tree a whole tree is shaking like it's

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.130 
tree a whole tree is shaking like it's
having<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.099> seizure<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:09.209> art<00:02:09.420> style<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.989> this

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
having a seizure the art style of this

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.680 
having a seizure the art style of this
game<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.560> sort<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.190> like<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.430> painting<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.360> not

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
game is sort of like a painting it's not

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.640 
game is sort of like a painting it's not
a<00:02:12.989> going<00:02:13.319> for

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
a going for

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.770 
a going for
realism<00:02:14.189> and<00:02:14.549> I<00:02:14.909> thought<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.329> was<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.750> thought

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
realism and I thought it was I thought

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.600 
realism and I thought it was I thought
that's<00:02:16.319> what<00:02:16.530> they<00:02:16.650> were<00:02:16.709> shooting<00:02:16.980> for<00:02:17.370> if

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
that's what they were shooting for if

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.390 
that's what they were shooting for if
you<00:02:17.939> look<00:02:18.120> at<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.329> game<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.659> Skyrim<00:02:19.260> it's<00:02:19.530> uh

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
you look at a game like Skyrim it's uh

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.179 
you look at a game like Skyrim it's uh
it's<00:02:20.790> realism<00:02:21.510> they're<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.409> and<00:02:22.739> I

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
it's realism they're going for and I

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.319 
it's realism they're going for and I
thought<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.549> was<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.730> route<00:02:24.030> they<00:02:24.209> were

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
thought that was the route they were

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.059 
thought that was the route they were
going<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.540> take<00:02:24.750> with<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.170> witcher<00:02:25.530> 3<00:02:25.560> they

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
going to take with the witcher 3 they

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.250 
going to take with the witcher 3 they
sort<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.430> did<00:02:26.670> with<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.000> witcher<00:02:27.329> 2<00:02:27.689> the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
sort of did with the witcher 2 the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.830 
sort of did with the witcher 2 the
witcher<00:02:28.560> 2<00:02:28.769> was<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.610> had<00:02:29.909> it's<00:02:30.120> cartoonish

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
witcher 2 was it had it's cartoonish

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.069 
witcher 2 was it had it's cartoonish
cartoon<00:02:31.560> eos<00:02:31.980> art<00:02:32.760> style<00:02:33.209> but<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.540> also<00:02:33.689> had

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
cartoon eos art style but it also had

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.860 
cartoon eos art style but it also had
more<00:02:34.409> of<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.620> realistic<00:02:35.159> style<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.599> feels

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
more of a realistic style and this feels

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.899 
more of a realistic style and this feels
more<00:02:37.230> like<00:02:37.290> you're<00:02:37.739> inside<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.129> painting<00:02:38.730> and

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
more like you're inside a painting and

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.599 
more like you're inside a painting and
that's<00:02:39.450> not<00:02:39.689> a<00:02:39.750> bad<00:02:40.079> thing<00:02:40.109> these<00:02:41.010> graphic

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
that's not a bad thing these graphic

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.280 
that's not a bad thing these graphic
problems<00:02:42.090> these<00:02:42.329> trees<00:02:42.689> whipping<00:02:43.170> around

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
problems these trees whipping around

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.860 
problems these trees whipping around
like<00:02:43.620> crazy<00:02:43.769> aren't<00:02:44.519> really<00:02:45.209> going<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.720> affect

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
like crazy aren't really going to affect

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.830 
like crazy aren't really going to affect
the<00:02:46.260> game<00:02:46.500> at<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.670> end<00:02:47.849> of<00:02:47.909> the<00:02:48.030> day<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.239> think

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
the game at the end of the day I think

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.080 
the game at the end of the day I think
I'm<00:02:49.260> going<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.560> really<00:02:49.980> enjoy<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.730> witcher<00:02:51.060> 3

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
I'm going to really enjoy the witcher 3

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.420 
I'm going to really enjoy the witcher 3
but<00:02:52.079> I<00:02:52.139> did<00:02:52.319> want<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.680> mention<00:02:52.769> this<00:02:53.040> stuff

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
but I did want to mention this stuff

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.309 
but I did want to mention this stuff

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
because if it's something that would put

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.170 
because if it's something that would put
you<00:02:55.440> off<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.920> game<00:02:56.159> if<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:57.000> were

super impressive graphical title that's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.520 
super impressive graphical title that's
not<00:03:02.970> what<00:03:03.150> you're<00:03:03.329> getting<00:03:03.659> but<00:03:04.200> now<00:03:04.319> that

pretty<00:03:07.980> much<00:03:08.189> everything<00:03:08.609> else<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.510> saw<00:03:09.989> revs

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
pretty much everything else I saw revs

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
video where he said he didn't really

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.119 
video where he said he didn't really
like<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:12.810> far<00:03:12.840> it's<00:03:13.109> pretty<00:03:13.470> boring<00:03:13.799> it's

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
like it so far it's pretty boring it's

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.470 
like it so far it's pretty boring it's
putting<00:03:14.340> him<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:14.609> sleep<00:03:14.639> all<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.329> other

putting him to sleep all this other

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.990 
putting him to sleep all this other
stuff<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:16.159> that's<00:03:17.159> okay<00:03:17.489> that's<00:03:17.730> revs

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
stuff and that's okay that's revs

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.699 
stuff and that's okay that's revs
opinion<00:03:18.540> whatever<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.199> that's<00:03:19.379> definitely

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
opinion whatever but that's definitely
