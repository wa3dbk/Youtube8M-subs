00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.020
 hello everyone I'm alexis and I invite you to 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.470
 which is a return with me to the circuit 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.470
 far away 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.010
 well now we are coming out of the pit 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.900
 lane that we go straight to curve 2 a 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.760
 curve 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.160
 pretty fast that is done 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.020
 practically in depth and it's important 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.420
 get out of that curve quickly because after 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.650
 you're going to give the next curve that 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.530
 it is also practically thorough and that 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.220
 in his life he had to leave fast 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.610
 then comes this left curve 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.100
 which is a bit slow 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.910
 good thing she is very important to do 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.880
 a good line and we will give this 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.220
 that are slower and we want you not to be 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.310
 of the first second depends depends on 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.310
 the marches you do and nothing 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.100
 this is the corkscrew what they call it 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.080
 it's a downhill curve very very 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.780
 complicated line very important 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.720
 also the plot to leave 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.090
 fast and make fast this curve that 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.190
 is next that is practically 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.880
 want to put salt is not nothing 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.100
 it has to be complicated is a circuit 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.190
 in general quite complicated but the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.070
 curves are very peculiar and nothing after 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.380
 is the line of this one is very important 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.950
 and make changes make a quick change 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.520
 address because it's that way then 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.130
 here I related strongly and well is 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.679
 a girl a little long 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.810
 that the step to the master straight where it is 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.239
 very important of the products 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.420
 transport well so they do not happen to you and 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.950
 for motorcycles 3 for me categories is 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.950
 a little bit are little long sacyr 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.060
 here we get to about 240 and this 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.370
 curve is very important to have it done 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.569
 quick not to pay much to the bike because 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.220
 it's a decisive curve 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.220
 here you win or lose races 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.050
 if you leave fast they do not pass you and if you leave 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.050
 slow you passing before goal
