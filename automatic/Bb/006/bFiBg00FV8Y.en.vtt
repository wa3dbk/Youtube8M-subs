00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.680
 Hall people and welcome to one 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.080
 further episode of our plugin tutorial 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.750
 row and today we create ourselves or 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.320
 or we sit in a doctor's mind 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.230
 mode 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.720
 you may know that from the aspect 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.239
 aid mode at ghom or so or others 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.489
 is an example now we are just 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.980
 invisible and the whole is actually 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.230
 not that hard to program 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.110
 actually pretty simple we do 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.880
 the whole thing with scoreboard teams we have 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.820
 yes already worked with scoreboards that 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.140
 Here is just the class with one 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.880
 objective where we then at the side 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.890
 have set this sidebar here 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.470
 we need everything this time nice but 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.670
 we'll see that right now 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.280
 I have created for our class 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.090
 with a command executed 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.610
 and now we need mine first 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:04.049
 scoreboard we just say glad board 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.970
 scoreboard that's what I call fort he habs 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.070
 on the write and then we need 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.979
 another sports team we devoured 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.270
 just team and not only 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:17.149
 scoreboard import the euro package 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:21.780
 point scoreboard and then we write 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:23.429
 long ago, although equal to zero 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.950
 of course you can do it here now, of course 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.600
 only over command we want that just like that 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.799
 make sure you're always invisible 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.429
 this server or half 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.679
 invisible 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.259
 of course if that's such a spac 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.909
 of course that would have to be installed 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.499
 I would do the player of the event 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.109
 Create a very simple method 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:41.310
 and doing the whole thing but we want 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:44.990
 that we are in the invisible therefore 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.990
 Let's build a command 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.000
 so now let's say ours 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.580
 scoreboard is a new cuba for that 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.780
 Let's write about the baking point on board 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.090
 equal bucket scoreboard manager gates 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.410
 scoreboard he's also doing a lot 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.440
 another variable for the sports manager 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:12.970
 scoreboard lowercase scoreboard 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.710
 manager sn is equal bucket point goes 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.030
 Maybe this is scoreboard manager 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.850
 a little clearer me 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.020
 personally, you can do that 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.110
 I'll just do it now 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.020
 that's how it would look like 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.550
 would you just have a variable more 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.740
 but that's pretty pointless for me 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.840
 therefore cabinet is the same and then 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.140
 So let's say our costume is our team 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.709
 the same board team we call the team 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.959
 just team and then we ask if 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.640
 the team is equal to zero 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.200
 that is, if steam does not exist yet 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.510
 then we have to register it first 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.830
 namely with ghost same board spot 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.030
 register new team and then team like this 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.830
 very important now here again from the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.690
 query out now we all have to 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.700
 player on the server or would have in 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.640
 to do this with one team 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.190
 in front of a loop in front of player players 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.400
 Colon bucket point goes online 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:13.570
 players or no suggestions is one 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.739
 for its loop I have also just before 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.299
 recently learned that this is a difference 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.900
 up to the last before or still full 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.120
 so make a loop with the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.739
 update so and then we say 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.190
 simply post.at player players and already 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.190
 we have all players finished in there 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.110
 and now let's just say it 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:41.049
 scores pushing effect so that of the 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:44.680
 has enter new persian effect then 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:47.799
 swap effect tablet that is 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.300
 Invisible as a station we write 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.790
 integer 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.860
 max value so we can get us easily 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.780
 the biggest intouch all this gives and as 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.460
 Amplifier you can easily enroll 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.800
 there we can go to 15 or 20 or 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.140
 Something in writing does not matter 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.000
 if max value i can tell you exactly 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:18.549
 say which number is that and that 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:22.020
 the number is 200 3 214 billion 708 214 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:26.950
 million 7 102 billion 147 million 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:29.110
 483 1647 so is the biggest in tetz all 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.030
 there is, and we can do that as well 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.040
 here we do not have to express 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.150
 in the t-point max value we write 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.710
 can simply describe integer and 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.140
 maxwell just now 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.880
 Copy this community pays that can 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.250
 we all feel writing that means 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.560
 everything exactly the same 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.150
 we would have forgotten something else 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.780
 write here in our before 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.300
 loop as my mouse grad 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:00.330
 more 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:04.780
 ok now is again say exactly players 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:07.450
 said scoreboard board so we put 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.310
 Just restore this scoreboard 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.810
 I still have that here and now 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.280
 most important we must forget too 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.919
 team ghost put him a property 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.580
 to prescribe wigos point set know 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.710
 you friendly invisible with that we say 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.700
 just that if that's the friends 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.440
 are invisible 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.919
 that he can see it anyway 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.320
 That is why we achieve that, too 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:37.080
 which looks so halfway then we export 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.080
 our plugin start the server 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.849
 I do not have a second one right now 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.520
 account here but we see that yourself 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:49.750
 we are still visible here when we are 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.680
 now we'll see / ghost 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.310
 never again 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:06:03.639
 Why should not we really have to 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:06.099
 We're just starting to watch again 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.349
 Okay we do not know how skat 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.990
 went wrong then 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:12.190
 then came no errors come on 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.750
 every case now we see each other so halfway 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.919
 Invisible I also know what that can do 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.840
 I believe I recognize in any case 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:20.919
 here so halfway visible and if they are him 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:23.699
 f5 we go see each other here just like that 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:26.710
 You know what I mean 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:31.990
 just like that of such spectator fashions 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:36.250
 movies knows the whole undone again 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:41.050
 You just write me yes 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:43.750
 short talk topsy pointless effect 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.330
 then swap the effect score visibility 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.400
 that 's the invisible rank already 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.909
 everything will be gone again 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.500
 normal 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:52.750
 to complete it all 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.529
 just write me a big primove 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.599
 and then p 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:57.580
 so he reversed the whole thing 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:03.250
 made and all players could you 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:07.029
 see again so that's it as 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.139
 said that nothing too hard and 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:09.639
 we had another consequence already 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:11.139
 times this scoreboard right one page 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:14.229
 and then there are these 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:16.659
 scoreboards users that we over here 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.919
 the game that you have something here 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:21.219
 For example, the number of 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:22.930
 live or so or here in the tablet 

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:24.430
 that is still behind a number 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.409
 there we can, for example, any 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.569
 show life or something with even 

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:30.250
 I'll build it if I can do it again 

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:32.139
 should show how that goes in the other 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.419
 tutorial please write in the 

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:36.159
 Comments 

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:39.539
 soria I am again the next time 

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:43.270
 let's program ourselves that way with one 

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:44.440
 the one with an api partly like us 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.770
 here for example in such a pig or 

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.090
 to be able to transform something 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.229
 we will definitely do that 

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.419
 program again next time 

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:51.590
 a bit spoilers and then I would 

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:53.389
 say, see you next time 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:58.120
 until then I would go through one 

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:58.120
 appreciation and makes you feel good and ciao
