00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
disparate building GPU on it so think

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.780 
disparate building GPU on it so think
about<00:00:37.630> it<00:00:37.780> in<00:00:38.110> the<00:00:38.260> reality<00:00:38.650> the<00:00:39.370> most<00:00:39.579> gamers

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
about it in the reality the most gamers

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.480 
about it in the reality the most gamers
they<00:00:40.120> were<00:00:40.240> just<00:00:40.390> use<00:00:40.810> one<00:00:41.320> discrete<00:00:42.100> graphic

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 
they were just use one discrete graphic

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.160 
they were just use one discrete graphic
card<00:00:42.670> powerful<00:00:43.210> graphic<00:00:43.540> card<00:00:43.720> they<00:00:43.900> won't<00:00:44.050> do

high-end car and the third scenario is

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.209 
high-end car and the third scenario is
they<00:01:04.119> can<00:01:04.269> use<00:01:04.420> a<00:01:04.449> mix<00:01:04.869> and<00:01:05.110> match<00:01:05.320> graphic<00:01:06.070> are

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:06.219 
they can use a mix and match graphic are

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:10.289 
they can use a mix and match graphic are
no<00:01:06.490> no<00:01:06.790> matter<00:01:06.969> MBDA<00:01:07.750> one<00:01:08.020> or<00:01:08.320> AMD<00:01:08.770> one<00:01:09.130> now<00:01:09.790> the

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
no no matter MBDA one or AMD one now the

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.270 
no no matter MBDA one or AMD one now the
building<00:01:10.600> GPU<00:01:10.990> still<00:01:11.260> will<00:01:11.770> become<00:01:12.070> like

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
building GPU still will become like

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.930 
building GPU still will become like
multi-gpu<00:01:13.270> solution<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:14.770> it's<00:01:15.159> very<00:01:15.370> exciting

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
multi-gpu solution so it's very exciting

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.240 
multi-gpu solution so it's very exciting
I<00:01:16.090> think<00:01:16.299> it's<00:01:16.420> very<00:01:16.479> styling<00:01:16.990> for<00:01:17.080> gamers<00:01:17.470> it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
I think it's very styling for gamers it

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.010 
I think it's very styling for gamers it

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
could you just tell us quickly about the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.190 
could you just tell us quickly about the
output<00:01:39.700> connectors<00:01:40.149> on<00:01:40.359> the<00:01:40.450> motherboard<00:01:40.719> yes

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
output connectors on the motherboard yes

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.190 
output connectors on the motherboard yes
of<00:01:41.469> course<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:42.429> I<00:01:42.460> if<00:01:42.969> user<00:01:43.240> they<00:01:43.509> want<00:01:43.719> to<00:01:43.869> use

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
of course so I if user they want to use

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.819 
of course so I if user they want to use
the<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:45.009> building<00:01:45.310> GPU<00:01:45.729> so<00:01:46.299> they<00:01:46.750> can<00:01:46.960> just

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
the the building GPU so they can just

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.149 
the the building GPU so they can just
use<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.159> hdmi<00:01:48.310> there's<00:01:49.090> HDMI<00:01:49.689> output<00:01:50.159> yeah

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
use the hdmi there's HDMI output yeah

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.309 
use the hdmi there's HDMI output yeah
and<00:01:51.429> of<00:01:52.030> course<00:01:52.090> if<00:01:52.420> they<00:01:52.569> have<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.810> discrete

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
and of course if they have a discrete

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.649 
and of course if they have a discrete
GPU<00:01:53.649> car<00:01:53.890> they<00:01:54.130> cannot<00:01:54.399> just<00:01:54.640> use<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:55.030> the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
GPU car they cannot just use the the

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.090 
GPU car they cannot just use the the
graphic<00:01:56.020> cards<00:01:56.289> output<00:01:56.679> yeah

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
graphic cards output yeah

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.310 
graphic cards output yeah
and<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.909> course<00:02:00.000> there<00:02:00.299> are<00:02:00.390> more<00:02:00.720> features

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
and of course there are more features

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.560 
and of course there are more features
about<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.950> board<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.759> example<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.540> a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
about this board for example we have a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.260 
about this board for example we have a
picture<00:02:03.900> called<00:02:04.259> RC<00:02:04.799> bluetooth<00:02:05.220> there<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.240> a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
picture called RC bluetooth there is a

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.260 
picture called RC bluetooth there is a
should<00:02:06.869> be<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> bluetooth<00:02:07.440> module<00:02:07.590> here<00:02:08.270> which

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
should be a bluetooth module here which

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.059 
should be a bluetooth module here which
means<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.600> we<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:09.989> use<00:02:10.020> our<00:02:10.319> smartphone<00:02:10.890> or

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
means that we can use our smartphone or

overclock<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.940> motherboard<00:02:15.260> now<00:02:16.260> i<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.560> do

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
overclock this motherboard now i can do

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.680 
overclock this motherboard now i can do
for<00:02:17.310> power<00:02:17.489> user<00:02:17.790> they<00:02:17.970> are<00:02:18.060> doing<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.420> last

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
for power user they are doing the last

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.380 
for power user they are doing the last
mile<00:02:18.989> overclocking<00:02:19.739> ok<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:20.640> can<00:02:20.880> see<00:02:21.209> that

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
mile overclocking ok we can see that

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.540 
mile overclocking ok we can see that
this<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.660> just<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:22.050> concept<00:02:22.770> motherboard<00:02:23.310> but

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
this is just a concept motherboard but

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.010 
this is just a concept motherboard but
will<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:23.850> will<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.300> be<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.540> motherboard

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
will this will this be a motherboard

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.780 
will this will this be a motherboard
that<00:02:25.200> we<00:02:25.260> will<00:02:25.380> actually<00:02:25.500> see<00:02:25.890> go<00:02:26.069> on<00:02:26.250> sale<00:02:26.580> and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
that we will actually see go on sale and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.199 
that we will actually see go on sale and
roughly<00:02:27.569> roughly<00:02:27.989> when<00:02:28.470> could<00:02:29.040> consumers<00:02:30.030> buy

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
roughly roughly when could consumers buy

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.990 
roughly roughly when could consumers buy
this<00:02:30.270> product<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:30.989> by<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.260> motherboard<00:02:32.000> for

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
this product but by this motherboard for

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.780 
this product but by this motherboard for
now<00:02:33.150> we<00:02:33.209> don't<00:02:33.600> have<00:02:33.840> plan<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.830> mass<00:02:35.069> /<00:02:35.280> doctors

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
now we don't have plan to mass / doctors

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.750 
now we don't have plan to mass / doctors
but<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.480> course<00:02:36.569> we're<00:02:37.260> looking<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:37.920> media<00:02:38.550> as

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
but of course we're looking for media as
