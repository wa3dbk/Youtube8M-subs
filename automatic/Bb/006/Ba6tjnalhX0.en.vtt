in here and it put seeds in the ground
which<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.130> kind<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.369> how<00:00:32.460> they<00:00:32.610> propagate<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
which is kind of how they propagate and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.040 
which is kind of how they propagate and
they're<00:00:33.719> from<00:00:33.989> India<00:00:34.410> actually<00:00:35.690> that<00:00:36.690> part<00:00:36.960> of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
they're from India actually that part of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.610 
they're from India actually that part of
Asia<00:00:37.879> very<00:00:38.879> very<00:00:39.090> pretty<00:00:39.329> plant<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.290> here's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
Asia very very pretty plant and here's

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.569 
Asia very very pretty plant and here's
one<00:00:41.690> can<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> red<00:00:43.680> underneath

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
one can I just like the red underneath

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.799 
one can I just like the red underneath
but<00:00:45.090> here's<00:00:46.020> an<00:00:46.200> idea<00:00:46.320> if<00:00:47.420> there's<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.600> right

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
but here's an idea if there's one right

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.220 
but here's an idea if there's one right
in<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:50.449> so<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.690> see<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.960> gets<00:00:52.079> really

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
in there so you can see it gets really

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.479 
in there so you can see it gets really
long<00:00:52.500> leaves<00:00:54.829> it's<00:00:55.829> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> back

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
long leaves it's kind of in the back

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.750 
long leaves it's kind of in the back
there<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.840> pretty<00:00:58.020> plant<00:00:58.760> pretty

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
there that's a pretty plant pretty

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.250 
there that's a pretty plant pretty
pretty<00:01:00.059> planet<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:04.170> 120s<00:01:04.860> doing<00:01:05.159> well

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
pretty planet and the 120s doing well

I<00:02:25.940> know<00:02:26.150> this<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.450> big<00:02:26.660> tank<00:02:26.900> 4<00:02:27.260> feet<00:02:27.470> by<00:02:27.500> 2

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
I know this is a big tank 4 feet by 2

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.800 
I know this is a big tank 4 feet by 2
feet<00:02:27.860> by<00:02:28.190> 2<00:02:28.220> feet<00:02:28.400> but<00:02:31.060> it's<00:02:32.060> just<00:02:32.300> not<00:02:32.570> big

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
feet by 2 feet but it's just not big

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.570 
feet by 2 feet but it's just not big
enough<00:02:32.840> when<00:02:35.050> when<00:02:36.050> somebody<00:02:36.320> puts<00:02:37.100> up<00:02:37.250> an<00:02:37.400> ass

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
enough when when somebody puts up an ass

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.920 
enough when when somebody puts up an ass
so<00:02:38.030> anyway<00:02:38.510> but<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.110> tanks<00:02:39.410> doing<00:02:39.680> ok<00:02:40.239> I<00:02:41.239> need

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
so anyway but this tanks doing ok I need

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.520 
so anyway but this tanks doing ok I need
to<00:02:42.020> figure<00:02:42.200> out<00:02:42.350> why<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:43.510> isn't<00:02:44.530> creating

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
to figure out why this isn't creating

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.650 
to figure out why this isn't creating
more<00:02:45.680> turbulence<00:02:46.220> right<00:02:46.430> there<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:50.480> if<00:02:50.570> I

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
more turbulence right there so and if I

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.660 
more turbulence right there so and if I
do<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:51.080> it'll<00:02:51.290> actually<00:02:51.500> eat<00:02:52.190> all<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.489> up

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
do that it'll actually eat all this up

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.810 
do that it'll actually eat all this up
so<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:54.170> this<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.709> if<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.370> can<00:02:55.489> believe<00:02:55.610> this

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
so but this is if you can believe this

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.630 
so but this is if you can believe this
this<00:02:56.060> is<00:02:56.269> lucky<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:58.040> let<00:02:58.130> me<00:02:58.220> pull<00:02:58.400> back

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
this is lucky so let me pull back

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.690 
this is lucky so let me pull back
Lucky's<00:02:59.090> almost<00:02:59.510> as<00:02:59.690> big<00:02:59.930> as<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:01.209> others

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
Lucky's almost as big as the others

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.750 
Lucky's almost as big as the others
Lucky's<00:03:04.700> easily<00:03:05.180> pushing<00:03:05.980> close<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.130> 5<00:03:07.340> inches

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
Lucky's easily pushing close to 5 inches

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.470 
Lucky's easily pushing close to 5 inches
now<00:03:07.970> in<00:03:08.269> size<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:10.510> good<00:03:11.510> for<00:03:13.030> used<00:03:14.030> to

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.199 

we<00:03:17.480> had

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.440 

they<00:03:24.750> actually<00:03:25.370> if<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.640> want<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:26.939> get<00:03:27.239> their

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
they actually if you want to get their

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.729 
they actually if you want to get their
attention<00:03:28.579> it<00:03:29.579> does<00:03:29.790> better<00:03:30.060> if<00:03:30.329> it's<00:03:30.569> a<00:03:31.109> shock

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
attention it does better if it's a shock

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.170 
attention it does better if it's a shock
wave<00:03:31.980> sound<00:03:32.540> instead<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.689> a<00:03:33.780> knock<00:03:35.180> I've

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
wave sound instead of a knock I've

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.979 
wave sound instead of a knock I've
noticed<00:03:36.840> my<00:03:37.969> when<00:03:38.969> I<00:03:39.000> siphon<00:03:39.540> out<00:03:39.659> of<00:03:39.719> here

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
noticed my when I siphon out of here

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.069 
noticed my when I siphon out of here
that<00:03:40.170> clear<00:03:40.829> plastic<00:03:41.069> -<00:03:41.489> if<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.299> tap<00:03:42.569> it<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.959> the

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
that clear plastic - if I tap it to the

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.379 
that clear plastic - if I tap it to the
glass<00:03:43.409> and<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:43.799> kind<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.069> creates<00:03:44.219> a<00:03:44.670> bell<00:03:44.969> I

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
glass and it kind of creates a bell I

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.319 
glass and it kind of creates a bell I
think<00:03:45.989> how<00:03:46.109> a<00:03:46.139> bell<00:03:46.439> works<00:03:46.799> an<00:03:47.040> air<00:03:47.310> word<00:03:47.549> you

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
think how a bell works an air word you

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.270 
think how a bell works an air word you
know<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.540> tap<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.260> does<00:03:49.469> a<00:03:49.500> ring<00:03:49.920> kind

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
know you tap it and it does a ring kind

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.330 
know you tap it and it does a ring kind
of<00:03:50.400> thing<00:03:51.019> they<00:03:52.019> go<00:03:52.230> nuts<00:03:52.439> that'll<00:03:53.040> get<00:03:53.189> their

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
of thing they go nuts that'll get their

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.750 
of thing they go nuts that'll get their
attention

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
attention

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.690 
attention
that's<00:03:54.060> like<00:03:54.859> pulling<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.920> fire<00:03:56.159> alarm<00:03:56.220> on

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
that's like pulling the fire alarm on

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.789 
that's like pulling the fire alarm on
them<00:03:56.989> and<00:03:57.989> just<00:03:58.409> so<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:58.620> know<00:03:58.650> for<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.459> guys

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
them and just so you know for you guys

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.250 
them and just so you know for you guys
new<00:04:01.799> to<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.040> biology<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.579> fish<00:04:02.930> this<00:04:03.930> little

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
new to the biology of fish this little

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.459 
new to the biology of fish this little
line<00:04:04.470> right<00:04:04.500> here<00:04:05.069> on<00:04:05.909> big<00:04:06.299> blue<00:04:07.129> right<00:04:08.129> there

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:09.469 
line right here on big blue right there

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.909 
line right here on big blue right there
that<00:04:10.469> line<00:04:10.829> is<00:04:11.810> actually<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.409> can<00:04:13.560> see<00:04:13.799> it

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
that line is actually and you can see it

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.210 
that line is actually and you can see it
on<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.189> one<00:04:14.430> here<00:04:15.049> as<00:04:16.049> well<00:04:16.500> almost<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.949> same

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
on this one here as well almost the same

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.529 
on this one here as well almost the same
quiet<00:04:17.459> place<00:04:18.560> that<00:04:19.560> line<00:04:20.039> is<00:04:20.459> how<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.120> fish

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
quiet place that line is how the fish

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.469 
quiet place that line is how the fish
here<00:04:21.989> it's<00:04:22.289> very<00:04:22.530> sensitive<00:04:22.889> to<00:04:23.880> vibration

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
here it's very sensitive to vibration

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.060 
here it's very sensitive to vibration
and<00:04:26.300> fish<00:04:27.300> can't<00:04:27.630> bark<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.680> now<00:04:28.770> if<00:04:28.860> you<00:04:28.949> think

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
and fish can't bark and now if you think

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.330 
and fish can't bark and now if you think
about<00:04:29.159> a<00:04:29.340> dog<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:30.389> what<00:04:30.599> they'll<00:04:30.810> do<00:04:31.020> is<00:04:31.340> they

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
about a dog so what they'll do is they

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.540 
about a dog so what they'll do is they
will<00:04:32.370> they<00:04:32.849> will<00:04:32.880> shake<00:04:33.449> like<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:34.050> and

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
will they will shake like this and

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.310 
will they will shake like this and
they'll<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.820> they'll<00:04:36.120> flicker<00:04:36.479> like<00:04:37.020> that

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
they'll and they'll flicker like that

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.890 
they'll and they'll flicker like that
and<00:04:37.710> then<00:04:38.580> some<00:04:38.849> fish<00:04:39.060> actually<00:04:39.479> have<00:04:39.630> bones

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
and then some fish actually have bones

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.350 
and then some fish actually have bones
it'll<00:04:40.289> rattle<00:04:40.440> together<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.099> it's<00:04:41.729> to<00:04:41.940> create

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.480 

and<00:04:47.229> like<00:04:47.409> see<00:04:47.620> how<00:04:47.740> they're<00:04:47.919> kind<00:04:48.039> of<00:04:48.129> jerkin

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
and like see how they're kind of jerkin

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.110 
and like see how they're kind of jerkin
is<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:48.819> create<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:51.599> way<00:04:52.599> of<00:04:52.750> yelling<00:04:53.080> I<00:04:54.120> can't

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
is to create a way of yelling I can't

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.589 
is to create a way of yelling I can't
really<00:04:55.240> talk<00:04:56.139> like<00:04:56.500> we<00:04:56.680> talk<00:04:56.889> now<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:57.550> take<00:04:58.419> that

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
really talk like we talk now I take that

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.679 
really talk like we talk now I take that
back<00:04:59.430> there<00:05:00.430> are<00:05:00.520> some<00:05:00.699> famous<00:05:00.909> mammals<00:05:01.509> that

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:01.689 
back there are some famous mammals that

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:06.450 
back there are some famous mammals that
swim<00:05:01.930> in<00:05:02.050> water<00:05:02.759> but<00:05:03.759> now<00:05:04.229> they<00:05:05.229> have<00:05:05.560> they

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
swim in water but now they have they

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.679 
swim in water but now they have they
breathe<00:05:06.759> air<00:05:07.139> they<00:05:08.139> have<00:05:08.319> an<00:05:08.439> air<00:05:08.620> cavity<00:05:08.919> and

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:09.689 
breathe air they have an air cavity and

so this is a baby tear but it's not HC
it's<00:06:38.309> not<00:06:38.490> the<00:06:38.639> dwarf<00:06:38.819> okay
