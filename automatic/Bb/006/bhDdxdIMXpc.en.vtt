 I am very, very glad I changed the skin but 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.489
 I did not sit under a tan 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.649

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.430

 The author of the maps is extremely banana like 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.360
 transferred from him like that 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.760
 to parkour card john uranium 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.680
 here you have to take platforms on 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.220
 platform as fast as you 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.890
 you can remember to settle the rule 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.869
 always run him here jump on 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.540
 pressure plates but does not accelerate if 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.090
 you fell just take off and go back to 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.640

 at night for more fun 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:48.859
 4-bet this is not a thoughtful card for you 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:02:02.240
 I will say the same with creativity you can take off 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:02:04.880
 just realized you jumped still dad and so 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.509
 back and well a little bit not very not 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.849
 thought out 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.940
 a little map because it â€™s not 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.519
 it would be interesting at least on the command 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.769
 the blocks would have been mastered of course 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:20.209
 more interesting atas creative for me why 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:31.000
 I can jump I chose such a card 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:34.450
 how I liked it the same lamb 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.450
 this is lucky 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.719
 so it means to jump from there did not work 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:53.670
 again failed and kay and version of Windows 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.950
 I took off it a little bit true I again 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.260
 I repeat for some reason I do not know how the card is not 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.530
 thought out and ill-conceived ill-conceived 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.530
 here 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:18.650
 oh well 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.650
 I will not jump them a little 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.700
 and a little bit was okay 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:41.080
 But not flew 5 likes 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:44.080
 where is what is unreal 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.080
 jump over 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.840
 here I am loshara before the critical moment for 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.540
 countries okay so let's do it again 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:07.390
 repeat 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:15.340
 igloo about the norms of me parkourist such 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:23.190
 map what is it so unfair than they 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.190
 the world was deported so what are you 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:35.230
 I already have enough anger and say 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.230
 the whole truth of this paint so guys think 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.780
 cheating 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.780
 add everything rightfully 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.880
 it does not say that you can not turn off 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:58.940
 rain 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:05:05.690
 i jumped oh well very interesting 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:07.990
 really really so damn why not 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.640
 enough so here I do not know from 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.340
 reaction collisions when you need to jump 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:22.190
 such because the run is not about 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:27.950
 sluggish that is unreal so alright so 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:38.290
 already this intrigue went but the guy 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:38.290
 easy oh so okay 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:54.160
 their 87 broke legs one more time 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.160
 about ferried to 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:05.300
 rather than fly so well let's a little bit 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.760
 a little bit and I'll jump 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.010
 it's pretty pretty and exciting 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.820
 map but if it were without creative 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:16.610
 there I would surely have broken disi it was 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:26.570
 in also not interesting so the author is not but 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:32.690

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:40.430
