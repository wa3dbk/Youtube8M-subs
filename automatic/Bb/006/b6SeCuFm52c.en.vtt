00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
do appear to be a kind of light blue

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.590 
do appear to be a kind of light blue
it's<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.570> bright<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.920> ices<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.299> is

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600

comparative<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.890> actually<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.759> these

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
comparative and I actually do like these

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.270 
comparative and I actually do like these
better<00:01:24.330> than<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> color<00:01:24.960> ice<00:01:25.229> because<00:01:25.890> ice

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
better than the color ice because ice

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.080 
better than the color ice because ice
fades<00:01:27.180> straight<00:01:27.750> from<00:01:27.990> very<00:01:28.470> light<00:01:28.770> blue

is highly highly regarded further very

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.390 
is highly highly regarded further very
good<00:01:36.090> quality<00:01:36.470> lenses<00:01:37.470> they're<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.159> most

good quality lenses they're the most

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.090 
good quality lenses they're the most
natural<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.810> tried<00:01:40.170> besides<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
natural that I have tried besides the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.280 
natural that I have tried besides the
adores<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.299> reason<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:42.930> these<00:01:43.079> better

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
adores the reason I like these better

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.590 
adores the reason I like these better
than<00:01:43.470> ice<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:45.000> quartz<00:01:45.390> those

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
than ice is because the quartz those

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.340 
than ice is because the quartz those
actually<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.740> kind<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.610> light<00:01:48.270> brown<00:01:48.689> specks

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
actually have kind of light brown specks

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.090 
actually have kind of light brown specks
that<00:01:49.860> fade<00:01:50.490> into<00:01:50.939> your<00:01:51.540> pupil<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.799> doesn't

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that fade into your pupil so it doesn't

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.690 
that fade into your pupil so it doesn't
just<00:01:53.130> go<00:01:53.490> directly<00:01:53.729> from<00:01:54.329> blue<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.770> dark<00:01:56.189> brown

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
just go directly from blue to dark brown

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.569 
just go directly from blue to dark brown
which<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.450> why<00:01:58.140> color<00:01:58.469> contacts<00:01:59.070> are<00:01:59.310> not

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
which is why color contacts are not

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.840 
which is why color contacts are not
natural-looking<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:01.229> these<00:02:01.560> do<00:02:02.009> look<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
natural-looking so these do look a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.760 
natural-looking so these do look a
little<00:02:03.420> natural<00:02:03.659> they<00:02:04.290> don't<00:02:04.560> look<00:02:04.710> very

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
little natural they don't look very

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.089 
little natural they don't look very
natural<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.790> will<00:02:06.450> say<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:06.899> brown<00:02:07.590> colored

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099

contact lenses again I've tried how many
I<00:02:33.030> don't<00:02:33.209> even<00:02:33.569> think<00:02:33.959> American<00:02:34.650> lenses<00:02:35.099> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
I don't even think American lenses the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.370 
I don't even think American lenses the
fresh<00:02:35.610> look<00:02:35.849> color<00:02:36.120> blends<00:02:36.480> those<00:02:36.900> aren't

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
fresh look color blends those aren't

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.380 
fresh look color blends those aren't
even<00:02:37.470> comfortable<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.220> me<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.640> am<00:02:38.910> very<00:02:39.180> very

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
even comfortable to me I am very very

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.660 
even comfortable to me I am very very
sensitive<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.319> have<00:02:40.680> read<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.040> my<00:02:41.130> comments

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
sensitive I have read in my comments

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.190 
sensitive I have read in my comments
that<00:02:41.790> some<00:02:42.000> people<00:02:42.420> can<00:02:42.630> wear<00:02:42.810> these<00:02:42.930> for<00:02:43.140> up

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
that some people can wear these for up

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.120 
that some people can wear these for up
to<00:02:43.349> eight<00:02:43.470> hours<00:02:43.860> others<00:02:44.450> can't<00:02:45.450> it's

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
to eight hours others can't it's

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.190 
to eight hours others can't it's
fifty-fifty<00:02:47.130> really<00:02:47.580> people's<00:02:48.299> experiences

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
fifty-fifty really people's experiences

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.770 
fifty-fifty really people's experiences
as<00:02:49.620> far<00:02:49.920> as<00:02:50.069> comfort<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.819> think<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:51.540> handle

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
as far as comfort I think I can handle

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.740 
as far as comfort I think I can handle
these<00:02:51.959> for<00:02:52.319> maybe<00:02:52.530> four<00:02:53.010> hours<00:02:53.060> max<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.720> I

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
these for maybe four hours max so I

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.330 
these for maybe four hours max so I
would<00:02:54.900> say<00:02:55.049> these<00:02:55.230> are<00:02:55.290> good<00:02:55.680> if<00:02:56.040> you're

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
would say these are good if you're

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.640 
would say these are good if you're
taking<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.940> lot<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.090> pictures<00:02:57.420> either<00:02:58.319> during

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
taking a lot of pictures either during

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.770 
taking a lot of pictures either during
the<00:02:58.769> day<00:02:59.010> or<00:02:59.370> at<00:02:59.640> night<00:02:59.670> this<00:03:00.239> would<00:03:00.420> be<00:03:00.540> good

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
the day or at night this would be good

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.080 
the day or at night this would be good
for<00:03:00.900> photography<00:03:01.620> because<00:03:02.099> they<00:03:02.549> will<00:03:02.819> be

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
for photography because they will be

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.690 
for photography because they will be
noticeable<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:04.110> has<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.769> slight<00:03:05.190> limbal<00:03:05.670> ring

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
noticeable it has a slight limbal ring

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.110 
noticeable it has a slight limbal ring
so<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.959> does<00:03:07.260> kind<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.950> give<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.400> circle<00:03:08.910> lens

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
so it does kind of give a circle lens

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.970 
so it does kind of give a circle lens
effect<00:03:09.599> in<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.930> way<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.349> doesn't<00:03:10.709> give<00:03:10.830> the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
effect in a way it doesn't give the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.460 
effect in a way it doesn't give the
appearance<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.670> enlarged<00:03:12.299> eyes<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:13.170> just

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
appearance of enlarged eyes it just

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.710 
appearance of enlarged eyes it just
outlines<00:03:14.190> your<00:03:14.430> eyes<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.420> looks<00:03:15.630> more

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
outlines your eyes so it looks more

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.949 
outlines your eyes so it looks more
prominent<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.769> defined<00:03:17.519> okay<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.510> that

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
prominent and defined okay so that

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.470 
prominent and defined okay so that
concludes<00:03:19.170> my<00:03:19.650> review<00:03:19.890> once<00:03:20.730> again<00:03:20.850> if<00:03:21.329> you
