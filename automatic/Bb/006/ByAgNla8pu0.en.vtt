 What is the trick of this flashlight super weight and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.859
 super compactness of all that is 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.330
 on the table it is the most compact 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:31.050
 It is powered by a little pinky battery 1 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.170
 one more lotion of this flashlight what on 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.489
 he has a frontal mount separately like this 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.500
 here 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.620
 comes off and remains small 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.399
 flashlight with a ring or rather with a hole even 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.200
 for keys like flashlight 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:52.770
 tactical flashlight how many love here 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:01:02.420
 so the angle changes the angle the button changes 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:02.420
 here here is the inclusion here 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.229
 well and back is inserted just by pressing 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.670
 powders so we look in general such 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.409
 tactical flashlight 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.450
 if we press and hold it he cuts 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.030
 shines like a spotlight adjustment just 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.450
 he has a very wide bunch 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.850
 but very bright for such a kid and his 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.850
 you can put it this way on 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.659
 table like you 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.610
 let's highlight me like this 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.479
 me by the way and all the time it 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.390
 Highlight tikay magician tivka xp 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.360
 and now here is an additional highlight 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.750
 With this phoenix, well, tikka xp is highlighted 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.659
 on the second brightness mode in general he 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.350
 just very bright and uniform 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.369
 illumination around this very wide 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:04.229
 give the corner by switching modes 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:06.300
 even brighter times two three here's economical 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.780
 night mode probably in this mode he 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.209
 any 90 hours of work there and the most 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.010
 bright of course really good for 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.980
 such a small flashlight let's 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:22.560
 compare with ticking tactics on the most 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:26.700
 power with diffuser yes I'm in a panic 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.610
 this lantern shines brighter than a tick and a bunch 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.940
 his illumination is wider yes 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.070
 that tikka xp is a very old flashlight then 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.920
 There is probably a modern tikka xp 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.079
 the light is not at all like mine 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.510
 five years ago they wo n't 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.730
 not slander for another five years 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.019
 ago she was very cool compare him 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.370
 two computers 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:53.700
 current modern five years ago 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:57.720
 the coolest is shorter here is this baby he 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.859
 I just have a hell of a fan 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.829
 this flashlight do not want to use myself 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:07.940
 Clearly shorter super light is easy 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:11.400
 moves just take one such flashlight 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.650
 small pair of batteries in the campaign can 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:19.440
 even one if not often 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:24.630
 use and all the weight well, probably for sure 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.910
 twice as easy as tick and maybe even 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.299
 the bigger is the same with his elder 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:34.200

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:39.380
