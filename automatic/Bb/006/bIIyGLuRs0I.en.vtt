is you hold this straight up and you're

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.429 
is you hold this straight up and you're
gonna<00:01:37.049> angle<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:39.090> right<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.930> your

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
gonna angle so right here is your

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.800 
gonna angle so right here is your
longest<00:01:40.710> point<00:01:41.400> that's<00:01:41.670> gonna<00:01:41.790> fall<00:01:42.119> so

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
longest point that's gonna fall so

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.210 
longest point that's gonna fall so
you're<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.170> take<00:01:43.350> from<00:01:43.590> there<00:01:43.890> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
you're going to take from there and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.859 
you're going to take from there and
you're<00:01:44.759> gonna<00:01:44.850> take<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.390> off<00:01:47.509> see<00:01:48.509> how<00:01:48.689> that

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
you're gonna take this off see how that

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
you're gonna take this off see how that
connects<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.860> I'm<00:01:50.009> going<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.549> way<00:01:50.790> so

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
connects but I'm going up this way so

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.160 
connects but I'm going up this way so
when<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.540> let<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.899> fall

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
when I let it fall

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.370 
when I let it fall
it's<00:01:52.680> gonna<00:01:52.799> fall<00:01:53.100> long<00:01:54.140> okay

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
it's gonna fall long okay

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.490 
it's gonna fall long okay
so<00:01:55.560> I'll<00:01:55.770> do<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.070> again<00:01:56.130> right<00:01:56.460> here<00:01:57.500> so

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
so I'll do that again right here so

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.170 
so I'll do that again right here so
angle<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.520> see<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.790> long<00:02:00.030> as

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
angle that up you can see this long as

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.780

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:18.259 
here I think it's too long I kind of

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:21.429 
here I think it's too long I kind of
want<00:06:18.439> it<00:06:18.469> to<00:06:18.529> go<00:06:18.709> short<00:06:19.009> shorter<00:06:19.819> to<00:06:19.999> longer<00:06:20.439> so

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:21.439 
want it to go short shorter to longer so

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:22.779

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:26.929 
these a little bit okay and then the

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:28.389 
these a little bit okay and then the
other<00:06:27.079> thing<00:06:27.379> that<00:06:27.409> I<00:06:27.589> see<00:06:27.829> in<00:06:27.919> is<00:06:28.129> it's<00:06:28.369> a

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:28.399 
other thing that I see in is it's a

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:31.149 
other thing that I see in is it's a
little<00:06:28.549> bit<00:06:28.669> bulky<00:06:29.179> here<00:06:29.479> for<00:06:29.929> this<00:06:30.139> so<00:06:30.859> I'm

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
little bit bulky here for this so I'm

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:33.939 
little bit bulky here for this so I'm
going<00:06:31.279> to<00:06:31.369> take<00:06:31.609> my<00:06:31.909> comb<00:06:32.619> and<00:06:33.619> I'm<00:06:33.769> going<00:06:33.919> to

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:33.949 
going to take my comb and I'm going to

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:38.199 
going to take my comb and I'm going to
take<00:06:34.159> a<00:06:34.189> little<00:06:34.549> bit<00:06:34.849> of<00:06:34.939> this<00:06:35.089> off<00:06:37.089> so<00:06:38.089> it

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:38.209 
take a little bit of this off so it

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:41.639 
take a little bit of this off so it
blends<00:06:38.479> a<00:06:38.689> little<00:06:38.959> bit<00:06:39.319> better<00:06:39.559> through<00:06:39.919> here

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:41.649 
blends a little bit better through here

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:43.899 
blends a little bit better through here
so<00:06:42.649> you<00:06:42.709> got<00:06:42.829> thirty<00:06:43.069> looking<00:06:43.399> better<00:06:43.519> through

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:43.909 
so you got thirty looking better through

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:48.039 
so you got thirty looking better through
this<00:06:44.029> part<00:06:45.399> and<00:06:46.449> the<00:06:47.449> reason<00:06:47.749> we're<00:06:47.899> getting

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:48.049 
this part and the reason we're getting

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:53.199 
this part and the reason we're getting
this<00:06:48.349> dry<00:06:48.879> Trisha<00:06:49.879> has<00:06:50.269> a<00:06:50.949> natural<00:06:51.949> curl<00:06:52.219> so

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:53.209 
this dry Trisha has a natural curl so

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:55.479 
this dry Trisha has a natural curl so
her<00:06:53.539> hair<00:06:53.749> kind<00:06:53.989> of<00:06:54.049> knows<00:06:54.199> what<00:06:54.379> I<00:06:54.409> want<00:06:54.649> so<00:06:55.039> we

her hair kind of knows what I want so we

00:06:55.489 --> 00:06:57.009 
her hair kind of knows what I want so we
like<00:06:55.669> to<00:06:55.699> have<00:06:55.939> it<00:06:56.059> straight<00:06:56.299> so<00:06:56.509> we<00:06:56.629> can<00:06:56.659> see

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:57.019
