00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 I'm going to put my third power in the fourth round. 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.520
 I will appeal to you. 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:18.910
 But I think you're really prepared for it . 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:23.859
 You have to prepare clearly reveal how about I write the number 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:28.250
 I was very confident that I was doing my best practice 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:31.550
 I was worried about someone who knew me a little better. 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.920
 I thought the border was clear as I thought. 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:41.650
 I've been flooded to the game as gimdaehyeok cheap lord seongseonseol posted in the waiting room 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.650
 So he dances better that these real good standing 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:52.240
 Standing 31 scores lately topography're really good enough to be called luxurious laminated power lines 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.140
 I think even painful part was the psychological burden of long borders, Ltd. 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.140
 I became a little 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:06.439
 I think I'm a little more comfortable with the dictionary than the church. 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.770
 I 've practiced practically without Pelmag. 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:15.680
 I'm a little more than the rattling premise 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:20.299
 It seemed to be as good as I thought, and I was prepared a little better. 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:25.009
 I'm really good at it. 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:28.969
 So when I look at it, I can not help it 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.869
 This is how it is, but today I came to my mothers. 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:34.789
 have 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:37.610
 I'm active low number of ink p. 9 taken out solely for gimdowoo antonghaneun 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:42.229
 I want my brother to fall down. 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.340
 It's a joke to me 4 I was not particularly interested in doing so much dancing practice 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.819
 It would. 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:51.009
 I practiced hard. 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.009
 I want to be more in the Star League 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:02:02.300
 I thought that curse was enough for me to go up . 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:05.830
 Yes Is there a handsome man and say you want to get off the original asking that the risk 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.830
 I'm interviewing as outer 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:17.680
 You've really slip even though what he cursed me Alor 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.280
 I do not think it's right. 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:26.530
 Nah, the player also won last year. 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:32.350
 41 years ago, I think another important Japanese bow bubble net meantime, what 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.010
 Be a bad nickname paste was looking considerably more put the match today 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.420
 silver 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:40.600
 Well, I think it's more of a good pose than the current one. 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.460
 Something special is coaching staff. 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:49.120
 I am wondering if you can train a player 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.100
 I heard a lot 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.780
 Yes 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:58.400
 So it was a little bit like that. 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.420
 I'm working hard until dawn . 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:08.720
 Why did I get stuck in the out so I worked hard on the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:13.519
 I have not been able to do it in recent years. 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:17.900
 Fortune game Gray seems to be loosened Well, 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.250
 About the same as redemption brake fitted with any player, but the place is a bit player 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.560
 It's different. 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.430
 Is there anything you want to eat two players touched the tricky scales so psychological warfare 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.620
 To do 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:33.580
 Even better with India base 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:38.740
 Someone seems to shake the system hard . 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:43.870
 I was a lot stronger at the Casper Cup or BlizzCon and I fell a lot. 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:48.819
 This time its grown ever without falling in the semifinals and 1 loss 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.730
 Doegeodeunyo need to practice hard so that I can just cause 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:56.980
 Yes, I expect good economic power in the river. 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:01.300
 Thank you so much for the third finals of the Star League 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.870
