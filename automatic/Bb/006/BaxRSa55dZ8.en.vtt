00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.860
 Today shows you this helicopter 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:21.770
 which works without mods so 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:23.630
 stay tuned well here we are again 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.910
 and yes that helicopter the 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.150
 really works without mods that is 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.250
 through the 1.8 possible and I want 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.559
 show you this and how it all works 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.899
 works for now what we actually 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.760
 need that it is really only a map 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.940
 she just pulls a safe like that 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.949
 just your world folder and you have 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.570
 everything already so easy 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.199
 only the world go and you will be here 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.989
 land 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.460
 we have these items are actually 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.399
 only relevant we need one with these 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.659
 bow a lava of a railroad and tnt 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.339
 and I will show you what this is for 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.399
 everything is so to speak we go here 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.920
 on the runway in the arc 10 through 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:05.479
 and yes, if we see ours here 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.610
 helicopter yes he has now 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.030
 So now the committee is open that is 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.740
 our view we can here the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.540
 Control the engine and turn it off 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.909
 the camera on and off my time later 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.810
 still and that has her arms and 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.369
 Of course he needs too 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.549
 something to request so much 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.649
 and yes I want to show you now 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.310
 So for the first time it's easy 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:38.060
 jogging like this and easy is 100 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:40.600
 percent if I once short part 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.270
 I did not want it so he was clearly like that 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.789
 and yes once for the tank as a refill 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.950
 but once for the smg is so 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.250
 even machine guns just once 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.119
 an ironware and then for 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.640
 bomb dnt what we are doing now 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.979
 just the back so in chat or how 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.740
 whatever you have already laid 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:07.460
 just start the engine on 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:11.420
 that's how it starts and now we have it here 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.950
 these possibilities left to right 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.590
 fly in front 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.420
 to fly backwards to the position 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.470
 hold and or fly up like that 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.190
 Do not wait 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.810
 so now you can fly forward and 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.300
 he lies here it is really funny 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.150
 does not look too bad so may 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.860
 that it is without mods then we can 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.799
 again hold the position 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:45.170
 For the turn, let's say so now 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:47.150
 again he flies down a bit like that 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.299
 he is here on the height 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.750
 let's take let's take it 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:57.459
 no gestmann dear animal here in 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.829
 a pig or a few more so here 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.700
 then just open it again so open 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:08.329
 menu and then just click smg and 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.959
 that shoots off that pretty much 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.700
 pretty strong and her meat thank you 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:19.250
 or we can go up again 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:23.180
 Do not fly high again today 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:30.709
 so high and can now go up there 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:34.850
 or come but these are here now 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:37.310
 we fly forward so we can 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.019
 do here but also the camera and 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.590
 then I sit in here and then can 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:46.180
 we direct ourselves here 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.019
 So pretty cool on the right 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.120
 position paid a bit after 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.120
 in front and we want to say now 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.209
 I'm bombing here on the roof 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:00.430
 Then click a little bit more 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:03.980
 on pump then puts the bomb 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.569
 so now can lay a few more 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.829
 I show in another view 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.810
 camera out as above are now the 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.750
 bombed looking pretty cool 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.750
 eat everything if all textures world 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:23.060
 changed and show now pay attention 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.770
 bomb must fall now the falls grad 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.300
 maybe not like 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.490
 Now we have one here and then 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.069
 Let's just click on the key 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.220
 So that's going to explode you yes and 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:37.860
 so now it 's pretty much exploding 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.690
 pretty cool and really fun 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.520
 it could actually do with it 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.710
 Try it yourself here on the ramp 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.930
 or you do not suspect you there 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.909
 Somehow know hows or what I do 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.039
 I wanted to you the easy times only 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.650
 and if you have more such 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.389

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.090
 So those with maps and not just mods 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.960
