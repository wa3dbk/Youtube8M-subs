of<00:00:11.849> spirit<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:12.540> instance<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.130> you<00:00:14.130> try<00:00:14.400> and

of spirit for instance and you try and

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.359

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
eat the fuck out of it I haven't done

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.800 
eat the fuck out of it I haven't done
this<00:00:17.550> before<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:19.170> adds<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.830> pages

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.109 
this before and that adds in the pages

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
but I think that a point to the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.019 
but I think that a point to the
challenge<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:25.189> dry<00:00:26.189> out<00:00:26.340> your<00:00:26.369> mouth<00:00:26.670> as
