definitely a Super Saiyan at the end

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.780 
definitely a Super Saiyan at the end
since<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.710> Naruto<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.520> thought<00:01:08.640> this

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
since the Naruto I just thought this

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.219 
since the Naruto I just thought this
would<00:01:09.000> be<00:01:09.030> cool<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.540> put<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.810> there<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.110> you

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
would be cool to put in there if you

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.780 
would be cool to put in there if you
guys<00:01:10.409> don't<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.799> that's<00:01:11.070> okay<00:01:11.490> but

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
guys don't like that that's okay but

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.590 
guys don't like that that's okay but
since<00:01:12.510> Naruto<00:01:13.049> has<00:01:13.200> tails<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:14.330> thought<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
since Naruto has tails I thought of the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.950 
since Naruto has tails I thought of the
end<00:01:15.750> maybe<00:01:16.049> since<00:01:16.409> Naruto<00:01:16.920> has<00:01:17.040> tails<00:01:17.310> um<00:01:17.960> they

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
end maybe since Naruto has tails um they

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.039 
end maybe since Naruto has tails um they
could<00:01:19.020> become<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> Super<00:01:19.680> Saiyan<00:01:19.710> 4<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:22.020> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
could become a Super Saiyan 4 and so I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.749 
could become a Super Saiyan 4 and so I
at<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> end<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.920> right<00:01:23.070> right<00:01:23.369> now<00:01:23.520> they're

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
at the end the right right now they're

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.810 
at the end the right right now they're
like<00:01:23.909> Super<00:01:24.450> Saiyan<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:25.560> super<00:01:25.799> soon<00:01:25.979> but

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
like Super Saiyan just super soon but

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.399 
like Super Saiyan just super soon but
they<00:01:26.970> become<00:01:27.299> Super<00:01:27.600> Saiyan<00:01:27.840> 4<00:01:28.080> at<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> end

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
they become Super Saiyan 4 at the end

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.310 
they become Super Saiyan 4 at the end
and<00:01:28.680> they<00:01:28.740> use<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.159> move<00:01:29.939> called<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.600> super

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and they use this move called the super

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.700 
and they use this move called the super
dum-dum<00:01:31.829> Rasengan<00:01:32.549> kamehameha<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.710> just

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
dum-dum Rasengan kamehameha I just

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.120 
dum-dum Rasengan kamehameha I just
thought<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.890> would<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.280> cool<00:01:35.700> idea<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
thought that would be a cool idea and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.090 
thought that would be a cool idea and
the<00:01:38.130> background<00:01:38.640> sort<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.799> more<00:01:40.799> Goku

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the background sort of like more Goku

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.219 
the background sort of like more Goku
become<00:01:41.430> we<00:01:41.850> first<00:01:42.240> become<00:01:42.630> super<00:01:42.930> seeing<00:01:43.110> it's

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
become we first become super seeing it's

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.749 
become we first become super seeing it's
sort<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> same<00:01:43.680> background<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> little

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
sort of the same background but a little

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.090 
sort of the same background but a little
different<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.960> not<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.439> damn<00:01:46.740> bug<00:01:46.950> or
