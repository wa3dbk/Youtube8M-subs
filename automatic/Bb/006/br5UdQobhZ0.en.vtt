00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:15.199
 I present to you such here 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:22.490
 the knife that I ended up literally 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:22.490
 a few days ago legs forged 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.470
 slowly trying to forge gaining 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.470
 of experience 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.690
 carbon steel out 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.809
 carbon steel unalloyed 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.730
 so 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.530
 the film will need some care 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:52.399
 wipe it constantly not wipe 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.399
 leave wet places 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.280
 materials 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:10.500
 glove box bath rusting steel 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:15.810
 handle type birch drip on the edges 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.400
 middle set of thick oak veneer 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.240
 he doesn't veneer a little bit different 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.610
 called 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.080
 I do not remember exactly decided 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.250
 experiment with such here 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.520
 I used to make birch bark 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.230
 now bark stocks over decided 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.950
 try here so we are whole too me 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:38.030
 I liked it very well 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.030
 looks nice 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:47.780
 even appeared the effect is as if mishandled 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:49.970
 Fracture layers when I get 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:56.350
 these stripes change places light and 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.350
 dark can be seen while turning 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.330
 so that the total length is the total 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.100
 about 29 centimeters 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.690
 herself 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.690
 the wedge itself is almost 17 centimeters 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.400
 butt thickness 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.480
 it turns out three and a half millimeters 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.940
 concave descents 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.940
 concave lens 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.269
 In general, here is such a copy 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.780
 turned out 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.780
 creator of everything 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.000
 Thanks for attention
