00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
to see what I can do I'm going to try

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.590 
to see what I can do I'm going to try
resetting<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.930> tablet<00:01:43.090> maybe<00:01:44.090> factory

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
resetting the tablet maybe factory

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.890 
resetting the tablet maybe factory
resetting<00:01:45.110> it<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:46.070> then<00:01:46.490> factory<00:01:47.240> setting<00:01:47.750> it

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
resetting it and then factory setting it

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.440 
resetting it and then factory setting it
through<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.470> SD<00:01:48.830> card<00:01:49.130> if<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:50.000> can<00:01:50.150> find<00:01:50.360> the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
through the SD card if I can find the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.190 
through the SD card if I can find the
firmware<00:01:51.070> Acer<00:01:52.070> hides<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.810> they<00:01:53.810> don't<00:01:53.990> make

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
firmware Acer hides the they don't make

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.770 
firmware Acer hides the they don't make
the<00:01:54.500> firmware<00:01:55.430> readily<00:01:56.119> available<00:01:56.210> on<00:01:56.690> the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
the firmware readily available on the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.060 
the firmware readily available on the
website<00:01:57.170> anymore<00:01:57.619> so<00:01:58.330> it's<00:01:59.330> going<00:01:59.509> to<00:01:59.570> be<00:01:59.810> a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
website anymore so it's going to be a

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.979 
website anymore so it's going to be a
fun<00:02:01.150> time<00:02:02.150> trying<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.810> look<00:02:02.930> for<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.229> firmware
