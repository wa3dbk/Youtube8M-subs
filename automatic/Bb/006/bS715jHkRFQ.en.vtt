00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
in regards to both so it's just the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.199 
in regards to both so it's just the
great<00:02:58.650> overall<00:02:58.950> tactic<00:02:59.549> and<00:02:59.669> I<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.909> see<00:03:00.090> me

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
great overall tactic and I you see me

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.699 
great overall tactic and I you see me
here<00:03:00.329> just<00:03:00.540> going<00:03:00.750> around<00:03:00.840> from<00:03:01.139> flag<00:03:01.349> to<00:03:01.500> flag

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
here just going around from flag to flag

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.729 
here just going around from flag to flag
and<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.099> keeping<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.849> enemy<00:03:03.120> busy<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:04.530> we're

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
and and keeping the enemy busy it we're

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.429 
and and keeping the enemy busy it we're
kind<00:03:04.949> of<00:03:05.010> like<00:03:05.159> doing<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.760> cat<00:03:06.689> chase<00:03:06.989> here<00:03:07.260> it's

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
kind of like doing a cat chase here it's

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.679 
kind of like doing a cat chase here it's
just<00:03:07.530> like<00:03:07.889> we<00:03:08.129> go<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.400> one-flag<00:03:08.790> try<00:03:09.629> to

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
just like we go to one-flag try to

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.300 
just like we go to one-flag try to
convert<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.199> and<00:03:10.290> then<00:03:10.439> they<00:03:10.590> go<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.799> our<00:03:10.889> flags

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
convert it and then they go to our flags

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.069 
convert it and then they go to our flags
on<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.579> other<00:03:11.819> side<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.269> convert<00:03:12.719> that<00:03:12.750> and

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
on the other side and convert that and

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.670 
on the other side and convert that and
it's<00:03:13.439> really<00:03:13.650> hard<00:03:13.739> in<00:03:14.189> a<00:03:15.090> mode<00:03:15.269> like<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:15.719> 64

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
it's really hard in a mode like this 64

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.140 
it's really hard in a mode like this 64
player<00:03:16.980> especially<00:03:17.219> with<00:03:17.549> battlefield<00:03:17.849> 3

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
player especially with battlefield 3

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.170 
player especially with battlefield 3
because<00:03:18.780> there's<00:03:18.959> no<00:03:19.169> commander<00:03:19.939> that<00:03:20.939> makes

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
because there's no commander that makes

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.550 
because there's no commander that makes
it<00:03:21.329> difficult<00:03:21.510> for<00:03:21.900> each<00:03:21.959> team<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.319> know

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
it difficult for each team to know

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.020 
it difficult for each team to know
exactly<00:03:22.680> or<00:03:23.069> what<00:03:23.219> squads<00:03:23.609> are<00:03:23.790> supposed<00:03:24.000> to

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
exactly or what squads are supposed to

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.449 
exactly or what squads are supposed to
be<00:03:24.120> doing<00:03:24.449> and<00:03:24.569> and<00:03:25.319> it's<00:03:25.680> also<00:03:26.189> difficult

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
be doing and and it's also difficult

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.679 
be doing and and it's also difficult
that<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.879> fact<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.299> don't<00:03:27.479> actually

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
that the fact that you don't actually

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:29.960 
that the fact that you don't actually
spawn<00:03:28.259> in<00:03:28.379> the<00:03:28.470> game<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.889> a<00:03:29.220> squad<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.639> have<00:03:29.819> to

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
spawn in the game in a squad you have to

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.819 
spawn in the game in a squad you have to
manually<00:03:30.329> do<00:03:30.509> it<00:03:30.629> so<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.049> get<00:03:31.109> most<00:03:31.470> people

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
manually do it so you get most people

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.710 
manually do it so you get most people
especially<00:03:32.099> pub<00:03:32.459> players<00:03:32.729> who<00:03:33.000> are<00:03:33.120> really

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
especially pub players who are really

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.059 
especially pub players who are really
not<00:03:33.810> aware<00:03:34.169> that<00:03:34.409> they're<00:03:34.560> actually<00:03:34.859> in<00:03:34.889> a

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
not aware that they're actually in a

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.509 
not aware that they're actually in a
squad<00:03:35.599> go<00:03:36.599> in<00:03:36.780> one<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.680> who<00:03:37.889> is<00:03:37.979> really<00:03:38.250> the

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
squad go in one so who is really the

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.640 
squad go in one so who is really the
teamwork<00:03:38.939> is<00:03:39.209> very<00:03:39.419> difficult<00:03:39.689> here<00:03:40.169> and<00:03:40.319> it's

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
teamwork is very difficult here and it's

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.050 
teamwork is very difficult here and it's
hard<00:03:40.859> if<00:03:40.979> you're<00:03:41.099> going<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.459> be<00:03:41.549> playing<00:03:41.699> a

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
hard if you're going to be playing a

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.110 
to be playing with its it's going to be
a<00:04:04.139> lot<00:04:04.319> more<00:04:04.349> stressing<00:04:05.189> for<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.519> stressful

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
a lot more stressing for you stressful

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.830 
a lot more stressing for you stressful
if<00:04:06.689> you're<00:04:06.870> someone<00:04:07.349> who<00:04:07.500> really<00:04:07.769> relies<00:04:08.310> or

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
if you're someone who really relies or

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.300 
if you're someone who really relies or
likes<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.989> heavily<00:04:10.290> rely<00:04:10.530> on<00:04:10.650> your<00:04:10.769> teamwork

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
likes to heavily rely on your teamwork

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.740 
likes to heavily rely on your teamwork
yeah<00:04:11.639> I<00:04:11.669> mean<00:04:11.969> obviously<00:04:12.180> it's<00:04:12.509> a<00:04:12.540> team<00:04:12.719> game

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
yeah I mean obviously it's a team game

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.409 
yeah I mean obviously it's a team game
so<00:04:13.079> you<00:04:13.199> really<00:04:13.560> need<00:04:13.709> that<00:04:13.769> to<00:04:14.609> kind<00:04:15.329> of

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
so you really need that to kind of

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.990 
so you really need that to kind of
compensate<00:04:16.019> for<00:04:16.049> a<00:04:16.620> map<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:17.489> this<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:17.940> a

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
compensate for a map like this and a

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.539 
compensate for a map like this and a
game<00:04:18.209> like<00:04:18.389> this<00:04:18.449> so<00:04:19.229> right<00:04:19.979> here<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.159> see<00:04:20.430> me

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
game like this so right here you see me

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.180 
game like this so right here you see me
using<00:04:20.759> the<00:04:21.030> ma<00:04:21.690> vie<00:04:21.840> as<00:04:22.079> usual<00:04:22.530> that's<00:04:22.740> kind<00:04:23.099> of

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
using the ma vie as usual that's kind of

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.230 
using the ma vie as usual that's kind of
like<00:04:23.370> my<00:04:23.610> standard<00:04:25.400> tactic<00:04:26.400> and<00:04:26.580> playing<00:04:27.030> this

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
like my standard tactic and playing this

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.540 
like my standard tactic and playing this
and<00:04:27.449> it<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:27.900> did<00:04:28.349> find<00:04:28.590> out<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.070> nav<00:04:29.400> is

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
and it I did find out that the nav is

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.939 
and it I did find out that the nav is
also<00:04:30.029> very<00:04:30.240> important<00:04:30.900> for<00:04:31.139> competitive<00:04:31.740> play

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
also very important for competitive play

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.640 
also very important for competitive play
a<00:04:32.159> lot<00:04:32.490> of<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.729> top<00:04:32.940> teams<00:04:33.180> are<00:04:33.389> using<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:33.900> they

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
a lot of the top teams are using it they

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.420 
a lot of the top teams are using it they
only<00:04:34.830> run<00:04:35.099> the

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
only run the

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.790 
only run the
just<00:04:36.000> for<00:04:36.300> that<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.750> nav<00:04:37.140> and<00:04:37.320> they'll<00:04:37.650> kind

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
just for that the nav and they'll kind

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.710 
just for that the nav and they'll kind
of<00:04:37.950> use<00:04:38.070> a<00:04:38.100> secondary<00:04:38.580> kit<00:04:38.940> or<00:04:39.120> an<00:04:39.270> all<00:04:39.420> kits

competitive<00:04:44.340> play<00:04:44.520> from<00:04:44.790> to<00:04:45.450> my<00:04:45.570> knowledge

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
competitive play from to my knowledge

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.430 
competitive play from to my knowledge
it's<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.410> very<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.800> looked<00:04:47.310> as<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.520> very<00:04:47.880> weak

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440

it's only for the catch it's not

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.780 
it's only for the catch it's not
primarily<00:05:24.720> for<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.050> weapons<00:05:25.410> it<00:05:26.250> in<00:05:26.460> a<00:05:26.550> map

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
primarily for the weapons it in a map

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.400 
primarily for the weapons it in a map
like<00:05:26.970> this<00:05:27.030> though<00:05:27.420> I<00:05:27.630> would<00:05:27.930> say<00:05:28.110> it's<00:05:28.320> very

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
like this though I would say it's very

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.230 
like this though I would say it's very
important<00:05:29.100> to<00:05:29.130> run<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.550> engineer<00:05:29.970> engineer

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
important to run the engineer engineer

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.630 
important to run the engineer engineer
kind<00:05:30.720> of<00:05:30.810> dominates<00:05:31.350> most<00:05:31.620> battlefield<00:05:32.430> maps

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
kind of dominates most battlefield maps

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.550 
kind of dominates most battlefield maps
because<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.570> has<00:05:33.690> all<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:34.020> tools<00:05:34.200> that<00:05:34.440> are

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
because it has all the tools that are

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.410 
because it has all the tools that are
necessary<00:05:34.770> to<00:05:35.280> take<00:05:35.460> out<00:05:35.670> vehicles<00:05:36.150> which<00:05:36.300> are

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
necessary to take out vehicles which are

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.620 
necessary to take out vehicles which are
very<00:05:36.570> important<00:05:37.020> in<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.200> game<00:05:37.320> like<00:05:37.470> this<00:05:37.650> so

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
very important in the game like this so

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.110 
very important in the game like this so
yeah<00:05:39.630> you'll<00:05:39.960> notice<00:05:40.200> most<00:05:40.530> most<00:05:41.250> players<00:05:41.580> if

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
yeah you'll notice most most players if

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.030 
yeah you'll notice most most players if
they<00:05:42.480> want<00:05:42.840> to<00:05:42.930> play<00:05:43.880> you<00:05:44.880> know<00:05:44.910> to<00:05:45.060> win<00:05:46.040> it's

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
they want to play you know to win it's

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.550 
they want to play you know to win it's
either<00:05:47.190> the<00:05:47.370> assault<00:05:47.730> or<00:05:47.940> the<00:05:48.750> engineer<00:05:49.320> that

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
either the assault or the engineer that

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.470 
either the assault or the engineer that
those<00:05:49.770> are<00:05:49.890> just<00:05:49.980> the<00:05:50.100> two<00:05:50.310> primary<00:05:50.490> kits<00:05:51.300> that

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
those are just the two primary kits that

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.330 
those are just the two primary kits that
have<00:05:51.540> dominated<00:05:51.800> always<00:05:52.800> dominated<00:05:53.220> in

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
have dominated always dominated in

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.460 
have dominated always dominated in
battlefield<00:05:53.760> in<00:05:54.480> the<00:05:54.600> previous<00:05:54.870> battlefields

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
battlefield in the previous battlefields

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.200 
battlefield in the previous battlefields
they've<00:05:55.590> always<00:05:55.980> been<00:05:56.130> the<00:05:56.610> most<00:05:56.760> dominant

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
they've always been the most dominant

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.700 
they've always been the most dominant
classes<00:05:57.450> the<00:05:58.350> most<00:05:58.500> useful<00:05:58.740> 114<00:05:59.400> play

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
classes the most useful 114 play

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.630 
classes the most useful 114 play
previous<00:06:01.710> ones<00:06:01.890> had<00:06:02.040> different<00:06:02.340> names<00:06:02.370> for

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
previous ones had different names for

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.330 
previous ones had different names for
the<00:06:02.850> classes<00:06:03.480> obviously<00:06:04.170> but<00:06:04.350> it<00:06:04.560> was<00:06:05.130> always

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
the classes obviously but it was always

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.330 
the classes obviously but it was always
you<00:06:05.790> know<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.030> assault<00:06:06.360> or<00:06:06.600> the<00:06:06.690> engineer

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
you know the assault or the engineer

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.390 
you know the assault or the engineer
being<00:06:08.340> the<00:06:08.460> ones<00:06:08.640> running<00:06:08.970> the<00:06:09.060> field<00:06:09.270> and<00:06:10.400> and

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
being the ones running the field and and

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.580 
being the ones running the field and and
you'll<00:06:11.640> see<00:06:11.850> that<00:06:11.880> it's<00:06:12.630> also<00:06:12.810> very<00:06:13.080> important

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
you'll see that it's also very important

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.680 
you'll see that it's also very important
here<00:06:13.740> I<00:06:13.920> on<00:06:14.370> the<00:06:14.400> other<00:06:14.520> hand<00:06:14.670> I've<00:06:15.450> always

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
here I on the other hand I've always

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.380 
here I on the other hand I've always
been<00:06:16.050> the<00:06:16.320> more<00:06:16.890> infantry<00:06:17.340> type<00:06:17.610> player<00:06:17.880> so

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
been the more infantry type player so

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.450 
been the more infantry type player so
I've<00:06:18.660> always<00:06:18.870> hopped<00:06:19.200> around<00:06:19.320> between<00:06:19.950> kits

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
I've always hopped around between kits

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.210 
I've always hopped around between kits
just<00:06:20.820> to<00:06:21.030> whatever<00:06:21.690> I<00:06:21.780> was<00:06:22.320> needed<00:06:22.770> to<00:06:22.800> help

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
just to whatever I was needed to help

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.410 
just to whatever I was needed to help
the<00:06:23.340> team<00:06:23.550> win<00:06:24.440> and<00:06:25.440> it<00:06:25.950> wasn't<00:06:26.370> until<00:06:26.490> I<00:06:26.910> know

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.420 
the team win and it wasn't until I know

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.090 
the team win and it wasn't until I know
many<00:06:27.660> of<00:06:27.720> you<00:06:27.780> guys<00:06:27.930> know<00:06:27.990> until<00:06:28.470> bad<00:06:28.650> company

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
many of you guys know until bad company

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.130 
many of you guys know until bad company
until<00:06:29.760> I<00:06:29.790> started<00:06:30.060> picking<00:06:30.360> up<00:06:30.480> the<00:06:30.570> recon<00:06:30.900> kit

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
until I started picking up the recon kit

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.710 
until I started picking up the recon kit
and<00:06:31.320> playing<00:06:31.590> that<00:06:31.740> heavily<00:06:32.180> because<00:06:33.180> it<00:06:33.330> was

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
and playing that heavily because it was

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.110 
and playing that heavily because it was
the<00:06:33.840> first<00:06:33.870> game<00:06:34.740> first<00:06:35.310> series<00:06:35.760> up<00:06:36.090> to

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
the first game first series up to

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.880 
the first game first series up to
battlefield<00:06:36.690> that<00:06:36.870> the<00:06:37.020> Recon<00:06:37.410> itself

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
battlefield that the Recon itself

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.530 
battlefield that the Recon itself
actually<00:06:38.210> became<00:06:39.210> a<00:06:39.890> a<00:06:40.890> really<00:06:41.550> good<00:06:41.790> kit<00:06:42.390> to

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
actually became a a really good kit to

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.820 
actually became a a really good kit to
use<00:06:43.160> so<00:06:44.160> about<00:06:45.090> you<00:06:45.330> know<00:06:45.420> again<00:06:45.780> I<00:06:45.810> think<00:06:46.320> dice

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
use so about you know again I think dice

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.119 
use so about you know again I think dice
has<00:06:47.310> been<00:06:47.580> going<00:06:48.180> back<00:06:48.390> to<00:06:48.630> what

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:49.129 
has been going back to what

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.669 
has been going back to what
traditionally<00:06:49.819> the<00:06:50.089> Recon<00:06:50.419> was<00:06:50.659> well<00:06:51.529> it's

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:51.679 
traditionally the Recon was well it's

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:53.439 
traditionally the Recon was well it's
not<00:06:51.800> record<00:06:52.099> I<00:06:52.249> wasn't<00:06:52.429> recon<00:06:52.789> in<00:06:52.939> traditional

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449 
not record I wasn't recon in traditional

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:56.019 
not record I wasn't recon in traditional
battlefield<00:06:53.899> on<00:06:54.110> the<00:06:54.559> recon<00:06:54.889> is<00:06:55.129> supposedly

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:56.029 
battlefield on the recon is supposedly

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:57.729 
battlefield on the recon is supposedly
what<00:06:56.449> dice<00:06:56.599> likes<00:06:56.839> to<00:06:56.959> say<00:06:57.080> is<00:06:57.199> a<00:06:57.229> class<00:06:57.499> that's

00:06:57.729 --> 00:06:57.739 
what dice likes to say is a class that's

00:06:57.739 --> 00:07:01.419 
what dice likes to say is a class that's
supposed<00:06:58.099> to<00:06:58.219> be<00:06:58.719> mobile<00:06:59.719> you<00:07:00.679> know<00:07:00.800> whether

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:01.429 
supposed to be mobile you know whether

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:03.639 
supposed to be mobile you know whether
you're<00:07:01.580> going<00:07:01.789> to<00:07:01.849> be<00:07:02.050> shooting<00:07:03.050> your<00:07:03.229> targets

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:03.649 
you're going to be shooting your targets

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:04.839 
you're going to be shooting your targets
from<00:07:03.769> one<00:07:03.979> direction<00:07:04.099> you're<00:07:04.489> going<00:07:04.519> to<00:07:04.669> be

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:04.849 
from one direction you're going to be

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:06.519 
from one direction you're going to be
moving<00:07:04.999> from<00:07:05.330> that<00:07:05.449> direction<00:07:05.599> and<00:07:06.080> you're

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:06.529 
moving from that direction and you're

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:09.009 
moving from that direction and you're
always<00:07:06.679> on<00:07:07.069> the<00:07:07.249> go<00:07:07.429> and<00:07:07.669> so<00:07:08.360> that's<00:07:08.869> a<00:07:08.989> really

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:09.019 
always on the go and so that's a really

00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:11.169 
always on the go and so that's a really
interesting<00:07:09.550> perspective<00:07:10.550> the<00:07:10.639> dice<00:07:10.819> is<00:07:10.969> put

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:11.179 
interesting perspective the dice is put

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:13.089 
interesting perspective the dice is put
on<00:07:11.300> the<00:07:11.509> the<00:07:11.989> sniper<00:07:12.259> class<00:07:12.529> or<00:07:12.769> the<00:07:12.800> scout

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:13.099 
on the the sniper class or the scout

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.850 
on the the sniper class or the scout
class<00:07:13.249> from<00:07:14.059> traditional<00:07:14.869> battlefield<00:07:15.319> but

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
class from traditional battlefield but

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.159 
class from traditional battlefield but
yeah<00:07:16.129> as<00:07:16.399> you<00:07:16.879> can<00:07:16.909> notice<00:07:17.239> that<00:07:17.809> the<00:07:17.959> game

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:18.169 
yeah as you can notice that the game

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830 
to the my next point I know most players

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.790 
to the my next point I know most players
may<00:07:25.069> be<00:07:25.369> frustrated<00:07:26.029> because<00:07:26.649> there's<00:07:27.649> not<00:07:27.740> a

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
may be frustrated because there's not a

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.859 
may be frustrated because there's not a
lot<00:07:28.219> of<00:07:28.249> vehicles<00:07:28.509> compared<00:07:29.509> to<00:07:29.569> the<00:07:29.749> original

00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:29.869 
lot of vehicles compared to the original

00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:31.629 
lot of vehicles compared to the original
design<00:07:30.439> of<00:07:30.589> these<00:07:30.679> maps<00:07:30.919> there<00:07:31.369> was<00:07:31.459> a<00:07:31.490> lot

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:31.639 
design of these maps there was a lot

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:33.730 
design of these maps there was a lot
more<00:07:31.699> vehicles<00:07:32.059> so<00:07:32.779> you'll<00:07:33.169> have<00:07:33.379> a<00:07:33.439> lot<00:07:33.709> of

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:33.740 
more vehicles so you'll have a lot of

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.199 
more vehicles so you'll have a lot of
people<00:07:33.979> who<00:07:34.069> are<00:07:34.339> kind<00:07:34.519> of<00:07:34.669> vehicle<00:07:34.969> lists

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:35.209 
people who are kind of vehicle lists

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:36.969 
people who are kind of vehicle lists
they<00:07:35.419> you<00:07:35.659> know<00:07:35.689> start<00:07:36.139> out<00:07:36.259> spot<00:07:36.679> on<00:07:36.769> the<00:07:36.830> game

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:36.979 
they you know start out spot on the game

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:38.739 
they you know start out spot on the game
they<00:07:37.159> take<00:07:37.309> the<00:07:37.399> vehicles<00:07:37.729> rush<00:07:38.269> the<00:07:38.419> points

00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:38.749 
they take the vehicles rush the points

00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:41.409 
they take the vehicles rush the points
and<00:07:38.929> then<00:07:39.499> they<00:07:39.709> you<00:07:40.699> leave<00:07:40.939> a<00:07:40.969> lot<00:07:41.149> of<00:07:41.240> players

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:41.419 
and then they you leave a lot of players

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:44.019 
and then they you leave a lot of players
without<00:07:41.629> any<00:07:41.929> and<00:07:42.800> so<00:07:43.159> that<00:07:43.550> that<00:07:43.729> can<00:07:43.939> be

00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:44.029 
without any and so that that can be

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:45.790 
without any and so that that can be
frustrating<00:07:44.209> but<00:07:44.599> overall<00:07:44.959> it's<00:07:45.349> just<00:07:45.649> when

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 
frustrating but overall it's just when

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.779 
frustrating but overall it's just when
you<00:07:45.889> can<00:07:46.479> take<00:07:47.479> a<00:07:47.509> vehicle<00:07:48.429> use<00:07:49.429> it<00:07:49.610> to<00:07:49.699> your
