00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.850
 compatible tweets with y os 6.1 good 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.560

 you will know of what there are not many 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:28.650
 good tweets still compatible with and 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:33.050
 6.1 I'm going to show you that I'm like 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.210
 You see here in and I 6.1 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.730
 the first tweet that usually shows 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.340
 call the background and we can 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.100
 find for free in the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.579
 big boss repository ' that I'm going to leave 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.089
 here below good this tweet what it does 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.879
 is to add us in our multitasking a 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:56.680
 button to eliminate the implications 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:01:00.070
 that we have open in second worse 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.470
 as you see when opening my multitasking in the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.500
 left side I see a small 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.830
 button these are the obligations that 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.840
 I have open in the background and for 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.720
 free ram memory and that in our 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.500
 device go more fluid simply 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.900
 clicking the button would eliminate them all 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.700
 and we would save ourselves if we left many 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.260
 open background applications 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.930
 go eliminating them one by one good once 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.350
 that we install this click we have to go 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.190
 to adjustments and adjustments will appear 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.460
 a small menu the background click and 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.410
 masters over him and to show us 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.970
 the little button we would have to 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:49.000
 activate the first two stars this 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.660
 tuit is called mission board 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.930
 and you can find it for free 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.720
 in the blood repository that I 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.900
 I'm going to leave here below this tweet what 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.110
 what it basically does is give another air to 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.050
 our multitasking once what 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.700
 we download we have to choose a method 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.670
 activation 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.070
 I in my case have chosen to slip to the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.410
 right or left in any 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.890
 place as you see we see the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.380
 multitasking in a much more way 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.650
 interesting and we can eliminate the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.470
 applications that we have open as 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.110
 in normal multitasking 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.989
 good as I've told you once you've 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.930
 installed this tweet you have to choose a 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.980
 activation method therefore you have 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.110
 to go to activator and choose for example 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.450
 the me in my case put in any 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.820
 place to slide to the right and 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.700
 select the tweet as you can see 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.730
 here mission board and in sliding to the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.390
 left also 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:02.610
 this tweet is called battle and it allows us 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:07.080
 customize the effect of changing 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.180
 page on our device good this 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.540
 You can download it in a way 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.150
 free in the mayor's repository 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.239
 I'm going to leave it here below and a 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.420
 once you have downloaded this tweet it is very 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.450
 very simple we create a shortcut 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.110
 go as you see here sweep simply 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:33.030
 we would have to click on it and choose the 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:36.120
 effect that we have when going from page to page 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.049
 our device for example I'm going to 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.049
 choose this 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:48.710
 and as you can see the effect changes simply 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.280
 you will have to find the one that most 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.280
 will like 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:04:01.409
 and ready is a click to customize 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.409
 our device is very very well 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.350
 this tweet is called spring to mars and what 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.050
 you can download for free in 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.620
 the internet repository that I am going to 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.950
 leave here in this tweet what it does is 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.370
 give us many customization modes 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.950
 for our device as you see nest 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.520
 what has changed, how can I fit 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.510
 more applications and so on with this 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.120
 tweet 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.130
 you can do a lot of things there is a 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.710
 lots of options as you see for the 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.530
 animations the capabilities the dock the 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.440
 lock screen icons folders 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.670
 multitasking the time machine the bar 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.680
 of state pages themes etc 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.300
 well with this tweet you can 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.970
 do lots of things for example 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.310
 for the dock like I said before 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.100
 fear that has changed we can put 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.620
 a custom number of applications 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.260
 in the domain in my case I put 5 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.560
 we can activate the coverflow effect that 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.130
 this is how you see the 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.370
 demidov applications a little changed 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.180
 they appear more 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:17.600
 in another angle and good is that it has 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.610
 countless addresses for icons 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.040
 for example hide labels 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:26.479
 block the movement disable the 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:29.300
 Balance or disable the uninstall voucher 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:33.500
 for example change the number of icons 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.240
 that we have online and so a lot of 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.910
 options soon for example for 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.270
 folders put a balloon to close it 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:44.389
 hide the preview hide the background 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.460
 it's a really very complete tweet and 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.610
 for those who like to customize 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.680
 our device is really very 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:56.840
 good good a note when for example 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.270
 select a tab voucher or 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.610
 we change anything inside the 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.850
 sprite you take what we have to do 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:08.810
 is to exit give the button reload and do 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:12.380
 a sprint this tweet is called aus and 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:15.170
 we can download it for free 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.630
 in the repository of insanity I'm going to 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.030
 leave here I leave this tweet what it does 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.700
 is to customize our 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.190
 multitask once installed as you see 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.930
 our multitasking changes is worth the way 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.540
 to see the applications that are 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.880
 open in the background simply 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.750
 to eliminate them we would have to slide 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:38.540
 your finger down as you see the 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:42.530
 player also changes and they are 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:45.860
 adds a small option that is for 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:48.290
 interact a little with the options of 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.940
 our device for example would have 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.030
 for wifi in wheats and turn off the 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:57.330
 bluetooth 3g 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:59.939
 Airplane mode mute the phone 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.900
 a small flashlight and so on 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:06.539
 we can raise and lower the brightness of 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.360
 our device is a tweet that is 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:12.210
