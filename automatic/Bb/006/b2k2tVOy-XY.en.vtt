gives<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.180> better<00:02:27.360> idea<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:27.989> that's<00:02:28.140> just

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
gives you a better idea but that's just

a<00:02:31.470> good<00:02:31.680> wing<00:02:31.950> shooting<00:02:32.190> pattern<00:02:32.730> that's<00:02:32.910> not

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
a good wing shooting pattern that's not

a turkey turkey level pattern as far as
I'm<00:02:35.940> concerned<00:02:36.330> but<00:02:36.570> for<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> pheasant<00:02:37.260> out<00:02:38.040> 250
