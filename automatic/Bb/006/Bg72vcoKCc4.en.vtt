00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.940 
I sign in yeah so my homework I have
been<00:01:57.659> doing<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:58.079> lot<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.320> stuff<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.740> doesn't

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
been doing a lot of stuff it doesn't

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.170 
been doing a lot of stuff it doesn't
look<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.100> I've<00:01:59.369> been<00:01:59.430> doing<00:01:59.729> stuff<00:01:59.880> because

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
look like I've been doing stuff because

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.880 
look like I've been doing stuff because
the<00:02:00.240> pile<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.540> pretty<00:02:00.719> much<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> same<00:02:01.140> even

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the pile is pretty much the same even

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.859 
the pile is pretty much the same even
though<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.310> changed<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:03.090> did<00:02:03.450> two<00:02:03.659> more

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
though I have changed I did two more

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.240 
though I have changed I did two more
science<00:02:04.229> tests<00:02:04.409> which<00:02:04.590> are<00:02:04.680> which<00:02:04.950> are<00:02:05.040> over

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
science tests which are which are over

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.789 
science tests which are which are over
here<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.450> did<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.320> retrace<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
here and I did I have to retrace the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.150 
here and I did I have to retrace the
stupid<00:02:08.190> clay<00:02:08.369> and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
uh-huh but this channel as you can see

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.420 
uh-huh but this channel as you can see
it<00:02:42.910> has<00:02:43.090> been<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.600> random<00:02:44.290> crapload<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.100> videos

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
it has been a random crapload of videos

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.700 
it has been a random crapload of videos
you<00:02:45.730> know<00:02:45.820> so<00:02:46.510> there's<00:02:46.690> like<00:02:46.870> um<00:02:47.050> my<00:02:47.470> first

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
you know so there's like um my first

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.140 
you know so there's like um my first
video<00:02:47.950> was<00:02:48.010> actually<00:02:48.160> science<00:02:48.640> experience<00:02:49.030> so

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
video was actually science experience so

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.340 
video was actually science experience so
so<00:02:49.300> I<00:02:49.330> thought<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.930> this<00:02:50.020> would<00:02:50.170> be<00:02:50.230> a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
so I thought that this would be a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.110 
so I thought that this would be a
science<00:02:50.650> channel<00:02:50.920> because<00:02:51.130> when<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.700> was<00:02:51.880> 10<00:02:52.090> I

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
science channel because when I was 10 I

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.770 
science channel because when I was 10 I
was<00:02:52.480> really<00:02:52.690> interested<00:02:53.050> in<00:02:53.170> science<00:02:53.580> but

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
was really interested in science but

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.760 
was really interested in science but
then<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.810> started<00:02:56.050> morphing<00:02:56.410> into<00:02:56.590> other

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
then I started morphing into other

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.020 
then I started morphing into other
things<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.370> then<00:02:57.520> I<00:02:57.580> started<00:02:57.850> liking

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
things and then I started liking

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.790 
things and then I started liking
Domino's<00:02:58.570> so<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:58.840> thought<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.590> would<00:02:59.710> be

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
Domino's so I thought that this would be

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.560 
Domino's so I thought that this would be
a<00:02:59.860> domino<00:03:00.220> channel<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.700> then<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.180> was<00:03:01.480> like

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
a domino channel and then I was like

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.420 
a domino channel and then I was like
screwing<00:03:02.170> up<00:03:02.260> on<00:03:02.380> my<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.500> was<00:03:02.980> doing<00:03:03.160> stuff<00:03:03.250> on

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
screwing up on my I was doing stuff on

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.250 
screwing up on my I was doing stuff on
my<00:03:03.550> ipod<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:03.940> that's<00:03:04.630> why<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:05.020> started

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
my ipod and that's why I just started

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.670 
my ipod and that's why I just started
just<00:03:06.220> putting<00:03:06.490> up<00:03:06.610> random<00:03:07.420> videos<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:08.020> then<00:03:08.650> I

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
just putting up random videos and then I

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.400 
just putting up random videos and then I
thought<00:03:09.130> it<00:03:09.250> would<00:03:09.340> be<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.460> pivot

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
thought it would be a pivot

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.650 
thought it would be a pivot
they<00:03:11.410> bought<00:03:11.620> whatever<00:03:11.980> it's<00:03:12.190> called<00:03:12.660> channel

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
they bought whatever it's called channel

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.840 
they bought whatever it's called channel
because<00:03:13.990> I<00:03:14.320> was<00:03:14.920> doing<00:03:15.070> some<00:03:15.220> animation<00:03:15.670> here

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
because I was doing some animation here

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.790 
because I was doing some animation here
and<00:03:16.120> some<00:03:16.420> tanks<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:16.930> stop-motion<00:03:17.470> animation

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
and some tanks so stop-motion animation

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.740 
and some tanks so stop-motion animation
again<00:03:18.400> stop-motion<00:03:19.060> animation<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.630> stop

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
again stop-motion animation to stop

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.810 
again stop-motion animation to stop
motion<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.080> minute<00:03:20.350> animation<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.010> then<00:03:21.580> I

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
motion a minute animation and then I

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.210 
motion a minute animation and then I
really<00:03:22.330> thought<00:03:22.450> it'd<00:03:22.600> be<00:03:22.630> a<00:03:22.750> nerve

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
really thought it'd be a nerve

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.220 
really thought it'd be a nerve
innervates<00:03:24.220> because<00:03:24.790> like<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.660> nerve<00:03:25.900> review

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
innervates because like a nerve review

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.510 
innervates because like a nerve review
channel<00:03:26.500> because<00:03:26.710> that's<00:03:27.070> what<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.220> was<00:03:27.340> doing

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
channel because that's what I was doing

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.990 
channel because that's what I was doing
here<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:27.990> then<00:03:28.990> I<00:03:29.230> thought<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.070> just<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.820> then

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
here and then I thought it just and then

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.300 
here and then I thought it just and then
I<00:03:31.030> just<00:03:31.270> made<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.510> stink<00:03:32.170> bomb<00:03:32.350> for<00:03:32.650> fun<00:03:32.860> and

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
I just made a stink bomb for fun and

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.650 
I just made a stink bomb for fun and
yeah<00:03:33.460> and<00:03:33.610> as<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:33.880> can<00:03:33.970> see<00:03:34.150> it's<00:03:34.300> just<00:03:34.390> a

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660

the best and Empire is pretty good too

the best and Empire is pretty good too
but<00:07:09.430> Rome<00:07:09.639> I<00:07:09.879> think<00:07:10.300> I<00:07:10.389> think<00:07:10.569> that<00:07:10.659> Empire's<00:07:10.990> a

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
but Rome I think I think that Empire's a

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.629 
but Rome I think I think that Empire's a
little<00:07:11.229> bit<00:07:11.319> better<00:07:11.409> than<00:07:11.620> Rome<00:07:11.830> but<00:07:12.129> Rome

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 
little bit better than Rome but Rome

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.510 
little bit better than Rome but Rome
beats<00:07:12.849> medieval<00:07:13.270> by<00:07:13.780> far<00:07:14.020> and<00:07:14.430> Napoleon<00:07:15.430> and

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 
beats medieval by far and Napoleon and

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.850 
beats medieval by far and Napoleon and
Napoleon's<00:07:15.940> is<00:07:16.060> just<00:07:16.240> a<00:07:16.389> version<00:07:17.259> of<00:07:17.500> vampire

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
Napoleon's is just a version of vampire

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.980 
Napoleon's is just a version of vampire
except<00:07:18.190> it's<00:07:18.310> in<00:07:18.370> a<00:07:18.460> different<00:07:18.610> age<00:07:18.879> so<00:07:19.750> but<00:07:19.960> I
