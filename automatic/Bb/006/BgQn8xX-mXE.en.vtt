it will it will give them at sharp

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.690 
it will it will give them at sharp
angles<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.620> like<00:02:13.830> I'm<00:02:14.190> telling<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.550> watch

angles to like I'm telling you watch
this<00:02:14.850> I'll<00:02:15.000> shoot<00:02:15.150> over<00:02:15.270> here<00:02:15.540> oh<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:17.190> was<00:02:17.370> a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
this I'll shoot over here oh that was a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.030 
this I'll shoot over here oh that was a
really<00:02:17.700> sharp<00:02:17.970> angle<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.720> yeah<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.830> is

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
really sharp angle so yeah this this is

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.710 
really sharp angle so yeah this this is
the<00:02:20.190> homing<00:02:20.490> bow<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.910> it's<00:02:21.030> such<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.540> great

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
the homing bow and it's such a great

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.440 
the homing bow and it's such a great
feature<00:02:22.080> actually<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.700> only<00:02:23.970> costs<00:02:24.270> three

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
feature actually it only costs three

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.300 
feature actually it only costs three
diamonds<00:02:24.660> but<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.050> mean<00:02:25.260> diamond<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:25.980> precious

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
diamonds but I mean diamond is precious

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.950 
diamonds but I mean diamond is precious
and<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.760> seems<00:02:26.970> like<00:02:27.150> something<00:02:27.390> good<00:02:27.750> you'd

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
and that seems like something good you'd

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.570 
and that seems like something good you'd
waste<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.530> except<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.310> wouldn't<00:02:29.520> be

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
waste it on except you wouldn't be

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.490 
waste it on except you wouldn't be
wasting<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:30.060> because<00:02:30.210> it's<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.450> good<00:02:30.630> item<00:02:30.900> so

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
wasting it because it's a good item so

yeah the and I did show you the element
or<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.570> explosive<00:02:36.570> arrow<00:02:37.130> that<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.370> our<00:02:38.490> first

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
or the explosive arrow that is our first

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.220 
or the explosive arrow that is our first
arrow<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.270> now<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.360> won't<00:02:39.630> use<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.870> humming<00:02:40.110> go

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
big I mean I think it's just about as

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.880 
big I mean I think it's just about as
big<00:02:47.100> as<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.310> TTI<00:02:48.000> looks<00:02:48.900> larger<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.470> me<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.620> don't

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
big as a TTI looks larger to me I don't

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.460 
big as a TTI looks larger to me I don't
know<00:02:49.950> why<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.190> mean<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:50.930> imac<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.110> might<00:02:52.260> not<00:02:52.410> be

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
know why I mean I imac it might not be

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.860 
know why I mean I imac it might not be
but<00:02:52.980> he<00:02:53.250> knows<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:53.970> pretty<00:02:54.209> big<00:02:54.330> explosion

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
but he knows it's pretty big explosion

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.270 
but he knows it's pretty big explosion
and<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.200> takes<00:02:55.380> care<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.709> problem<00:02:56.130> so

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
and it takes care of the problem so

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.130 
and it takes care of the problem so
check<00:02:56.430> out<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.670> sheep<00:02:56.850> over<00:02:57.090> there<00:02:57.240> he's

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
gone he's dead he's dead he will never

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.360 
gone he's dead he's dead he will never
exist<00:03:00.270> again<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:00.840> minecraft<00:03:01.080> world<00:03:01.500> soho

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370

yeah<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:03.060> explosive<00:03:03.690> arrow<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.080> great

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
yeah that explosive arrow is great

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.560 
yeah that explosive arrow is great
probably<00:03:05.160> my<00:03:05.250> favorite<00:03:05.520> era<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.880> we'll<00:03:06.450> move

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
probably my favorite era and we'll move

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.810 
probably my favorite era and we'll move
on<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.900> Sarah<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.670> exactly

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
on to the I Sarah and this is exactly

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.780 
on to the I Sarah and this is exactly
why<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.360> set<00:03:09.870> up<00:03:10.020> this<00:03:10.260> lava<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:11.130> torch<00:03:11.490> field

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
why I set up this lava and torch field

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.390 
why I set up this lava and torch field
down<00:03:12.000> here<00:03:12.300> is<00:03:12.420> because<00:03:12.959> this<00:03:13.650> arrow<00:03:13.920> will<00:03:14.220> get

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
down here is because this arrow will get

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.240 
down here is because this arrow will get
rid<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.610> any<00:03:15.110> any<00:03:16.110> lava<00:03:16.470> will<00:03:16.769> turn<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.040> into<00:03:17.160> a

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
rid of any any lava will turn it into a

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.910 
rid of any any lava will turn it into a
obsidian<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.209> will<00:03:18.360> freeze<00:03:18.690> water<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.440> will

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
obsidian it will freeze water it will

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.009 
obsidian it will freeze water it will
take<00:03:20.160> out<00:03:20.280> torches<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.910> put<00:03:21.120> out<00:03:21.209> fires<00:03:21.480> so

take out torches and put out fires so
I'll<00:03:22.530> just<00:03:22.590> shoot<00:03:23.100> in<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.430> lava<00:03:23.640> down<00:03:23.910> here

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
I'll just shoot in this lava down here

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.280 
I'll just shoot in this lava down here
oh<00:03:24.650> whoops<00:03:25.970> wrong<00:03:26.970> arrow<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.420> don't<00:03:27.810> why<00:03:28.080> why

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
oh whoops wrong arrow I don't why why

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.009 
oh whoops wrong arrow I don't why why
did<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.560> even<00:03:28.709> occur<00:03:29.010> okay<00:03:29.820> hopefully<00:03:30.630> does

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
did that even occur okay hopefully does

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.280 
did that even occur okay hopefully does
it<00:03:31.140> still<00:03:31.560> work<00:03:31.590> Oh<00:03:31.980> No<00:03:32.760> let's<00:03:33.180> try<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.390> no<00:03:34.170> it

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
it still work Oh No let's try the no it

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.840 
it still work Oh No let's try the no it
still<00:03:34.470> didn't<00:03:34.650> work<00:03:34.709> let's<00:03:35.370> just<00:03:35.519> let's<00:03:35.790> just

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
still didn't work let's just let's just

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.509 
still didn't work let's just let's just
get<00:03:36.239> rid<00:03:36.510> of<00:03:36.570> this<00:03:36.870> explosive<00:03:37.350> airily<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.130> don't

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
get rid of this explosive airily I don't

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:39.920 
get rid of this explosive airily I don't
even<00:03:38.580> know<00:03:38.790> why<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.090> happened<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.450> tested<00:03:39.810> the

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
even know why that happened I tested the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.690 
even know why that happened I tested the
earlier<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.380> it<00:03:40.470> worked<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.980> guess<00:03:41.430> we<00:03:41.580> have<00:03:41.670> to

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
earlier and it worked I guess we have to

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.690 
earlier and it worked I guess we have to
get<00:03:41.850> our<00:03:42.000> arrows<00:03:42.299> one<00:03:42.510> at<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.690> time<00:03:42.900> okay<00:03:43.500> so

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
get our arrows one at the time okay so

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.640 
get our arrows one at the time okay so
as<00:03:44.700> you've<00:03:45.120> seen<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.480> recipe<00:03:45.660> for<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.230> 0

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
as you've seen the recipe for the I 0

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.820 
as you've seen the recipe for the I 0
let's<00:03:47.220> actually<00:03:47.489> show<00:03:47.880> what<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.180> does<00:03:48.709> here<00:03:49.709> we

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
let's actually show what it does here we

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.330 
let's actually show what it does here we
go<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:51.019> it<00:03:52.019> turned<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.290> love<00:03:52.890> into<00:03:53.040> some

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
go and it turned that love into some

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.789 
go and it turned that love into some
nice<00:03:53.670> obsidian<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.330> I<00:03:54.600> believe<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.200> more<00:03:55.530> you

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
nice obsidian and I believe the more you

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.490 
nice obsidian and I believe the more you
charge<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.340> up<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:57.060> more<00:03:57.269> area<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.959> will<00:03:58.080> cover

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
charge it up the more area it will cover

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.759 
charge it up the more area it will cover
I<00:03:59.150> think<00:04:00.150> maybe<00:04:00.540> not<00:04:00.780> cuz<00:04:01.049> I<00:04:01.110> did<00:04:01.320> only<00:04:01.440> put

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
I think maybe not cuz I did only put

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.550 
I think maybe not cuz I did only put
yeah<00:04:02.370> okay<00:04:02.820> let's<00:04:03.180> try<00:04:03.269> this<00:04:06.080> okay<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.110> think<00:04:07.290> a

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
yeah okay let's try this okay I think a

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.140 
yeah okay let's try this okay I think a
look<00:04:07.709> check<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:07.920> out<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.340> longer<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.820> hold<00:04:08.850> it

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
look check it out the longer you hold it

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.630 
look check it out the longer you hold it
yeah<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.780> more<00:04:09.930> area<00:04:10.530> covers<00:04:10.920> it<00:04:11.220> will<00:04:11.370> cover

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
yeah the more area covers it will cover

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.880 
yeah the more area covers it will cover
I<00:04:11.760> think<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.180> think<00:04:12.450> that's<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:12.690> 3<00:04:12.900> by<00:04:13.019> 3<00:04:13.049> is<00:04:13.440> the

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
I think I think that's a 3 by 3 is the

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.710 
I think I think that's a 3 by 3 is the
total<00:04:14.220> arrow<00:04:14.489> it<00:04:14.730> will<00:04:14.760> cut<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.239> mean<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.480> area

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
total arrow it will cut I mean the area

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.900 
total arrow it will cut I mean the area
it<00:04:15.930> will<00:04:16.049> cover<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:17.400> would<00:04:17.549> be<00:04:17.580> the<00:04:17.790> ice

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
it will cover and that would be the ice

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.670 
it will cover and that would be the ice
arrow<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.540> check<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.080> out<00:04:19.109> I'll<00:04:19.289> take<00:04:19.410> out<00:04:19.560> one

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
arrow and check it out I'll take out one

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.979 
arrow and check it out I'll take out one
of<00:04:19.709> these<00:04:19.830> torches<00:04:20.479> yeah<00:04:21.479> it<00:04:21.690> takes<00:04:21.840> out

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
of these torches yeah it takes out

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.230 
of these torches yeah it takes out
torches<00:04:22.349> puts<00:04:22.530> out<00:04:22.650> fires<00:04:22.890> turns<00:04:23.280> ice<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:24.090> it

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
torches puts out fires turns ice and it

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.310 
torches puts out fires turns ice and it
turns<00:04:24.419> water<00:04:24.570> into<00:04:24.690> eyes<00:04:24.960> too

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
turns water into eyes too

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.560 
turns water into eyes too
slaven<00:04:25.740> obsidian<00:04:26.250> it's<00:04:26.670> pretty<00:04:26.970> useful<00:04:27.090> arrow

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
slaven obsidian it's pretty useful arrow

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.060 
slaven obsidian it's pretty useful arrow
I<00:04:27.690> mean<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.050> depends<00:04:28.290> what<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.500> purpose<00:04:28.950> is

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
I mean it depends what the purpose is

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.520 
I mean it depends what the purpose is
for<00:04:29.280> so<00:04:29.970> let's<00:04:30.300> go<00:04:30.450> ahead<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:30.660> go<00:04:30.900> get<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.440> the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
for so let's go ahead and go get to the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.590 
for so let's go ahead and go get to the
next<00:04:31.740> arrow<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.460> will<00:04:32.640> be<00:04:33.000> I<00:04:33.030> guess<00:04:33.390> the

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
next arrow and that will be I guess the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.560 
next arrow and that will be I guess the
fire<00:04:33.930> arrow<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:35.280> fire<00:04:35.460> arrow<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.210> really<00:04:36.420> cool

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
fire arrow the fire arrow is really cool

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.570 
fire arrow the fire arrow is really cool
it<00:04:36.720> pretty<00:04:36.870> much<00:04:36.990> just<00:04:37.200> ignites<00:04:37.680> mobs<00:04:38.070> on<00:04:38.340> fire

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
it pretty much just ignites mobs on fire

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.230 
it pretty much just ignites mobs on fire
so<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.840> don't<00:04:40.200> on<00:04:40.320> me<00:04:40.640> it<00:04:41.640> really<00:04:41.790> ignites

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
so I don't on me it really ignites

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.270 
so I don't on me it really ignites
anything<00:04:42.660> on<00:04:42.750> fire<00:04:42.900> as<00:04:43.050> you<00:04:43.110> can<00:04:43.260> see<00:04:43.500> i<00:04:43.740> missed

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
anything on fire as you can see i missed

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.780 
anything on fire as you can see i missed
and<00:04:44.550> it's<00:04:44.790> just<00:04:44.970> hitting<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.240> grass<00:04:45.920> but<00:04:46.920> sefa

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
and it's just hitting the grass but sefa

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.750 
and it's just hitting the grass but sefa
if<00:04:48.030> so<00:04:48.210> see<00:04:48.390> if<00:04:48.480> I<00:04:48.540> can<00:04:48.690> get<00:04:48.780> some<00:04:48.840> aim<00:04:49.170> on<00:04:49.410> this

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
if so see if I can get some aim on this

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.190 
if so see if I can get some aim on this
there<00:04:50.760> we<00:04:50.850> go<00:04:50.970> got<00:04:51.210> him<00:04:51.360> let's<00:04:51.750> get<00:04:51.900> that<00:04:51.990> big

tree<00:04:56.790> over<00:04:56.820> there<00:04:57.060> we'll<00:04:57.300> try<00:04:58.280> they<00:04:59.280> get<00:04:59.490> it<00:04:59.610> I

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
tree over there we'll try they get it I

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.900 
tree over there we'll try they get it I
don't<00:05:00.840> think<00:05:00.900> so<00:05:01.200> yeah<00:05:02.070> there<00:05:02.280> we<00:05:02.340> go<00:05:02.400> got<00:05:02.730> that

alright so moving on to the next area
that's<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.120> fire<00:05:09.330> area<00:05:09.600> we<00:05:10.470> got<00:05:10.650> see<00:05:11.400> let's<00:05:11.820> do

ignite things with lightning so it's

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.930 
ignite things with lightning so it's
it's<00:05:20.880> pretty<00:05:21.150> neat<00:05:21.500> it<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.860> it's<00:05:23.340> really<00:05:23.550> cool

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
it's pretty neat it is it's really cool

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.140 
it's pretty neat it is it's really cool
but<00:05:24.270> I<00:05:24.330> mean<00:05:24.420> it's<00:05:24.900> crafting<00:05:25.470> is<00:05:25.820> it's<00:05:26.820> pretty

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
but I mean it's crafting is it's pretty

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.810 
but I mean it's crafting is it's pretty
special<00:05:27.420> so<00:05:27.840> I<00:05:27.870> mean<00:05:28.170> use<00:05:28.770> these<00:05:29.040> I<00:05:29.280> guess<00:05:29.580> to

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
special so I mean use these I guess to

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.000 
special so I mean use these I guess to
your<00:05:30.000> advantage<00:05:30.630> because<00:05:30.990> lightnings<00:05:31.770> pretty

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
your advantage because lightnings pretty

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.800 
your advantage because lightnings pretty
strong<00:05:32.310> when<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:32.610> comes<00:05:32.790> to<00:05:32.910> groups<00:05:33.300> of<00:05:33.510> mobs

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
strong when it comes to groups of mobs

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.900 
strong when it comes to groups of mobs
so<00:05:34.560> and<00:05:34.950> don't<00:05:35.160> ever<00:05:35.220> use<00:05:35.430> them<00:05:35.580> on<00:05:35.700> pigs

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
so and don't ever use them on pigs

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.080 
so and don't ever use them on pigs
because<00:05:36.180> you'll<00:05:36.450> make<00:05:36.600> the<00:05:36.780> pigs<00:05:36.960> harder<00:05:37.320> so

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
because you'll make the pigs harder so

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.430 
because you'll make the pigs harder so
I'm<00:05:39.090> not<00:05:39.450> gonna<00:05:39.540> tell<00:05:39.720> you<00:05:39.780> what<00:05:39.930> happens<00:05:40.230> cuz
