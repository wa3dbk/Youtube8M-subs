00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.390
 ischemic stroke is an emergency 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.750
 extremely severe neurological disease he has 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.430
 of potential impacts on 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.599
 extremely patient disability 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.360
 important 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.220
 today we have possibilities 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.839
 extremely effective treatments that 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.199
 have the goal of reducing the 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:36.330
 disability and reduce the mortality of a 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.680
 event particularly impacting in the 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.540
 quality of life of the patient 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.260
 it is the thrombolysis because of it 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.719
 intravenous a cartoon a drug which 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.399
 whose goal is to 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.949
 revascularize any vessel 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.350
 intracranial that was closed by a 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.300
 thrombus with the aim of saving the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.949
 as much fabric as possible 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.059
 cerebral therefore reduce of serve the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.140
 disability 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.390
 obviously systemic thrombolysis is one 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.369
 method that can potentially have 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.009
 of the side effects for which 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.530
 you need to be extremely confident that 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.000
 the patient has no problems 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.810
 contraindications and execute is the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.970
 methodically, however, we must do one 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.259
 series of investigations to those patients yes 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.140
 must submit both character 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.270
 radiological both in character 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.819
 hematochemical with the aim of working 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.649
 in the greatest possible security 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.050
 in this context the element in 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.560
 absolute most important is the speed of 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.300
 action 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.429
 the greed for action that is not alone 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.729
 rapidity of health personnel but 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.500
 rapidity of the patient himself if he is in one 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.050
 clinical condition able to be fulfilled 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.660
 account of the situation and speed also 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.130
 of people of people who 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.110
 are eventually rescuing the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.849
 patient times brain so the patient 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.890
 first arrive in the emergency room with 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:57.810
 then suggestive symptoms of stroke 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.750
 difficulty of word difficulty of 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.300
 movement movement difficulties in 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.119
 particular on one side then an arm 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.649
 or both arms and legs must 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.899
 immediately go to the emergency room 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.000
 the first element from the point of view 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.590
 diagnostic perform a skull tac that 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.720
 gives us an extremely indication 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.430
 important allows us to distinguish 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.410
 between a die gica situation 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.510
 obviously does not beat roar laughter and one 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.290
 ischemic situation 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.799
 here we can see the image of a 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.890
 patient who had a deficiency of 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.319
 force in emi left side with 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.269
 difficulty in not moving the 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.900
 arm and possibility to move the leg 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:43.349
 and difficulty in articulating a word 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.349
 as you can see here is possible 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.390
 note the right hemisphere of attack not 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.159
 shows no lesion 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.379
 this is not something strange 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.269
 of attack in the acute phase does not show the 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.549
 ischemic lesion and this is one of the 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.239
 main elements to deal with 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.220
 the patient with the dated thrombolysis 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.170
 it must be absolutely negative if 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.569
 the atac shows lesions 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.819
 already evident ischemic means that 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.739
 probably some schemes that to the of 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.170
 beyond the four and a half hours that the 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.090
 maximum period within those beggars can 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.700
 be treated in a condition of 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.230
 this verified type that I am not there 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.299
 of character contraindications 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.690
 general clinical the patient comes 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.480
 thrombus lysate the clinical picture in 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.609
 this case has been progressively 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.699
 rapidly improving the deficits of 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.919
 motor and progressively improved 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:38.459
 the dream year is non-awareness 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.780
 of the patient to be sick instead 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.430
 something that in this case is 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.019
 then progressively improved in the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.760
 time 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.889
 the next look and make a tac 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.530
 of control generally the attack of 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.230
 check is done at 24 hours unless 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.699
 that there are no situations 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.530
 details of deterioration of 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:58.019
 fluctuation of the clinical picture 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.650
 in this case a check tac does 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.709
 see the ischemic area the most area 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.220
 black which is shown here on the level 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.379
 temporal quite temporal and is the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.379
 area and which indicates brain tissue 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.060
 who has suffered ischemic damage 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:20.459
 in this case there was none 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.500
 presence of bleeding damage for which the 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.560
 patient undergoes therapy 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.460
 antiplatelet from the point of view 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.900
 preventive as secondary prevention 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.430
 antiplatelet therapy have a 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.590
 extremely element 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.420
 obviously effective patient will do then 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.770
 a series of further investigations also 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.470
 neuroradiological in particular will do 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.960
 a magnetic resonance than with one 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.690
 series of different sequences makes me see 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.450
 the lesion in the acute phase that this area 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.760
 whiter than you look here and will do me 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.730
 see also the arterial tree 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.470
 intracranial that will be absolutely in 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.030
 this case patent in particular 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.570
 the right middle cerebral artery 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.490
 this this vessel I indicate here is a 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.410
 vase that presents a flow 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.360
 absolutely normal and it is the vessel that is 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.500
 was responsible for the jolie schemes 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.500
 that we brought you back before
