on<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.070> whole<00:02:09.190> way<00:02:09.310> around<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.330> thing's

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
on the whole way around so this thing's

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.940 
on the whole way around so this thing's
nice<00:02:14.100> because<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.690> heat<00:02:16.690> anodized<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.200> stop<00:02:17.680> in

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
nice because I heat anodized a stop in

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.010 
nice because I heat anodized a stop in
here<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.610> little<00:02:18.850> sticky<00:02:19.150> which

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
here it is a little sticky which

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.810 
here it is a little sticky which
probably<00:02:20.440> just<00:02:20.680> needs<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:21.040> wear<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.250> new<00:02:21.490> spot

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
probably just needs to wear a new spot

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.000 
probably just needs to wear a new spot
so<00:02:22.570> it's<00:02:22.720> not<00:02:22.870> titanium<00:02:23.590> doesn't<00:02:23.920> need

distressed worn-out beat-up finish for
an<00:03:30.340> everyday<00:03:30.610> user<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.739> lot<00:03:32.980> more

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
an everyday user this is a lot more

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
an everyday user this is a lot more
practical<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.680> I<00:03:36.130> just<00:03:36.370> flat-out<00:03:36.580> liked<00:03:36.880> it

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030
