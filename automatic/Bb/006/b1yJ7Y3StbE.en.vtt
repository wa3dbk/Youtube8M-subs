00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:15.540
 cool, like we said we're here with 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.850
 one more video and today sun child to 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 Here's the 2.0 version of my 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.720
 port with password I do not know if you 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.570
 Remember her I put her and the channel 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.920
 It's already been about six months and it's been a while 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.150
 since it stopped working 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.880
 So I wanted to tell you that the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.340
 version 2.0 and I wanted to apologize to 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.860
 everybody is always asking for it then 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.000
 bringing this version 2.0 here already does 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.630
 long time that the staff is 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.309
 asking 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.160
 however people are not everyone who 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.710
 like version 2.0 so I'm giving 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.520
 time and in those 2.0 versions trying to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.420
 put -it's because a lot of people do not 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.980
 like not 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.719
 but if in case you know of any machine 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.489
 and that gave some problem to my machine 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.890
 that gave trouble and wants me to do the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.050
 version 2.0 leaves in the description there that 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.489
 the time I'm doing all the sectors 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.199
 of 2.0 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.030
 I'm trying to give some real time. 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.309
 in this tutorials so let's here is a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.380
 tutorial that this team was much more 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.659
 compact and it was much 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.670
 functional is going the tutorial here 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.700
 The first thing you must do there is 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.650
 the front of the house make of preference 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.380
 5 Just so we can do the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.700
 circuit you can then decorate and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.049
 any way you want 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.850
 After doing that, I came here in the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.950
 half breaks the place for you to 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.890
 enter and that above you will put 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.780
 the buttons jump a block and put six 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.040
 button above press the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.060
 wood galley because the buttons 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.280
 wood they stay longer 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.810
 press and to activate this 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.240
 You have to get the three buttons 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.950
 same time with the stone button 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.020
 It's much harder to do that. 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.240
 beauty after that here on the side 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.060
 left we will put two 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.070
 pistons with islaine and two blocks in the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.170
 in front of him that will close the door, right? 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.740
 after that pull that captures caption 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.090
 home here you will also pull do 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.930
 this beauty here pulled three here's three 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.390
 for three 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.189
 after that here in the middle is the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.380
 Grandpa let's select as soon as we 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.190
 will want the lighting placed on this 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.050
 password here 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.960
 now I'm going to put these two down 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.060
 Do not put this one here and the top two 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.340
 But it will be this way then put 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.990
 here these two and here you select the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.300
 password in this way in a place that you 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.760
 You want the password, you'll put a torch 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.920
 from redstone after that you will come 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.090
 here in front and will put three blocks 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.820
 in this way 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.440
 here you will put a network stone 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.900
 for each torch you put through 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.790
 example here will be connected in this 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.140
 and linked this to us in this fight 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.490
 underneath we have to make the call 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.680
 here below 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.930
 After that, he pulled another one here. 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.850
 here in this last block you count 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.320
 a redstone torch then has 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.150
 need of this redstone up here 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.980
 because I think it will be disabled 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.990
 only when you were able to activate and 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.150
 disable these three lever these three 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.960
 Top torches here that charge this going 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.820
 light up 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.220
 then after that you see this block 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.860
 break that block between the wall 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.870
 and the ceiling does not and makes that rule is 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.460
 this connection that down here 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.860
 but she's getting in touch here 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.060
 guys come down 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.800
 Wow, and you have a blog here not to 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.840
 also contact you when you 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.100
 takes the block it gets into 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.380
 contact with the reduction of the low icc 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.090
 so you put a block on it 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.660
 lose that contact, right? 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.250
 after that it's come here puts a python 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.860
 with sly me turning up we go 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.570
 to do is a tiny load and e 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.780
 here you will put a block on top 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.870
 do not hesitate to 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.940
 slime after that comes here puts a 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.070
 block here in front of a repeater 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.750
 can be repeated at the same level if 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.890
 raise the level is not working right now 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.990
 explain you 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.050
 and here we will put a block 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.450
 in this new version 1.5 with this boot here 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.430
 You will now be able to perform both the 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.050
 two pistons down here without the block a 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.850
 people can not energize just exist 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.160
 here at the door with the block will power 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.570
 the two pistons and is already working is 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.110
 very easy to do 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.550
 this is our door and here inside 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.840
 you can also place a single button 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.650
 put the button right here where it has 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.470
 return 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.540
 and here you will be able to close is e 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.010
 open that door that happens in this 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.350
 I'll have the guys open up for you guys 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.270
 You see how tight you are. 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.100
 redstone for that of decreasing load 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:24.780
 here it will make the pistons 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.710
 with the slime only have the ok or the blocks and 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.600
 so will be closing the passage 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.699
 and when you press again it goes there 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.590
 and pull the blocks and the same thing happens 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:37.090
 there at the front when you say active 3 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.030
 torches that torch will ascend until 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.819
 do it again here she torches this fee 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.650
 that she feels and her sister carries 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.530
 The same thing happens is the pistons 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.210
 release the tone pull the blocks right 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.160
 even here can close off the 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.599
 door then had no need to 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.729
 be able to close the door when you 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:57.340
 leave home and from here you alone 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.870
 You close the link here and you can create 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.789
 your house and inside right? 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.639
 the proposal is pretty cool because it works 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.710
 even then it is if you want to put a 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.930
 four- digit password, and then you can 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.460
 stay comfortable but I find it very difficult 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.050
 to be able to press four buttons on a 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:18.430
 I'll try it here, but I think a lot. 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:21.669
 Difficult is very fast, I managed but it is 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.259
 very difficult but in case you want it is only 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.870
 you put another torch on top 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:28.569
 The place you do not want to just let it be 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.159
 just leave it vague so hopefully you guys 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.990
 have liked the system there is a 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:33.849
 very simple very simple system 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.470
 In case you do not understand people, I 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.849
 I always left in description download 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.430
 of these that me here then download 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.830
 and analyzes there will have a link in the 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.750
 description and that's it I hope very much that 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.699
 You would have liked it dearly if you 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.710
 You liked me there, I wanted to count on 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.180
 a jewel of you there trigger favorites 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.009

 Many thanks to everyone and always 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.639

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.960
 have done for him and I'm noticing that

 there are two villages here on this ground 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.550
 that very close to each other had not 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.479
 noticed that is in another on another day today 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.610
