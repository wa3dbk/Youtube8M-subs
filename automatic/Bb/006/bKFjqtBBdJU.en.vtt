we're<00:00:03.270> going<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.810> be<00:00:03.990> rolling<00:00:04.319> out<00:00:06.680> each<00:00:07.680> half

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
we're going to be rolling out each half

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.100 
we're going to be rolling out each half
separately<00:00:10.940> so<00:00:11.940> I'm<00:00:12.059> going<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.509> divide<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
separately so I'm going to divide the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.060 
separately so I'm going to divide the
dough<00:00:13.460> and<00:00:15.199> just<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.379> make<00:00:16.529> sure<00:00:16.590> nothing

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
dough and just to make sure nothing

is to pulse this I want to chop the
raisins<00:01:03.090> finely<00:01:03.930> enough<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.530> they'll<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.830> able

raisins finely enough so they'll be able
to<00:01:05.040> spread<00:01:05.430> them<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.939> don't<00:01:06.150> really<00:01:06.270> don't

want to raisin paste now have a chopped
raisin<00:01:14.520> filling<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.950> if<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.070> take<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.880> blade

raisin filling and if I take the blade
out<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.890> don't<00:01:23.100> cut<00:01:23.280> myself<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.540> leave<00:01:24.750> it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
out so I don't cut myself I can leave it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:39.289 
out so I don't cut myself I can leave it
in<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.310> wood<00:01:26.670> messing<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.299> book<00:01:38.299> and

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
in here and wood messing up a book and

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.990 
in here and wood messing up a book and
we're<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.960> roll<00:01:40.290> out<00:01:40.500> our<00:01:40.530> dough<00:01:41.000> now

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
we're going to roll out our dough now

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.240 
we're going to roll out our dough now
the<00:01:42.060> tricky<00:01:42.540> part<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.020> making<00:01:43.439> these<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:44.100> that

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the tricky part of making these is that

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.609 
the tricky part of making these is that
you're<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.610> roll<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.270> layer<00:01:45.619> fill

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
you're going to roll out one layer fill

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.230 
you're going to roll out one layer fill
it<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.979> then<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.220> need<00:01:47.369> another<00:01:47.670> layer<00:01:47.939> of

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
it and then you need another layer of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.569 
it and then you need another layer of
dough<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:50.100> dough<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:53.630> fattest<00:01:54.630> fragile<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
dough the dough is fattest fragile is a

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.819 
dough the dough is fattest fragile is a
pie<00:01:56.579> crust<00:01:56.610> dough<00:01:57.210> which<00:01:58.079> means<00:01:58.320> if<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.590> want

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
pie crust dough which means if you want

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.469 
pie crust dough which means if you want
to<00:01:58.920> roll<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.250> out<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.579> thin<00:01:59.700> you're<00:02:00.299> going

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
to roll it out really thin you're going

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.359 
to roll it out really thin you're going
to<00:02:00.630> run<00:02:00.810> into<00:02:00.960> some<00:02:01.049> problems<00:02:01.380> transferring

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
to run into some problems transferring

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.090 
to run into some problems transferring
it<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.479> here's<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:04.020> I've<00:02:04.110> tried<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.590> work<00:02:04.860> out

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
it so here's what I've tried to work out

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.100 
it so here's what I've tried to work out
a<00:02:05.460> way<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.479> makes<00:02:07.110> sense<00:02:08.479> that<00:02:09.479> lets<00:02:09.720> us<00:02:09.869> get

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
a way that makes sense that lets us get

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.990 
a way that makes sense that lets us get
the<00:02:10.319> dough<00:02:10.530> thin<00:02:11.129> enough

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
the dough thin enough

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.710 
the dough thin enough
we<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.540> crisp<00:02:12.810> cookie<00:02:13.580> but<00:02:14.580> can<00:02:15.390> still<00:02:15.570> be

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
we get the crisp cookie but can still be

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.600 
we get the crisp cookie but can still be
managed<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.470> transferred<00:02:17.010> onto<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.400> baking

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
managed and transferred onto the baking

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.280 
managed and transferred onto the baking
sheets<00:02:18.170> I've<00:02:19.970> used<00:02:20.970> two<00:02:21.210> baking<00:02:21.660> sheets<00:02:21.690> and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
sheets I've used two baking sheets and

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.950 
sheets I've used two baking sheets and
I've<00:02:22.410> put<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> sheet<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.540> silicon<00:02:24.540> treated

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
I've put a sheet of silicon treated

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.950 
I've put a sheet of silicon treated
baking<00:02:25.410> parchment<00:02:25.740> on<00:02:26.190> each<00:02:26.550> which<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.690> prefer

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
baking parchment on each which I prefer

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.950 
baking parchment on each which I prefer
to<00:02:28.290> greasing<00:02:28.800> it's<00:02:29.040> neater<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.720> think

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
to greasing it's neater and I think

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.400 
to greasing it's neater and I think
gives<00:02:31.140> better<00:02:31.410> control<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.490> can<00:02:32.640> buy<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
gives better control and you can buy the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.260 
gives better control and you can buy the
silicone<00:02:34.410> paper<00:02:34.650> actually<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.520> bulk<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.120> have

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
silicone paper actually in bulk and have

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.140 
silicone paper actually in bulk and have
almost<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.630> lifetime<00:02:36.840> supply<00:02:40.880> all<00:02:41.880> right<00:02:42.000> so

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
almost a lifetime supply all right so

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.690 
almost a lifetime supply all right so
I'm<00:02:42.330> going<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.690> roll<00:02:42.990> this<00:02:43.230> out<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:45.470> a

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
I'm going to roll this out to a

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.800 
I'm going to roll this out to a
rectangle<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:49.560> measures<00:02:49.620> about<00:02:50.040> 9<00:02:50.340> by<00:02:51.030> 12<00:02:51.420> it

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
rectangle that measures about 9 by 12 it

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.090 
rectangle that measures about 9 by 12 it
looks<00:02:51.990> like<00:02:52.140> I'll<00:02:52.290> need<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.470> little<00:02:52.800> bit<00:02:52.980> of

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
looks like I'll need a little bit of

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.470 
looks like I'll need a little bit of
flour<00:02:53.370> on<00:02:53.580> this<00:02:55.430> we<00:02:56.430> don't<00:02:56.610> want<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:56.910> put<00:02:57.209> great

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
flour on this we don't want to put great

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.390 
flour on this we don't want to put great
much<00:02:57.750> extra<00:02:58.230> flour<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.920> other<00:02:59.040> hand<00:02:59.280> we

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
much extra flour on the other hand we

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.920 
much extra flour on the other hand we
don't<00:02:59.520> want<00:02:59.640> things<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.090> stick

that'll<00:03:12.150> never<00:03:12.360> win<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.230> need<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.650> cook<00:03:13.920> a

reasonably<00:03:16.680> sanitary<00:03:17.370> all<00:03:18.330> right<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:22.650> we're

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
reasonably sanitary all right so we're

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.830 
reasonably sanitary all right so we're
going<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.070> aim<00:03:23.310> for<00:03:23.340> about<00:03:23.790> 9<00:03:24.030> by<00:03:24.269> 12<00:03:24.570> which

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
going to aim for about 9 by 12 which

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.350 
going to aim for about 9 by 12 which
actually<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.410> going<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.680> be<00:03:25.800> fairly<00:03:26.040> thin<00:03:26.489> all

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
actually is going to be fairly thin all

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.440 
actually is going to be fairly thin all
right<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.810> looks<00:03:27.840> like<00:03:28.140> we<00:03:28.500> are<00:03:28.530> now<00:03:28.890> about

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.280 

it's<00:03:33.450> not<00:03:33.630> quite<00:03:33.930> 10<00:03:34.260> ahead<00:03:35.810> 7<00:03:36.810> still<00:03:37.110> and

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
it's not quite 10 ahead 7 still and

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.360 
it's not quite 10 ahead 7 still and
still<00:03:37.560> need<00:03:37.769> some<00:03:38.010> more<00:03:39.650> that<00:03:40.650> was<00:03:40.799> optimism

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
still need some more that was optimism

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.440 
still need some more that was optimism
on<00:03:41.670> my<00:03:41.820> part<00:03:42.150> or<00:03:42.330> wishful<00:03:42.690> thinking<00:03:44.269> does<00:03:45.269> not

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
on my part or wishful thinking does not

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.449 
on my part or wishful thinking does not
have<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.840> be<00:03:45.959> exact<00:03:46.380> but<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.769> figured<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.340> a

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
have to be exact but I figured this is a

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.810 
have to be exact but I figured this is a
pretty<00:03:48.860> good<00:03:49.860> place<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.340> start

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
pretty good place to start

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.770 
pretty good place to start
okay<00:03:51.390> now<00:03:51.750> what<00:03:52.230> we're<00:03:52.380> going<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.709> do<00:03:53.209> is<00:03:54.209> to

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
okay now what we're going to do is to

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.070 
okay now what we're going to do is to
put<00:03:54.989> on<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:56.400> raisin<00:03:56.820> filling<00:03:57.269> now<00:03:58.019> the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
put on the raisin filling now the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.130 
put on the raisin filling now the
original<00:03:58.799> recipe<00:03:59.160> for<00:03:59.700> this<00:04:00.140> involved

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
original recipe for this involved

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.530 
original recipe for this involved
rolling<00:04:01.860> out<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.160> whole<00:04:02.400> dough<00:04:02.790> putting<00:04:03.450> the

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
rolling out the whole dough putting the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.420 
rolling out the whole dough putting the
filling<00:04:03.780> on<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.470> then<00:04:04.560> putting<00:04:04.799> another<00:04:05.160> dope

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
filling on and then putting another dope

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.930 
filling on and then putting another dope
more<00:04:06.030> dough<00:04:06.239> on<00:04:06.420> top<00:04:06.830> if<00:04:07.830> you<00:04:08.040> did<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.340> in<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.549> pan

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
more dough on top if you did it in a pan

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.840 
more dough on top if you did it in a pan
with<00:04:09.450> sides<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:10.680> can't<00:04:10.920> really<00:04:11.220> get<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.610> thin

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
with sides you can't really get it thin

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.539 
with sides you can't really get it thin
enough<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.480> if<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.410> did<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:13.739> on<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.890> machine<00:04:13.980> it

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
enough and if you did it on a machine it

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.060 
enough and if you did it on a machine it
was<00:04:14.670> difficult<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.269> transfer<00:04:15.810> so<00:04:16.769> we're<00:04:16.919> going

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
was difficult to transfer so we're going

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.680 
was difficult to transfer so we're going
to<00:04:17.220> do<00:04:17.489> this<00:04:17.729> in

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
to do this in

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.750 
to do this in
trips<00:04:21.140> at<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.380> point<00:04:22.740> I'm<00:04:22.800> going<00:04:22.980> to<00:04:23.160> take<00:04:23.400> my

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
trips at this point I'm going to take my

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.660 
trips at this point I'm going to take my
brazen<00:04:24.240> filling<00:04:27.770> second<00:04:28.770> Isis<00:04:29.130> nice<00:04:29.400> big

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
brazen filling second Isis nice big

brazen filling second Isis nice big
spoon<00:04:30.030> for<00:04:30.060> this<00:04:30.540> I'm<00:04:31.230> going<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.890> put<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.400> strip

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
spoon for this I'm going to put a strip

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.320 
spoon for this I'm going to put a strip
of<00:04:33.210> raisin<00:04:33.660> filling<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:35.760> divide<00:04:36.180> it

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
of raisin filling and divide it

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.740 
of raisin filling and divide it
approximately<00:04:37.110> in<00:04:37.410> half<00:04:38.180> if<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.300> really

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
approximately in half if you really

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.050 
approximately in half if you really
wanted<00:04:40.230> to<00:04:40.290> you<00:04:40.470> could<00:04:40.890> scale<00:04:41.310> this<00:04:41.550> out<00:04:41.760> and

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
wanted to you could scale this out and

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.680 
wanted to you could scale this out and
get<00:04:42.210> an<00:04:42.360> absolute<00:04:42.930> half<00:04:44.240> these<00:04:45.240> are<00:04:45.390> really

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
get an absolute half these are really

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.590 
get an absolute half these are really
not<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:46.080> kind<00:04:46.350> of<00:04:46.530> pastry<00:04:50.150> we're<00:04:51.150> going<00:04:51.420> to

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
not that kind of pastry we're going to

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.220 
not that kind of pastry we're going to
spoon<00:04:51.930> this<00:04:52.170> on<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:53.370> spray<00:04:54.060> so<00:04:54.450> now<00:04:54.750> we<00:04:54.810> have

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
spoon this on and spray so now we have

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.880 
spoon this on and spray so now we have
our<00:04:56.990> dough<00:04:59.840> covered<00:05:00.840> half<00:05:01.200> of<00:05:01.350> it<00:05:01.530> with<00:05:01.770> the

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
our dough covered half of it with the

our dough covered half of it with the
resin<00:05:02.280> filling<00:05:02.700> what<00:05:02.820> we're<00:05:02.940> going<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.390> do<00:05:03.570> is

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
resin filling what we're going to do is

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.460 
resin filling what we're going to do is
gently<00:05:04.050> flip<00:05:04.500> this<00:05:04.650> over<00:05:05.420> let<00:05:06.420> me<00:05:06.540> go<00:05:06.870> clean<00:05:07.320> my

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
we don't care if there are little bits

we don't care if there are little bits
of<00:05:13.170> raisins<00:05:13.800> showing<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.820> original<00:05:14.910> sunshine

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
of raisins showing the original sunshine

cookie<00:05:16.200> had<00:05:16.350> bits<00:05:16.590> of<00:05:16.740> raisin<00:05:17.160> showing<00:05:17.580> so<00:05:17.760> I'm

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
cookie had bits of raisin showing so I'm

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.440 
cookie had bits of raisin showing so I'm
using<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:18.150> as<00:05:18.300> my<00:05:18.510> gold<00:05:19.470> standard<00:05:20.330> all<00:05:21.330> right

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.850 
it feels a little moist under here so
let<00:05:27.210> me<00:05:27.270> sprinkle<00:05:27.750> a<00:05:27.780> little<00:05:27.900> more<00:05:28.200> flour<00:05:28.470> on

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
let me sprinkle a little more flour on

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.710 
let me sprinkle a little more flour on
this<00:05:29.100> because<00:05:29.400> I<00:05:29.580> do<00:05:29.640> not<00:05:29.940> want<00:05:30.210> it<00:05:30.330> to<00:05:30.450> stick

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
this because I do not want it to stick

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.560 
this because I do not want it to stick
at<00:05:30.870> this<00:05:31.020> point<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.919> I'm<00:05:32.580> going<00:05:32.850> to<00:05:32.910> roll<00:05:33.270> this

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
at this point and I'm going to roll this

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.500 
at this point and I'm going to roll this
out<00:05:34.370> until<00:05:35.370> it<00:05:35.700> is<00:05:36.150> about<00:05:37.040> six<00:05:38.040> inches<00:05:38.580> by<00:05:39.120> 18

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
out until it is about six inches by 18

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.830 
out until it is about six inches by 18
inches<00:05:40.640> that's<00:05:41.640> so<00:05:41.910> we're<00:05:42.030> going<00:05:42.210> to<00:05:42.390> roll<00:05:42.600> it

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
inches that's so we're going to roll it

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.530 
inches that's so we're going to roll it
this<00:05:43.440> way<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.990> we're<00:05:46.200> also<00:05:46.350> going<00:05:46.680> to<00:05:46.770> roll<00:05:47.040> it

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
this way and we're also going to roll it

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.500 
this way and we're also going to roll it
lengthwise<00:05:48.540> do<00:05:48.930> it<00:05:49.050> 18<00:05:49.500> inches<00:05:49.890> here<00:05:50.460> I<00:05:50.760> don't

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
lengthwise do it 18 inches here I don't

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.690 
lengthwise do it 18 inches here I don't
have<00:05:51.870> to<00:05:51.990> do<00:05:52.110> it<00:05:52.230> this<00:05:54.740> what<00:05:55.740> I'm<00:05:55.860> trying<00:05:56.220> to<00:05:56.460> do

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
have to do it this what I'm trying to do

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.260 
have to do it this what I'm trying to do
is<00:05:57.060> to<00:05:57.360> create<00:05:57.810> more<00:05:58.169> cracker<00:05:59.070> like<00:05:59.430> cookie<00:06:00.060> I

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
is to create more cracker like cookie I

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.460 
is to create more cracker like cookie I
want<00:06:00.990> to<00:06:01.050> get<00:06:01.169> the<00:06:01.380> dough<00:06:01.590> thin<00:06:03.169> so<00:06:04.169> that<00:06:04.320> when

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
want to get the dough thin so that when

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.650 
want to get the dough thin so that when
it<00:06:04.590> bakes<00:06:04.770> that<00:06:05.190> will<00:06:05.370> crisp<00:06:05.669> up<00:06:06.080> and<00:06:07.880> I<00:06:08.880> think

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
it bakes that will crisp up and I think

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.630 
it bakes that will crisp up and I think
this<00:06:09.930> is<00:06:10.110> probably<00:06:10.410> about<00:06:10.800> the<00:06:11.010> best<00:06:11.340> way<00:06:11.610> to

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
this is probably about the best way to

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.090 
this is probably about the best way to
do<00:06:11.910> it
