00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.139
 the south of 38 and the new dexal one of the 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:17.429
 line recently renewed by the yard 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.230
 no show extremely reconstruction 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.390
 sturdy and accurate it is a boat from 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.369
 major displacement is designed for 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.589
 the needs of the sailors they face 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.699
 every day the ocean waters 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.769
 we reached the south 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.769
 of England to try it at sea 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.470
 the transom has no beaches 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.390
 you and the impulses are almost absent 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.340
 yet the lines of the deck and the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 hulls are quite graceful with 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.240
 lettuce that harmonizes well the volumes of the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.280
 deck saloon 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.110
 a concession to the aesthetics to come 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.410
 certainly appreciated also by ours 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.410
 latitudes 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.930
 the cockpit is clearly divided into two 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.980
 on the cup the double wheelhouse with wide 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.980
 cavoni under the seats 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.990
 further on there are the sessions 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.350
 of the crew in a collected space e 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.350
 well protected 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.620
 on the columns we find the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.270
 navigation equipment i 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.480

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.480
 tilting 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.890
 thanks to the double blade the rudder gives away 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.890
 excellent sensations in navigation 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.420
 the svinc drift makes it possible to reduce 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.630
 the draft from two meters to 80 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.520
 centimeters 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.799
 in addition to facilitating landings in 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.390
 shallow water for navigation improves 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.390
 performance at load-bearing speeds 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.090
 the thruster of the thruster allows the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.630
 easy maneuvering on the quay 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.630
 and security 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.819
 in the bow, a small bowsprit for 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.590
 the gennaker given its small size 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.590
 of the bow and advises 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.220
 the design of many Nordic parquet floors 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.710
 and to give prevalence above all to the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.680
 living area 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.360
 the souter of 38 with his dexal an anti 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.810

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.810
 school of thought 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.629
