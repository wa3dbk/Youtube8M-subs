00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.249 
page I can go down to small and you know
it's<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.180> depending<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:33.720> much<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.079> want

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
it's just depending on how much you want

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.480 
it's just depending on how much you want

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
to see on a page or how good your

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.370 
to see on a page or how good your
eyesight<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.090> you're<00:01:36.450> able<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.930> change<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.530 
eyesight is you're able to change that
quite<00:01:37.680> simply<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.400> something<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.909> find<00:01:39.210> really

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
quite simply so something I find really

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.179 
quite simply so something I find really
interesting<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.590> not<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
interesting is that it's not just the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.830 
interesting is that it's not just the
e-reader<00:01:41.790> device<00:01:42.150> itself<00:01:42.509> they've<00:01:42.720> actually

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
e-reader device itself they've actually

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.810 
e-reader device itself they've actually
created<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.320> whole<00:01:43.500> kind<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.460> could<00:01:44.640> say

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
created a whole kind of if I could say

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.899 
created a whole kind of if I could say
ecosystem<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.159> books<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
ecosystem so to get the books on to the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.030 
ecosystem so to get the books on to the
actual<00:01:48.060> device<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:49.140> plug<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.619> USB<00:01:49.649> cable

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
actual device you plug in the USB cable

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.590 
actual device you plug in the USB cable
