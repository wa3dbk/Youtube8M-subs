00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.070
 hello friends how are you 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.690
 I hope you are the best and 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.480
 welcome to a new video of 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:28.010
 minecraft in which I bring you some 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.590
 called game world sirs and if this is 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.840
 a very interesting way 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.760
 jealousy though say why because 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.820
 It adds a new dimension as it 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.470
 they can give an account and it's a dimension 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.220
 scary because it's the world of 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.870
 caves are endless caves very well 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.000
 structured mostly because they are 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.400
 very well done that is, they are not caves 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.170
 normal as we see daily that 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.120
 then they are finished and then we already 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.150
 bored or not these caves are immense 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.800
 there are new minerals down there and so 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.290
 also many new here we have the 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.699
 alligator is a very passive is not going to 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.050
 attack even if you hit it will not attack 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.080
 for nothing in the world 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.100
 and well it's very good then what 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.470
 first thing you have to do is get 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.750
 moses town already know where to get it and 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.320
 in caves I talk about it because I do not have a peak 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.320
 to remove that 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.670
 although I think that is speaking to me 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.510
 quite then we have to do is 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.090
 typical portal gentlemen 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.750
 typical form of portal does not have great 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.750
 science the truth 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.400
 and they do not need to sell cheste 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.080
 understand what they put in the center and 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.080
 let's go to the dimension 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.940
 the weather is following us the general 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.580
 it's not alligator, I sent it here 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.700
 wall and he got alone rather and gives 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.800
 very afraid gentlemen is this system of 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.750
 I have them, so I have to 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.510
 say and I think I look like a peak 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.030
 around here because I think it's going 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.080
 to come well gentlemen a little pug this and 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.490
 well I say it's pretty 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.730
 interesting, I do not know, it makes me very 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.340
 interesting that way 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.070
 my house is called vista I had already thought 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.350
 that was real all that is the bus that does not 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.970
 charge and good because it is a system of 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.860
 caves and how can you see nothing to see 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.140
 with normal things are I guess that 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.730
 more expanding this and much more 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.120
 interesting could be seen with the bug 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.880
 that has many, many, many parts to 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.990
 where to go and then the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.980
 caves here you never get to the 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.040
 surface 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.450
 there are many harmful many many good 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.760
 like the alligator that since the plane 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.620
 right now and it's very interesting that 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.540
 here everything will not go creative mode 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.150
 to explore more quickly as 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:51.200
 can see effects effects of 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:55.720
 sound very crisis of fear then there is 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.240
 to be careful with this dimension 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.340
 through the caves and we try and 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.490
 us up as high as that 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.980
 we can then if there is a part that is 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.870
 I would be alone that nothing else is like cne 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.400
 see that there is nothing is to say nothing more 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.610
 up to the petroken first up 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:20.220
 As you can see, this is very limited 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.230
 it's very big we 're never going to get there 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.230
 we will never reach the surface 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.230
 mom 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.890
 in theory we have to get to where 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.890
 Sirs 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.430
 Friends will never come 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.390
 it is eternal this good we have arrived 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.750
 gentlemen we have arrived as you can see the 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.880
 limit if we are in block 254 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.650
 then it is to say 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.780
 the highest you can find is 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.200
 this you do not go against something else and it's 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.840
 pure darkness asturias then you have to 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.910
 go very well armed and with it well enough 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.830
 wood and things of his step but go here 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.170
 in because it is very complicated 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.060
 leave if you get to lose or good more 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.500
 old man who never goes out you never know if you 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.900
 you get to lose and you do not have like is another 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.370
 portal you never leave there are also unions 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.180
 which characterizes then this one 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.180
 then we have 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.609
 good 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:34.189
 and 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.340
 is a Japanese then you know that the 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.980
 Japanese people always come up with things 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.170
 very good and new things about everything 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.360
 then we also have this mode of 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.240
 mobile that I've told them the aggressive that 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.420
 is a zombie use my worst archer is 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.860
 say ya imagine zombie archers 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.690
 we already have as we already have as 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.630
 skeletons and then they put us an archer 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.640
 of the zombie no no is not something complicated 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.410
 because the alligator or the alligator can have 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.690
 items or can not have anything then 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.160
 well there is a peak and they are very 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.680
 funny these parts of people 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.080
 income you can adopt with certain 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.630
 mineral that you find is called fitting 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.250
 yum then but not in mind nor very 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.380
 well how to adopt them because it assumes that 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.690
 you click right and if you consume them 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.370
 that is, they consume part of the mineral as 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.460
 you can see your mineral here we have other 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.680
 sites also that are made of the del 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.190
 hair although terminal that there is here that 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.120
 is this mineral 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.120
 to be seen 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.290
 we have the hair like this is going to see a 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.880
 little bit like iron as well as iron but 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.880
 good if you understand me 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.820
 vandalism skate mans and it's supposed to 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.890
 you have to domesticate it you have to 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.960
 give him of this and yes yes if he ingests it as 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.880
 You can see that this tour is going down 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.370
 you can ingest only you just have to give 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.139
 the key mans but 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.110
 I think I understood that I had to give 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:05.870
 thousand thousand of these of these hairs do not 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.210
 I think it's true signals because I'm 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.010
 I would do a lot but then it sounds like that 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.790
 said that something related to the number 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:16.100
 1000 but good as it is in Japanese 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.110
 later I do not understand much if nothing that yes 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.400
 gentlemen this if the world today is 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.800
 because that liked and that has been done 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.110
 interesting the cave biome cake 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.940
 world then if it was like that they would not be 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.070
 forget to leave a like because then that 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.560
 it helped a lot we look for it because 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.330
 there is a pitch already quite good to see 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.600
 I hate holy we go there that are missing so many 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.970
 things or crimes a diamond to ten 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.020
 ingots or holy god I did not know what it is 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.180
 that I had always felt sorry for myself 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.830
 kill them but I already realized that if the 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.830
 they find kill the gentlemen 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:53.600
 they saw that I killed him and that came to 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.600
 steal the items as they are alligator 

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:59.999
 according to the items 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:05.759
 first of all how it feels
