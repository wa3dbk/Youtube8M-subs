00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.150
 Overview of my 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:49.250
 wardrobe and I find it 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.530
 really cool, especially with 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.720
 all this white pieces of furniture in it 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.909

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.979
 like to eat the ikea ps series 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.780
 I have that extra time in may 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.159
 bought because I thought if I have one 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.140
 I would like to have my own flat 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.089
 have that closet in there and that 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.580
 really great then it also has a lot 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.810
 Storage space is just very transparent 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.350
 that means everything has to be neat 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.240
 hold 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.640
 you have then above my backpacks for 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.500
 example simply stored and to the right 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.079
 Do you see that I have my comforter and 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.179
 so always in there in this box that is 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.549
 actually great and then I have 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.619
 all my sweaters in this one 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.020
 hang in the middle row I tried 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.429
 sort of color that way 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.710
 here is, for example, my one blue 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.240
 Blouse you know this white sweater 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.369
 probably already and mine 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.420
 current favorite sweater from kinect 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.420
 is in there too 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.260
 you see her one more time the individual 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.510
 garments a bit so me 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.910
 I really only have sweaters and t-shirts 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.700
 hang there and then one floor deeper 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.830
 I have a lot of skirts and pants 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.240
 more t shirts because just lie in it 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.460
 that might even be one 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.110
 a little nicer still be arranged but 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.630
 from the beginning is definitely very good 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.490
 and my current favorite part have 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.350
 I'm in it, too , this is the skirt 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.360
 I bought at humana here in 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.710
 cologne at the bottom are still things sports 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.510
 a pair of shoes 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.940
 and then I still have those white ones 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.220
 Bought more boxes which are easy for 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.120
 my underwear and all this 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.680
 Maybe not everybody does that 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.200
 absolutely must see there just like that 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.450
 enters my wardrobe room and 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.590
 they also have such small demarcation 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.400
 that means you can really different 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.290
 things in there so amazed and see here 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.670
 you have the wardrobe complete 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.170
 I can also give you that in the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.120
 pack infobox then you can do that 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.160
 model again more exactly on what he 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.430
 me too is cool this is just this 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.870
 grid look and you can totally cool 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.760
 make it a tune I think it's the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.920
 really special if you are there 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.260
 just hang on it and then has it 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.750
 At the same time you are still a jewelery 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.790
 stand next to the wardrobe and 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.660
 Here I have such a dresser this 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.430
 also from ikea 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.650
 I also have a lot of things on it 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.050
 stand like my jewelry stand and 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.050
 magazines i just really like to like 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.590
 Here is another picture of Carrie 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.790
 bradshaw and her friends of sex 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.170
 I'm interested in them simply because I have the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.040
 I really like series and I think it's totally 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.960
 bleak 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.630
 and I did not know who my heart pure 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.570
 should and here my whole 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.000
 magazines and yes then I have here 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.530
 still in this box or in these boxes 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.240
 many things like hats 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.070
 For example, I have such a lot here 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.930
 cool hat I have my times on the 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.190
 bought flea market you also like quite 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.190
 especially for the autumn now 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.010
 one floor lower it is still one 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.550
 a bit chaotic dhabi so socks and 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.410
 gloves just lie in it too 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.110
 This sweet with the loop here and 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.450
 I have clothespins in there as well 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.920
 so I have to sort out the jewelery 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.480
 and at the bottom because I simply 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.430
 tights because ye know 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.080
 probably because they are very happy and 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.640
 very often wear pantyhose and have 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.640
 I just stowed down there 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.690
 and here you see mine 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.510
 mirror I have synonymous with ikea 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.010
 and I think that's cool because 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.130
 I still have a string of lights from you 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.720
 primark decorated and so a few 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.640
 have cut out magazine items 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.990
 and I think that makes a lot 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.630
 I do not have any batteries yet 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.310
 fairy lights but that will be fine 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.140
 and here you see again my 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.579
 jewelry stand I have to by yes 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.989
 brought home and I still have 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.840
 made such a pin board respectively 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.360

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.250

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.390
 then I have glued on one 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.770
 windowsill my makeup head and mine 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.230
 nail polish floor or as you like it 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.360
 call and here still a clothes rail 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.790
 which it has in the room in there 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.990
 I really hang my clothes and 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.750
 I have a little bit of that too 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.669
 color sorts my shoes rather less 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.040
 but I have a data part 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.140
 I also have another school on 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.360

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.600

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.890

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.290
