 2012 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.350

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.870
 was released on March 1, 2012 on xbox 360 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.730

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.590
 sports is developed by his little sister 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.050
 and spirit takes care of all the part 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.550
 which arcade is a solo that completely 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.780
 crazy it's good because we 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.790
 is not there to do the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.250
 snowboard simulation anyway and he 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.530
 worthily takes over from his 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.840
 cool predecessor boarders the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.520
 awesome while his guests in

 their name next we have others who are 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.719
 fighting as one can be 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.189
 stored and where else is the mektoub 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.140
 aqallal shaun white 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.369
 thankfully that ssx is here and who we 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.960
 did well that's been doing for years 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.770
 2000 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.750
 actually this is a big 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.219
 license since 2000 painful value 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.869
 sure of the video game and games of this moba 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.390
 and there we do a reboot capsize 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.469
 that's right in fact in this one you 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.079
 go take big players 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.340
 riders like car is actually what 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.689
 you're going to do it's the big tricks of 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.430
 big food rooftop sick 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.530
 can subsequently feed 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.430
 company and lands on a roof 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.430
 is 20 minutes 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.049
 this is so beaten can walk the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.710
 world in the game you see you can pass 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.269
 by the Mayans by the algae and the 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.989
 big mountains precisely we're going to 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.009
 see 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.380
 browse the world right away with 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.489
 stone the manukian tumor I chose 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.500
 the patagonie test 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.450
 because in Patagonia there is a 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.099
 crazy thing it actually in every 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.170
 every world you have a skill a 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.760
 very specific vision goggles 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.989
 night to a flashlight and 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.739
 protections in the Alps and in 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.890
 patagonia but will sweeney these cases there 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.330
 we saw in the last conference 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.650
 kind of mini surprise out of 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.739
 nowhere and there is such west 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.989
 years it's huge it's so cool if you 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.790
 often used tempting cryer project 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.709
 okay understands and so I have until 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.420
 between tricks races or so the 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.830
 final race super super violent 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.720
 France had different modes of play ok 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.430
 so good choice my little personal 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.360
 small specifications 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.620
 tricks cost 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.849
 yeah and especially the material that 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.920
 change whenever he is and the 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.549
 protections talent and under when you 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.110
 give in everest 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.700
 ok so here I pump if woods wishes 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.880
 without content percent chance of 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.959
 to live two sentences to which Le Havre 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.489
 take the time to load me I know 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.930
 not if you had felt that or 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.370
 not but I had played in a shop 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.480
 where I had been to a big band 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.040
 could play the game that is still in 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.510
 demo at the time and I had found that 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.769
 but ultra enjoyable from the beginning you go 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.180
 make an easy quarter to take in hand 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.319
 any edge of the big thing cgt like a fool 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.400
 in front of the console what is 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.750
 completely even you take the 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.130
 joystick just right trigger opt out and 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.440
 boosts after you do what you want 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.150
 to be the patous years you steal it's it 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.220
 Intuitive it's tuba during the rotation 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.540
 galore and where you fight in an airplane 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.299
 with a mother to passers-by 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.590
 live she really cultivates and it is 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.790
 so that of the bus level we start on 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.310
 ejected from a helicopter or his lover 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.810
 of the mountain because it's really 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.150
 arrived quite special value riders 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.800
 last side and so the lega a lot of 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.730
 after 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.930
 not at all ah yes go pavement 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.690
 you do not need to tie your feet 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.310
 against y'a no bard announces george 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.660
 and so to the person of antonio tale 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.400
 can fall from one side to another there not 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.100
 at all there it is really I am from 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.340
 blow you do you do your figure and there 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.840
 the interest of the game can not only 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.520
 advanced rotation styles and chips 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.410
 before and there which I break my mouth 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.270
 and I will do my alarm because there 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.610
 a rhinois go there that's really the 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.420
 ok revolution is that it's the 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.890
 I said you do not die it's 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.270
 that you know, I'm coming back 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.280
 back you do not really have to die so 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.900
 I know it's not very interesting and 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.030
 on the other hand it will be interesting to die 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:22.840
 in Cairo have done like that you can 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:24.040
 buy their missing walbach and you see that 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.480
 penalize me because but 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.310
 opponents where they do not have the real one 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.280
 are not influenced by that ok so in 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.920
 did I got involved fucking I 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:39.730
 return to his position that I see on the 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:40.450
 piston made to leave quiet on 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.130
 no longer believed 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.510
 the stress starts to rise a plateau 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.220
 is it going to happen motivate to get there is 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.169
 alive what is the red lights 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.730
 mac action sword the pile but that I 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.250
 ai learned the genre after Thee 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.530
 game scents where Egypt a rate that 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.390
 in fact it's boosting your boost to a 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.950
 boost gauge that will fill up at 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.590
 as it is and is generated by 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.980
 those little balls that are in the in 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.450
 floor 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.830
 ok and so you have to really move to 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.660
 places on the courses that are we 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.090
 will say arrow you will speak apart from the 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.890
 boost to have the little boost 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.060
 I showed the one that then what 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.080
 you think a little air of and it's gone 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.030
 from there you use your boosterait like 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.250
 what do you want totally as you are 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.360
 you can do and coach is to fall under 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.060
 which one to support his tele tricks where that 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.740
 not at all uh not at all 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.690
 yes against him on August 26 at the end 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.780
 for a moment you have more so you can 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:29.280
 not but that's why tan ap it is 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.280
 ungrateful she just published the pledges 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.490
 and you had played a little bit you know 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.550
 a little license on the island under bada os 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.380
 x since to progress 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.720
 I played a little bit and everything will be 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.060
 cashew guests and cooke down as 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.830
 good big riders I like to see my 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.250
 small mountain the small landscape of 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.900
 water villages to help here and there 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.270
 in this game I find that the graphics 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.560
 have passed a plant that's true 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.700
 the gameplay as you say is very 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.600
 good but graphically it may be 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.800
 a little bit below it is a little bit 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.030
 buying for the blu ray but the gains 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.930
 we have a speed in the game 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.160
 finally we mouth you well but 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.190
 it's true all who wish a single 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.020
 blow is still a pen cayla is 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.670
 also a big troll a big plus 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.170
 music I think in music 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:13.390
 for me I'm a big fan of electro 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:15.770
 and the size of the sex that passes a trick 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.440
 but that's just fine 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.580
 that the art world and all tried 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.770
 some downright the type of music 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.720
 which consequently makes a big cultural show 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.190
 to know the ears is michel 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.200
 douat your console is the same thing to 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.370
 actors we see the mountain at the bottom 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.830
 frankly it's not that bad what are you 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.120
 you see that this is an ultra step 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.060
 pour it the age and behind it's like 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.270
 medium and high level of multi is this 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.250
 we can play that for proof the case 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.350
 now it's over you can not play anymore 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.240
 with split screens do not eat 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.740
 in the end to play live and live 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.060
 well done where all the riders are on 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.290
 the same mountain and I believe that I 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.060
 spend a bit of a mess bintou 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.680
 couston geotag and if people come 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.030
 not get them back you do not find that 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.550
 beat up experience points and 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.540
 the aptitude good of course there are some guys who 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.460
 gets into the places kind with 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.370
 central dropped he poses a jodel and if he 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.230
 happens except normal it does not surprise me 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.240
 Well, I had a good tour of the game. 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.380
 is rather positive very small up 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.590
 now we will ask his opinion to 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.590
 Pierre 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:16.579
 the game is not really at all 

00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:19.449
 seriously it's all about pleasure
