00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.169
 You already ate a true coronation but 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:17.950
 I 'm not talking about any crossan I 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:21.040
 I mean that good gold and 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.850
 crunchy on the outside and that 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.340
 mouth 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.220
 so today I'll show you all 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.180
 secrets of the famous croca process 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.180
 nokia 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:48.850
 come on I'm here with Mazzaropi that is 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.800
 responsible for the production of cylinders 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.460
 Heart how long you are here 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.559
 kill off more or less 19 years 19 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.409
 years and tell us the 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.210
 differential from the next ofner to the floor 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:05.140
 before the offer is well differentiated 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.180
 because it is worked over a handle 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.500
 he has mothers is a mass 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.600
 developed so that you have a 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.600
 idea takes three days to make a 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.010
 The mass is then made with love. 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.010
 so it has a hollow name 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.710
 and this beautiful mass you see 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.490
 is prepared with natural fermentation 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.490
 developed here by Ofner 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.909
 now that it goes away in the dough to 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.909
 then receive the filling 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.340
 Hey 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.760
 the base of this mass is prepared with 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.140
 flour and butter 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.440
 so we're going to start that one now. 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.330
 process that goes mass and butter mass 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.869
 butter to leave this dough well 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.869
 puff 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.009
 this rate is already good because it is super 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.880
 Smell already makes you want to put your hand 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.950
 in the mass 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.480
 but here in this step to finish the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.790
 process of perusing it will do 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.250
 those works and then will still lead to the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.019
 refrigerator to rest for 24 hours 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.900
 this beautiful mass with natural fermentation 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.879
 already rested for 24 hours to get out 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.680
 We give continuity to the process is a 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.030
 kitchen somewhat laborious but the 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.030
 result is delicious 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.930
 the boss was explaining that because of this 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.480
 to arrive at this stage that we 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.120
 Can you see she's already puffed? 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.129
 she has a three-day trial 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.530
 to say she stayed inside the fridge to 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.390
 fourth stage we went through because 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.690
 so she was firm trying slowly 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.250
 to be well crumbled on the outside 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.250
 and cuts into the mouth 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.859
 now he's going to mine the dough for 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:04.749
 arrive at the correct thickness stay soft 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.749
 crispy and rolling 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.280
 that was acting well the mass she 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.380
 is very relaxed and at the moment that he 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.010
 cut her not she's not coming back with 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.480
 the place 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.480
 it is in the right format 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.240
 before they forced with that computer 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.550
 It's good that we have a 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.550
 thing that facilitates this process, 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.790
 I asked to put my hand in the dough and he 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.530
 just said that if I make a mistake, I'll go 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.360
 eat group a 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.830
 as it now has to be 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.090
 It's no use putting put 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.190
 hand in the mass, right? 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.150
 So, come on, the first one and there, girl. 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.680
 do it like this 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:03.400
 Only then is it justified once it is so 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:06.450
 There you go first, you smell. 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.450
 to tell 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.050
 look where I'm going to eat turkey 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:24.919
 here it comes here 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.750
 Do you want to know the people I can not? 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.750
 eat raw nine turns 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:40.229
 he's putting Croats ans straight 

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:43.740
 in shape and now this mass is still going 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:50.639
 rest for another four hours after 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:54.659
 beautifully failure to get golden brown 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:57.119
 saturn 22 minutes at 140 degrees 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.909
 I do not know how to pay a visit to 

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:02.249
 okay factory and do not stay here ok 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:05.249
 taking mouth water before a 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:07.860
 chocolate mousse pie looks only the 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:12.809
 Good smell, but the 22 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.369
 minutes and now with the result people 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:22.219
 it's hot 

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:22.219
 This little golden baby can already eat 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.610
 now it's ready and cold 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.980
 she is already putting in the packaging that 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.840
 comes with six units that goes straight to 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.949
 store 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.440
 the smell here is always so 24 or so 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.540
 hours in 24 hours thank you very much 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.169
 by basij that will give a little more round 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.169
 questions 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.550
 And as usual, I'm going to pretend 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:06:05.439
 hot chocolate and to accompany 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:08.319
 that aortic arch liked comments here 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:10.870
 I was not as excited as I was. 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:13.360
 with this visit by the factory of off to 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.539
 here thinking about several recent 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.550
 nor tasteful that I can prepare with 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:21.610
 this crust is negative in the next 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.610
 three videos where I will present scenes 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:28.710
 of mouthwatering expect in a 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.710
