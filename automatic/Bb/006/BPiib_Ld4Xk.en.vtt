now look at those two d-pads this one is

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.410 
now look at those two d-pads this one is
more<00:02:00.869> as<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.710> square<00:02:02.369> shape<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
more as like a square shape in the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.910 
more as like a square shape in the
middle<00:02:03.689> i<00:02:03.869> guess<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.439> little<00:02:04.469> bit<00:02:04.770> more

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
middle i guess it's a little bit more

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.089 
middle i guess it's a little bit more
stiff<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:06.030> mean<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.810> kind<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.200> harder<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
stiff I mean it's kind of harder to

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.020 
stiff I mean it's kind of harder to
react<00:02:10.039> this<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.280> normal<00:02:11.459> d-pad<00:02:11.910> you're

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.790 
I mean it looks cool but be kind of
funky<00:02:16.310> at<00:02:16.460> times<00:02:16.780> now<00:02:17.780> moving<00:02:18.380> on<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.650> the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
funky at times now moving on to the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.050 
funky at times now moving on to the
buttons<00:02:19.660> um<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:21.740> a<00:02:21.770> button<00:02:22.160> has<00:02:22.430> been<00:02:22.460> put

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
buttons um the a button has been put

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.450 
buttons um the a button has been put
into<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.270> red<00:02:23.600> kind<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.140> like<00:02:24.290> an<00:02:24.410> mm<00:02:24.740> except

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
into a red kind of like an mm except

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.740 
into a red kind of like an mm except
square<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.270> has<00:02:26.420> an<00:02:26.600> A<00:02:26.900> in<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.260> um<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:29.090> actually

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
square it has an A in it um it actually

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.340 
square it has an A in it um it actually
feels<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.530> lot<00:02:30.680> better<00:02:31.670> than<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.810> Nintendo

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
feels a lot better than the Nintendo

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.710 
feels a lot better than the Nintendo
controller<00:02:33.590> because<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:35.270> know<00:02:35.360> bigger

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
controller because you know bigger

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.870 
controller because you know bigger
buttons<00:02:36.110> making<00:02:36.800> sure<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.280> actually<00:02:37.490> feels

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
buttons making sure it actually feels

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
buttons making sure it actually feels
like<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.330> have<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.510> better<00:02:39.350> grip<00:02:39.770> on<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.010> um<00:02:40.900> I

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
like you have a better grip on it um I

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.040 
like you have a better grip on it um I
have<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:42.800> say<00:02:43.130> about<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.580> home<00:02:43.820> button<00:02:44.270> now

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
have to say about the home button now

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.880 
have to say about the home button now
you<00:02:45.110> see<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.680> minus<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:46.820> plus<00:02:47.320> of<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.680> they're

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
you see the minus and plus of it they're

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.910 
you see the minus and plus of it they're
clear<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.880> wand<00:02:50.150> but<00:02:50.570> they're

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
clear on the wand but they're

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.200 
clear on the wand but they're
essentially<00:02:51.920> plastic<00:02:52.490> on<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.670> normal<00:02:53.060> Wii

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
essentially plastic on the normal Wii

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.450 
essentially plastic on the normal Wii
Remote<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:54.020> home<00:02:54.260> button<00:02:54.560> has<00:02:54.770> been<00:02:54.800> moved<00:02:55.130> up

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
Remote the home button has been moved up

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.240 
Remote the home button has been moved up
a<00:02:55.880> little<00:02:56.240> bit<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:57.470> if<00:02:57.770> you<00:02:57.860> look<00:02:58.040> at<00:02:58.130> the

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
a little bit and if you look at the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.300 
a little bit and if you look at the
speakers<00:02:58.630> they're<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.660> lot<00:02:59.930> different<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:01.040> one

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
speakers they're a lot different the one

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.360 
speakers they're a lot different the one
on<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:02.240> wand<00:03:02.480> speaker<00:03:03.080> more<00:03:03.500> like<00:03:03.890> echoes<00:03:04.340> a

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
on the wand speaker more like echoes a

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.090 
on the wand speaker more like echoes a
lot<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.940> it's<00:03:05.240> a<00:03:05.480> little<00:03:05.780> bit<00:03:05.870> slower<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.980> it's

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
lot and it's a little bit slower so it's

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.670 
lot and it's a little bit slower so it's
kind<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:07.310> weird<00:03:07.610> well<00:03:08.450> for<00:03:08.480> me<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.110> at<00:03:09.380> at

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
kind of weird well for me it is at at

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.400 
kind of weird well for me it is at at
least<00:03:09.940> then<00:03:10.940> we<00:03:11.180> got<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.420> wii<00:03:11.600> remote<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:12.170> just

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
least then we got the wii remote it just

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.310 
least then we got the wii remote it just
sounds<00:03:12.920> normal<00:03:13.160> from<00:03:13.820> what<00:03:13.970> you'd<00:03:14.120> expect<00:03:14.330> get

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
sounds normal from what you'd expect get

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.500 
sounds normal from what you'd expect get

other<00:04:07.880> reviews<00:04:08.150> that<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:10.640> glove<00:04:10.970> with<00:04:11.150> the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
other reviews that the glove with the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.320 
other reviews that the glove with the
nyko<00:04:11.480> thing<00:04:11.870> actually<00:04:12.130> sticks<00:04:13.130> out<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:13.820> winds

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330
