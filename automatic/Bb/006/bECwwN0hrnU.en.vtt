00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.219 
diameter dome for the 4 foot rise in the
center<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:27.540> we're<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> start<00:01:28.020> with<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
center and we're going to start with the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.719 
center and we're going to start with the
tension<00:01:28.439> ring<00:01:28.799> which<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> band<00:01:29.460> around

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729

tension ring which is the band around
the<00:01:29.909> bottom<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> dome<00:01:30.799> it's<00:01:31.799> usually

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the bottom of the dome it's usually

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.950 
the bottom of the dome it's usually
easiest<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.880> take<00:01:32.909> your<00:01:33.360> tape<00:01:33.509> measure<00:01:33.540> and

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
easiest to take your tape measure and

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.390 
easiest to take your tape measure and
hook<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> nail<00:01:34.560> or<00:01:34.740> screw<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.159> floor

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
hook it on a nail or screw in the floor

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.859 
hook it on a nail or screw in the floor
we<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> screw<00:01:36.119> here<00:01:36.329> already<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
we have a screw here already in the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.540 
we have a screw here already in the
floor

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.970 

this<00:01:43.550> time<00:01:43.790> we're<00:01:43.940> going<00:01:44.120> to<00:01:44.270> build<00:01:44.510> a<00:01:44.980> 12-foot

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
this time we're going to build a 12-foot

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.960 
this time we're going to build a 12-foot
diameter<00:01:46.250> dome<00:01:46.720> so<00:01:47.720> I'm<00:01:47.900> going<00:01:48.260> to<00:01:48.440> draw<00:01:48.970> the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
diameter dome so I'm going to draw the

00:01:49.970 --> 00:02:02.330 
diameter dome so I'm going to draw the
6-foot<00:01:50.480> radius

we're going to shape to match the line

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.490 
we're going to shape to match the line
we've<00:02:28.590> drawn<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.130> printout<00:02:30.060> calls<00:02:30.420> for<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.260> says

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
we've drawn a printout calls for it says

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.190 
we've drawn a printout calls for it says
we<00:02:31.650> need<00:02:31.769> four<00:02:32.160> lengths<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.060> flexi<00:02:33.450> track<00:02:33.720> to

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
we need four lengths of flexi track to

come<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.500> 10-foot<00:02:34.890> lengths<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.819> we're<00:02:35.910> going

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
come in 10-foot lengths so we're going

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.490 
come in 10-foot lengths so we're going
to<00:02:36.090> take<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.299> first<00:02:36.569> piece<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.930> flexi<00:02:37.260> track

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
you shave it to match just about any

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.580 
you shave it to match just about any
shape<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.520> want

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.479 

you<00:03:02.160> can<00:03:02.310> do<00:03:02.430> s<00:03:02.670> shapes<00:03:03.709> all<00:03:04.709> kinds<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.280> curves

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
you can do s shapes all kinds of curves

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.800 
you can do s shapes all kinds of curves
but<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.819> course<00:03:06.060> for<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.300> one<00:03:06.360> we're<00:03:06.599> just

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
but of course for this one we're just

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.710 
but of course for this one we're just
doing<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.140> smooth<00:03:07.470> arc<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:09.260> circle<00:03:11.510> now<00:03:12.510> that

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
doing a smooth arc a circle now that

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.300 
doing a smooth arc a circle now that
I've<00:03:12.840> got<00:03:13.019> this<00:03:13.170> shape<00:03:13.379> to<00:03:13.560> match<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.739> line<00:03:14.129> on

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
I've got this shape to match the line on

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.250 
I've got this shape to match the line on
the<00:03:14.400> floor<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.910> need<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.510> lock<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:15.750> in<00:03:16.110> its

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
the floor I need to lock this in its

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.410 
the floor I need to lock this in its
shape<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:17.220> easiest<00:03:17.580> way<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.819> do<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.150> was

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
shape and the easiest way to do this was

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.089 
shape and the easiest way to do this was
with<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> little<00:03:19.080> feature<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.500> flexi<00:03:19.860> track

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
with a little feature that flexi track

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.520 
with a little feature that flexi track
has<00:03:20.340> called<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.700> hammer<00:03:20.940> lock<00:03:21.180> tab<00:03:21.450> I've<00:03:22.290> got<00:03:22.500> a

these flat onto the concrete and that

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.890 
these flat onto the concrete and that
locks<00:03:38.549> it<00:03:38.760> in<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.209> whatever<00:03:39.360> shape<00:03:39.720> you

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
locks it in the whatever shape you

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.979 
locks it in the whatever shape you
have<00:03:40.049> it<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:40.880> let<00:03:41.880> me<00:03:41.970> show<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.180> how<00:03:42.480> easy<00:03:42.780> it

have it in let me show you how easy it
is<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.110> how<00:03:43.349> fast<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.860> works<00:03:50.780> now<00:03:51.780> those<00:03:51.989> are

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
is and how fast it works now those are

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.319 
is and how fast it works now those are
locked<00:03:52.430> so<00:03:53.430> I'm<00:03:53.549> going<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.700> go<00:03:53.819> back<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.060> make

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
locked so I'm going to go back to make

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.150 
locked so I'm going to go back to make
sure<00:03:54.599> they're<00:03:54.810> all<00:03:54.989> mashed<00:03:55.290> really<00:03:55.829> good<00:03:56.010> and

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
sure they're all mashed really good and

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.350 
sure they're all mashed really good and
flat<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:59.040> know<00:03:59.069> when<00:03:59.459> it's<00:03:59.610> properly<00:03:59.819> hammer

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
flat you know when it's properly hammer

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.589 
flat you know when it's properly hammer
locked<00:04:00.629> when<00:04:00.900> it's<00:04:01.019> smooth<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.500> touch<00:04:02.599> if

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
locked when it's smooth to the touch if

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.199 
locked when it's smooth to the touch if
you<00:04:03.810> like<00:04:04.079> you<00:04:04.379> can<00:04:04.470> still<00:04:04.739> add<00:04:04.950> screws<00:04:05.400> along

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
you like you can still add screws along

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.940 
you like you can still add screws along
the<00:04:06.420> side<00:04:06.780> like<00:04:07.049> this<00:04:07.260> but<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:07.590> really<00:04:07.829> don't

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
the side like this but you really don't

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.949

need<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.190> as<00:04:08.609> long<00:04:08.880> as<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.180> use<00:04:09.389> 20<00:04:09.810> gauge

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
need to as long as you use 20 gauge

need to as long as you use 20 gauge
track<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:11.130> what<00:04:11.280> if<00:04:11.370> you're<00:04:11.519> using<00:04:11.700> one<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.000> the

heavier versions of flexi track I have a

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.069 
heavier versions of flexi track I have a
sample<00:04:14.579> here

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.920

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.719 
with the 18 or 16 gauge flexi track
you'll<00:04:21.590> probably<00:04:21.859> still<00:04:22.340> want<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.520> hammer

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
you'll probably still want to hammer

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.670 
you'll probably still want to hammer
lock<00:04:22.940> it<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.210> hold<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.479> in<00:04:23.569> place<00:04:23.690> while<00:04:24.530> you

per section per side on each side is
enough<00:04:37.840> if<00:04:38.840> you're<00:04:39.050> building<00:04:39.199> a<00:04:39.440> full<00:04:39.650> half

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
enough if you're building a full half

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.950 
enough if you're building a full half
sphere<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:40.729> can<00:04:40.909> leave<00:04:41.060> this<00:04:41.240> strap<00:04:41.599> alone

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
sphere you can leave this strap alone

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
but if you're building a flatter don't

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.399 
but if you're building a flatter don't
like<00:04:44.210> we<00:04:44.389> are<00:04:44.509> today<00:04:44.629> you'll<00:04:44.990> need<00:04:45.139> to<00:04:45.229> pull

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:45.409 
like we are today you'll need to pull

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:47.409 
like we are today you'll need to pull
this<00:04:45.530> inside<00:04:45.919> strap<00:04:46.280> out<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:47.120> we'll<00:04:47.210> tell<00:04:47.389> you

why later but I'll show you how it comes

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.640 
why later but I'll show you how it comes
out<00:04:49.159> so<00:04:49.460> easily<00:04:49.780> you<00:04:50.780> might<00:04:50.990> as<00:04:51.110> well<00:04:51.139> pull<00:04:51.500> it

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
out so easily you might as well pull it

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
your joint and screw it like you would a

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.600 
your joint and screw it like you would a
regular<00:05:05.539> piece<00:05:06.050> of<00:05:06.229> track<00:05:06.469> but<00:05:07.159> before<00:05:07.490> you

regular piece of track but before you
install<00:05:07.819> your<00:05:07.969> screws<00:05:08.389> you'll<00:05:08.599> need<00:05:08.750> to

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
install your screws you'll need to

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.110

maintains the same radius that you've

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:15.550 
maintains the same radius that you've
drawn<00:05:13.520> on<00:05:13.669> the<00:05:13.759> floor<00:05:14.030> then<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.139> can<00:05:15.289> install

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
drawn on the floor then you can install

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.980 
drawn on the floor then you can install
your<00:05:15.620> screws<00:05:19.479> when<00:05:20.479> you've<00:05:20.599> got<00:05:20.780> all<00:05:20.900> your

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
pieces curved and spliced together check

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.029 
pieces curved and spliced together check
one<00:05:23.779> last<00:05:23.810> time<00:05:24.229> to<00:05:24.440> make<00:05:24.469> sure<00:05:24.620> that<00:05:24.770> they

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
one last time to make sure that they

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.529 
one last time to make sure that they
match<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.250> line<00:05:25.639> you've<00:05:25.849> drawn<00:05:26.090> on<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.330> floor

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
match the line you've drawn on the floor

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.640 
match the line you've drawn on the floor
for<00:05:26.750> your<00:05:26.870> dome<00:05:28.599> once<00:05:29.599> you've<00:05:29.750> matched<00:05:30.020> in<00:05:30.380> and

for your dome once you've matched in and
make<00:05:30.770> sure<00:05:30.800> everything's<00:05:31.279> just<00:05:31.400> right<00:05:31.900> then

make sure everything's just right then

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.420 
make sure everything's just right then
you'll<00:05:33.050> be<00:05:33.169> ready<00:05:33.319> to<00:05:33.440> make<00:05:33.650> your<00:05:33.830> final<00:05:34.099> cut

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
you'll be ready to make your final cut

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.450 
you'll be ready to make your final cut
and<00:05:34.580> your<00:05:34.669> final<00:05:34.909> splice<00:05:35.330> that<00:05:36.190> looks<00:05:37.190> good

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
and your final splice that looks good

00:05:37.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
and your final splice that looks good
there

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.780 

now<00:06:02.480> you<00:06:03.110> just<00:06:03.170> think<00:06:03.380> that<00:06:03.650> need<00:06:04.400> to<00:06:04.490> snip

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
now you just think that need to snip

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.580 
now you just think that need to snip
this<00:06:05.030> because<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:05.420> needs<00:06:05.600> to<00:06:05.690> land<00:06:06.230> right<00:06:06.530> at

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
this because it needs to land right at

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:14.410 
this because it needs to land right at
that<00:06:06.830> point<00:06:12.760> let's<00:06:13.760> sniff<00:06:13.940> this<00:06:14.090> we'll<00:06:14.300> go

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
that point let's sniff this we'll go

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:26.550 
that point let's sniff this we'll go
inside<00:06:14.720> there

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:45.150 

okay<00:06:27.560> now<00:06:27.770> I<00:06:27.800> need<00:06:27.980> to<00:06:28.070> screw<00:06:28.340> it<00:06:28.430> right<00:06:28.460> there

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.470 

okay<00:06:46.160> there's<00:06:46.520> your<00:06:46.640> final<00:06:46.760> splice<00:06:47.150> now

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
okay there's your final splice now

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.440 
okay there's your final splice now
you've<00:06:47.630> got<00:06:47.750> your<00:06:47.870> tension<00:06:48.230> ring
