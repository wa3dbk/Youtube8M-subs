do now is take a clean soft cloth and
just<00:01:33.490> buff<00:01:33.820> it<00:01:34.030> out<00:01:34.150> in<00:01:34.360> circular<00:01:35.140> motions<00:01:35.740> it

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
just buff it out in circular motions it

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.820 
just buff it out in circular motions it
says<00:01:36.160> to<00:01:36.340> go<00:01:36.490> from<00:01:36.730> multiple<00:01:37.150> angles<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:38.680> to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
says to go from multiple angles but to

00:01:38.830 --> 00:02:07.109 
says to go from multiple angles but to
do<00:01:38.950> it<00:01:38.980> in<00:01:39.100> a<00:01:39.220> circular<00:01:39.460> pattern

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.150 

and<00:02:08.119> once<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.690> cloth<00:02:09.200> gets<00:02:10.090> too<00:02:11.090> much<00:02:11.240> of<00:02:11.630> the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
and once the cloth gets too much of the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.480 
and once the cloth gets too much of the
stuff<00:02:13.160> on<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.490> just<00:02:14.620> move<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.860> cleaner<00:02:16.160> part

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
stuff on it just move to a cleaner part

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.540 
stuff on it just move to a cleaner part
of<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.670> cloth<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:18.010> doesn't<00:02:19.010> take<00:02:19.160> out<00:02:19.340> all

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
of the cloth that doesn't take out all

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.190 
of the cloth that doesn't take out all
the<00:02:19.820> scratches<00:02:20.090> if<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.570> have<00:02:20.660> deep<00:02:20.840> scratches

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
the scratches if you have deep scratches

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.010 
the scratches if you have deep scratches
then<00:02:21.740> you're<00:02:22.340> going<00:02:22.460> to<00:02:22.520> need<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:23.020> really

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
then you're going to need a really

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.210 
then you're going to need a really
expensive<00:02:24.350> machine<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:26.480> fix<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.930> but<00:02:27.080> this<00:02:27.320> has

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
expensive machine to fix it but this has

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.530 
expensive machine to fix it but this has
done<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.580> trick<00:02:28.990> for<00:02:29.990> any<00:02:30.230> kind<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.650> scratch

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
done the trick for any kind of scratch

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.750 
done the trick for any kind of scratch
that<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.810> couldn't<00:02:33.380> you<00:02:33.920> know<00:02:34.040> if<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.370> can<00:02:34.550> run

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
that I couldn't you know if you can run

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.700 
that I couldn't you know if you can run
your<00:02:34.940> finger<00:02:35.210> and<00:02:35.360> feel<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.630> groove<00:02:36.050> then<00:02:36.530> it's

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
your finger and feel a groove then it's

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.500 
your finger and feel a groove then it's
probably<00:02:36.890> too<00:02:37.400> deep<00:02:37.610> but<00:02:37.940> for<00:02:38.180> any<00:02:38.330> of<00:02:38.420> the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
probably too deep but for any of the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.420 
probably too deep but for any of the
light<00:02:38.690> ones<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:41.030> does<00:02:41.300> an<00:02:41.390> excellent<00:02:41.660> job<00:02:42.430> so

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
light ones this does an excellent job so

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.590 
light ones this does an excellent job so
hopefully<00:02:43.820> that<00:02:44.000> helps<00:02:44.390> if<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.260> did<00:02:45.440> please

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
hopefully that helps if it did please

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.940 
hopefully that helps if it did please
