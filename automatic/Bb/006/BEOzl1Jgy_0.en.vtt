00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.049
 hello to all and today I'm going 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.410
 show you how to make a ball in 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.269
 origami from a sheet of paper 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.549
 so to start you take your 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.080
 sheet of paper 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.680
 I have already done folding for easy 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.090
 to facilitate attachment so forgotten in 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:31.679
 diagonal not only this and in 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:41.160
 the other way you bend also go away in 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:47.219
 parallel so in this sense there and in 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:52.219
 the other meaning so when you're done 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:01:00.050
 all his folds forget like these 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:00.050
 in the middle you straighten the right side 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:13.650
 and you take the tip here and you 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:16.520
 fold like that then you bend 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.520
 this part 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:35.660
 you take the left side that we have the 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:38.690
 tip and you close this off you 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:48.200
 have your basic video from 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:52.119
 this figure you bend so following his 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.119
 to hold like this 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:15.460
 t 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:26.280
 as know here to go back to you 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:26.280
 do the same thing like that and like that 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:38.910
 then after facing you turn down 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.910
 the two points towards the middle 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.900
 here 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.260
 as much the figure and executioner start 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.800
 that's what gives us this 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:28.260
 then we understood the side with the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:34.500
 moving points you can move 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:42.269
 on that side you can not 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:51.780
 can you take a tip and you 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:54.799
 fold down as those have 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.799
 do the same on that side 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:10.549
 you press well and then you 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:31.580
 close the rest in the family is 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:34.750
 here is how you fold like this 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.750
 next to 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:53.059
 here you go back to figure and you 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.059
 do exactly the same thing 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:14.229
 the group bound both sides for 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:14.229
 bait safer inside 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:47.180
 and now the looters who 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:53.030
 are slaughtered you just need 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.099
 just blow into the hole that 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.780
 is here 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:59.110
 to make your balloon so I'm going 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.110
 blow 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:33.590
 here we go I blew this little 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:37.310
 hole there and monbalen was done so 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.140
 this is it's a little pretty you 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:43.460
 can decorate sister to use the 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.500
 paper that shines otherwise second 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:49.130
 use you put in and you 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:52.010
 can send it on someone and that's 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:07:22.540
 a very good effect in many also the 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:07:22.540
 tidy up here so here we blast here it is 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:31.530
