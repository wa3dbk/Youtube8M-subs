00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.420
 Welcome to a new edition of magical others 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.970
 This time we stand 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.199
 actually should 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.129
 and make the five stand 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.300
 Yes 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.129
 brag 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.310
 Hahn the report was also half empty we go to the top and 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.970
 were able to learn 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 Ben Ali is going to have a loud mirror 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.039
 There we finally pay off 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.169
 and then he lays down Zastrow even warned him 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.300
 and continue to be there 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.540
 The Federation Brad 40 years no longer stop 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.500
 to get tips on how to do it 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.770
 on 2227 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.770
 who more 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.350
 the personality is quite moderate at 2227 meters above sea level 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.870
 these are the gray hairs we use in other values 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.940
 and the look is the director 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.810
 Southeast direction 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.990
 van leer out of here is obvious to see 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.990
 it works from here 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.950
 Worms the rise 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.290
 for five games 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.300
 that's how Thilo can become 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.520
 this one 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.650
 and revile Chen 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.650
 this is Do 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.580
 the clock 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.560
 Euro 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 Duden will see 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.120
 they are very depressing 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.780
 at least came 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.810
 after the wonderful panorama 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.460
 be priced 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.460
 see next 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.739
 to take no one for so long 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.609
 like Wensing's, Wensing repeated other names 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.559
 Europe and America and Oceania 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.569
 and the project sees how many euros there were scenes 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:32.719
 Holebas 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.059
 that would 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:37.059
 Ahlen now knows as to see 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.569
 for her non-binding 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.109
 No next to «top left Björn Brinkmann 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.789
 According to one about the Berliner the Russian does not win 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.959
 no longer in the race for a seat in Switzerland 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.019
 on 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.019
 below 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.219
 your reasons 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:27.729
 the one call 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.279
 become 4 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:39.329
 he is provided with a chip 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.749
