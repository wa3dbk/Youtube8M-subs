00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.570
 with other minutes to a new video already 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.360
 have reported slow since the 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.789
 morning of ten fifteen and good 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.849
 I do not know some of you will have since these 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.980
 valve heights was rumored since 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.279
 time I was trying to make a 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.369
 hybrid of console and PC hardware not 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.930
 between the two not that was holding that 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.930
 between the best of each 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.230
 the rumors are carried about this was not going 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.570
 more so much the rumors and it's that it seems 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.090
 be they are looking are looking 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.949
 people to make a console they put on 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.180
 a job offer say the following 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.730
 We are developing hardware for 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.890
 improve those experiences and you can 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.510
 be a key part for this to happen 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.010
 join our motivated team that is 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.900
 designing a machine doing 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.839
 prototypes this year and producing in 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.940
 a wide range of systems we do not talk 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.790
 of mice and peace help us to invent 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.589
 a whole new experience and that without 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.890
 doubt is totally a job advertisement 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.439
 for a console do not tell me not me 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.420
 really this as you can see, I have not 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.030
 talked a lot about about it the first 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.460
 video that he dedicated to the rumored sting 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.780
 box that would be the next console that 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.770
 would produce valve valve is known by 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.570
 many already for great games 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.009
 more returns presentations as well 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.590
 say it 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.590
 jal live is among its highlights 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.520
 the truth is that what they want to do 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.830
 that is rumored that they want to do because 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.479
 is doing something is clear but what 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.090
 that is rumored to be is going to be a 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.710
 Hybrid console etc. so good that 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.940
 we can connect it to our television 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.039
 and apart from playing pc games I would go 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.810
 with the digital download platform of 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.210
 destination digital distribution already 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.220
 you know that you estimate a store 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.869
 digital that you buy what good 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.850
 You want to lower it not thus far 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.220
 supposedly last inbox how it 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.350
 call this console because 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.810
 it would work signs by downloading 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.510
 digital or through pc game is a 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.950
 great idea is a great idea totally if 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.340
 me at the beginning when I read it I have 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.560
 said another console more then no but if 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.080
 a console that is a console but is 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.580
 supporting in the pc then totally but 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.640
 people are going to look for the community in the 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.820
 comfort of the console on a pc no no 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.170
 if you understand me the people that really 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.990
 look for comfort you bought a console not 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.370
 the people who are looking for maybe better 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.190
 experiences so it was best bought 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.570
 I started because he knows the subject of such 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.550
 I think that this is good because they would come together 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.190
 the all the issues and the truth that 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.920
 it would be pretty good no and I think that 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.680
 would have competition not the new xbox of 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.420
 the wii and the new one pointed out I do not think that 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.520
 there would be a pretty enough competition 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.280
 direct us yes especially if these two 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.960
 last systems that named stps 4 or 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.090
 Xbox 720 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.390
 had something against the second 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.180
 hand or something like that against something not 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.430
 then here the pc would win and some teambox 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.650
 that rests on the pp would win perhaps the 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.270
 battle and one nothing else if it has been 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.640
 liked the news 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.220
 we have more attentive about this for now 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.080
 he returns, he is not going, he is not going to release his pledge 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.200
 of all this is not going to say anything about 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.850
 this console but good let's see what it is 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.530
 what happens to me all this 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.880
 all this offer of employment I think 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.000
 totally to work a new 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.260
 console the truth and good nothing but 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.340
 has liked the news we do not see in the 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.340
 next video until next time
