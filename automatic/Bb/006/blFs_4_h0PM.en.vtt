 salt count 10 to 12 grams of salt in bed too early 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.650
 to cook pasta there is no single cooking time that is to say that 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.750
 barak as in the kitchen it is necessary to beat so to taste it is there that one takes one

 dive into a die we'll look at how and the dough and the dough must 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.239
 to be alden tv alden what to say to the tooth 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.039
 which simply means that it cut me off at the moment 2 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.760
 tasting 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.760
 this is what will allow us to determine the baking of the dough 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.770

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.190

 the occurrence olive oil do not mix any more milk to be 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.440
 above the vacuum patents in the middle no interest 2002 to put in 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.830
 olive oil in the cooking water by account 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.830
 in the end once we patch will be cooked and we wanted to have 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.580
 filter from his cooking water 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.430
 we will master to give him 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.970
 gellos kibo I add harmful 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.970
 especially without

 I always leave the temperature of my back constant I do not drop I 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.280
 do not increase that content 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.549
 I did not say for you but for your children to prevent that from happening 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.590

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.359
 simply we will appreciate it to see 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.710
 how passion is prevented a fairly important resistance 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.720
 which precisely determines the cooking of course is not important to them 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.760
 the more one that is not enough so 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.550
