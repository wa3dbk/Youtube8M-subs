when I say upper level low normally a
low-pressure<00:05:52.440> area<00:05:52.770> which<00:05:52.950> would<00:05:53.160> bring<00:05:53.310> rain

low-pressure area which would bring rain

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.210

would<00:05:54.600> be<00:05:54.630> at<00:05:54.840> about<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:55.170> 5000<00:05:55.860> foot<00:05:55.980> level

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
would be at about the 5000 foot level

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.220 
would be at about the 5000 foot level
this<00:05:56.670> one<00:05:56.880> is<00:05:56.910> running<00:05:57.240> at<00:05:57.330> about<00:05:57.390> 35<00:05:58.050> to

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
this one is running at about 35 to

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.740 
this one is running at about 35 to
40,000<00:05:58.980> feet<00:05:59.130> so<00:05:59.340> it's<00:05:59.490> it's<00:05:59.940> very<00:06:00.240> high<00:06:00.480> and

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
40,000 feet so it's it's very high and

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.300 
40,000 feet so it's it's very high and
so<00:06:00.900> far<00:06:01.140> the<00:06:01.230> high<00:06:01.380> pressure<00:06:01.650> has<00:06:01.890> kept<00:06:02.190> it

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
so far the high pressure has kept it

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.890 
so far the high pressure has kept it
away<00:06:02.400> from<00:06:02.640> us<00:06:02.850> but<00:06:03.210> it<00:06:03.330> still<00:06:03.540> looks<00:06:03.720> as

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
away from us but it still looks as

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.330 
away from us but it still looks as
though<00:06:03.930> it's<00:06:04.200> going<00:06:04.290> to<00:06:04.380> move<00:06:04.560> on<00:06:04.740> in<00:06:04.980> and<00:06:05.220> give

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
though it's going to move on in and give

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.610 
though it's going to move on in and give
us<00:06:05.490> about<00:06:05.670> a<00:06:05.820> 90<00:06:06.240> percent<00:06:06.630> chance<00:06:06.690> of<00:06:07.050> rain<00:06:07.110> for

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
us about a 90 percent chance of rain for

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.820 
us about a 90 percent chance of rain for
tomorrow<00:06:08.360> increased<00:06:09.360> a<00:06:09.810> little<00:06:10.200> bit<00:06:10.320> more<00:06:10.530> and
