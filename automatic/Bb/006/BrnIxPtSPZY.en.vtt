welcome<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.800> video<00:00:02.190> in<00:00:02.460> which<00:00:02.970> we<00:00:03.000> will

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
welcome to this video in which we will

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.420 
welcome to this video in which we will
solve<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.899> truss<00:00:04.170> or<00:00:04.440> at<00:00:04.890> least<00:00:05.040> part<00:00:05.279> of<00:00:05.339> the

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
solve a truss or at least part of the

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.210 
solve a truss or at least part of the
truss<00:00:05.670> using<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.390> method<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.810> sections<00:00:07.230> the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
truss using the method of sections the

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.860 
truss using the method of sections the
method<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.639> sections<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.360> particularly

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
method of sections is particularly

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.320 
method of sections is particularly
useful<00:00:10.320> when<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.219> have<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.460> structure<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.210> you

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
useful when you have a structure and you

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.020 
useful when you have a structure and you
want<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.660> find<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.799> tension<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.460> some<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
want to find the tension in some of the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.630 
want to find the tension in some of the
members<00:00:15.240> but<00:00:15.540> not<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.929> all<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.230> them<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:17.250> idea

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
members but not in all of them the idea

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.849 
members but not in all of them the idea
is<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.210> cut<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.810> section<00:00:19.560> through<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
is that you cut a section through the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.750 
is that you cut a section through the
truss<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.810> then<00:00:21.810> use<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> free<00:00:22.890> body<00:00:23.070> diagram

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
truss and then use a free body diagram

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.580 
truss and then use a free body diagram
of<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.609> part<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.210> truss<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.439> you've

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
of the the part of the truss that you've

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.630 
of the the part of the truss that you've
cut<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.949> section<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:31.279> can<00:00:32.279> actually

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
cut the section of and that can actually

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.639 
cut the section of and that can actually
make<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.480> quite<00:00:33.660> simple<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.200> solve<00:00:34.380> for

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
make it quite simple to solve for

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.049 
make it quite simple to solve for
tension<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.130> members<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
tension and members if you do the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.770 
tension and members if you do the
section<00:00:36.620> correctly<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.800> wisely<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:39.660> we

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
section correctly and wisely so here we

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.209 
section correctly and wisely so here we
have<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.469> trust<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.890> we'll<00:00:41.040> use<00:00:41.070> to

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
have the trust that we'll use to

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.299 
have the trust that we'll use to
demonstrate<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.899> has<00:00:43.200> six<00:00:43.680> joints<00:00:43.920> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
demonstrate this it has six joints a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.930 
demonstrate this it has six joints a
through<00:00:44.760> F<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.800> 9<00:00:46.800> members<00:00:47.129> labeled<00:00:47.760> one

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
through F and 9 members labeled one

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.779 
through F and 9 members labeled one
through<00:00:47.969> nine<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:49.010> suppose<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.550> want<00:00:50.730> to

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
through nine and suppose that we want to

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.439 
through nine and suppose that we want to
find<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.210> tension<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.690> members<00:00:52.289> 5<00:00:52.530> 6<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.100> 7<00:00:53.449> so

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
find the tension in members 5 6 and 7 so

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.889 
find the tension in members 5 6 and 7 so
5<00:00:56.090> this<00:00:57.090> guy<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:58.109> guy<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.680> guy<00:00:59.899> well

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
5 this guy this guy and this guy well

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.529 
5 this guy this guy and this guy well
one<00:01:01.620> way<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.030> cut<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> section

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
one way to do that is to cut a section

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.390 
one way to do that is to cut a section
through<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.960> trust<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.619> actually<00:01:05.100> cuts

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
through the trust that actually cuts

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.030 
through the trust that actually cuts
through<00:01:05.760> these<00:01:05.970> five<00:01:06.360> or<00:01:07.350> I'm<00:01:07.530> sorry<00:01:07.740> through

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
through these five or I'm sorry through

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.890 
through these five or I'm sorry through
these<00:01:08.220> three<00:01:08.490> members<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.180> want<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.630> find

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
these three members that we want to find

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.789 
these three members that we want to find
the<00:01:10.890> tension<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.450> let's<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.619> let's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the tension in so let's do that let's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.010 
the tension in so let's do that let's
just<00:01:14.159> take<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.549> trust<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.090> cut<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.540> cut<00:01:15.869> it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
just take the trust and cut and cut it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.010 
just take the trust and cut and cut it
along<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.619> Green<00:01:16.920> Line<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.840> then<00:01:18.840> what

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
along this Green Line and then what

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.340 
along this Green Line and then what
we'll<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:20.520> will<00:01:20.850> draw<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:22.049> Freebody

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
we'll do is we will draw a Freebody

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.240 
we'll do is we will draw a Freebody
diagram<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.549> all<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> truss<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.950> left

diagram of all of the truss to the left
of<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.759> Green<00:01:27.030> Line<00:01:27.470> solve<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.680> free<00:01:28.950> body

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
of the Green Line solve that free body

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.020 
of the Green Line solve that free body
diagram<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:31.200> tension<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.860> members<00:01:32.400> 5<00:01:32.640> 6

diagram for the tension and members 5 6
&amp;<00:01:33.240> 7<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.750> we'll<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.710> done<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.520> turns<00:01:35.729> out

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
&amp; 7 and we'll be done and it turns out

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.539 
&amp; 7 and we'll be done and it turns out
in<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.869> case<00:01:36.930> at<00:01:37.350> least<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.920> much<00:01:38.159> simpler

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
in this case at least to be much simpler

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.080 
in this case at least to be much simpler
than<00:01:38.790> solving<00:01:39.240> all<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.490> for<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> tensions

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
than solving all of the for the tensions

than solving all of the for the tensions
and<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> members<00:01:43.640> ok<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.420> let's<00:01:45.750> draw

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
and all of the members ok so let's draw

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.679 
and all of the members ok so let's draw
our<00:01:46.350> free<00:01:47.009> body<00:01:47.189> diagram<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.180> section<00:01:48.570> we

moments about a point equals zero and in

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.009 
moments about a point equals zero and in
this<00:03:27.290> case<00:03:27.530> we<00:03:28.130> will<00:03:28.400> choose<00:03:29.590> Point<00:03:30.590> C<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:32.019> be

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
this case we will choose Point C to be

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.930 
this case we will choose Point C to be
the<00:03:33.650> point<00:03:33.830> about<00:03:34.100> which<00:03:34.250> we<00:03:34.459> compute<00:03:34.820> the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
the point about which we compute the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.199 
the point about which we compute the
moment<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:36.019> reason<00:03:36.410> for<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.769> is<00:03:37.010> that<00:03:37.489> all

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
moment the reason for that is that all

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.860 
moment the reason for that is that all
of<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.570> forces<00:03:38.870> except<00:03:39.320> 47<00:03:40.180> go<00:03:41.180> through<00:03:41.450> C<00:03:41.660> so

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
of the forces except 47 go through C so

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.979 
of the forces except 47 go through C so
it's<00:03:42.019> going<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.320> make<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.680> easy<00:03:43.209> so<00:03:44.209> we<00:03:44.780> have

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
it's going to make it easy so we have

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.620 
it's going to make it easy so we have
the<00:03:45.320> sum<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.829> the<00:03:46.340> I'm<00:03:47.000> sorry<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.510> sum<00:03:47.720> of<00:03:47.930> the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
the sum of the I'm sorry the sum of the

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.420 
the sum of the I'm sorry the sum of the
moments<00:03:50.630> about<00:03:52.150> Point<00:03:53.150> C<00:03:53.239> or<00:03:53.540> equal<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:53.930> zero

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
moments about Point C or equal to zero

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.729 
moments about Point C or equal to zero
well<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.579> only<00:03:55.790> moment<00:03:56.120> about<00:03:56.390> point<00:03:56.540> C<00:03:57.079> is<00:03:57.350> T

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
well the only moment about point C is T

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.420 
well the only moment about point C is T
seven<00:03:58.310> it<00:03:59.060> has<00:03:59.329> a<00:03:59.360> moment<00:03:59.840> arm<00:04:00.049> here<00:04:00.739> of<00:04:00.920> 12

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
seven it has a moment arm here of 12

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.990 
seven it has a moment arm here of 12
feet

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
feet

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.229 
feet
so<00:04:02.329> we<00:04:02.390> have<00:04:02.570> T<00:04:02.720> seven<00:04:03.079> times<00:04:03.290> twelve<00:04:03.590> feet<00:04:03.829> is

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
so we have T seven times twelve feet is

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.569 
so we have T seven times twelve feet is
equal<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.360> zero<00:04:05.829> which<00:04:06.829> means<00:04:06.890> that<00:04:07.459> the

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
equal to zero which means that the

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.560 
equal to zero which means that the
tension<00:04:08.060> in<00:04:08.239> number<00:04:08.930> seven<00:04:09.320> is<00:04:09.500> zero<00:04:10.570> wasn't

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
tension in number seven is zero wasn't

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.020 
tension in number seven is zero wasn't
that<00:04:11.660> easy

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
that easy

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.740 
that easy
okay<00:04:14.030> let's

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
okay let's

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.229 
okay let's
then<00:04:17.269> sum<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.600> forces<00:04:18.630> in<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.230> y-direction

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
then sum the forces in the y-direction

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:31.760 
then sum the forces in the y-direction
and<00:04:22.280> we<00:04:23.280> have<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:24.510> t5<00:04:28.760> sine<00:04:30.470> twenty<00:04:31.470> six

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
and we have that t5 sine twenty six

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.970 
and we have that t5 sine twenty six
point<00:04:32.100> six<00:04:32.430> degrees<00:04:32.550> that's<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:34.260> sky<00:04:34.560> going

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
point six degrees that's the sky going

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.810 
point six degrees that's the sky going
up<00:04:35.720> minus<00:04:36.720> T<00:04:37.020> six

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
up minus T six

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.120 
up minus T six
sine<00:04:39.920> twenty<00:04:40.920> six<00:04:41.280> point<00:04:41.610> six<00:04:42.000> degrees<00:04:43.130> minus

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
sine twenty six point six degrees minus

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.690 
sine twenty six point six degrees minus
thirty<00:04:44.820> thousand<00:04:47.030> is<00:04:48.030> equal<00:04:48.450> to<00:04:48.570> zero<00:04:48.900> okay<00:04:49.700> we

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
thirty thousand is equal to zero okay we

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.280 
thirty thousand is equal to zero okay we
can't<00:04:50.910> solve<00:04:51.120> this<00:04:51.300> directly<00:04:51.480> yet<00:04:51.960> for

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
can't solve this directly yet for

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.830 
can't solve this directly yet for
anything<00:04:52.500> so<00:04:53.490> let's<00:04:53.820> sum<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.270> forces<00:04:54.300> in<00:04:54.720> the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
anything so let's sum the forces in the

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.690 
anything so let's sum the forces in the
x-direction<00:04:55.200> and<00:04:57.500> we<00:04:58.500> have<00:04:58.770> here<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.460> t<00:05:00.419> five

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700

t<00:05:07.200> 6<00:05:07.980> cosine<00:05:09.260> twenty<00:05:10.260> six<00:05:10.560> point<00:05:10.860> six<00:05:11.220> degrees

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
t 6 cosine twenty six point six degrees

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.800 
t 6 cosine twenty six point six degrees
is<00:05:11.940> equal<00:05:12.330> to<00:05:12.390> zero<00:05:12.780> and<00:05:14.030> so<00:05:15.030> this<00:05:15.270> tells<00:05:15.540> us

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
is equal to zero and so this tells us

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:23.440 
is equal to zero and so this tells us
that<00:05:16.080> T<00:05:16.590> five<00:05:18.380> is<00:05:19.430> equal<00:05:20.430> to<00:05:21.180> negative<00:05:21.510> T<00:05:22.050> six

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
that T five is equal to negative T six

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:30.430 
that T five is equal to negative T six
so<00:05:24.450> we<00:05:24.600> can<00:05:24.780> take<00:05:25.050> this<00:05:25.530> and<00:05:28.640> plug<00:05:29.640> it<00:05:29.820> in<00:05:30.000> to

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
so we can take this and plug it in to

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.500 
so we can take this and plug it in to
this<00:05:31.440> equation<00:05:32.240> to<00:05:33.240> get<00:05:33.479> T<00:05:33.780> five<00:05:34.880> sine<00:05:35.880> twenty

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
this equation to get T five sine twenty

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:42.050 
this equation to get T five sine twenty
six<00:05:36.870> point<00:05:37.200> six<00:05:37.560> degrees<00:05:38.540> plus<00:05:39.540> T<00:05:40.229> five<00:05:41.060> sine

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
six point six degrees plus T five sine

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.520 
six point six degrees plus T five sine
twenty<00:05:42.960> six<00:05:43.320> point<00:05:43.680> six<00:05:44.070> degrees<00:05:44.550> and<00:05:45.260> this<00:05:46.260> is

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
twenty six point six degrees and this is

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.930 
twenty six point six degrees and this is
equal<00:05:46.979> to<00:05:47.100> thirty<00:05:47.340> thousand<00:05:47.850> pounds<00:05:49.940> from

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
equal to thirty thousand pounds from

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.120 
equal to thirty thousand pounds from
which<00:05:51.120> we<00:05:51.300> can<00:05:51.510> compute<00:05:51.870> that<00:05:52.110> T<00:05:52.290> five<00:05:52.620> is

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
which we can compute that T five is

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.890 
which we can compute that T five is
equal<00:05:53.610> to<00:05:55.460> thirty<00:05:56.460> three<00:05:56.700> thousand<00:05:57.390> five

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
equal to thirty three thousand five

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:04.190 
equal to thirty three thousand five
hundred<00:05:58.260> pounds<00:05:59.130> and<00:06:00.169> T<00:06:01.169> six<00:06:01.500> then<00:06:02.960> will<00:06:03.960> be

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
hundred pounds and T six then will be

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.219 
hundred pounds and T six then will be
minus<00:06:04.770> thirty<00:06:05.070> three<00:06:05.400> thousand<00:06:05.990> five<00:06:06.990> hundred

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
minus thirty three thousand five hundred

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.860 
minus thirty three thousand five hundred
pounds<00:06:08.060> so<00:06:09.060> there<00:06:09.210> you<00:06:09.330> have<00:06:09.390> it

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
pounds so there you have it

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.060 
pounds so there you have it
that<00:06:10.110> was<00:06:10.260> actually<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.680> pretty<00:06:10.860> simple

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
that was actually a pretty simple

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.190 
that was actually a pretty simple
computation<00:06:11.970> and<00:06:12.290> it<00:06:13.290> gives<00:06:13.560> us<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:13.919> value<00:06:14.340> of

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
computation and it gives us the value of

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.510 
computation and it gives us the value of
the<00:06:16.200> tensions<00:06:16.650> and<00:06:16.740> the<00:06:16.830> members<00:06:17.220> that<00:06:17.400> we

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
the tensions and the members that we

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.400 
the tensions and the members that we
wanted<00:06:17.850> to<00:06:17.940> know<00:06:18.090> without<00:06:18.720> having<00:06:19.110> to<00:06:19.200> solve

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
wanted to know without having to solve

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.930 
wanted to know without having to solve
for<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:19.740> tensions<00:06:20.160> in<00:06:20.310> any<00:06:20.580> of<00:06:20.729> the<00:06:20.790> other

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
for the tensions in any of the other

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:28.300 
for the tensions in any of the other
members<00:06:21.390> and<00:06:23.180> for<00:06:24.180> this<00:06:24.270> particular<00:06:24.630> truss

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.210 

it<00:06:29.510> turns<00:06:30.510> out<00:06:30.780> that<00:06:31.020> probably<00:06:31.560> if<00:06:31.890> we<00:06:32.100> took

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
it turns out that probably if we took

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:39.080 
it turns out that probably if we took
another<00:06:32.370> section<00:06:33.890> through<00:06:34.890> here<00:06:37.190> to<00:06:38.190> get<00:06:38.490> t1

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
another section through here to get t1

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.930 
another section through here to get t1
t3<00:06:39.420> and<00:06:39.780> t4<00:06:40.310> that<00:06:41.310> would<00:06:41.460> be<00:06:41.580> a<00:06:41.610> pretty<00:06:41.820> easy

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
t3 and t4 that would be a pretty easy

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.420 
t3 and t4 that would be a pretty easy
computation<00:06:42.870> as<00:06:43.050> well<00:06:43.260> and<00:06:43.590> then<00:06:44.100> we<00:06:44.250> just

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
computation as well and then we just

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.220 
computation as well and then we just
have<00:06:44.640> to<00:06:44.670> find<00:06:45.060> the<00:06:45.330> tensions<00:06:46.020> and<00:06:46.140> the

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
have to find the tensions and the

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.990 
have to find the tensions and the
vertical<00:06:46.500> numbers<00:06:46.950> if<00:06:47.160> we<00:06:47.190> wanted<00:06:47.550> all<00:06:47.730> of<00:06:47.760> the

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
vertical numbers if we wanted all of the

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000 
vertical numbers if we wanted all of the
tensions<00:06:48.450> and<00:06:48.630> that<00:06:49.230> wouldn't<00:06:49.500> be<00:06:49.590> that<00:06:49.620> bad

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
tensions and that wouldn't be that bad

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.640 
tensions and that wouldn't be that bad
so<00:06:50.880> for<00:06:51.120> this<00:06:51.240> particular<00:06:51.420> truss<00:06:52.110> using<00:06:52.560> the

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
so for this particular truss using the

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.240 
so for this particular truss using the
method<00:06:52.920> of<00:06:53.010> sections<00:06:53.250> to<00:06:53.670> find<00:06:53.940> all<00:06:54.210> of<00:06:54.240> the

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
method of sections to find all of the

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.700 
method of sections to find all of the
tensions<00:06:56.250> and<00:06:56.400> the<00:06:56.460> members<00:06:57.120> would<00:06:57.390> not<00:06:57.600> be<00:06:57.840> it

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
tensions and the members would not be it

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.170 
tensions and the members would not be it
would<00:06:58.920> probably<00:06:59.130> be<00:06:59.400> the<00:06:59.520> easier<00:06:59.790> way<00:06:59.910> to<00:06:59.940> do

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
would probably be the easier way to do

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.450 
would probably be the easier way to do
it<00:07:00.330> in<00:07:00.510> general<00:07:01.500> that's<00:07:01.650> probably<00:07:02.040> not<00:07:02.250> true

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
it in general that's probably not true

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.390 
it in general that's probably not true
but<00:07:03.330> for<00:07:04.140> a<00:07:04.170> case<00:07:04.410> where<00:07:04.650> you<00:07:04.770> can<00:07:04.980> cut<00:07:05.910> the<00:07:07.400> the

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 
but for a case where you can cut the the

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.340 
but for a case where you can cut the the
trust<00:07:08.730> so<00:07:08.970> that<00:07:09.150> you<00:07:09.240> find<00:07:09.570> or<00:07:09.900> that<00:07:10.080> you<00:07:10.170> have

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.350 
trust so that you find or that you have

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.900 
trust so that you find or that you have
the<00:07:10.530> tension<00:07:10.740> and<00:07:11.070> three<00:07:11.220> unknowns<00:07:11.340> members

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:11.910 
the tension and three unknowns members

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.090 
the tension and three unknowns members
this<00:07:12.900> is<00:07:13.050> an<00:07:13.200> easy<00:07:13.350> way<00:07:13.560> to<00:07:13.590> find<00:07:13.860> those

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 
this is an easy way to find those

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.670 
this is an easy way to find those
tensions<00:07:14.630> so<00:07:15.630> hopefully<00:07:16.200> you<00:07:16.320> found<00:07:16.350> this

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
tensions so hopefully you found this

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.260 
tensions so hopefully you found this
helpful<00:07:16.740> and<00:07:17.310> that<00:07:17.610> will<00:07:17.790> conclude<00:07:18.030> this

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
helpful and that will conclude this

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.570 
helpful and that will conclude this
