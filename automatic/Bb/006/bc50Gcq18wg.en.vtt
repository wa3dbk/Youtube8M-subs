much good to have you along and of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.770 
much good to have you along and of
course<00:00:35.730> there<00:00:35.910> are<00:00:36.030> thousands<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.510> others

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
course there are thousands of others

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.389 
course there are thousands of others
along<00:00:36.930> similar<00:00:37.200> lines<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.890> clearly<00:00:38.160> there<00:00:38.370> are

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
along similar lines so clearly there are

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.250 
along similar lines so clearly there are
many<00:00:38.489> novelists<00:00:38.940> out<00:00:39.149> there<00:00:39.329> fermenting<00:00:39.960> and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
many novelists out there fermenting and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.110 
many novelists out there fermenting and
just<00:00:40.559> waiting<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.190> muse<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.640> spirit<00:00:42.000> them

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
just waiting for the muse to spirit them

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.790 
just waiting for the muse to spirit them
into<00:00:42.300> print<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.649> is

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
into print and I think that this is

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.529 
into print and I think that this is
obviously<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.399> suitable<00:00:44.850> moment<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.329> just

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
obviously a suitable moment to just

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.430 
obviously a suitable moment to just
whistle<00:00:45.809> through<00:00:45.989> some<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.320> more

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
whistle through some of the more

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.350 
whistle through some of the more
fundamental<00:00:46.590> do's<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.129> don'ts<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.149> novel
