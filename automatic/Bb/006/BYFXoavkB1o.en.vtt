00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
you try to double shot but you

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.339 
you try to double shot but you
accidently<00:02:30.190> reload<00:02:30.549> sit<00:02:31.209> YY<00:02:31.599> and<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.170> will

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
accidently reload sit YY and it will

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.220 
accidently reload sit YY and it will
cancel<00:02:32.739> that<00:02:33.040> reload<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.670> save<00:02:33.879> your<00:02:34.060> life
