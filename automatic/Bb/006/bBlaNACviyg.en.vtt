00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.760
 hello hello hello this tutorial for the 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.940
 assembly of the change kit for the 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.250
 moto bike which consists of a series of 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.590
 axes and chains to transfer the 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.200
 transmission of the left side of the 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.150
 bicycle to the right side and from there to 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.009
 changes of the bicycle this for 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.589
 take advantage of them and be able to climb streets 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.280
 very steep or go faster at 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.050
 flat areas 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.410
 This kit contains the following parts 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.030
 although it varies depending on the manufacturer 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.250
 the plate for protection of the chain 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:37.070
 as well as the plates for the assembly of 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.290
 the axes the same gears and shafts 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.829
 and the three different chains needed 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.829
 for assembly 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.969
 as well as the screws and nuts 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.969
 required 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.690
 Y 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.210
 first we will mount the plate of the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.489
 back of the engine for this is 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.170
 necessary to put them spacers that 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.360
 they come in the kit along with the washers 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.720
 to be able to make space between the motor and 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.720
 the plate 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.549
 now we install the plates for the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.630
 assembly that are attached to the tube 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.630
 bicycle seat 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.850
 now I look with the two clamps 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.950
 and we firmly tighten we should not 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.009
 forget to tighten all the screws 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.780
 that hold the motor to the frame now 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.090
 we will mount one of the plates for 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.530
 Engine mount for this part 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.930
 left of the engine we remove the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.740
 screws we put the plate and we go back to 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.740
 install the screws 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.390
 now we remove the screws from the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.330
 right part in motor cap 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.310
 clutch 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.500
 now we place the second plate 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.560
 Shaft assembly was from the part 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.410
 Rear of the car lid and subject 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.990
 with the other end nut now with 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.300
 very careful we place the shaft through 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.560
 of the 2 bearings and placing the 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.560
 gears in the counter order 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.530
 then let's know the keys that 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.060
 hold the gears to the shaft and we tighten 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.620
 with the allen screws that comes in the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.599
 kit making sure to line up 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.359
 correctly the gears with the 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.569
 chains since these should be as 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:31.549
 possible straight after we put each one 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.530
 of the three chains required with a 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.290
 adequate length and to finalize 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.079
 we install intense of the chain that goes 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.639
 from the engine to multiplication and we can 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.430
 see the whole system working 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:46.810
 properly you can now see the 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.810
 installation from all angles 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.940
 It is important to mention that he has 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.640
 with the motorcycle bike started now with the 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.130
 pedals only and not with inertia 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.460
 of the bike bike as it will be possible with a 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.650
 specific traditional I hope this video 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.470
 You have been very helpful remember 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.650
