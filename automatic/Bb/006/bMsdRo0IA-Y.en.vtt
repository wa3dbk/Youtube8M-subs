the<00:00:00.149> rail<00:00:00.810> authority<00:00:00.960> was<00:00:01.439> established<00:00:01.469> in

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
the rail authority was established in

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.900 
the rail authority was established in
1996<00:00:03.060> for<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.840> purpose<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.380> developing

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
system of high-speed rail service and it

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.209 
system of high-speed rail service and it
has<00:00:08.280> been<00:00:08.540> many<00:00:09.540> years<00:00:09.809> in<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.440> planning<00:00:10.650> to

has been many years in the planning to
develop<00:00:11.460> our<00:00:11.730> system<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.300> really<00:00:12.630> we<00:00:12.809> since

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
develop our system and really we since

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.530 
develop our system and really we since

this

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.930

sharing<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.300> rail<00:02:11.480> with<00:02:12.020> conventional

sharing the rail with conventional

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.880

passenger train service but also having

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.710

that dedicated track for the high-speed

service I think that's something we
certainly<00:02:19.819> need<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.209> look<00:02:20.360> at<00:02:20.540> in<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:21.110> mirror

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
certainly need to look at in a mirror

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:29.350 
certainly need to look at in a mirror
here<00:02:21.769> in<00:02:22.040> California
