00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
part they seem to just be variations on

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.420 
part they seem to just be variations on
a<00:00:24.449> theme<00:00:24.539> like<00:00:24.960> whoever<00:00:25.350> originally<00:00:25.680> invented

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
a theme like whoever originally invented

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.550 
a theme like whoever originally invented
it<00:00:26.580> didn't<00:00:27.150> patent<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.660> very<00:00:27.900> well<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.439> all

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
it didn't patent it very well and all

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.900 
it didn't patent it very well and all
these<00:00:28.740> companies<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.340> came<00:00:29.519> along<00:00:29.730> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
these companies just came along and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.440 
these companies just came along and
copied<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.599> when<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> first<00:00:31.650> saw<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.520> Tomcat

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
copied it so when I first saw the Tomcat

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.870 
copied it so when I first saw the Tomcat
live<00:00:33.930> catch<00:00:34.320> mousetrap<00:00:35.130> right<00:00:35.370> here<00:00:35.700> I

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
live catch mousetrap right here I

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.790 
live catch mousetrap right here I
figured<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:37.050> must<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.680> Tomcats<00:00:38.629> sleeker

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
figured it must just be Tomcats sleeker

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.369 
figured it must just be Tomcats sleeker
sexier<00:00:40.800> plastic<00:00:41.640> version<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.870> trap<00:00:43.170> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
sexier plastic version of this trap and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.380 
sexier plastic version of this trap and
that<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.219> appears<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.789> at<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> first

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
that is what it appears to be at a first

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.330 
that is what it appears to be at a first
glance<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:46.289> really<00:00:46.500> looks<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.890> lot<00:00:47.070> prettier

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
glance it really looks a lot prettier

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.830 
glance it really looks a lot prettier
like<00:00:47.640> something<00:00:48.030> you'd<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.510> know<00:00:48.629> rather

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
like something you'd you know rather

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.229 
like something you'd you know rather
have<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.500> living<00:00:49.710> room<00:00:49.890> than<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.700> metal

have in your living room than a metal

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.439 
have in your living room than a metal
box<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:51.989> basically<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.280> same<00:00:53.489> idea<00:00:53.550> when<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
box but basically the same idea when I

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.360 
box but basically the same idea when I
started<00:00:54.780> looking<00:00:55.170> deeper<00:00:55.829> than<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.160> lid

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
started looking deeper than the lid

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.209 
started looking deeper than the lid
though<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.940> found<00:00:57.360> out<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.899> differences<00:00:58.500> we're

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
though I found out the differences we're

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.790 
though I found out the differences we're
actually<00:00:59.430> more<00:01:00.239> than<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.539> skin<00:01:01.020> deep<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
actually more than just skin deep you

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.820 
actually more than just skin deep you
see<00:01:02.010> where<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.670> doors<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.420> tin<00:01:04.320> cat<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
see where the doors on the tin cat and

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.679 
see where the doors on the tin cat and
the<00:01:04.949> eating<00:01:05.339> are<00:01:05.519> more<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.150> baffle

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the eating are more of just a baffle

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.590 
the eating are more of just a baffle
system<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.500> things<00:01:07.860> are<00:01:08.159> more<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.820> ramps

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
system these things are more like ramps

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.800 
system these things are more like ramps
that<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.770> two<00:01:11.070> parts<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.760> close<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.299> behind

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that have two parts that close up behind

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.590 
that have two parts that close up behind
the<00:01:13.110> mouse<00:01:13.290> when<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.040> comes<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.520> why<00:01:15.360> does<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the mouse when it comes in why does that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.469 
the mouse when it comes in why does that
matter<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.200> ask<00:01:16.409> well<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.340> serious<00:01:18.000> complaint

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
matter you ask well a serious complaint

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.510 
matter you ask well a serious complaint
that<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:19.140> had<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.979> some<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.280> these<00:01:20.460> other

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
that I have had with some of these other

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.980 
that I have had with some of these other
traps<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:22.080> smaller<00:01:22.979> mice<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:24.390> walk<00:01:24.720> back

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
traps is that smaller mice can walk back

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.499 
traps is that smaller mice can walk back
out<00:01:25.229> after<00:01:25.680> they've<00:01:26.159> gone<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.880> looking<00:01:27.390> at

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
out after they've gone in so looking at

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.319 
out after they've gone in so looking at
this<00:01:27.630> trap<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.259> feel<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:28.829> Tomcat<00:01:29.430> may<00:01:29.970> have

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
this trap I feel like Tomcat may have

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.510 
this trap I feel like Tomcat may have
solved<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.960> problem<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.040> small<00:01:32.310> mice

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
solved that problem of the small mice

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.020 
solved that problem of the small mice
with<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.600> different<00:01:34.320> door<00:01:34.710> design<00:01:35.130> how<00:01:35.909> are

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
with this different door design how are

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.609 
with this different door design how are
we<00:01:36.119> gonna<00:01:36.210> find<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.659> out<00:01:36.840> though<00:01:37.049> well

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
we gonna find that out though well

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.020 
we gonna find that out though well
what's<00:01:37.979> something<00:01:38.220> that's<00:01:38.369> smaller<00:01:38.759> than<00:01:38.880> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
what's something that's smaller than a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.990 
what's something that's smaller than a

need<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.409> be<00:02:02.560> baited<00:02:02.979> because<00:02:03.369> you<00:02:03.520> place<00:02:03.759> them

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
need to be baited because you place them

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.179 
need to be baited because you place them
along<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.750> wall<00:02:05.110> which<00:02:05.530> is<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.920> mouse's

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
natural movement pattern they run right

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.109 
natural movement pattern they run right
in<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.319> door<00:02:08.530> but<00:02:09.039> just<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.729> make<00:02:09.880> absolutely

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119

morning and it looks like we got one we
have<00:02:32.110> just<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.590> little<00:02:32.890> mole<00:02:33.250> right<00:02:33.580> here<00:02:34.000> and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
have just a little mole right here and

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.850 
have just a little mole right here and
they're<00:02:34.299> usually<00:02:34.480> pretty<00:02:34.989> sluggish<00:02:35.380> once

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
they're usually pretty sluggish once

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.190

they<00:02:36.040> get<00:02:36.190> above<00:02:36.489> ground<00:02:36.760> they<00:02:37.150> are<00:02:37.180> made<00:02:37.959> for

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
they get above ground they are made for

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.780 
they get above ground they are made for
you<00:02:38.410> know<00:02:38.500> tunneling<00:02:38.950> slowly<00:02:39.220> underground

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
you know tunneling slowly underground

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.729 
you know tunneling slowly underground
not<00:02:39.940> scampering<00:02:40.360> around<00:02:40.480> like<00:02:40.780> mice<00:02:40.989> do<00:02:41.200> so

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
not scampering around like mice do so

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.080 
not scampering around like mice do so
he's<00:02:42.010> probably<00:02:42.190> feeling<00:02:42.549> a<00:02:42.730> little<00:02:42.940> lethargic

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
he's probably feeling a little lethargic

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.150 
he's probably feeling a little lethargic
right<00:02:43.660> now<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.810> don't<00:02:44.049> see<00:02:44.380> any<00:02:44.620> signs<00:02:44.980> of

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
right now I don't see any signs of

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.920 
right now I don't see any signs of
chewing<00:02:45.549> so<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.880> could<00:02:46.180> be<00:02:46.209> we<00:02:46.510> just<00:02:46.540> got<00:02:46.900> lucky

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
chewing so it could be we just got lucky

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.380 
chewing so it could be we just got lucky
and<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:47.590> guy<00:02:47.769> wasn't<00:02:48.190> into<00:02:48.459> doing<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.940> but

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
and this guy wasn't into doing that but

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.930 
and this guy wasn't into doing that but
overall<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:50.170> looks<00:02:50.290> like<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.980> trap<00:02:51.310> worked

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
overall it looks like the trap worked

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.020 
overall it looks like the trap worked
really<00:02:52.660> well<00:02:52.870> we<00:02:53.500> could<00:02:53.709> see<00:02:54.069> it<00:02:54.220> because<00:02:54.670> of

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
really well we could see it because of

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.589 
really well we could see it because of
the<00:02:55.450> clear<00:02:55.959> plastic<00:02:56.260> lid<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.459> mole<00:02:58.060> even

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
the clear plastic lid the mole even

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.150 
the clear plastic lid the mole even
though<00:02:58.690> he's<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> really<00:02:59.230> small<00:02:59.500> one<00:02:59.709> was<00:02:59.890> not

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
though he's a really small one was not

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.340 
though he's a really small one was not
able<00:03:00.519> to<00:03:00.760> escape<00:03:01.090> from<00:03:01.269> these<00:03:01.480> doors<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:01.959> really

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
able to escape from these doors I really

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.979 
able to escape from these doors I really
like<00:03:02.530> how<00:03:02.680> they<00:03:02.829> work<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:04.359> looks<00:03:04.690> pretty

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
like how they work and it looks pretty

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.220 
like how they work and it looks pretty
cool<00:03:05.230> too<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.459> Tomcat<00:03:07.030> live<00:03:07.420> catch<00:03:07.750> mouse

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
cool too so the Tomcat live catch mouse

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.620 
cool too so the Tomcat live catch mouse
trap<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:08.799> can<00:03:08.950> catch<00:03:09.220> more<00:03:09.940> than<00:03:10.150> one<00:03:10.390> Mouse

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630

trap that can catch more than one Mouse
it's<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.350> good<00:03:11.709> trap<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.310> like<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.940> if<00:03:13.090> you'd<00:03:13.600> be

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
it's a good trap I like it if you'd be
