dude<00:00:09.200> on<00:00:09.379> course<00:00:14.440> to<00:00:15.610> some<00:00:16.610> asshole

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.130 

so<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> thing<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:26.940> I<00:00:27.210> work<00:00:27.510> with<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:28.020> and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
so the thing that I work with here and

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.670 
so the thing that I work with here and
trying<00:00:28.440> to<00:00:28.529> find<00:00:28.860> the<00:00:29.010> same<00:00:29.310> height<00:00:30.380> pieces<00:00:31.380> as

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
trying to find the same height pieces as

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.630 
trying to find the same height pieces as
much<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.610> possible<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:34.980> probably<00:00:35.370> best

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
much as possible so it's probably best

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.549 
much as possible so it's probably best
if<00:00:35.970> we<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.239> start<00:00:36.629> with<00:00:36.870> those<00:00:36.989> ones<00:00:37.260> that

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
if we can start with those ones that

00:00:37.559 --> 00:01:11.600 
if we can start with those ones that
have<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> consistent<00:00:39.210> type<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.660> them
