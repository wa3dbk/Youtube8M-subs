00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.969
 So I think I have with it too 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.790
 Of course , thoughts always threatened 

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:13.740
 It is not necessarily the fascination 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.910
 it has other backgrounds to me 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.530
 retracted 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.900
 if they introduce themselves as me 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.000
 I started for art 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 I wanted to become an artist 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.270
 I of course tried somewhere in the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.730
 my dad's library to find something 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.330
 the teacher on 1 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.300
 and I think so or so 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.800
 been that calendar pictures at least 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.100
 from edward mother were on the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.970
 I had a desk later 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.829
 experience or project the dark one 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.450
 artist was with those the Nazis 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.480
 have tried to get in contact 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.760
 He was very popular and you can feel free 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.620
 that's quite possible because this honor 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.829
 a way of making pictures 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.290
 this strange realism would have that 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 can now fold around outdated simply 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.059
 Do not open the door and all 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.100
 other than heroes for me in question 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.119
 I do not know who I'm coming from 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.040
 can not kirchner you 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.380
 I can not kandinsky I can there 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.880
 not ticks lie the names never heard 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.640
 because they were all gone the tub 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.670
 responds that are burned to emigrate 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.680
 The with is did not exist and think so 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.830
 I was the only one ever 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.229
 there was a presumed species too 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.590
 to draw 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.479
 where you do not recognize as necessarily as 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.760
 psychiatrist but also loan recognizes 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.650
 something is not right 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.960
 And now this kind of art has that 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.070
 double triple culture for example 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.790
 and that fascinated me and me 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:51.000
 and now perhaps it has brought about 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.040
 this condition is not quite 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.780
 science that can be me 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.460
 biographically I'm not so much into it 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.040
 I am interested in what has driven me 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.720
 only ever looked at these pictures 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.100
 thematically because it was clear anyway 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.969
 the time before the invention of the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.489
 penicillins penicillins where to get 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.530
 health problems had all because of the 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.340
 has to do with sexuality 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.160
 the compact was quite wide before that 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.280
 rather the unpleasant side but the one out 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.050
 the resulting existential 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.030
 style 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.370
 that just struck me so I had 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.680
 never to do with impressionism too 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.340
 could not have been exceeded 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.340
 I was never interested
