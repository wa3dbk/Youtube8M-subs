00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.870
 well how about grass to see the video now I'm going to show you how to install 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.110
 windows 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.919
 few meters from the others nor left the road that downloads 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:15.079
 the program that we are going to need is good 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.130
 in case you do not what in the month of July 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.499
 link in the description of the video 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.760
 I'm going to do it the way it has to be done 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.640
 in that case we give 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.249
 right button 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.179
 to open with 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.110
 there are those who say other programs 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.110
 in case it does not appear here good ratio of the ate examine 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.740
 again will come 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.740
 and the selected ones 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.900
 to accept 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.810
 percent will send them to the page for a while 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.810
 here is one that claims to be top stress point 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.470
 percent were double click 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.470
 while mentioning decompress 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.960
 if it is discounted it will take a long time for me to decompress 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.430
 the star for you to see how it is done 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.430
 for reasons of time in the video 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.630
 since this happened 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.970
 this file will disappear 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.230
 where they installed less 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.330
 that's the same as if they had burned in a duty 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
 so if we can give it vitality now 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.670
 his files were going to appear 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.250
 in that case I'm going to 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.680
 get out of here because I'm going to show you start moving 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.920
 from the zero 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.950
 this happens because I already had my machine 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.680
 count xp 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.020
 I do not wanna lose it 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.020
 what different 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.900
 if we can see how he's going to start stories 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.480
 this is how one hundred percent of the menus that appear here 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.199
 above these means are of the program that I use to be able to run windows 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.199
 we see in a virtual way 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.049
 we can see that I am saying the installation 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.759
 It will not be easy then 20 to 30 minutes 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:51.899
 since we are in this month we will not injure windows 7 professional because 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.289
 remember that since they were born 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:58.639
 if you choose windows 7 that I estimate whose name I will take charge in the law 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.259
 what happens to them why be coherent helmsman of a serial of windows 7 a 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.259
 tinelli functions of windows 7 professional 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:12.219
 very good in this case they are going to copy windows files 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.709
 I repeat for reasons of time I will have to accelerate the video 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.879
 in that case I'm going to let it settle
