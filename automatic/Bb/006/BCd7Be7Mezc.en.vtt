it for a long time because I want the

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.759 
it for a long time because I want the
curls<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.510> be<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.540> little<00:03:12.019> tighter<00:03:12.319> than<00:03:12.620> they

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
curls to be a little tighter than they

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.420 
curls to be a little tighter than they
were<00:03:12.829> before

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.780 

that's<00:03:19.430> better

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
that's better

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.780 
that's better
yep<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.750> like<00:03:20.870> that<00:03:21.200> so<00:03:21.800> yeah

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
yep I like that so yeah

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.280 
yep I like that so yeah
repeat<00:03:23.390> step<00:03:23.750> all<00:03:24.410> over<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.580> hand<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.110> you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
repeat step all over the hand and so you

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:40.990 
repeat step all over the hand and so you
got<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.470> handful<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:27.980> curlgirl<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:40.070> just<00:03:40.820> as<00:03:40.970> a

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
got a handful of curlgirl and just as a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.200 
got a handful of curlgirl and just as a
reminder<00:03:41.210> I<00:03:41.750> am<00:03:42.440> switching<00:03:42.950> from<00:03:43.430> inside<00:03:43.970> to

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
reminder I am switching from inside to

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.240 
reminder I am switching from inside to
outside<00:03:44.390> because<00:03:44.900> I<00:03:45.050> like<00:03:45.440> a<00:03:45.650> little<00:03:45.920> bit<00:03:46.040> more

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
outside because I like a little bit more

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.850 
outside because I like a little bit more
volume<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:47.390> what<00:03:47.930> happens<00:03:48.260> is<00:03:48.350> when<00:03:48.470> you<00:03:48.530> curl

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
volume and what happens is when you curl

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.140 
volume and what happens is when you curl
them<00:03:48.920> on<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.190> same<00:03:49.400> direction<00:03:49.670> they<00:03:50.000> all

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
them on the same direction they all

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.880 
them on the same direction they all
start<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.450> like<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:50.900> know<00:03:50.990> how<00:03:51.140> when<00:03:51.320> that<00:03:51.530> one

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
start to like you know how when that one

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.160 
start to like you know how when that one
when<00:03:52.490> almost<00:03:52.910> 50<00:03:53.270> different<00:03:53.390> curls<00:03:53.720> turn<00:03:53.930> into

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
when almost 50 different curls turn into

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.150 
when almost 50 different curls turn into
one<00:03:54.380> big<00:03:54.410> curl

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
one big curl

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160 
one big curl
yeah<00:03:55.970> that's<00:03:56.210> annoying<00:03:56.450> when<00:03:56.720> they<00:03:56.810> all<00:03:56.960> mold

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170
