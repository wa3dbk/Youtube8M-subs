joy elegant the only thing I would say I

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.840 
joy elegant the only thing I would say I
wish<00:06:05.440> it<00:06:05.620> had<00:06:05.800> was<00:06:06.010> a<00:06:06.040> little<00:06:06.400> bit<00:06:06.580> more

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
wish it had was a little bit more

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.180

tweezers instead of 36 tweezers I wish
it<00:06:09.340> had<00:06:09.520> something<00:06:09.820> like<00:06:10.210> you<00:06:10.780> know<00:06:10.900> maybe<00:06:11.140> 56

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860

it had something like you know maybe 56
or<00:06:12.130> something<00:06:12.580> just<00:06:13.270> so<00:06:13.540> that<00:06:13.900> it<00:06:14.170> would<00:06:14.290> be

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
or something just so that it would be

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.130 
or something just so that it would be
faster<00:06:14.950> but<00:06:15.520> you<00:06:15.730> know<00:06:15.880> once<00:06:16.240> you<00:06:16.450> remove<00:06:16.870> the

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
faster but you know once you remove the

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.470 
faster but you know once you remove the
hair<00:06:17.500> um<00:06:18.270> the<00:06:19.270> first<00:06:19.480> time<00:06:20.640> yeah<00:06:21.640> it's<00:06:22.090> it's
