00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.919
 Maracas today would like to show you 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.230
 the battle on p110 e4 where I took the master already 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.590
 long ago this rubric was not there 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.560
 finally on this birdie managed to take 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.189
 the masters will not say that it was difficult I 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.230
 even he did not expect that I will get well in this 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.230
 bout master because bout is pretty 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.599
 simple easy fast 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.019
 don't say that i'm right here a lot 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.830
 I made even more damage 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.600
 simply 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.910
 on someone else's light here t-62 in general to 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.250
 success goes 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.370
 already played the boy and you need to do 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.200
 if you want to dream at the beginning of the battle without 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.480
 Damage well, I'm going forward there 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.640
 such position 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.100
 let's say so standard on which i 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.989
 often began to ride on such heavy 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.449
 type t110 e4 and other machines 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.330
 because the position is generally good but 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.220
 here I am directly teaching what is already here 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.729
 someone waiting for some kind of brace 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.740
 for sure stands who have the church therefore 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.360
 I'm trying to do something like a board 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.390
 neatly here i am a candle it is 268 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.720
 I charged very nehilo 900 but I 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.700
 Fortunately, he also repulsed, but then I 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.909
 already I don't want to leave any more 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.310
 realizing that now he will drive up again and 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.780
 most likely will not give me light 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.189
 splat and I can and not get on it and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.170
 In general, now there will be a long wait and 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.649
 while I'm waiting here in battle 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.240
 I'll tell you about this rubbish 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.720
 love it now 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.470
 damage on it is growing rapidly often 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.939
 happens on 6 thousand damages on 7 the matter is 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.280
 what is it by 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.740
 it fits very well for the players 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.770
 who in general cannot play at all 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.800
 on for so that there are players who are used to 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.670
 There stretch play but on pt not 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.130
 skill rather low t110 e4 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.070
 very well suited for such players 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.940
 because there is a tower that turns 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:25.170
 hotel is limited but still it is very 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.960
 convenient and helps to damage 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.650
 especially in urban conditions 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.320
 from behind the corners from everyones pass it on 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.960
 general then 110 and get 4 is obtained 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.490
 very good here only I wanted 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.780
 move off but drives up to 4502 bk 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.970
 stock and object 704 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.030
 of course I would not mind sneaking 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.510
 shoot now but first of all I'm afraid and 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.080
 704 secondly there are 268 more likely 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.600
 worth it but just now I'm on the minimap 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.010
 I see that 268 went to another place and 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.000
 Now, in principle, neatly I can 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.160
 leave give home besides 704 was distracted 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.900
 make an instant shock and roll away 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.850
 backwards 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.959
 slippers very well he got at all 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.050
 punch easily and in general to me he 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.320
 like as e100 and mouse machine 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.750
 excellent for them it is good not to damage 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.110
 miss in general here of course 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.820
 I wanted to give the 700th fourth but 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.800
 did not get the slippers but again got 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:43.489
 roll back to 7 from 704 not 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:47.940
 get here 704 gets 30 deuce and 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:50.330
 until the suspender recharge I have to 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.950
 Now pick up but I Th here with slowly 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.290
 saw the mouth thought about pick well 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.890
 do you understand that if I now 704 they 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.630
 will take away 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.310
 and then he won't give a shock lucky that 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.800
 268 gets into the caterpillar I still have 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.069
 a little time to shoot it 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.720
 first and pick it up most likely 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:15.690
 but of course he has a very recharge 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:22.030
 fast but shooting first here and great 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:26.050
 there is e100 t30 lucky that orton for me 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.330
 I would not get here E100 I would say that to me 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.440
 like to see what he has 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.970
 huge cheeks 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:38.580
 where just a sin to miss in general in 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.650
 In general, it gets there without problems 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:46.470
 as you can see the fight is pretty easy 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.470
 but no less than this master I will receive 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.640
 again i'm on the cheek 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:57.490
 I'm going to the hundredth and send him to the hangar 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:04.030
 Well, after that it's almost the end of a crash 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:07.720
 food catch up t30 and since I have a tower 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:11.110
 turns me very comfortable it here 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.290
 take well, in general, I hope everything 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.560
 You fight was something interesting that was 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.410
 heading master put huskies
