know gets a little warm um and it gets a
little<00:01:07.740> firm<00:01:08.070> after<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.630> 3040<00:01:10.320> miles<00:01:10.500> on

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
little firm after you know 3040 miles on

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.010 
little firm after you know 3040 miles on
the<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> highway<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.750> these<00:01:12.750> leather

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the on the highway so these leather

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.289 
the on the highway so these leather
seats<00:01:13.380> are<00:01:13.560> actually<00:01:13.890> kind<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.159> nice<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.729> I

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
could see that being a plus there but

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.499 
could see that being a plus there but
another<00:01:20.220> thing<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.729> guess<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.240> see

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
another thing I guess you can see

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.120
