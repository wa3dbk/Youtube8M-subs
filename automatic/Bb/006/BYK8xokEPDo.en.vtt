 it is necessary to remove the seeds from the mature fruits 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:36.340
 the annatto

 is used as a dye in the food industry 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.829
 of cosmetics and medicines and I also turned to nations for games 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.650
 we will show how to make handmade dye group 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.160
 we will introduce two different technologies 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.450
 and are used by producers in the western region of mines 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.540
 the manufacturer of homemade products maria paula daughter

 who will do the demonstrations 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:07.519
 one of the natal recipes 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.349
 five hundred grams of annatto seeds 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.139
 the pound of fine corn 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.139
 and 200 thousand liters of oil 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.120
 you first have to select the seeds 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.769
 remove and those that are damaged 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.379
 meadow 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:29.529
 now put the oil in a pan 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:34.779
 add the seeds and let simmer fry until the dem and the net pp 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.159
 in another pot the cubatÃ£o river 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.199
 this year at the same time the seeds with 11 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.449
 planning cornmeal without stopping until roasted 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:54.199
 so get it out of the fire 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.770
 when the seed is released well the ink inspects the roast forrÃ³ me 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.770
 I call enough to make it very homogeneous 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.269
 now the mix of cornmeal and the procon offer pounded in the pestle 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:12.039
 we 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.039
 Chick 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.620
 you should only stamped violent turn to remove the dye from the seeds without 

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:22.020
 break it 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.380
 can be used by small ones with only rubbed seeds with corn 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:29.009
 a wooden spoon 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.949
 the maize will pick up the vulture ink when the seeds become black and 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.949
 so the red color is time to stop 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:44.999
 now the dye must be accelerated to separate the corn from the seed 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.629
 ready 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:50.800
 the dye is ready
