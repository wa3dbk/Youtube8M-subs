metal but the chassis that they're
mounted<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:48.000> plastic<00:00:48.980> this<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> near

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
mounted on is plastic this is a near

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.260 
mounted on is plastic this is a near
scale<00:00:51.149> model<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.989> 0a0<00:00:52.559> switcher<00:00:53.489> which

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
scale model of the 0a0 switcher which

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.209 
scale model of the 0a0 switcher which
was<00:00:54.480> good<00:00:54.690> because<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> tie<00:00:55.620> tractive

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
was good because of the tie tractive

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.790 
was good because of the tie tractive
effort<00:00:56.510> because<00:00:57.510> all<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.989> weight<00:00:58.199> was<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
effort because all the weight was on the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.569 
effort because all the weight was on the
eight<00:00:58.980> drive<00:00:59.340> wheels<00:00:59.609> there<00:00:59.940> are<00:01:00.059> no<00:01:00.300> front<00:01:01.140> or

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
eight drive wheels there are no front or

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.080 
eight drive wheels there are no front or
trailing<00:01:02.579> trucks<00:01:03.180> wheels<00:01:03.979> and<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.519> model<00:01:05.939> is

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
trailing trucks wheels and this model is

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.630 
trailing trucks wheels and this model is
pretty<00:01:06.270> much<00:01:06.510> limited<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.140> being<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.860> switcher

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
pretty much limited to being a switcher

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.149 
pretty much limited to being a switcher
as<00:01:08.820> well<00:01:09.030> because<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:10.020> has<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> very<00:01:10.740> small

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
as well because it has a very small

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.910 
as well because it has a very small
flywheel<00:01:11.850> equipped<00:01:12.299> motor<00:01:12.689> you're<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:13.710> going

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
flywheel equipped motor you're not going

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.820 
flywheel equipped motor you're not going
to<00:01:14.010> get<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.159> lot<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.520> torque<00:01:14.820> from<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.360> engine

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
to get a lot of torque from this engine

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.999 
to get a lot of torque from this engine
but<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.909> be<00:01:18.090> used<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> switcher<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.830> only

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
but it can be used as a switcher it only

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.910 
but it can be used as a switcher it only
has<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.280> traction<00:01:21.119> entire<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.650> can't

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
has one traction entire so you can't

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.620 
has one traction entire so you can't
start<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.580> huge<00:01:24.420> turn<00:01:24.840> maybe<00:01:25.259> ten<00:01:26.009> cars<00:01:26.630> fifteen

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
start a huge turn maybe ten cars fifteen

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.149 
start a huge turn maybe ten cars fifteen
cars<00:01:27.869> max<00:01:28.520> but<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.689> has<00:01:31.200> de<00:01:31.500> traction

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
cars max but like it has de traction

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.140 
cars max but like it has de traction
because<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.909> weight<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.810> drivers

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
because all the weight is on the drivers

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.359 
because all the weight is on the drivers
you<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.540> headlight<00:01:37.470> here<00:01:37.890> working

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
you have a headlight here working
