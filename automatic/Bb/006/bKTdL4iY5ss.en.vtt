of a hundred dollars with an interest

of a hundred dollars with an interest
rate<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.690> five<00:00:45.899> percent<00:00:46.410> would<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.920> equivalent

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
rate of five percent would be equivalent

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.319 
rate of five percent would be equivalent
to<00:00:48.320> 105<00:00:49.320> dollars<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.489> year<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
to 105 dollars in one year if the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.790 
to 105 dollars in one year if the
interest<00:00:51.539> rate<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.899> five<00:00:52.079> percent<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.620> one

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
interest rate was five percent for one

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.040 
interest rate was five percent for one
year<00:00:53.010> would<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.250> 100<00:00:53.910> times<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.510> plus<00:00:54.539> five

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
year would be 100 times one plus five

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.049 
year would be 100 times one plus five
percent<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:56.190> brackets<00:00:56.879> which<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.960> 1.05<00:00:59.059> equals

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
percent in brackets which is 1.05 equals

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.349 
percent in brackets which is 1.05 equals
105<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.859> other<00:01:01.980> words<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:03.149> would

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
105 so in other words we would

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.939 
105 so in other words we would
theoretically<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:04.229> indifferent<00:01:04.589> between

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
theoretically be indifferent between

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.969 
theoretically be indifferent between
having<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.519> hundred<00:01:05.850> dollars<00:01:06.210> today<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.979> 105

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
having a hundred dollars today and 105

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.280 
having a hundred dollars today and 105
dollars<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.909> year<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.720> prevailing

dollars in one year if the prevailing
interest<00:01:10.409> rate<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.310> year<00:01:11.520> period

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
interest rate for that one year period

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.490 
interest rate for that one year period
were<00:01:12.689> five<00:01:12.990> percent<00:01:13.530> now<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:15.600> obviously<00:01:16.259> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
were five percent now that obviously is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.530 
were five percent now that obviously is
very<00:01:16.590> linked<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> concept<00:01:18.420> of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
very linked to the concept of

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.740 
very linked to the concept of
compounding<00:01:19.320> where<00:01:19.790> we're<00:01:20.790> taking<00:01:21.060> sums<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
compounding where we're taking sums of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.350 
compounding where we're taking sums of
money<00:01:21.780> or<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> sum<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> money<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.700> figuring<00:01:24.360> out

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
money or a sum of money and figuring out

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.030 
money or a sum of money and figuring out
what<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> sum<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.259> money<00:01:25.439> could<00:01:25.710> grow<00:01:25.979> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
what that sum of money could grow to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.130 
what that sum of money could grow to
over<00:01:26.280> time<00:01:26.820> with<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> certain<00:01:27.570> interest<00:01:27.840> rate

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
over time with a certain interest rate

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
over time with a certain interest rate
so<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> hundred<00:01:29.340> dollars<00:01:29.670> at<00:01:29.850> five<00:01:30.030> percent

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
so a hundred dollars at five percent

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.410 
so a hundred dollars at five percent
cleared<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.840> becomes<00:01:31.140> 105<00:01:31.950> after<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> year<00:01:32.610> if

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
cleared it becomes 105 after a year if

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.030 
cleared it becomes 105 after a year if
we<00:01:33.540> add<00:01:33.689> another<00:01:33.960> hundred<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.770> through

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
we add another hundred to it through

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.200 
we add another hundred to it through
savings<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> becomes<00:01:36.000> 205<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.790> after<00:01:38.790> after

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
savings it becomes 205 and after after

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.929 
savings it becomes 205 and after after
another<00:01:39.450> year<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> 205<00:01:40.920> would<00:01:41.549> become

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
another year then the 205 would become

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.270 
another year then the 205 would become
205<00:01:42.930> x<00:01:43.320> 1.0<00:01:43.920> 5<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.189> so

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
205 x 1.0 5 and so on and so on and so

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.670 
205 x 1.0 5 and so on and so on and so
on<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.030> sums<00:01:48.270> would<00:01:48.570> grow<00:01:48.869> pipe<00:01:49.409> by

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
on and the sums would grow pipe by

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.679 
on and the sums would grow pipe by
compounding<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> time<00:01:51.119> value<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.600> money

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
compounding and the time value of money

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.859 
compounding and the time value of money
is<00:01:52.200> what<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.860> use<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.189> express<00:01:53.970> those<00:01:54.329> present

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
