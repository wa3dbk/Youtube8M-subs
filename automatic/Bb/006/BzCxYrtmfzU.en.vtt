00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:08.050 

so<00:00:02.449> then<00:00:03.020> as<00:00:03.830> I<00:00:04.520> got<00:00:05.419> my<00:00:05.830> value<00:00:06.830> here<00:00:07.310> a<00:00:07.490> little

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.060 
so then as I got my value here a little

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.580 
so then as I got my value here a little
bit<00:00:08.330> more<00:00:09.220> established<00:00:10.220> I<00:00:10.960> then<00:00:11.960> saw<00:00:12.560> that

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
bit more established I then saw that

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.970 
bit more established I then saw that
this<00:00:13.040> was<00:00:13.750> starting<00:00:14.750> to<00:00:14.810> flatten<00:00:15.020> out<00:00:15.230> this<00:00:15.800> is

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
this was starting to flatten out this is

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.640 
this was starting to flatten out this is
still<00:00:16.160> a<00:00:16.219> round<00:00:16.550> cylindrical<00:00:17.480> neck<00:00:17.660> and<00:00:17.929> so

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
still a round cylindrical neck and so

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.470 
still a round cylindrical neck and so
even<00:00:19.339> though<00:00:19.429> I<00:00:19.460> don't<00:00:19.609> want<00:00:19.849> to<00:00:19.910> do<00:00:19.999> too<00:00:20.210> much

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
even though I don't want to do too much

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.409 
even though I don't want to do too much
I<00:00:20.810> still<00:00:21.410> want<00:00:21.829> to<00:00:21.949> have<00:00:22.279> that<00:00:22.339> mentality<00:00:22.970> that

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
I still want to have that mentality that

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.979 
I still want to have that mentality that
now<00:00:24.140> that<00:00:24.409> I<00:00:24.439> have<00:00:24.710> this<00:00:24.949> clean<00:00:25.460> edge<00:00:25.699> I<00:00:26.060> should

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:26.989 
now that I have this clean edge I should

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.009 
now that I have this clean edge I should
be<00:00:27.140> able<00:00:27.289> to<00:00:27.560> play<00:00:27.890> off<00:00:28.220> of<00:00:28.249> that<00:00:28.720> not<00:00:29.720> have

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
be able to play off of that not have

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.870 
be able to play off of that not have
that<00:00:30.199> edge<00:00:30.380> go<00:00:30.619> away<00:00:30.859> I'm<00:00:31.130> not<00:00:31.310> trying<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:31.699> go

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
that edge go away I'm not trying to go

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.520 
that edge go away I'm not trying to go
ahead<00:00:32.119> and<00:00:32.300> make<00:00:32.450> this<00:00:32.630> dark<00:00:32.930> enough<00:00:33.199> that<00:00:33.410> it

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
ahead and make this dark enough that it

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.020 
ahead and make this dark enough that it
just<00:00:34.329> ends<00:00:35.329> up<00:00:35.480> by<00:00:36.190> blending<00:00:37.190> in<00:00:37.340> with<00:00:37.489> this<00:00:37.789> I

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
just ends up by blending in with this I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.080 
just ends up by blending in with this I
want<00:00:38.239> to<00:00:38.329> watch<00:00:38.600> that<00:00:38.989> carefully<00:00:39.430> but<00:00:40.430> this<00:00:40.789> is

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
want to watch that carefully but this is

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.970 
want to watch that carefully but this is
indeed<00:00:41.719> going<00:00:42.079> to<00:00:42.170> help<00:00:42.469> me<00:00:42.649> have<00:00:43.250> the<00:00:43.789> round

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
indeed going to help me have the round

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.439 
indeed going to help me have the round
aspect<00:00:45.980> to<00:00:46.129> this<00:00:46.250> neck<00:00:46.519> the<00:00:46.820> cylindrical

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
aspect to this neck the cylindrical

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.709 
aspect to this neck the cylindrical
quality<00:00:48.019> and<00:00:48.399> somewhere<00:00:49.399> you<00:00:50.059> know<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:50.539> looks

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
quality and somewhere you know it looks

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.619 
quality and somewhere you know it looks
like<00:00:50.809> maybe<00:00:51.469> in<00:00:51.739> here<00:00:52.190> it's<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.940> little<00:00:53.149> darker

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
like maybe in here it's a little darker

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.840 
like maybe in here it's a little darker
that's<00:00:54.019> gonna<00:00:54.260> happen<00:00:54.679> with<00:00:54.829> larren<00:00:55.219> axes<00:00:55.609> and

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
that's gonna happen with larren axes and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.639 
that's gonna happen with larren axes and
muscles<00:00:56.269> and<00:00:56.600> all<00:00:56.750> those<00:00:56.960> kinds<00:00:57.320> of<00:00:57.379> things

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
muscles and all those kinds of things

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.700 
muscles and all those kinds of things
and<00:00:58.239> maybe<00:00:59.239> this<00:00:59.539> is<00:00:59.749> some<00:01:00.289> of<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:00.469> lighter

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
and maybe this is some of the lighter

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.570 
and maybe this is some of the lighter
area<00:01:01.190> in<00:01:01.280> here<00:01:01.609> but<00:01:02.499> in<00:01:03.499> here<00:01:03.980> it<00:01:04.220> totally

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
area in here but in here it totally

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.740 
area in here but in here it totally
disappears<00:01:05.320> in<00:01:06.640> here<00:01:07.640> we<00:01:08.180> might<00:01:08.390> be<00:01:08.450> able<00:01:08.689> to

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
disappears in here we might be able to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.120 
disappears in here we might be able to
see<00:01:08.960> a<00:01:08.990> little<00:01:09.140> bit<00:01:09.290> more<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.590> an<00:01:09.710> indication

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
see a little bit more of an indication

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.640 
see a little bit more of an indication
here<00:01:10.579> but<00:01:11.270> still<00:01:11.600> we<00:01:11.780> want<00:01:11.960> just<00:01:12.229> ever<00:01:12.409> so

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
here but still we want just ever so

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.620 
here but still we want just ever so
slightly<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:13.340> suggestion<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.180> that's<00:01:14.420> all

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
slightly the suggestion and that's all

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.899 
slightly the suggestion and that's all
our<00:01:14.780> minds<00:01:15.020> need<00:01:15.320> sometimes<00:01:15.950> is<00:01:16.220> just<00:01:16.520> a

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
our minds need sometimes is just a

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.530 
our minds need sometimes is just a
suggestion<00:01:17.570> that<00:01:18.560> this<00:01:18.740> isn't<00:01:19.100> flat<00:01:19.540> it's

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
suggestion that this isn't flat it's

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.719 
suggestion that this isn't flat it's
actually<00:01:21.079> going<00:01:21.259> around<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.220> out<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.549> our

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
actually going around and out of our

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.170 
actually going around and out of our
sight<00:01:23.920> bending<00:01:24.920> around<00:01:25.159> just<00:01:25.759> like<00:01:25.939> the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
sight bending around just like the

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.569 
sight bending around just like the
sphere<00:01:26.570> would<00:01:26.840> accept<00:01:27.799> that<00:01:27.860> we<00:01:28.009> have<00:01:28.220> a<00:01:28.250> dark

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
sphere would accept that we have a dark

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.109 
sphere would accept that we have a dark
background<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:29.299> it

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
background to it

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.530 
background to it
well<00:01:32.119> not<00:01:32.719> the<00:01:32.930> two<00:01:33.200> light<00:01:33.799> source<00:01:34.100> sphere<00:01:34.880> if

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
well not the two light source sphere if

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.450 
well not the two light source sphere if
you're<00:01:35.750> working<00:01:36.350> with<00:01:36.469> a<00:01:36.590> round<00:01:36.829> object<00:01:37.070> we'd

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
you're working with a round object we'd

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.530 
you're working with a round object we'd
still<00:01:37.729> want<00:01:37.939> to<00:01:38.079> bend<00:01:39.079> this<00:01:39.320> around<00:01:40.540> and

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
still want to bend this around and

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.969 
still want to bend this around and
because<00:01:41.899> it's<00:01:42.079> going<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.350> where<00:01:42.560> there's<00:01:42.770> less

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
because it's going to where there's less

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.859 
because it's going to where there's less
light<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:43.759> wouldn't<00:01:44.119> have<00:01:44.270> a<00:01:44.299> reflective

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
light it wouldn't have a reflective

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.520 
light it wouldn't have a reflective
light<00:01:45.049> on<00:01:45.259> it<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:47.920> I<00:01:48.920> just<00:01:49.130> want<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.520> think<00:01:49.759> it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
light on it and I just want to think it

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.310 
light on it and I just want to think it
thinking<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.799> is<00:01:52.579> often<00:01:53.149> enough<00:01:53.539> even<00:01:54.170> though

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
thinking it is often enough even though

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.249 
thinking it is often enough even though
you<00:01:54.380> don't<00:01:54.649> think<00:01:54.890> you're<00:01:55.039> doing<00:01:55.369> too<00:01:55.670> much

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
you don't think you're doing too much

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.859 
you don't think you're doing too much
thinking<00:01:57.259> it<00:01:57.680> is<00:01:57.939> sometimes<00:01:58.939> going<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.750> add

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
thinking it is sometimes going to add

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.740 
thinking it is sometimes going to add
that<00:02:00.170> subtle<00:02:00.979> suggestion<00:02:01.670> that's<00:02:02.329> going<00:02:02.630> to

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
that subtle suggestion that's going to

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.270 
that subtle suggestion that's going to
make<00:02:02.990> your<00:02:03.740> drawing<00:02:04.960> dynamic<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.280> actually

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
make your drawing dynamic and actually

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.219 
make your drawing dynamic and actually
communicate<00:02:07.820> what<00:02:07.969> you're<00:02:08.119> trying<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.479> do<00:02:08.630> at

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
communicate what you're trying to do at

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.869 
communicate what you're trying to do at
least<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.739> get<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.039> going<00:02:10.190> in<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.459> right<00:02:10.550> way

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
least to get you going in the right way

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.479 
least to get you going in the right way
so<00:02:10.910> that<00:02:11.420> when<00:02:11.510> you're<00:02:11.690> thinking<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:13.250> can

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
so that when you're thinking it you can

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.050 
so that when you're thinking it you can
be<00:02:13.700> a

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
be a

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.970 
be a

we're what you're trying to accomplish -

we're what you're trying to accomplish -
and<00:02:16.610> you'll<00:02:16.970> realize<00:02:17.270> all<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:17.900> need<00:02:18.349> a<00:02:18.380> little

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
and you'll realize all I need a little

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.220 
and you'll realize all I need a little
bit<00:02:18.770> more<00:02:19.010> oh<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.430> need<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:19.940> little<00:02:20.239> bit<00:02:20.360> more<00:02:20.599> or

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
bit more oh I need a little bit more or

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.660

this<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.950> going<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.280> have<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.489> be<00:02:22.580> adjusted

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
this is going to have to be adjusted

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.610 
this is going to have to be adjusted
because<00:02:23.300> this<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.840> what<00:02:24.020> I'm<00:02:24.140> trying<00:02:24.349> to

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
because this is what I'm trying to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.040 
because this is what I'm trying to
accomplish<00:02:24.890> I'm<00:02:25.610> thinking<00:02:26.209> it<00:02:26.390> I'm<00:02:26.840> gonna

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
accomplish I'm thinking it I'm gonna

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.809 
accomplish I'm thinking it I'm gonna
keep<00:02:27.290> moving<00:02:27.560> towards<00:02:28.130> that<00:02:28.220> goal

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
keep moving towards that goal

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.330 
keep moving towards that goal
so<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:31.550> isn't<00:02:31.700> gonna<00:02:31.910> happen<00:02:32.120> self<00:02:33.340> anything

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
so it isn't gonna happen self anything

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.759 
so it isn't gonna happen self anything
on<00:02:34.519> this<00:02:34.700> drawing<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.330> may<00:02:35.900> have<00:02:36.019> realized<00:02:36.410> is

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
on this drawing you may have realized is

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.620 
on this drawing you may have realized is
not<00:02:37.160> going<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.269> accomplish<00:02:38.540> itself<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:41.180> if

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
not going to accomplish itself and so if

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.820 
not going to accomplish itself and so if
you're<00:02:41.900> not<00:02:42.019> willing<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.319> put<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.709> effort

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
you're not willing to put in the effort

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.890 
you're not willing to put in the effort
you're<00:02:43.310> going<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.670> have<00:02:43.849> to<00:02:44.030> be<00:02:44.150> satisfied

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
you're going to have to be satisfied

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.330 
you're going to have to be satisfied
with<00:02:44.959> something<00:02:45.380> that's<00:02:45.739> going<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.010> be<00:02:46.130> more

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
with something that's going to be more

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.360 
with something that's going to be more
suggestive<00:02:47.030> or<00:02:47.410> hopefully<00:02:48.410> still

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
suggestive or hopefully still

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.610 
suggestive or hopefully still
communicate<00:02:49.970> well<00:02:50.900> enough<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.410> its

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
communicate well enough in its

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.800 
communicate well enough in its
simplicity<00:02:51.799> but<00:02:54.819> a<00:02:55.819> drawing<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.360> never<00:02:56.600> gonna

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
simplicity but a drawing is never gonna

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.740 
simplicity but a drawing is never gonna

to put its own clean edges on it's not

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.580 
to put its own clean edges on it's not

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
gonna go ahead and increase the value to

set this neck back behind you no further

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.259 
set this neck back behind you no further
back<00:03:06.530> from<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.890> face<00:03:07.190> it's<00:03:07.849> just<00:03:08.000> not<00:03:08.150> going

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
back from the face it's just not going

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.830 
back from the face it's just not going
to<00:03:08.360> do<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:08.540> itself<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:10.450> know<00:03:11.450> that's<00:03:11.720> an

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
to do it itself and I know that's an

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.320 
to do it itself and I know that's an
absurd<00:03:12.190> comment<00:03:13.190> maybe<00:03:13.340> because<00:03:14.030> I'm<00:03:14.150> just

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
absurd comment maybe because I'm just

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.789 
absurd comment maybe because I'm just
trying<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.690> think<00:03:15.310> logically<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.810> am<00:03:17.810> going<00:03:18.470> to

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
trying to think logically I am going to

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.090 
trying to think logically I am going to
be<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.100> one<00:03:19.310> doing<00:03:19.850> it
