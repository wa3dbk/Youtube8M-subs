00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
kerfing our strips that essentially

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.869 
kerfing our strips that essentially
provide<00:00:45.300> some<00:00:45.570> glue<00:00:45.899> surface<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.489> back

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and the top to be glued together this is

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.350 
and the top to be glued together this is
a<00:00:54.570> strip<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.710> kerfing<00:00:55.969> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.239> it's

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
a strip of the kerfing you can see it's

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.860 
a strip of the kerfing you can see it's
just<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.930> thin<00:00:58.890> strip<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.280> mahogany<00:00:59.789> with<00:00:59.969> lots

just a thin strip of mahogany with lots
of<00:01:00.960> kerfs<00:01:01.230> cut<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.219> make<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.850> flexible

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
of kerfs cut in it that make it flexible

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.580 
of kerfs cut in it that make it flexible
this<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.549> called<00:01:05.760> reverse<00:01:06.180> kerfing<00:01:06.540> there<00:01:07.500> are

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
this is called reverse kerfing there are

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.109 
this is called reverse kerfing there are
two<00:01:07.740> different<00:01:07.979> types<00:01:08.189> reverse<00:01:08.610> kerfing<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
two different types reverse kerfing and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.580 
two different types reverse kerfing and
than<00:01:09.210> traditional<00:01:09.810> kerfing

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
than traditional kerfing

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.330 
than traditional kerfing
I<00:01:11.220> chose<00:01:11.760> reversed<00:01:12.180> for<00:01:12.570> two<00:01:12.900> reasons<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:14.040> it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
I chose reversed for two reasons one it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.010 
I chose reversed for two reasons one it
looked<00:01:14.700> easier<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.390> make<00:01:15.570> than<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
looked easier to make than the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.999 
looked easier to make than the
traditional<00:01:16.590> kerfing

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
traditional kerfing

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.450 
traditional kerfing
and<00:01:17.570> it's<00:01:18.570> supposed<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> provide<00:01:19.460> extra

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
and it's supposed to provide extra

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.109 
and it's supposed to provide extra
rigidity<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:22.159> don't<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.640> either<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.000> those

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
rigidity I don't know if either of those

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.830 
rigidity I don't know if either of those
things<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.509> true<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:24.900> um<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:26.659> went<00:01:27.659> with

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
things are true but um I went with

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.410 
things are true but um I went with
reversed<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.350> could<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.680> bought<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.420> it's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
reversed I could have bought this it's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.069 
reversed I could have bought this it's
only<00:01:31.220> like<00:01:32.220> two<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:32.880> three<00:01:32.909> dollars<00:01:33.270> for<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
only like two or three dollars for a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.300 
only like two or three dollars for a
strip<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:35.479> I'm<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.100> make<00:01:38.100> as

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
strip of it but I'm going to make as

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.310 
strip of it but I'm going to make as
much<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.700> guitar<00:01:38.960> myself<00:01:39.960> as<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.200> can

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.649 

so<00:01:45.280> like<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:45.490> said<00:01:45.549> I<00:01:45.670> did<00:01:45.880> order<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.210> plans<00:01:46.450> I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
so like I said I did order the plans I

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.929 
so like I said I did order the plans I
ordered<00:01:46.930> them<00:01:46.990> from<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.259> website<00:01:47.470> called<00:01:48.130> Stu

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
ordered them from a website called Stu

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.289 
ordered them from a website called Stu
Mac<00:01:49.240> comm<00:01:49.810> Stuart<00:01:50.229> McDonald<00:01:50.710> they<00:01:51.610> seem<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.180> be

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
building

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.810 
building
so<00:01:56.290> hopefully<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.890> plans<00:01:57.159> should<00:01:57.580> arrive

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
so hopefully the plans should arrive

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.120 
so hopefully the plans should arrive
tomorrow<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:59.170> can<00:01:59.320> start<00:01:59.590> looking<00:01:59.890> at

tomorrow and I can start looking at

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.070 
tomorrow and I can start looking at
those<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:00.610> see<00:02:01.270> what<00:02:01.299> I've<00:02:01.479> really<00:02:01.810> gotten

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
those and see what I've really gotten

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.870 
those and see what I've really gotten
myself<00:02:02.229> into<00:02:04.830> but<00:02:05.830> I<00:02:05.860> believe<00:02:06.189> I've<00:02:06.430> gotten<00:02:06.700> as

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
myself into but I believe I've gotten as

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.540 
myself into but I believe I've gotten as
much<00:02:06.909> of<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.420> prep<00:02:07.689> work<00:02:07.899> done<00:02:07.930> as<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.500> can

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
much of the prep work done as I can

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.460 
much of the prep work done as I can
there's<00:02:09.880> still<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.149> bracing<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:10.989> needs<00:02:11.260> to

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
there's still the bracing that needs to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.020 
there's still the bracing that needs to
be<00:02:11.620> made<00:02:11.860> but<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.310> don't<00:02:12.519> know<00:02:12.730> what<00:02:12.940> the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
be made but I don't know what the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.820 
be made but I don't know what the
dimensions<00:02:13.480> are<00:02:13.660> for<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.560> need<00:02:14.769> to

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
dimensions are for that so I need to

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.059 
dimensions are for that so I need to
wait<00:02:14.950> for<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.190> plans<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:17.410> let's<00:02:17.739> get<00:02:17.830> into<00:02:18.040> it

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
wait for the plans so let's get into it

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.520 
wait for the plans so let's get into it
let's<00:02:18.430> do<00:02:18.880> some<00:02:19.030> sanding<00:02:19.510> some<00:02:19.750> squaring<00:02:20.380> and

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
let's do some sanding some squaring and

let's do some sanding some squaring and
let's<00:02:20.680> make<00:02:21.310> some<00:02:21.370> curving<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.370> first

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
let's make some curving so the first

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.699 
let's make some curving so the first
thing<00:02:24.760> I'm<00:02:24.819> going<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.150> do<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.660> start<00:02:26.049> working

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
thing I'm going to do is start working

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.890 
thing I'm going to do is start working
with<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.250> neck<00:02:27.610> blank<00:02:27.790> now<00:02:28.330> take<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.690> the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
with the neck blank now take it to the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.880 
with the neck blank now take it to the
jointer<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.880> flatten<00:02:30.880> one<00:02:31.090> face<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.890> one

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.709 

next<00:02:45.599> it's<00:02:45.749> to<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.230> table-saw<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:47.599> square<00:02:48.599> up

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:48.719 
next it's to the table-saw to square up

00:02:48.719 --> 00:03:07.180 
next it's to the table-saw to square up
the<00:02:48.749> other<00:02:49.379> two<00:02:49.769> sides

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.210 

with<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.390> neck<00:03:08.780> blank<00:03:09.050> cleaned<00:03:09.470> up<00:03:09.650> I'm<00:03:09.890> going

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
with the neck blank cleaned up I'm going

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.600 
with the neck blank cleaned up I'm going
to<00:03:10.340> turn<00:03:10.730> my<00:03:10.970> attention<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:12.370> back<00:03:13.370> of<00:03:13.520> the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
to turn my attention to the back of the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.580 
to turn my attention to the back of the
guitar<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.150> soundboard<00:03:14.630> essentially

guitar and the soundboard essentially
I'm<00:03:15.680> just<00:03:15.830> going<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.070> clean<00:03:16.400> up<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:17.470> glue<00:03:18.470> line

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
I'm just going to clean up the glue line

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.440 
I'm just going to clean up the glue line
that<00:03:18.860> we<00:03:18.950> did<00:03:19.100> before<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.640> give<00:03:20.090> everything

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
that we did before and give everything

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:40.649

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.080 

now<00:03:41.659> it's<00:03:41.870> on<00:03:42.019> to<00:03:42.260> making<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:43.129> kerfing<00:03:43.400> the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
now it's on to making the kerfing the

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.050 
now it's on to making the kerfing the
kerfing<00:03:44.480> is<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:45.610> part<00:03:46.610> of<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.730> guitar<00:03:46.879> that

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
kerfing is the part of the guitar that

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.820 
kerfing is the part of the guitar that
you<00:03:47.780> don't<00:03:47.959> actually<00:03:48.080> see<00:03:48.260> it's<00:03:48.590> on<00:03:48.739> the

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
you don't actually see it's on the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.009 
you don't actually see it's on the
inside<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.340> it<00:03:49.459> provides<00:03:49.790> glue<00:03:50.269> surface<00:03:50.750> for

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
inside and it provides glue surface for

these<00:03:57.680> strips<00:03:58.159> are<00:04:00.040> 7/32<00:04:01.040> of<00:04:01.280> an<00:04:01.489> inch<00:04:01.670> by<00:04:02.140> 9/16

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
these strips are 7/32 of an inch by 9/16

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.619 
these strips are 7/32 of an inch by 9/16
of<00:04:03.200> an<00:04:03.319> inch<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:04.190> their<00:04:04.340> length<00:04:04.610> is<00:04:04.849> about<00:04:05.000> 22

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
of an inch and their length is about 22

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.289 
of an inch and their length is about 22
inches<00:04:06.280> after<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.549> strips<00:04:07.790> are<00:04:07.940> cut<00:04:07.970> I'm

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
inches after the strips are cut I'm

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:09.850 
inches after the strips are cut I'm
gonna<00:04:08.540> take<00:04:08.750> it<00:04:08.870> over<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.049> my<00:04:09.260> router<00:04:09.500> and

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
gonna take it over to my router and

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.699 
gonna take it over to my router and
round<00:04:10.700> over<00:04:10.879> one<00:04:11.450> of<00:04:11.599> the<00:04:11.750> corners<00:04:11.930> with<00:04:12.530> an

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
round over one of the corners with an

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:28.210 
round over one of the corners with an
eighth<00:04:13.099> inch<00:04:13.840> roundover<00:04:14.840> bit

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.920 

then<00:04:29.220> I'll<00:04:29.400> just<00:04:29.580> sand<00:04:30.210> all<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:30.630> strips

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
then I'll just sand all the strips

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:40.810 
then I'll just sand all the strips
really<00:04:31.230> quickly

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.000 

after<00:04:41.540> giving<00:04:41.750> them<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:42.020> light<00:04:42.200> sanding<00:04:42.770> I

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
after giving them a light sanding I

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.210 
after giving them a light sanding I
taped<00:04:43.640> them<00:04:43.820> all<00:04:44.000> together<00:04:44.350> and<00:04:45.350> now<00:04:45.410> I'm

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
taped them all together and now I'm

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.150 
taped them all together and now I'm
marking<00:04:46.850> out<00:04:47.030> where<00:04:47.330> each<00:04:48.320> kerf<00:04:48.740> cut<00:04:48.770> will<00:04:49.130> be

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
marking out where each kerf cut will be

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.730 
marking out where each kerf cut will be
I<00:04:49.490> taped<00:04:50.480> them<00:04:50.630> together<00:04:50.750> so<00:04:51.320> that<00:04:51.350> I<00:04:51.500> wouldn't

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
I taped them together so that I wouldn't

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.890 
I taped them together so that I wouldn't
have<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:52.130> cut<00:04:52.700> all<00:04:52.910> of<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.120> curves<00:04:53.330> in<00:04:53.660> each

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
have to cut all of the curves in each

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.440 
have to cut all of the curves in each
one<00:04:54.170> individually<00:04:54.410> this<00:04:55.100> way<00:04:55.310> I<00:04:55.340> can<00:04:55.670> do<00:04:56.300> them

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
one individually this way I can do them

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.480 
one individually this way I can do them
all<00:04:56.570> at<00:04:56.660> the<00:04:56.750> same<00:04:56.930> time<00:04:56.990> I'm<00:04:57.980> measuring<00:04:58.220> these

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
all at the same time I'm measuring these

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.150 
all at the same time I'm measuring these
out<00:04:58.670> every<00:04:58.910> 3/8<00:04:59.780> of<00:04:59.930> an<00:05:00.080> inch<00:05:00.170> and<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:00.950> curves

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
out every 3/8 of an inch and the curves

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:20.140 
out every 3/8 of an inch and the curves
will<00:05:01.340> be<00:05:01.460> cut<00:05:01.700> on<00:05:02.830> center

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.730 

the<00:05:20.840> curves<00:05:21.110> don't<00:05:21.410> have<00:05:22.010> to<00:05:22.900> be<00:05:23.900> every<00:05:24.230> 3/8<00:05:24.620> of

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
the curves don't have to be every 3/8 of

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.120 
the curves don't have to be every 3/8 of
an<00:05:24.860> inch

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
an inch

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.280 
an inch
exactly<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.900> purpose<00:05:27.740> of<00:05:28.010> these<00:05:28.160> is<00:05:29.290> really

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
exactly the purpose of these is really

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.800 
exactly the purpose of these is really
they're<00:05:30.440> just<00:05:30.620> flexible<00:05:31.250> strips<00:05:31.580> that<00:05:32.060> will

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
they're just flexible strips that will

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:55.460 
they're just flexible strips that will
be<00:05:32.930> glued<00:05:33.229> to<00:05:33.500> the<00:05:33.650> sides<00:05:34.070> of<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.370> guitar

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.160 

and<00:05:55.980> so<00:05:56.190> with<00:05:56.400> all<00:05:56.640> of<00:05:56.820> the<00:05:56.940> curves<00:05:57.210> cut<00:05:57.870> into

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
and so with all of the curves cut into

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.220 
and so with all of the curves cut into
the<00:05:58.290> kerfing<00:05:58.500> I'll<00:05:59.040> flip<00:05:59.430> them<00:05:59.580> over<00:05:59.670> and<00:06:00.230> sand

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
the kerfing I'll flip them over and sand

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:09.500 
the kerfing I'll flip them over and sand
them<00:06:01.410> once<00:06:01.650> again

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 
I'm going to need to do at some point

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:45.489 
I'm going to need to do at some point
while<00:06:44.599> I'm<00:06:44.749> waiting<00:06:44.839> for<00:06:44.990> the<00:06:45.139> plans<00:06:45.319> to

00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:45.499 
while I'm waiting for the plans to

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:48.820 
while I'm waiting for the plans to
arrive<00:06:45.740> so<00:06:46.430> that's<00:06:47.059> what<00:06:47.210> we<00:06:47.300> did<00:06:47.389> I<00:06:47.449> made<00:06:47.830> way

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
arrive so that's what we did I made way

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.709 
arrive so that's what we did I made way
more<00:06:48.860> kerfing<00:06:49.580> than<00:06:49.909> I'm<00:06:50.120> actually<00:06:50.300> going<00:06:50.599> to

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719 
more kerfing than I'm actually going to

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:52.779 
more kerfing than I'm actually going to
need<00:06:50.990> but<00:06:51.740> that's<00:06:51.949> that's<00:06:52.279> not<00:06:52.520> a<00:06:52.550> bad<00:06:52.759> thing

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
need but that's that's not a bad thing

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:55.059 
need but that's that's not a bad thing
I'm<00:06:53.659> sure<00:06:53.900> some<00:06:54.169> of<00:06:54.199> the<00:06:54.319> pieces<00:06:54.469> of<00:06:54.710> break<00:06:54.889> on

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:55.069 
I'm sure some of the pieces of break on

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:58.390 
I'm sure some of the pieces of break on
me<00:06:55.249> some<00:06:55.819> of<00:06:55.939> them<00:06:56.120> turned<00:06:56.779> out<00:06:56.990> to<00:06:57.289> be<00:06:57.439> more

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
me some of them turned out to be more

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.890 
me some of them turned out to be more
flexible<00:06:58.909> than<00:06:59.029> others<00:06:59.270> some<00:06:59.599> are<00:06:59.719> less

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
flexible than others some are less

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.200 
flexible than others some are less
flexible<00:07:00.080> than<00:07:00.439> others<00:07:00.740> so<00:07:01.729> I<00:07:01.759> guess<00:07:01.999> at<00:07:02.180> least

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
flexible than others so I guess at least

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.850 
flexible than others so I guess at least
this<00:07:02.449> way<00:07:02.599> I<00:07:02.629> can<00:07:02.719> pick<00:07:03.199> and<00:07:03.349> choose<00:07:03.409> the

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
this way I can pick and choose the

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.559 
this way I can pick and choose the
pieces<00:07:04.400> that<00:07:04.610> I<00:07:04.819> want<00:07:05.089> to<00:07:05.180> use<00:07:07.029> so<00:07:08.029> the<00:07:08.360> plans

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:08.569 
pieces that I want to use so the plans

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:12.939 
pieces that I want to use so the plans
should<00:07:08.779> be<00:07:08.839> here<00:07:09.050> tomorrow<00:07:09.199> and<00:07:09.650> I<00:07:10.599> guess<00:07:11.949> what

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:12.949 
should be here tomorrow and I guess what

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:14.409 
should be here tomorrow and I guess what
I'm<00:07:13.039> gonna<00:07:13.159> need<00:07:13.370> to<00:07:13.520> do<00:07:13.669> is<00:07:13.849> start<00:07:14.060> making

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:14.419 
I'm gonna need to do is start making

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:17.230 
I'm gonna need to do is start making
some<00:07:14.599> templates<00:07:15.050> and<00:07:15.319> some<00:07:15.889> molds<00:07:16.490> and<00:07:16.699> things

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 
some templates and some molds and things

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.260 
some templates and some molds and things
like<00:07:17.419> that<00:07:17.479> to<00:07:18.490> you<00:07:19.490> know<00:07:19.610> actually<00:07:19.819> start

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
like that to you know actually start

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.469 
like that to you know actually start
putting<00:07:21.229> this<00:07:21.319> thing<00:07:21.379> together<00:07:22.089> so<00:07:23.089> that<00:07:23.330> will

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 
putting this thing together so that will

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:29.800 
putting this thing together so that will
probably<00:07:23.839> be<00:07:24.409> first<00:07:26.020> so<00:07:27.020> I<00:07:28.539> guess<00:07:29.539> that'll<00:07:29.779> be

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:29.810 
probably be first so I guess that'll be

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.600 
probably be first so I guess that'll be
the<00:07:29.930> next<00:07:30.110> part<00:07:30.289> so<00:07:31.009> if<00:07:31.099> you<00:07:31.159> like<00:07:31.310> this<00:07:31.399> video
