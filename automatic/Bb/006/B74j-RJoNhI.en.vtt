00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.410
 what is a computer the computer is 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.050
 a composite electrical device 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.820
 mainly by a processor one 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.890
 memory input and output devices 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.320
 that they carry out a processor 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.849
 information from a group of 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.030
 instructions provided by the 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.860
 user calls programs or software to 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.979
 from this the types 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.320
 that are super computers the station 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:45.309
 work computer desktop 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.530
 laptop computers tablet phones 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.140
 smart domestic use and 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.989
 personal resistant entertainment 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.670
 game consoles as you can 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.379
 observe we classify the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.089
 computer term to all 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.820
 devices that have a processor 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.479
 with a memory input devices 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.479
 and data output 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.850
 the computer also called 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.610
 computer is an electronic machine that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.490
 receive and process data to convert 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.250
 in useful information a computer is 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.619
 a connection of integrated circuits and 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.440
 other related components that 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.780
 can execute with speed quickly and 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.660
 as indicated by the user 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.759
 by another program a great variety of 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.600
 sequences or instructions routines 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.820
 which are organized you ordered 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.460
 systematized according to a wide 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.640
 range of practical applications 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.890
 and precisely certain process to the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.850
 which has been called with the name 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.100
 of programming the computer in addition to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.100
 the routine or computer program 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.550
 you need specific data that should be 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.650
 supplied and that are required at 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.320
 moment of execution 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.810
 to provide the final product of 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.000
 data processing that receives the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.940
 author's name 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.160
 or output characteristics 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.050
 main that distinguish it from others 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.800
 similar devices like 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.230
 calculator is not programmable is that it is 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.350
 A general purpose machine is 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.209
 say you can perform various tasks of 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.180
 according to the possibilities that 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.340
 they provide programming languages 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.470
 use of the computer in society the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.300
 computers were built in a 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.220
 principle to be used with a 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.870
 user but due to the great 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.940
 impact that this machine had on the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.730
 society , a 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.920
 wide variety of models and brands 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.739
 reduced the sale prices by the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.140
 cheapening technology and this to 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.640
 At the same time it caused a 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.970
 lots of applications and 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.120
 functions that streamlined work 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.459
 daily in various areas with what 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.370
 would facilitate in each sector the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.800
 production of products or 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.660
 will streamline processes that at some time 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.890
 they will last much longer 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.890
 the human being 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.950
 with xstrata labor or business use 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.590
 as we can imagine in these sectors 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.780
 the computer is more essential since 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.670
 that it facilitates the work they do 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.830
 workers at the same time that you 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.110
 It suits the company or the company 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.730
 have a computerized machine that 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.470
 I would do the work of a certain amount 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.990
 of workers that the only thing 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.960
 would get would be maintenance that a 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.030
 worker with salary and also ensured 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.640
 that makes data processes more 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.320
 fast that the average human being the 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.810
 output of products or jobs 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.870
 made thus being the field where more 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.580
 it has spread its use are employed 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.670
 for data processing 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.440
 administrative procedures have been authorized 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.420
 typical functions of management of 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.790
 companies including also packages 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.710
 integrated electronic office post 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.840
 that usually by processors of 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.730
 text sheets electronic management 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.040
 files and databases mail 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.050
 electronic electronic agendas and 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.490
 graphic application one of the 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.380
 examples would be the trade of the 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.170
 computer that helps in the design and 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.220
 manufacture of products and to give in 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.920
 market campaigns to be given 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.220
 and process inventories accounts receivable 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.740
 and to pay and payroll another example would be 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.110
 in the sales department, compare the 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.700
 Product availability and credit 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.440
 of the customer another would be in shipping and receipt 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.080
 they use the computer to enter 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.990
 transmissions keeping updated 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.130
 the records of inventory and sale on 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.130
 next example series 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.410
 the computer in educational use in the 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.790
 education the computer is a means that 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.970
 Strengthens the process 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.590
 teaching-learning thus being a 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.560
 average instrument to educate 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.900
 find out about research compare train 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.290
 the brain memory the mental quickness 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.820
 and in general the mental abilities the 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.530
 computer technology is 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.090
 becomes a powerful and diverse that 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.970
 the tool that transforms the 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.940
 students of passive receivers of the 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.490
 information on active participants is 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.470
 an enriching learning process 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.919
 where he plays a major role 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.350
 the ease of relating successively 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.820
 different types of information 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.800
 customizing education by allowing 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.380
 to each student advance according to their own 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.450
 capacity but the mere application of 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.910
 computer in education does not ensure 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.410
 better training for students 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.160
 for this it has to be followed 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:42.460
 certain steps not to misuse 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.140
 that is, the communication computed as 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.420
 long history has been a machine 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.450
 very powerful and even to overcome 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.910
 devices that only fulfill a function 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:54.310
 one of these cases is communication 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.530
 a computer with access to 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.260
 Internet can easily enter 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:03.250
 news pages where they are updated 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:05.920
 every 10 minutes and so be aware what 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.920
 as up-to-date as possible or either 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.320
 for help from programs or social networks 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.320
 that send messages images and even 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.810
 videos in a short time just like 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.060
 it helps send messages to a 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.180
 public that although it does not occupy it can 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.890
 understand easily what it implies 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.950
 this is the case of mainly 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:30.330
 advertising then from a computer 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.330
 with the programs 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.040
 business card videos and so on 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:40.210
 all in order to deliver a message 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.210
 to the public
