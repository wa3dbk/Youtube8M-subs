 Top scorer euro 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.860
 "I'm fine 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.210
 but not there we see you yes 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.210
 exactly where was meant 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.630
 Photo AP concluded 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.330
 that's impossible 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.590
 but just have a look 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.260
 a daring action 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.290
 I'm fine 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.290

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.910
 4 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.610
 what was going on who would have thought that 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.240
 and so expect the two should get the top 4 he has 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.350
 MR 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.470
 at the 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.350
 on the other hand, interest rates will remain 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.350
 5 000 euros but had arrived with me 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.570
 that is not so accurate 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.570
 User can 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.039
 Horror and anger 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.349
 it should be 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.349
 it would 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.349
 there have to 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.379
 Minute it goes on 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.509
 they'll make it 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.229
 every second begins the second half 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:59.219
 you can do it that way is very clear favorite 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:00.469
 Indeed 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.799
 even the song "One reproach is not to be underestimated 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:07.109
 we have to have these people 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.319
 and we will succeed 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.700
 all our fans are keeping our fingers crossed for us today 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.700
 we have to be in the wise what is in us 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.369
 the second half is over 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.279
 Do not go now 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.569
 from Norbert Bangert situation 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.569
 the speech is 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.349
 The beginning clearly determines the game 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.529
 we'll see if we have a safe side soon 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:38.529
 and so will probably change from 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.959
 was a long way 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.689
 I wanted to work this 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.689
 I knew it 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.599
 every suit is executed 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.119
 Trier that did not work out the ball rolls in from 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.780
 No one may have such a thing about his choice 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.090
 the answer to what reaches what is too much is too much of that I am 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.819
 deliberately 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.529
 but it is my only chance 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:23.279
 i have to make the compensation thats i blame my team 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.279
 Add ten to seven cost what it wants 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.639
 what should the couple live or the team dominates so Barth has 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.920
 not at all to work 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.699
 and now I do not know 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.699
 so surely his reasons have got cure 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.979
 if we think of something better, Ellison said 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:45.859
 Machnig is good
