going to cut a little ring around the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:37.760 
going to cut a little ring around the
base<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.420> tail<00:00:36.050> good<00:00:37.050> girl

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
base of the tail good girl

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.670 
base of the tail good girl
and<00:00:38.489> we're<00:00:38.610> gonna<00:00:38.730> look<00:00:39.059> at<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.510> from<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and we're gonna look at it from the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.270 
and we're gonna look at it from the
front<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> back<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:42.030> clean<00:00:42.329> off<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.750> back

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.850 

and<00:00:47.780> this<00:00:48.780> helps<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.940> establish<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.930> line<00:00:52.320> right

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and this helps to establish a line right

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.260 
and this helps to establish a line right
in<00:00:52.920> through<00:00:53.340> here<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.780> not<00:00:55.760> cluttered<00:00:56.760> by

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
in through here that is not cluttered by

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.270 
in through here that is not cluttered by
hair<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> base<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.920> tail

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.280 

this<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.729> done<00:01:05.939> these<00:01:06.600> are<00:01:06.900> small

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
this can be done these are small

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.770 
this can be done these are small
straight<00:01:07.979> edge<00:01:08.280> shears<00:01:09.180> well<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.630> is

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
straight edge shears well this is

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.929 
straight edge shears well this is
actually<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.170> curved<00:01:10.530> scissor<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.159> small

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
actually a curved scissor but small

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.740 
actually a curved scissor but small
scissors<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.500> could<00:01:13.680> use<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.479> blender<00:01:15.479> like

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
scissors or you could use a blender like

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.920 
scissors or you could use a blender like
this<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.530> could<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> blender<00:01:22.700> and

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
this we could do it in the blender and

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.390 
this we could do it in the blender and
some<00:01:24.930> groomers<00:01:25.320> use<00:01:25.530> clippers<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.220> that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
some groomers use clippers but that

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.749 
some groomers use clippers but that
makes<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.759> really<00:01:27.450> close<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.020> naked<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.280> what

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
makes it really close and naked so what

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.940 
makes it really close and naked so what
we're<00:01:29.909> trying<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.329> do<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.810> we're<00:01:31.530> trying<00:01:31.770> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
we're trying to do is we're trying to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.469 
we're trying to do is we're trying to
separate<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.960> rump<00:01:34.350> line<00:01:34.710> from<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.759> tail<00:01:36.030> so

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
separate the rump line from the tail so

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.569 
separate the rump line from the tail so
that<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.840> doesn't<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.439> just<00:01:37.950> mushed<00:01:38.369> up

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that it doesn't get all just mushed up

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.870 
that it doesn't get all just mushed up
in<00:01:38.820> there<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.240> now<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
in there so now you can see we have the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.420 
in there so now you can see we have the
beginnings<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.320> clear<00:01:43.680> rump

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
beginnings of a clear rump

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.429 
beginnings of a clear rump
then<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.299> take<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:47.180> larger<00:01:48.180> curved<00:01:48.540> scissor<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
then we take a larger curved scissor and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.090 
then we take a larger curved scissor and
we're<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.979> create<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:51.000> line<00:01:51.710> right<00:01:52.710> in

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
we're going to create this line right in

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.920 
we're going to create this line right in
through<00:01:53.490> here<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.030> get<00:01:54.240> rid<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.509> some<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> this

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
through here and get rid of some of this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.340 
through here and get rid of some of this
excess<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.060> create<00:01:57.060> really<00:01:57.659> cute<00:01:58.170> little

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
excess and create really cute little

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.810 
excess and create really cute little
buns<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:59.219> our<00:01:59.430> be<00:01:59.610> shown<00:02:00.140> these<00:02:01.140> are<00:02:01.820> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
buns on our be shown these are the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.740 
buns on our be shown these are the
Bichon<00:02:03.299> Thais<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.320> shown<00:02:04.590> buns

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.130 

and<00:02:11.310> key<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:13.060> coming<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.630> nice<00:02:13.870> and

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.809 
go over it and over it like I'm
sketching<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.599> in<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:56.650> this<00:03:56.829> shape<00:03:57.189> and<00:03:57.430> form

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
sketching it in to this shape and form

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.420 
sketching it in to this shape and form
that<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:58.629> want<00:03:59.019> that's<00:03:59.319> my<00:04:00.219> approach<00:04:00.730> to

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
that I want that's my approach to

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.649 
that I want that's my approach to
scissoring<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:05.079> I<00:04:05.230> use<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:06.069> scissors<00:04:06.659> almost

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
scissoring and I use the scissors almost

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:16.680 
scissoring and I use the scissors almost
like<00:04:08.639> the<00:04:09.639> artist<00:04:10.090> would<00:04:10.269> use<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.810> brush<00:04:15.690> so

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
like the artist would use the brush so

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.529 
like the artist would use the brush so
there's<00:04:16.930> our<00:04:17.109> nice<00:04:17.349> little<00:04:17.560> rough<00:04:17.949> line<00:04:18.539> got

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
there's our nice little rough line got

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.780 
there's our nice little rough line got
it
