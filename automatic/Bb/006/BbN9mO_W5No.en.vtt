00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
you I've been buying from a few places I

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.810 
you I've been buying from a few places I
guess<00:00:56.670> overall<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.719> shipping<00:00:58.109> quality<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
guess overall the shipping quality I

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.819 
guess overall the shipping quality I
think<00:00:59.820> nike<00:01:00.059> got<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.449> point<00:01:00.750> some<00:01:01.680> other

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
think nike got it on point some other

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.719 
think nike got it on point some other
places<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.520> came<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.000> boxes<00:01:03.359> came<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:03.809> right

places it came the boxes came all right
they<00:01:05.729> weren't<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.180> secure<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> guess<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.260> so

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
they weren't as secure I guess and so

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.469 
they weren't as secure I guess and so
