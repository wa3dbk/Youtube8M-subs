we're<00:00:00.390> gonna<00:00:00.510> talk<00:00:00.810> about<00:00:00.930> how<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.230> securely

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
we're gonna talk about how to securely

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.300 
we're gonna talk about how to securely

erase a hard drive attackers like to get
hold<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.549> hard<00:00:05.759> drives<00:00:06.000> that<00:00:06.210> might<00:00:06.359> have<00:00:06.540> data

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
hold of hard drives that might have data

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.540 
hold of hard drives that might have data
on<00:00:06.899> them<00:00:07.170> especially<00:00:07.379> if<00:00:07.799> it's<00:00:07.980> sensitive

their<00:00:10.830> benefit<00:00:11.540> there<00:00:12.540> are<00:00:12.630> two<00:00:12.750> things<00:00:13.019> that

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
their benefit there are two things that

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.720 
their benefit there are two things that
can<00:00:13.349> get<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:13.799> trouble<00:00:13.950> with<00:00:14.190> hard<00:00:14.519> drives

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
can get you in trouble with hard drives

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.180 
can get you in trouble with hard drives
one<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:16.049> when<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.289> ask<00:00:16.470> an<00:00:16.680> operating

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
one is that when you ask an operating

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.580 
one is that when you ask an operating
system<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.820> delete<00:00:18.090> data<00:00:18.300> from<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.960> drive

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
system to delete data from a drive

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.500 
system to delete data from a drive
sometimes<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> operating<00:00:20.880> system<00:00:21.300> just

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
sometimes the operating system just

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.140 
sometimes the operating system just
simply<00:00:21.840> marks<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.350> area<00:00:22.740> as<00:00:23.010> hey<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.820> can

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
simply marks that area as hey you can

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.390 
simply marks that area as hey you can
use<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.510> later<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.830> data<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.220> never

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
use this later but the data is never

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.939 
use this later but the data is never
actually<00:00:26.670> erased<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:28.050> second<00:00:28.410> problem<00:00:28.769> is

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
actually erased the second problem is

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.150 
actually erased the second problem is
even<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:29.550> data<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:30.060> erased<00:00:30.510> from<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.840> drive

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
even if data is erased from a drive

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.770 
even if data is erased from a drive
sometimes<00:00:32.160> there's<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.759> little<00:00:33.000> bit<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.510> hint

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
sometimes there's a little bit of hint

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.750 
sometimes there's a little bit of hint
of<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> magnetism<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> was<00:00:35.190> there<00:00:35.370> before

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
of the magnetism of it was there before

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.090 
of the magnetism of it was there before
called<00:00:36.390> data<00:00:36.600> remanence<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.410> their<00:00:37.860> tools

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
called data remanence and their tools

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.950 
called data remanence and their tools
that<00:00:38.520> can<00:00:38.640> allow<00:00:38.820> people<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.239> go<00:00:39.420> recover<00:00:39.719> that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
that can allow people to go recover that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.319 
that can allow people to go recover that
information<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.790> need<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.149> is

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
information so what we need to do is

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.790 
information so what we need to do is
protect<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> drive<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.410> you're<00:00:43.559> going<00:00:43.680> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
protect the drive if you're going to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.440 
protect the drive if you're going to
give<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.070> away<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:44.460> sell<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:44.940> dispose<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
give it away or sell it or dispose of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.389 
give it away or sell it or dispose of
your<00:00:45.690> computer<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.860> ways<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.219> can

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
your computer and there ways you can

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.369 
your computer and there ways you can
crush<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> drive<00:00:48.149> use<00:00:48.510> chemicals<00:00:49.110> to

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
crush the drive use chemicals to

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.439 
crush the drive use chemicals to
basically<00:00:50.160> eat<00:00:50.460> away<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> driving<00:00:51.329> use

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
basically eat away the driving use

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.750 
basically eat away the driving use

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
drives but all these things will destroy

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.729 
drives but all these things will destroy
the<00:00:56.610> drive<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.239> can't<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.570> used<00:00:57.809> anymore<00:00:57.960> if

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the drive so it can't be used anymore if

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
the drive so it can't be used anymore if
you<00:00:59.160> want<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> donate<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> driver<00:01:00.270> even<00:01:00.420> use

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
you want to donate the driver even use

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.510 
you want to donate the driver even use
it's<00:01:00.960> more<00:01:01.260> yourself<00:01:01.739> there's<00:01:02.219> another

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
it's more yourself there's another

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.570 
it's more yourself there's another

option called sanitization you Santas i
sanitized<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> hard<00:01:06.720> drive<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.140> less<00:01:07.350> secure

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
sanitized a hard drive it's less secure

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.880 
sanitized a hard drive it's less secure
but<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.549> drive<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.030> still<00:01:09.240> usable<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.710> way

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
but the drive is still usable the way

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.039 
but the drive is still usable the way
sanitization<00:01:11.760> works<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.330> write<00:01:12.540> over<00:01:12.900> and

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
sanitization works is you write over and

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.530 
sanitization works is you write over and
over<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.500> over<00:01:13.799> where<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> file<00:01:14.820> used<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.360> be

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
over and over where a file used to be

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.590 
over and over where a file used to be
with<00:01:16.170> random<00:01:16.650> data<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> result<00:01:18.330> it

with random data and as a result it

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.450 
with random data and as a result it
makes<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.900> very<00:01:18.990> difficult<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.860> go<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.220> and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
makes it very difficult to go in and

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.270 
makes it very difficult to go in and
recover<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.000> files<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.420> were<00:01:21.600> there

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
recover the files that were there

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.200 
recover the files that were there

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
wondering they do need to be sanitized

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.800 
wondering they do need to be sanitized
as<00:01:26.310> well<00:01:26.520> even<00:01:26.970> though<00:01:27.180> they're<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.509> made<00:01:27.689> of

Esteli say here are the files i want you
to<00:03:42.709> believe<00:03:42.890> so<00:03:43.430> in<00:03:43.579> this<00:03:43.670> case<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.150> would

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
to believe so in this case you would

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.449 
to believe so in this case you would
already<00:03:44.450> have<00:03:44.599> files<00:03:45.049> on<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.410> drive<00:03:45.709> but

that's<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.950> path<00:03:52.190> he<00:03:52.430> would<00:03:52.549> put<00:03:52.760> in<00:03:52.910> as<00:03:53.150> the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
you would combine some switches semen -

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.650 
you would combine some switches semen -
p5<00:04:05.660> -<00:04:06.139> say<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.350> want<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.620> do<00:04:06.739> this<00:04:06.889> 5<00:04:07.130> times<00:04:07.510> -<00:04:08.510> s

is<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:08.900> switch<00:04:09.230> I<00:04:09.410> didn't<00:04:09.680> give<00:04:09.769> you<00:04:09.889> before<00:04:10.069> but

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
is a switch I didn't give you before but

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.849 
is a switch I didn't give you before but
it<00:04:10.549> basically<00:04:10.910> just<00:04:11.060> tells<00:04:11.420> it's<00:04:12.079> delete<00:04:12.530> to

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
it basically just tells it's delete to

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.670 
it basically just tells it's delete to
delete<00:04:12.889> files<00:04:13.400> within<00:04:14.269> that<00:04:14.420> folder<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:15.109> any

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
delete files within that folder and any

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.440 
delete files within that folder and any
other<00:04:15.920> folders<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.639> within<00:04:17.030> that<00:04:17.180> folder

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
other folders that within that folder

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.509 
other folders that within that folder
and<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.079> on<00:04:18.260> it<00:04:18.440> gets<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.739> whole<00:04:18.889> tree<00:04:19.280> in<00:04:19.400> this

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
and so on it gets the whole tree in this

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.330 
and so on it gets the whole tree in this
case<00:04:19.760> below<00:04:20.060> mine<00:04:20.329> docks<00:04:20.660> and<00:04:21.169> even<00:04:21.919> lists<00:04:22.130> out

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
case below mine docks and even lists out

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.129 
case below mine docks and even lists out
so<00:04:22.550> here's<00:04:22.789> an<00:04:22.970> example<00:04:23.060> of<00:04:23.660> what<00:04:23.840> you<00:04:23.990> could

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
so here's an example of what you could

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.290 
so here's an example of what you could
put<00:04:24.289> in<00:04:24.440> your<00:04:24.560> computer<00:04:24.770> just<00:04:25.400> change<00:04:25.700> the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
drive and the folder name and you'll be

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.339 
drive and the folder name and you'll be
able<00:04:28.849> to<00:04:29.030> erase<00:04:29.180> everything<00:04:29.570> in<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.080> folder
