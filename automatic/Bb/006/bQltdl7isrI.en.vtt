00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 came to word 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.970
 [Music] 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.520
 mio 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.170
 to old and welcome to 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.900
 a new hairstyle video 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.580
 I'm finally my old videos so 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.740
 went over a bit and is there 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.170
 I noticed this video here my 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.029
 Last hairstyle video is just that 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.829
 most clicked sste video that me 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.390
 That's why I'm on 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.130
 The idea is still a hairstyle 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.110
 video seemingly turning 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.090
 I hope you like the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.130
 at least you knew the last and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.870
 Today there are eight new hairstyles 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.060
 for the school for the university nothing 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.620
 complicated nothing longer than five 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.810
 It takes me minutes to do that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.810
 Do not be patient and I hope now 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.220
 Just have fun and we'll start 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.990
 She should be one again at this time 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.550
 that is done really fast and 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.710
 Although I do not really bad 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.630
 really but i find this method 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.020
 So I'll explain it to you like that 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.850
 you go split your hair in half 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.770
 she twirls back and then lays 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.900
 he superimposes them and then shares the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.430
 Hair again in half on the 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.530
 World it is inward again 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.689
 over each other and then splits the strand 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.040
 back in half and that works 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.869
 really really fast if 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.330
 Once you have it on and you messias 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.560
 in the end, the better I think 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.550
 too much for the whole thing 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.930
 bit apart 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.850
 and then it looks like this in the end 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.960
 the second hairstyle has practically that the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.820
 just done here as 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.310
 starting point you can do any other 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.020
 Type of plaited plait and take the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.580
 I just put it on top of my head 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.580
 stuck with hairpins 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.190
 I would be a bit on it 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.690
 be careful that the hair ties of 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.040
 So I can not see the pigtails 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.960
 just the heads so a bit 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.850
 with each other and principle at the end so 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.890
 From hairstyle number three is a bit 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.020
 inspired by oriana grande me so far 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.310
 I want to be great here and I have 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.360
 just a side part 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:03.350
 pulled and then the perpetrator or hair 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.410
 a little bit together and then one 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.390
 pot again and the am 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.580
 upside down a bit and pulled up 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.740
 so a bit until I gezÃ¼ndelt 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.600
 was happy with it and it did not look that way 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.150
 says many palms now promote 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.500
 that means it is nicer and better 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.500
 then I have the hair is just that 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.060
 also done and finished the hairstyle 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.530
 still here everyone is really easy and 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.760
 is also very very fast looks 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.959
 as if that were a pot with the head though 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.280
 I do not have any 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.020
 And that's just the way it is now 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.760
 much more voluminous by this 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.470
 method here, you have to see the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.120
 Hackers you just hide and the 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.590
 The longer your hair is the better 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.299
 and the clock is ready 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.439
 [Music] 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.150
 I have one for the next hairstyle 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.859
 middle parted and then each 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.019
 on the right and on the left side 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.999
 again separated two parts and put 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:59.170
 I've been on top of each other until now 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:03:01.540
 I'm about to get ahead and that 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.939
 I'll get the hair down so practically 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.500
 hang and pin it in the back and 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.359
 the beautiful thing about the hairstyle is that you 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.650
 Although'm open hair but they fly 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.650
 Do not face each other all the time 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.090
 it may be a bit difficult that 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.650
 hairpin on the back of the head to hide 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.600
 that's why I just have a bigger one 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:31.860
 something nice clip over it again 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:33.330
 done and then it should look like 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.220
 next a hairstyle that's great for 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.870
 really hot days is because you the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.990
 hair completely stuck and 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.760
 although you divide them into three parts 1 and 2 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.230
 will she be so long until those little ones 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.940
 bargains arise that really works 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.410
 that's really easy 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.970
 practically by itself and this 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.250
 bargain then the plug you just 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.080
 on the back of the head stuck with hairpins or 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.330
 whatever has to wash your laundry 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.800
 Monz is stuck and that too is back 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.240
 made very fast and that still has to 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.590
 do not look super neat 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.220
 I just believe in the hairstyle ever 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.510
 Messier is the better then 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.940
 I have a third for you 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.980
 Variant if we like to use in the summer 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.600
 stands and I have one 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.450
 Ponytail high on my top 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.550
 made head and then I have one 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.170
 plate strand of the ponytail 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.549
 separated and I leave now 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.410
 first in peace and with the rest of the 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.080
 I just make a joke like hair 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.700
 Normally, too, and would do 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.270
 the small stern ones I am now plaiting 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.570
 just completely down and now comes 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.710
 the strand just around the death and 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.990
 says you have an impression of that 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.710
 a little more work but ten 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.710
 percent of fast 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.290
 perhaps already noticed I carry 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.240
 my hair totally happy to side 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.310
 and yes, because of this hairstyle I wear 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.260
 you to the side and I have for easy 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.330
 on one side of my hair 2 zbr 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.040
 under braided you can easily 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.440
 even making a promise does not matter 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.970
 like you, I just have it 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.860
 normal and then the pigtails one 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.770
 counted out a bit so that she 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.960
 something moderately a bit voluminous and so on 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.420
 look and then I just take everyone 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.930
 hair to the side and find it easy 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.880
 first with soft rubbers and then make 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.860
 I'll do that trick with the little one again 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.780
 strand of hair and wrap it around the 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:20.300
 hairline round that was very much 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:24.170
 nice effect and behind you can see 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:27.310
 now the heads and very nice 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.310
 finished is guarded 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.630
 okay those were the eight visit and 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.820
