00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
it's too tight you can use a filter

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.880 
it's too tight you can use a filter
wrench<00:02:21.500> which<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.130> have<00:02:22.310> right<00:02:22.610> here<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:24.410> uses<00:02:24.710> a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
wrench which I have right here it uses a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.620 
wrench which I have right here it uses a
ratchet<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:25.730> just<00:02:25.910> plug<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.210> in<00:02:26.270> there<00:02:26.450> and

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
when you loosen it it actually holds

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.670 
when you loosen it it actually holds
onto<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.060> filter<00:02:29.330> tightly<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.410> moves<00:02:30.590> it

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
onto the filter tightly and it moves it

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:39.070
