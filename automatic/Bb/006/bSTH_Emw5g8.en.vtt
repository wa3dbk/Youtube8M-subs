 the area of ​​france 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.600
 good even though three quarters of corn

 product is used to feed livestock 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.769
 he serves up a lot of other wilfried stuff

 of course you do not worry it's okay 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.550

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.180
 mouth more exactly of Monday in the

 corn starch is even used 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.579
 regularly in kung fu paintings 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.989
 on the walls but also in the 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.789
 laundry products or products of 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.170
 cleaning the pili plays the methods that 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.670

 protecting youtube happily from 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.729
 beauties the madness he admitted including starch 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.470
 corn is often used as a binder 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.570
 in the construction of buildings a 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.280
 house that serves to keep everything from 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.930
 corn if if it's there and even you 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.369
 know the stem all hard when we have at home 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.630
 all grains is used as a binder 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.009
 in these same houses and buildings 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.180
 in short corn is used a little bit 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.080
 everywhere is not just to feed 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.540
 hens there were evenings 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.900
 if I do not tell you this makes you think of 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.070
 what cinema is easy in fact one 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.170
 could think that popcorn was 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.720
 invented by the Ricans with the cinema 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.100
 both seem so linked and 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.720
 yet popcorn was invented by 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.030
 Amerindian peoples of the millennium 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.320
 before Christ christ popcorn or corn 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.690
 blown one since this is his 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.090
 shelter according to their superstitions of 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.400
 kind spirits and not to them 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.660
 to anger you had to eat them 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.370
 it looks like a dubious joke 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.480
 and yet not the Native Americans believe 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.670
 really that there were spirits 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.870
 of the order the doctor was not 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.670
 rediscovered that millennia more 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.540
 late by the Americans then for them 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.890
 the spirits and all that bullshit 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.880
 so much to say it right away 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.830
 tape and balls but a force 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.270
 unimaginable 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.370
 it must hurt he loved it so much 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.830
 popcorn and put on leave by blow 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.840
 ci funfair sporting events 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.240
 political meeting everywhere except at 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.800
 theater and cinema the cinema that was 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.180
 very young at that moment trying to 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.890
 to look like the theater from which he came 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.900
 is to be a rich thing reserved for 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.090
 high society people and popcorn 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.770
 in all that bah it was beautiful end 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.250
 so out of the question to sell this 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.070
 muck 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.690
 it's a shame now maybe 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.010
 decades later cinemas grow up 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.510
 a little bit and realized 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.550
 that there was still a lot 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.320
 tricasse yesterday on the October so he 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.730
 will eventually sell it all over it says 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.590
 even though today the world leader in 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.180
 pop corn are the united states france 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.370
 she has the luxury of being the leader 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.330
 European with our producers located 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.190
 here and here 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.720
 having united of fate exports even 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.580
 country of uncle sam 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.990
 to get back to the corn it was 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.650
 discovered by christophe colomb at the same 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.880
 time as america 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.140
 he thought then that it was a 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.030
 new species of pruned wheat 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.620
 gigantic since especially the seedlings 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.930
 maize grown in mexico could 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.280
 reach nearly 10 feet tall either 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.810
 almost four-story building when 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.310
 even huh is that dear that we thought 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.990
 have discovered indes instead of 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.070
 America he was calling stupidly the 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.210
 corn corn 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.680
 that's the way it's going on 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.150
 to call him in quebec but before 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.870
 the arrival of the Europeans to conquer 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.550
 the new World 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.930
 maize had already been grown for 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.310
 millennia by the Amerindians and 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.960
 especially the Mayans a brilliant 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.790
 civilization that had lived on the current 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.380
 mexico with its pyramids are 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.850
 advanced astronomy and in particular its 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.000
 famous calendar predicting the end of 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.620

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.900

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.730

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.800

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.780
 of high society 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.730
 aristocrats to differentiate themselves from 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.770
 rest of the hrw people rang the heads of 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.030
 neonates shaped lépine corn thanks to 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.560
 wooden boards that they tied 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.880

 religious to fight against 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.769

 was a doctor in a care center he 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.000
 was looking for a nourishing product but 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.320
 bland for his patients he thought in 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.850
 effect that if what we ate had 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.430
 not where it would prevent our impulses 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.090

 a hard and crispy hard dough 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.110
 he gave the situation with milk and 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.250
 it was a huge success and then both 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.990
 brothers in place is rare it is quickly the 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.620
 wheat corn since it worked better 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.970
 so the cornflakes and elders he 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.620
 then commercialized complex in 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.419
 all america and run away a max of 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.639
 thune irony of history and end up 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.560
 iced with complex sugars like these 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.690
 so that it is more taste and so that 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.699
 his second night at the technical side 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.199
 a mesh transforms corn into flour 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.000
 and that's where we make 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.530

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.790
 the basic diet of the Mayans and on 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.139
 the land of their ancestors the mexicans 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.490
 continue to cultivate piles of 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.990
 different varieties of corn
