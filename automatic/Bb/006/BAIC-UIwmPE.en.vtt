00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
okay so this is my my implementation of

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.990 
okay so this is my my implementation of
liquid<00:00:27.789> wars<00:00:28.950> because<00:00:29.950> currently<00:00:30.759> see<00:00:30.910> the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
liquid wars because currently see the

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.780 
liquid wars because currently see the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
text but I've got a mini screen here

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.240 
text but I've got a mini screen here
saying<00:00:34.090> press<00:00:34.360> home<00:00:34.600> to<00:00:34.930> quit<00:00:35.170> home<00:00:35.620> to<00:00:36.129> home

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
saying press home to quit home to home

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.910 
saying press home to quit home to home
brew<00:00:36.400> tell<00:00:36.640> press<00:00:37.360> a<00:00:37.540> to<00:00:37.570> start<00:00:37.930> game<00:00:38.170> once

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
brew tell press a to start game once

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.890 
brew tell press a to start game once
I've<00:00:39.010> got<00:00:39.190> some<00:00:39.370> settings<00:00:39.850> for<00:00:40.449> my<00:00:40.600> attack

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
I've got some settings for my attack

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.900 
I've got some settings for my attack
defense<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:41.650> my<00:00:41.769> map<00:00:42.269> so<00:00:43.269> i<00:00:43.720> can<00:00:44.170> select

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
defense and my map so i can select

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.390 
defense and my map so i can select
attack<00:00:45.910> and<00:00:46.360> change<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.839> value<00:00:47.080> of<00:00:47.170> that<00:00:47.400> will

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
attack and change the value of that will

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.100 
attack and change the value of that will
the<00:00:48.489> defense<00:00:48.879> change<00:00:49.239> value<00:00:49.570> and<00:00:49.780> I've<00:00:49.930> got

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
the defense change value and I've got

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.590 
the defense change value and I've got
two<00:00:50.500> maps<00:00:50.800> programmed<00:00:51.519> in<00:00:51.670> at<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.879> moment<00:00:51.970> and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
two maps programmed in at the moment and

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.920 
two maps programmed in at the moment and
we're<00:00:53.140> both<00:00:53.260> hard-coded<00:00:54.039> but<00:00:54.760> I'm<00:00:55.329> going<00:00:55.870> to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
we're both hard-coded but I'm going to

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.830 
we're both hard-coded but I'm going to
change<00:00:56.260> how<00:00:56.710> I'm<00:00:56.829> doing<00:00:57.100> that<00:00:57.250> so<00:00:57.460> i<00:00:57.489> can<00:00:57.879> say

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
change how I'm doing that so i can say

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.590 
change how I'm doing that so i can say
the<00:00:58.870> PNG<00:00:59.559> file<00:00:59.800> and<00:01:00.129> use<00:01:01.000> that<00:01:01.090> to<00:01:01.239> generate

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
the PNG file and use that to generate

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.070 
the PNG file and use that to generate
the<00:01:01.719> map<00:01:01.899> so<00:01:02.770> if<00:01:02.829> i<00:01:02.920> select<00:01:03.129> map<00:01:03.520> to<00:01:04.000> an<00:01:04.629> attack

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
the map so if i select map to an attack

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.120 
the map so if i select map to an attack
of<00:01:05.350> five<00:01:05.940> so<00:01:06.940> arbitrary<00:01:07.330> values<00:01:07.630> hit<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.590> and

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
of five so arbitrary values hit a and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.270 
of five so arbitrary values hit a and
the<00:01:10.090> game<00:01:10.270> starts<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.770> just<00:01:11.920> a<00:01:12.009> prototype

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
the game starts it's just a prototype

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.770 
the game starts it's just a prototype
map<00:01:13.200> took<00:01:14.200> about<00:01:14.940> 22<00:01:15.940> minutes<00:01:16.149> to<00:01:16.270> generate

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
map took about 22 minutes to generate

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.050 
map took about 22 minutes to generate
and<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:19.929> gaps<00:01:20.350> in<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.619> walls<00:01:21.060> but

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
and so the gaps in the walls but

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.090 
and so the gaps in the walls but
hopefully<00:01:22.630> you<00:01:22.690> can<00:01:22.869> see<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:26.409> fighters<00:01:26.979> are

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
hopefully you can see the fighters are

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:36.920 
hopefully you can see the fighters are
quite<00:01:27.340> aggressive<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:32.490> wii<00:01:33.509> AI<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:35.590> a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
quite aggressive the wii AI is a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.730 
quite aggressive the wii AI is a
completely<00:01:37.930> random<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:42.310> ya<00:01:42.400> hopefully

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
completely random see ya hopefully

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.690 
completely random see ya hopefully
there's<00:01:44.740> other<00:01:44.920> stuff<00:01:45.130> as<00:01:45.189> well<00:01:45.280> if<00:01:45.490> i<00:01:45.579> hit

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
there's other stuff as well if i hit

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.810 
there's other stuff as well if i hit
home<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.840> gets<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.170> paused<00:01:47.439> so<00:01:47.770> i<00:01:47.890> can<00:01:48.189> return

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
home it gets to paused so i can return

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.520 
home it gets to paused so i can return
home<00:01:49.090> we<00:01:49.240> shall<00:01:49.420> go<00:01:49.689> to<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.899> game<00:01:50.049> or<00:01:50.200> go<00:01:50.320> back

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
home we shall go to the game or go back

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.859 
home we shall go to the game or go back
