and they might have some mechanical

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.010 
and they might have some mechanical
skills<00:00:45.790> but<00:00:45.940> they<00:00:46.030> have<00:00:46.149> difficulty<00:00:46.600> planning

for example a pipe fitting or you take a
mechanical<00:00:50.260> person<00:00:50.410> and<00:00:50.710> you<00:00:50.770> ask<00:00:50.950> them<00:00:51.100> to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
mechanical person and you ask them to

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.100 
mechanical person and you ask them to
plan<00:00:51.370> for<00:00:51.730> electrical<00:00:52.329> and<00:00:52.570> they<00:00:52.780> struggle

addition to they did be skilled in that

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.240 
addition to they did be skilled in that
craft<00:00:58.300> meaning<00:00:59.200> they<00:00:59.590> need<00:00:59.770> to<00:00:59.890> understand

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
craft meaning they need to understand

craft meaning they need to understand
the<00:01:00.370> task<00:01:00.610> steps<00:01:00.940> and<00:01:01.180> how<00:01:01.270> they<00:01:01.480> would

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
the task steps and how they would

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.630 
the task steps and how they would
approach<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:02.079> job<00:01:02.260> remember<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.309> goal<00:01:03.489> of

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
approach the job remember the goal of

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.580 
approach the job remember the goal of
the<00:01:03.700> planner<00:01:03.940> scheduler<00:01:04.509> is<00:01:04.719> to<00:01:05.079> drive<00:01:05.289> wrench

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
the planner scheduler is to drive wrench

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.859 
the planner scheduler is to drive wrench
time<00:01:05.859> or<00:01:06.069> the<00:01:06.369> increased<00:01:06.789> craft<00:01:07.240> efficiency

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
time or the increased craft efficiency

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.410 
time or the increased craft efficiency
and<00:01:08.819> obviously<00:01:09.819> they'll<00:01:09.999> be<00:01:10.119> working

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
and obviously they'll be working

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.849 
and obviously they'll be working
independently<00:01:10.539> many<00:01:11.319> times<00:01:11.590> they'll<00:01:11.829> be

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:11.859 
independently many times they'll be

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:13.499 
independently many times they'll be
going<00:01:12.069> out<00:01:12.280> researching<00:01:12.700> jobs<00:01:13.030> on<00:01:13.240> their<00:01:13.329> own

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
going out researching jobs on their own

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.539 
going out researching jobs on their own
so<00:01:14.109> they<00:01:14.229> need<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.409> be<00:01:14.469> a<00:01:14.530> self-starter<00:01:15.189> be

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
so they need to be a self-starter be

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.029 
so they need to be a self-starter be
motivated<00:01:16.119> in<00:01:16.509> addition<00:01:17.139> to<00:01:17.229> that<00:01:17.350> they<00:01:17.709> need

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
motivated in addition to that they need

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.739 
motivated in addition to that they need
to<00:01:18.100> get<00:01:18.189> computer<00:01:18.639> skills<00:01:18.880> if<00:01:19.479> you<00:01:19.569> think

of skill regarding the software package
itself<00:01:39.549> how<00:01:40.209> do<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:40.420> create<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.779> job<00:01:40.990> plans

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
itself how do you create the job plans

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.690 
itself how do you create the job plans
how<00:01:41.529> do<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:41.709> schedule<00:01:41.979> how<00:01:42.279> do<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.490> create

how do you schedule how do you create

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.690 
how do you schedule how do you create
the<00:01:42.880> PM<00:01:43.179> tasks<00:01:43.479> as<00:01:43.719> an<00:01:43.869> example<00:01:44.139> and<00:01:44.700> then

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
the PM tasks as an example and then

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.879 
the PM tasks as an example and then
they're<00:01:46.240> also<00:01:46.389> your<00:01:46.659> primary<00:01:47.259> communication

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
they're also your primary communication

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:50.399 
they're also your primary communication
point<00:01:48.099> for<00:01:48.759> nonemergency<00:01:48.969> work<00:01:49.689> for<00:01:50.169> playing
