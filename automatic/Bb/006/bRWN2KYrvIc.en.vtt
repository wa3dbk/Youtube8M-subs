00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220

 grabs 23 men for for the challenge 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.139
 Today I wanted to talk to you about the topic 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.300
 speak sport in the morning or in the evening 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.510
 I am an absolute tomorrow I have to 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.830
 I'm getting up early so me 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.359
 find the night can be in the local 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.859
 night work very well too 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.170
 I have no problem with it for long 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.810
 stay up but just now really 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.390
 early in the morning even if a uni 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.440
 Early on, she really does bother if god 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.030
 That's why I sometimes tell her 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.340
 In the evening I did sport 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.200
 actually always very pleasant way 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.090
 the uni after a long day 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.809
 properly expand so that you are beautiful too 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.550
 is tired 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.050
 yes and now I have too 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.329
 because I'm one for the marathon 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.520
 get up early because we 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.100
 from time to time have common running meetings 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 how are you going for my marathon preparation? 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.320
 you will each also at 10 so 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.320
 subscribe to the channel 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.840
 Well, I have to say 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.869
 that I always feel extremely proud afterwards 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.860
 I am that I tormented myself out of there 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.900
 have in this to these unchristian 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.950
 time and still during the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.009
 Holidays yes and I actually tell us 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.369
 that I am better now 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.200
 nice and pleasant find in the morning 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.299
 to do sport than in the evening and me 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.790
 I also realized that I was in the morning 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.590
 I am much more capable 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.130
 will eat anything from simple sport 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:43.500
 be as fast as bad pass 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.829
 and then I can fully lock everything 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.450
 just do not eat a lot and do not eat 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.180
 yes that's just in the morning then easy 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.189
 easier on an empty stomach too 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.049
 train for me now 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.020
 For example, in the evening, if I always stop 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.390
 also eat relatively late and then you are 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.040
 yourself 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.420
 so now for an hour nothing 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.979
 and then another hour and then it will be 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.780
 later and later somehow you lose 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.409
 Again the motivation is the day too 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.420
 already over again 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.770
 so I do not mouth too dry 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.630
 I got drink in the morning 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.040
 then a glass of water will go too 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.400
 I do not have the toilet with it then 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.860
 somehow on the way the intimus and then 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.500
 I can do well an hour 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.820
 a little over an hour to run and 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.380
 It's the same in the evening 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.290
 somehow after half an hour 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.330
 oh think god i do not like anymore and 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.150
 maybe somehow to 45 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.750
 minutes, but in the morning 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.190
 it is also an hour and then yes 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.290
 something would actually happen now 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.150
 but then I do not want to 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.830
 Exaggerate but I also notice like me 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.320
 always raise myself slowly and always 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.739
 more so my endurance also better 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.239
 become 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.900
 I must also say that I am 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.070
 At the beginning of the vegan was extremely tired 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.700
 so i was really i had that 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.930
 can sleep all day 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.330
 meanwhile, it is actually that way 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.950
 I am well thus I also 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.840
 can get up earlier that is still 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.250
 not it's still not like that 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.410
 I now happily out of bed out 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.579
 fly and carried in my sports gear 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.010
 of course this is still a 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.769
 but with every time I overcome that 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.930
 it will make it better and many 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.510
 studies just say the morning sport 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.239
 is more effective than the sport in the evening 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.250
 but for those who are not keen 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.049
 finally recommend on empty stomach 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.739
 So things look like a banana banana 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.660
 is a great breakfast shape and sport 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.820
 After that, there are all sorts of things anyway 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.060
 great dishes from the attilas I have then 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.840
 quite like the apple cinnamon or just 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.380
 Amaranth pop with fresh fruits 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.200
 or a shake shake shake too 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.590
 great to take on the uni da that 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.150
 then goes very fast 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.730
 I can drink that in the upper one 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.069
 and that is all very easy and 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.420
 my personal tips so far 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.790
 now helped with the 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.120
 get up early even if 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.420
 as was the motivation not so because 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.670
 Firstly, the alarm clock is quite whole 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.650
 make very, very far from the bed on 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.629
 so you do not even the snooze button 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.730
 can press and best then too 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.959
 Not exactly two alarms that one once 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.750
 get up then go back to bed 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.060
 but just this one alarm and then 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.650
 really nice on the bed outside 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.660
 be quick to wash your face and 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.100
 just really out of the 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.160
 Flat quickly put on all already 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.740
 prepare the day before to wear it 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.710
 must go out and that is the best for me 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.290
 solution and no that's not the bad ones 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.270
 best solution is having someone with you 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.070
 a friend of a friend something too 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.139
 agree and then meet 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.970
 you can not keep the person waiting 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.770
 what that does not work is the same as 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.810
 you did not miss a flight at four 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.340
 in the morning or you would be 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.289
 also feel very bad because then 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.160
 somehow the friend the woman 17 or 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.139
 standing in front of the door 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.220
 he himself still has the blanket over 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.470
 pulled his head 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.030
 So these are my two top tips 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.229
 works for me but i would 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.850
 Of course, I am very happy if you 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.539
 me even more of your tips 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.770
 betray 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.360
 this is you already have 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.910
 noticed that you from the night owl in 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.039
 the will to tag people did prefer 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.500
 Sports in the morning or where are for 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.550
 you yes the pros and cons if it is in 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.770
 who pretends how can you 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.300
 motivate how do you stand it ? 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.530

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.780
