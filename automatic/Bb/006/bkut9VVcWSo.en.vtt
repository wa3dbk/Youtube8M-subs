00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.259 
reach some kind of unclear position and
I<00:02:27.239> think<00:02:27.630> he<00:02:27.750> found<00:02:28.280> correct<00:02:29.280> defense<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.940> of

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
I think he found correct defense and of

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.890 
I think he found correct defense and of
course<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.720> game<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.230> still<00:02:32.069> don't<00:02:32.280> know<00:02:32.370> where

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
course the game I still don't know where

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.870 
course the game I still don't know where
who<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.019> better<00:02:34.290> or<00:02:34.590> who<00:02:34.769> where<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.340> went<00:02:35.670> wrong

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
who is better or who where I went wrong

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.089 
who is better or who where I went wrong
or<00:02:36.360> something<00:02:36.989> because<00:02:37.349> it's<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:37.860> difficult

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
or something because it's so difficult

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.420 
or something because it's so difficult
to<00:02:38.430> calculate<00:02:38.640> all<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.269> lines<00:02:39.980> but<00:02:40.980> at<00:02:41.310> a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
to calculate all the lines but at a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.759 
to calculate all the lines but at a
certain<00:02:41.459> moment<00:02:41.849> it<00:02:42.480> did<00:02:42.840> turn<00:02:43.049> out<00:02:43.230> very<00:02:43.290> well

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
certain moment it did turn out very well

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.020 
certain moment it did turn out very well
for<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.280> Maxine<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.560> was<00:02:46.560> there<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.769> moment

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
for you Maxine so was there a moment

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.490 
for you Maxine so was there a moment
where<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.180> messed<00:02:48.420> up<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.260> identify

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
where you messed up can you identify

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.979 
where you messed up can you identify
that<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:50.250> one<00:02:50.430> moment<00:02:50.609> yeah<00:02:51.600> it's<00:02:51.780> very

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
that just one moment yeah it's very

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.020 
that just one moment yeah it's very
simple<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.470> one<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.890> change<00:02:53.340> Queens<00:02:53.609> I<00:02:53.819> mean

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
simple it's one I a change Queens I mean

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.660 
simple it's one I a change Queens I mean
I'm<00:02:54.690> probably<00:02:55.319> still<00:02:55.560> better<00:02:55.950> after<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.459> but

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
I'm probably still better after this but

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.720 
I'm probably still better after this but
the<00:02:56.910> task<00:02:57.180> becomes<00:02:57.950> absolutely<00:02:58.950> daunting<00:02:59.459> to

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
the task becomes absolutely daunting to

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.319 
the task becomes absolutely daunting to
to<00:03:00.420> win<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.489> I<00:03:02.489> still<00:03:02.670> don't<00:03:03.060> know<00:03:03.090> why<00:03:03.269> I

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
to win it and I still don't know why I

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.479 
to win it and I still don't know why I
mean<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:03.989> only<00:03:04.140> blame<00:03:04.470> exhaustion<00:03:04.920> from

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
mean I can only blame exhaustion from

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.280 
mean I can only blame exhaustion from
calculating<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:06.420> many<00:03:06.569> lines<00:03:06.810> during<00:03:07.079> the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
calculating so many lines during the

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.640 
calculating so many lines during the
game<00:03:07.440> because<00:03:07.859> of<00:03:08.459> course<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.209> wanted<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.750> to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
game because of course I wanted to to

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.030 
game because of course I wanted to to
keep<00:03:10.859> Queens<00:03:11.209> but<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.840> don't<00:03:13.410> know<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.530> stop<00:03:13.799> god

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
keep Queens but I don't know I stop god

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.479
