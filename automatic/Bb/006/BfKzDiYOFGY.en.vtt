00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
most excited for our by far the new

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.959 
most excited for our by far the new
features<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:49.649> basically<00:00:50.129> these<00:00:50.489> are<00:00:50.550> going

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
features now basically these are going

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.910

to<00:00:51.120> make<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.510> update<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.050> adventure<00:00:52.559> update

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
to make the update the adventure update

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.580 
to make the update the adventure update
so<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.550> example<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.120> NBC<00:00:54.570> villages<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
so for example the NBC villages and the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.979 
so for example the NBC villages and the
ground<00:00:55.829> remains<00:00:55.980> strong<00:00:56.850> holds<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.629> kind<00:00:57.930> of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
ground remains strong holds that kind of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.200 
ground remains strong holds that kind of
stuff<00:00:58.230> no<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:59.039> not<00:00:59.280> sure<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.760> will<00:00:59.879> have<00:01:00.059> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
stuff no I'm not sure that will have to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.119 
stuff no I'm not sure that will have to
create<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.539> whole<00:01:00.870> new<00:01:00.899> world<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.920> these

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
create a whole new world to get these

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.250 
create a whole new world to get these
features<00:01:02.730> other<00:01:03.000> people<00:01:03.510> think<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.140> new

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
features other people think that the new

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.960 
features other people think that the new
features<00:01:04.530> will<00:01:04.890> automatically<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.790> their

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
features will automatically be in their

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.270 
features will automatically be in their
world<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.130> be

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
world but I think that is going to be

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.609 
world but I think that is going to be
the<00:01:08.400> same<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.820> lapis<00:01:09.240> lazuli<00:01:09.360> blocks<00:01:09.960> that

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the same as the lapis lazuli blocks that

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.109

going to bring a whole lot of new
features<00:03:21.209> such<00:03:21.750> as<00:03:21.780> hitting<00:03:22.260> mops<00:03:22.560> who<00:03:22.739> are

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
features such as hitting mops who are

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.039 
features such as hitting mops who are
rushing<00:03:23.310> will<00:03:23.459> push<00:03:23.730> them<00:03:23.940> back<00:03:24.150> which<00:03:24.720> again

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
rushing will push them back which again

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.930 
rushing will push them back which again
is<00:03:25.109> going<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.650> add<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:25.829> bit<00:03:26.130> more<00:03:26.160> variety<00:03:26.549> in

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
the game now this probably means that

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.770 
the game now this probably means that
the<00:03:29.310> longer<00:03:29.579> you<00:03:29.670> sprint<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.299> lower<00:03:30.480> your

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
the longer you sprint the lower your

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.699 
the longer you sprint the lower your
food<00:03:31.019> bar<00:03:31.230> goes<00:03:32.870> sadly<00:03:33.870> enough<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.230> didn't<00:03:34.560> find

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
food bar goes sadly enough I didn't find

new combat mechanics in Minecraft
basically<00:03:48.780> at<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.019> moment<00:03:49.319> it's<00:03:49.470> kind<00:03:49.650> of

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
basically at the moment it's kind of

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.440 
basically at the moment it's kind of
boring<00:03:49.920> because<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.519> always<00:03:50.760> do<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.209> same

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
boring because you always do the same

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.080 
boring because you always do the same
damage<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.109> both<00:03:52.319> are<00:03:52.590> also<00:03:52.889> way<00:03:53.340> overpowered

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
damage and both are also way overpowered

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.449 
damage and both are also way overpowered

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
now the new mechanics are going to

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.280 
now the new mechanics are going to
include<00:03:56.670> critical<00:03:57.060> hit<00:03:57.450> so<00:03:57.660> you'll<00:03:57.810> never<00:03:58.049> hit

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
include critical hit so you'll never hit

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.740
