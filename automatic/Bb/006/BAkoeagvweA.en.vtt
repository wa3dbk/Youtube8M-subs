when<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.130> think<00:00:14.429> about<00:00:14.519> sheet<00:00:15.000> metal<00:00:15.330> I'm

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
when I think about sheet metal I'm

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.439 
when I think about sheet metal I'm
thinking<00:00:16.379> about<00:00:16.680> something<00:00:17.039> like<00:00:17.220> 25<00:00:18.119> gauge

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
thinking about something like 25 gauge

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.340 
thinking about something like 25 gauge
20<00:00:19.230> gauge<00:00:19.470> 18<00:00:20.220> gauge<00:00:20.930> something<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.109> has

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
20 gauge 18 gauge something that has

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.570 
20 gauge 18 gauge something that has
some<00:00:22.740> flex<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.310> it

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.099 

this<00:00:26.269> is<00:00:26.480> 3/16<00:00:27.289> inch<00:00:27.500> plate<00:00:28.160> steel<00:00:29.109> the

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
this is 3/16 inch plate steel the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.010 
this is 3/16 inch plate steel the
dividing<00:00:30.650> line<00:00:30.859> between<00:00:30.910> plate<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.180> sheet<00:00:32.780> is

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
dividing line between plate and sheet is

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.139 
dividing line between plate and sheet is
set<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:33.739> 3/16<00:00:34.550> inch<00:00:34.699> mark<00:00:36.370> 3/16<00:00:37.370> inch<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.790> up

set to 3/16 inch mark 3/16 inch and up

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.140 
set to 3/16 inch mark 3/16 inch and up
is<00:00:38.360> plate<00:00:39.399> 11<00:00:40.399> 64th<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:41.360> below<00:00:41.720> is<00:00:41.960> sheet<00:00:43.150> and

is plate 11 64th and below is sheet and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.210 
is plate 11 64th and below is sheet and
generally<00:00:44.629> when<00:00:44.780> I<00:00:44.839> think<00:00:45.230> about<00:00:45.320> sheet<00:00:45.860> metal

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
generally when I think about sheet metal

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.399 
generally when I think about sheet metal
and<00:00:46.430> what<00:00:46.730> I'm<00:00:46.820> doing<00:00:47.059> a<00:00:47.180> video<00:00:47.409> particularly

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
and what I'm doing a video particularly

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.410 
and what I'm doing a video particularly
in<00:00:48.470> this<00:00:48.530> case<00:00:48.769> like<00:00:49.040> cutting<00:00:49.430> sheet<00:00:50.059> metal

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
in this case like cutting sheet metal

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.710 
in this case like cutting sheet metal
I'm<00:00:51.350> talking<00:00:51.800> about<00:00:52.129> much<00:00:52.730> thinner<00:00:53.120> material

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
I'm talking about much thinner material

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.180 
I'm talking about much thinner material
such<00:00:54.409> as<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.680> 25<00:00:55.220> gauge<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:56.210> 20<00:00:56.659> gauge<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:57.649> 18

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
such as the 25 gauge the 20 gauge the 18

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.229 
such as the 25 gauge the 20 gauge the 18
gauge<00:01:00.039> for<00:01:01.039> measuring<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.550> thickness<00:01:01.969> of

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
gauge for measuring the thickness of

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.639 
gauge for measuring the thickness of
either<00:01:02.840> sheet<00:01:03.230> metal<00:01:03.559> or<00:01:03.940> plate<00:01:04.940> steel<00:01:05.330> I<00:01:05.690> use

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
either sheet metal or plate steel I use

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.180 
either sheet metal or plate steel I use
this<00:01:06.950> gauge<00:01:08.140> you<00:01:09.140> can<00:01:09.289> find<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.679> gauge<00:01:09.890> like

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
this gauge you can find a gauge like

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.680 
this gauge you can find a gauge like
this<00:01:10.490> if<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:11.270> do<00:01:11.539> a<00:01:11.780> search<00:01:12.350> for<00:01:13.090> gauge<00:01:14.090> for

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
this if you do a search for gauge for

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:22.150 
this if you do a search for gauge for
sheet<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.200> plate<00:01:15.979> iron<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.610> steel<00:01:20.979> here<00:01:21.979> are

some<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.429> the<00:01:22.490> hand<00:01:22.729> shears<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.300> use<00:01:23.570> for

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
some of the hand shears I use for

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.100 
some of the hand shears I use for
cutting<00:01:24.020> sheet<00:01:24.619> metal<00:01:25.450> this<00:01:26.450> gray<00:01:26.720> pair<00:01:26.990> on

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
the left these are rather old school but

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.790 
the left these are rather old school but
because<00:01:31.130> they<00:01:31.280> have<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.729> longer<00:01:32.060> handle<00:01:32.300> and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
because they have a longer handle and

the compounding of leverage enables the
cutting<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:05.899> heavier<00:02:06.470> sheet<00:02:06.860> metal<00:02:07.220> and

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
cutting of heavier sheet metal and

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.170 
cutting of heavier sheet metal and
incidentally<00:02:09.649> these<00:02:10.369> are<00:02:10.729> all<00:02:10.940> with<00:02:11.450> shears

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
incidentally these are all with shears

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.790 
incidentally these are all with shears
now<00:02:14.180> there<00:02:14.360> are<00:02:14.480> several<00:02:14.750> other<00:02:14.989> good<00:02:15.319> brands

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
now there are several other good brands

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.070 
now there are several other good brands
but<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.400> prefer<00:02:16.819> with<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:20.629> mention<00:02:20.930> top

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
but I prefer with the mention top

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.199 
but I prefer with the mention top
cutters<00:02:21.500> can<00:02:21.709> be<00:02:21.830> used<00:02:22.069> for<00:02:22.340> cutting<00:02:22.940> sheet

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209

metal<00:02:23.540> let's<00:02:24.470> say<00:02:24.709> 20<00:02:25.160> gauge<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.780> also<00:02:26.780> for

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
metal let's say 20 gauge and also for

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.610 
metal let's say 20 gauge and also for
heavier<00:02:28.040> materials

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
heavier materials

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.410 
heavier materials
now<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:30.800> five-inch<00:02:31.310> here<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:31.910> somewhat

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
now this five-inch here is somewhat

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.380 
now this five-inch here is somewhat
limited<00:02:32.870> in<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.319> length<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.920> cut

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.420 

the<00:02:36.930> 12-inch<00:02:37.350> here<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.950> other<00:02:38.100> hand

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
the 12-inch here on the other hand

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.990 
the 12-inch here on the other hand
allows<00:02:38.970> for<00:02:39.300> longer<00:02:39.480> cuts<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.260> also<00:02:41.220> for<00:02:41.910> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
allows for longer cuts and also for the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.890 
allows for longer cuts and also for the
cutting<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.450> heavier<00:02:42.990> material<00:02:44.600> if<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.720> was

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
cutting of heavier material if I was

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.710 
cutting of heavier material if I was
looking<00:02:46.050> for<00:02:46.440> an<00:02:46.650> all-around<00:02:47.250> shear<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:48.030> would

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
looking for an all-around shear I would

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.050 
looking for an all-around shear I would
definitely<00:02:49.200> consider<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:50.130> 12-inch<00:02:50.670> shear

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
definitely consider this 12-inch shear

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.100 
definitely consider this 12-inch shear
from<00:02:51.390> grizzly<00:02:52.080> industrial<00:02:53.480> it's<00:02:54.480> reasonably
