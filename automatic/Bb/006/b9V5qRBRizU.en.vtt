00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 how much is how much ruthlessness 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.960
 empathy and cynicism we will see silk 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.889
 hint that I am 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.019
 potentially generally born with the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.980
 son in law, you want to marry the daughter 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.900
 I think we have to respond to it 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.090
 comedy a bit like making jazz and second 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.189
 me how much rhythm counts in comedy 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.680
 that's all because conception is enough 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.760
 fundamental right 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.679
 if you go see some old ones 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.350
 comedies of the 30s the actors 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.450
 corrifano like crazy and I a little bit 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.820
 this fixed sky I eat this 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.550
 words many times to have that rhythm 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.410
 there because in a joke inside with a 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.700
 according to a first one second after the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.960
 people don't laugh anymore so it's essential 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.489
 but clearly we need some 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.739
 actors who are ready to face e 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.880
 I must say that maximum lives in a game 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.940
 train 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.180
 the reference to the moody james day 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.210
 hello trust also blood however is that one 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.340
 girl like ilaria that clearly is 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.720
 fresh to this kind I saw it in 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.040
 a couple of movies and I saw that he has a 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.590
 great sense of humor and above all 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.930
 a great rhythm and then to have an ease 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.340
 also to make dialects in 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.240
 characterizations and this is 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.240
 fundamental 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.360
 I imitate him a little, that is, small 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.650
 I told you I used to make his jokes and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.290
 then he had a marvelous trio lopez 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.470
 solenghi I had the unbridled passion for 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.720
 anna marchesini and therefore I did not make myself 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.390
 account also I am from spectators precisely 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.770
 of this thing than everything as it says 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.100
 which is a second before a second 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.200
 after 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.270
 and this tendency to run every 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.310
 in fact they tell me so because it seems 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.710
 always losing to lose the moment 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.229
 of a healthy envy always in his 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.050
 comparisons because he does and says about 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.700
 things that if I say them, inquiries and not 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.190
 they have the same kind of look effect 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.369
 I'm not throwing myself away this isn't it 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.810
 but it is recognizing a thing from this 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.280
 point of view what you were saying 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.810
 that is, ours works first 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.860
 shamelessness because maybe not 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.410
 you would expect us to do or say 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.990
 we moved in certain situations that 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.910
 that we stunned an example 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.500
 for all and it remains more impressed than 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.720
 natal in beverly hills when we go out 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.910
 chained to the headboard of the bed 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.910
 but I cite it as an example because it is 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.980
 so china one of the absurd theater 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.600
 of the absurd own literary forge 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.959
 added that we were and jacket 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.540
 tie in underpants attached to this 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.610
 what and we continue to behave in 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.890
 this white house a nice situation 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.830
 lesson is that when he was under the train 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.530
 the usual takes them 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.540
 I mentioned sofia loren in society 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.540
 of my mother who throws herself into 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.030
 knee and screams the daughter's name 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.640
 the c series for frey ma was born for him 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.480
 in the sentence but that its numbers invite 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.870
 kneeling citing their own of this 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.150
 a foolish madness only at the thought 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.239
 of this thing under the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.940
 credibility crazy search in history 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.849
 that situation is over you don't know 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.650
 some condition here is this I believe 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.650
 it marked the height of provocation
