00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
put two hoops in so we did a hole here

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.410 
put two hoops in so we did a hole here
put<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> hoopin<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.490> did<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> hole<00:01:29.939> here<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.270> put

put a hoopin and did a hole here and put
a<00:01:30.450> hoopin<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.990> then<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.439> healed<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.799> I

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
a hoopin and then when it healed up I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.609 
a hoopin and then when it healed up I
put<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> bar<00:01:32.430> through<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:34.259> hurt<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
put the bar through this one it hurt a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.490 
put the bar through this one it hurt a
little<00:01:34.770> bit<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.369> not<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:36.350> wasn't<00:01:37.350> very

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
little bit but not really wasn't very

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.620 
little bit but not really wasn't very
bad<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.130> around<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.579> same<00:01:38.759> time<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.420> became

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
bad so around that same time I became

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.080 
bad so around that same time I became
really<00:01:39.930> fascinated<00:01:40.650> with<00:01:40.770> ear<00:01:40.979> stretching<00:01:41.340> so

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
really fascinated with ear stretching so

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.730 
really fascinated with ear stretching so
I<00:01:42.119> started<00:01:42.509> stretching<00:01:42.750> my<00:01:42.990> bottom<00:01:43.290> holes<00:01:43.530> out

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
I started stretching my bottom holes out

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.010 
I started stretching my bottom holes out
with<00:01:44.220> basically<00:01:44.909> whatever<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.240> could<00:01:45.299> find<00:01:45.600> I'd

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
with basically whatever I could find I'd

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.679 
with basically whatever I could find I'd
use<00:01:46.439> nails<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.250> found<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> house<00:01:47.880> I've

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
use nails that I found in the house I've

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.410 
use nails that I found in the house I've
used<00:01:49.110> pieces<00:01:49.619> from<00:01:49.860> board<00:01:50.159> games<00:01:50.460> lots<00:01:51.240> of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
used pieces from board games lots of

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.719 
used pieces from board games lots of
different<00:01:51.689> sizes<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.200> drinking<00:01:52.619> straws<00:01:52.950> again

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
different sizes of drinking straws again

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.249 
different sizes of drinking straws again
that's<00:01:53.970> probably<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.509> best<00:01:54.630> way<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.020> go

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that's probably not the best way to go

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.620 
that's probably not the best way to go
about<00:01:55.290> stretching<00:01:55.860> your<00:01:56.130> ears<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.700> tried<00:01:57.540> to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
about stretching your ears I tried to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.999 
about stretching your ears I tried to
clean<00:01:57.810> everything<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.290> best<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.560> could<00:01:58.619> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
clean everything the best I could and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:01:59.530 
clean everything the best I could and
stare

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
stare

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.940 
stare
everything<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.320> I<00:02:00.440> didn't<00:02:00.650> have<00:02:00.710> any

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
everything and I didn't have any

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.860 
everything and I didn't have any
problems<00:02:01.100> but<00:02:01.820> you're<00:02:02.270> probably<00:02:02.480> better<00:02:02.720> off

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
problems but you're probably better off

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.080 
problems but you're probably better off
not<00:02:03.530> doing<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:04.070> that<00:02:04.250> way<00:02:04.280> but<00:02:04.640> these<00:02:04.790> are<00:02:04.970> at<00:02:05.060> a

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
not doing it that way but these are at a

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.270 
not doing it that way but these are at a
four<00:02:05.390> gauge<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:06.020> stopped<00:02:06.410> at<00:02:06.590> four<00:02:06.860> because<00:02:07.250> I
