 it should be soup today 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.980
 because it has to heat again in moscow me 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.690
 Yesterday I was so the butt 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.379

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.000
 there is great for you today I have 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.109
 a very traditional soup for me 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.880
 chosen is threatened linsensuppe for 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.449
 those who would not come this recipe 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.720
 usually this will be great 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.239
 prepared with a carrot and I have 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.860
 but for paprika because I have the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.630
 taste of paprika like very much and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.300
 I think that's a very fresh one 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.489
 Variation is of course you are welcome 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.590
 city ​​paprika use a tube though 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.469
 If you use a paprika I would 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.090
 He suggests a yellow paprika 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.840
 do not use it with soup color 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.300
 is falsified 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.789
 I hope he stays tuned and looks at you 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.309
 my recipe to from a great 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.530
 lentil soup and see you next time 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.600
 your intuitive as today's recipe 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 the red lenses need a yellow one 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.320
 paprika potatoes 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.610
 you need a charlotte one 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.720
 garlic clove spices oil and water 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.270
 inflow you need some margarine 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.549
 and citric acid league is all about 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.320
 First of all, it's up to our peppers 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.270
 peel me around after a nice 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.490
 result to achieve since the shell 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.500
 not confidential is then cut 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.360
 I put the whole thing in small fine cubes 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.340
 I've got the peppers neat before 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.100
 washed because despite the lack should 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.720
 you definitely do yours with me 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.890
 paprika in small beautiful cubes 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.380
 have one cut now 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.840
 garlic clove on these facts we all 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.310
 small and if you small your garlic 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.320
 you have to chopped everything 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.240
 cut onion into small fine cubes 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.710
 Of course , you can also do that with you 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.840
 your potato you played before 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.990
 I do not do that here now 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.159
 I use salted potatoes from the day before 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.409
 Of course you can 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.049
 Also, this is easy to use 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.659
 with me now it's up to the lenses 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.380
 you have to be really neat with red lenses 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.860
 wash around 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.810
 to achieve a nice result and 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.060
 if necessary, pre- pollution 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.399
 to remove lenses 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.220
 After that I heat a little oil in 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.319
 a pot and there then mine 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.810
 douse and protect them 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.930
 for a few minutes until it turns golden yellow 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.880
 Then I give my peppers 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.250
 dice into it and mine too 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.080
 garlic the whole tip I also still 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.310
 A few minutes before I got the water 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.069
 to get into the water come to one 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.620
 lentils and my potatoes and that 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.840
 I cook whole potatoes on the potatoes 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.970
 Of course only if they are raw if they are 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.110
 if you take pre-cooked potatoes 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.620
 can you also to the conclusion to 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.799
 give 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.680
 the whole cooks up here for 30 minutes 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.500
 medium heat and over again 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.120
 you stir the whole thing down there the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.090
 Lens can settle and then 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.530
 can burn if that then 30 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.269
 has simmered for a few minutes and everything is beautiful 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.849
 she disintegrates like me the whole 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.340
 through a sieve because I think that way 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.609
 A nice result is getting lenses 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.650
 yes, as is well known legumes and the 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.140
 I just do not like peel 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.609
 enjoyable 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.350
 That's why I have the whole thing through 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.590
 but of course you can as well 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.810
 simply mix it up with a blender and mix 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.340
 the advantage would be that of course 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.470
 you just have a lot more great at the end 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.920
 because here is lost even one yet 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.569
 a little something and it is also a bit 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.819
 laboriously through a sieve 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.790
 press but I think in the end you have 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.680
 a really super creamy soups 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.170
 I had something in the first place 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.910
 salted but after I got that through her 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.160
 I have tasted it again 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.060
 now the taste is something 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.230
 falsified if all the whole 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.670
 floating particles are out of the soup 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.109
 to add color to the whole thing 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.050
 give it a little bit now 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.620
 margarine 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.120
 to mention a small loose pot 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.770
 if you do not have a joker kid on hand 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.880
 Of course you can also have one 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.680
 take small sticks 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.220
 I now give it dried in it 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.830
 into it and some paprika powder and that 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.380
 I'm just afraid of that 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.180
 serves the whole thing a little more 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.360
 to give taste and make the mint 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.670
 it is also fresher if the whole thing 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.959
 we have already foamed 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.850
 to do our super 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.070
 Here you see how great the color of the 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.800
 soup is she has such a curry yellow there 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.200
 I give a little bit more of mine now 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.120
 paprika powder and lemon juice 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.250
 I hope you have this recipe 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.050
 i liked your heart and i could 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.910
 heat your car for this dish 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.010
