which<00:05:00.740> was<00:05:00.919> a<00:05:00.949> side<00:05:01.370> blink<00:05:01.820> project<00:05:02.270> which

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
which was a side blink project which

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.689 
which was a side blink project which
really<00:05:02.539> got<00:05:03.139> me<00:05:03.289> started<00:05:03.560> on<00:05:03.860> drums<00:05:04.220> so<00:05:04.490> that's

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
really got me started on drums so that's

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:05.980 
really got me started on drums so that's
why<00:05:04.820> I<00:05:04.849> was<00:05:05.000> really<00:05:05.150> important<00:05:05.570> for<00:05:05.630> me<00:05:05.750> to<00:05:05.780> get

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
why I was really important for me to get

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.960 
why I was really important for me to get
this<00:05:06.139> one<00:05:06.199> because<00:05:07.190> I<00:05:07.430> pretty<00:05:07.639> much<00:05:07.729> learned

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
this one because I pretty much learned

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.670 
this one because I pretty much learned
that<00:05:08.180> whole<00:05:08.330> album<00:05:08.720> that<00:05:08.930> was<00:05:09.110> kind<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:09.560> the

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
that whole album that was kind of the

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.080 
that whole album that was kind of the
reason<00:05:09.949> I<00:05:10.039> started<00:05:10.250> drumming<00:05:10.610> in<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:10.880> first

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
reason I started drumming in the first

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.830 
reason I started drumming in the first
place<00:05:12.310> so<00:05:13.310> that's<00:05:13.849> pretty<00:05:14.150> much<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.449> leg<00:05:14.630> and

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
place so that's pretty much the leg and

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.070 
place so that's pretty much the leg and
then<00:05:14.979> on<00:05:15.979> this<00:05:16.310> side<00:05:16.370> I<00:05:16.880> got<00:05:17.210> this<00:05:17.419> a<00:05:17.449> while<00:05:17.720> ago

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
then on this side I got this a while ago

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.960 
then on this side I got this a while ago
around<00:05:18.590> the<00:05:18.830> time<00:05:18.860> I<00:05:19.039> was<00:05:19.190> getting<00:05:19.370> my<00:05:19.610> arms

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
around the time I was getting my arms

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.600 
around the time I was getting my arms
and<00:05:20.150> this<00:05:20.240> is<00:05:20.590> pretty<00:05:21.590> much<00:05:21.680> like<00:05:21.800> good

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
and this is pretty much like good

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.450 
and this is pretty much like good
defeating<00:05:23.090> evil<00:05:23.300> but<00:05:23.990> then<00:05:24.199> I'm<00:05:24.409> probably<00:05:25.010> on

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
defeating evil but then I'm probably on

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.850 
defeating evil but then I'm probably on
this<00:05:25.669> side<00:05:25.909> if<00:05:26.150> I<00:05:26.270> decide<00:05:26.659> to<00:05:26.690> go<00:05:27.409> more<00:05:27.620> on<00:05:27.680> this

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
this side if I decide to go more on this

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.370 
this side if I decide to go more on this
leg<00:05:28.070> have<00:05:28.849> like<00:05:29.090> an<00:05:29.240> opposite<00:05:29.780> like<00:05:30.020> maybe

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
leg have like an opposite like maybe

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.070 
leg have like an opposite like maybe
like<00:05:30.620> right<00:05:30.770> here<00:05:31.039> have<00:05:31.880> evil<00:05:32.449> defeating<00:05:32.900> good

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
like right here have evil defeating good

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.520 
like right here have evil defeating good
and<00:05:33.320> then<00:05:33.440> have<00:05:34.120> evil<00:05:35.120> and<00:05:35.300> good<00:05:35.510> maybe<00:05:36.080> like

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
and then have evil and good maybe like

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.830 
and then have evil and good maybe like
on<00:05:36.710> the<00:05:36.979> back<00:05:37.159> like<00:05:37.520> just<00:05:38.030> somehow<00:05:38.270> chillin

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
on the back like just somehow chillin

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.779 
on the back like just somehow chillin
together<00:05:39.110> and<00:05:39.349> getting<00:05:39.590> along<00:05:39.680> I<00:05:40.159> kind<00:05:40.760> of

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
together and getting along I kind of

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.210 
together and getting along I kind of
thought<00:05:40.909> that<00:05:40.970> was<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.210> good<00:05:41.360> idea<00:05:41.889> but<00:05:42.889> I<00:05:43.159> don't

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
thought that was a good idea but I don't

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.180 
thought that was a good idea but I don't
know<00:05:43.460> if<00:05:43.550> I'm<00:05:43.639> gonna<00:05:43.760> go<00:05:43.909> anymore<00:05:44.150> on<00:05:44.360> this<00:05:44.510> leg

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
know if I'm gonna go anymore on this leg

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.379 
know if I'm gonna go anymore on this leg
outside<00:05:46.190> of<00:05:46.460> that<00:05:46.580> I'm<00:05:46.849> pretty<00:05:47.120> sure<00:05:47.240> that

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
outside of that I'm pretty sure that

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
let me know but I'm pretty sure I

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.250 
let me know but I'm pretty sure I
covered<00:05:59.539> everything<00:05:59.750> but<00:05:59.960> I<00:05:59.990> was<00:06:00.050> getting<00:06:00.139> a

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260
