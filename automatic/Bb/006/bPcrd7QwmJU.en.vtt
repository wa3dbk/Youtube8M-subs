00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello friends and welcome 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.260
 here to the presentation of john deere 84 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.670
 00 to 74 00 unfortunately god or you anyway 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.540
 prescribed and chajnantor vasilis 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.199
 fasilis 31 and we'll take a look 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.539
 but until it is exactly amazon on 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.000
 first look really looks really cool 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.140
 so I am positively surprised and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.260
 palette fractions above all things too 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.090
 you have to have really nice sound 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.340
 Just say it is we have 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.559
 here at animation we have at all 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.360
 We are looking forward to some nice features 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.230
 Here, for example, we have the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.540
 possibility and I have to say honestly 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.090
 center back playing bad like 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.520
 So to a well- adjusted mirror 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.890
 there is nothing to complain about and we 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.930
 have here where it really what you have 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.290
 Of course, interior needs have 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.420
 technically, however, gives the most necessary class 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.670
 there is nothing over it nothing 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.620
 bad but still but you know 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.440
 could so that's not bad 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.750
 would or so ever since looks 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.420
 really cool from the inside of living there 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.130
 when I am quite good at everything 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.210
 really good for that too so much too 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.070
 that ever 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.229
 we look what you have for functions 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.910
 unfortunately god in his language makes 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.410
 but nothing like that will be fine now 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.630
 actually make of him as a politician 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.420
 then get forgotten when those are looking 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.490
 always ask friends and above all hire 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.710
 the round light also turns the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.890
 to be very very nice for example 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.860
 we have technical features here 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.420
 Quite little in the description 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.229
 engine even a little we have here 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.000
 with the note 5 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.590
 but get ahead with a few tricks 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.250
 work light behind anyway I have to 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.940
 to say honestly 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.800
 these were enough 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.990
 We view this make out anyway 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.610
 but this is all bad 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.290
 run it possible very briefly with 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.630
 that the 5 we have special 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.880
 functions begin the character and 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.010
 Embedding is very nicely done around 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.810
 with the sx we know from 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.300
 accordingly as it showed what 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.940
 want to look closely for the mirror 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.410
 reflect also this again 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.430
 everything switched on again 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.730
 Of course, friends otherwise just look easy 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.610
 we have definitely here 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.620
 in the text of the murder just as understand 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.960
 we photos this maybe a drawback 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.320
 at massive vasilis of skin kz or 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.540
 putting one's worth on text monster looks 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.580
 that's just how it is a bit 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.370
 pity that I really like, I 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.780
 now she does not know either ps now else 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.980
 something important 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.410
 the purchase price for 55,000 rock voices 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.030
 magnet that was so nice but - 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.670
 but be happy if you are a little bit more 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.800
 Worthing on description would be me 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.010
 personally now otherwise texture 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.050
 technically the tires could be up to you 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.840
 be better but the tractor looks real 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.370
 horny out and so butterfly texture is her 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.510
 a bit used used a bit 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.640
 so now can be bad on the spot 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.970
 really accurate at all 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.840
 an optical video mode different but with 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.220
 the whole with the descriptive text 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.739
 this little pity that pleases me 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.239
 Personally, so good on us now 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.650
 Let's see the runners that 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.239
 theme in any case that the lok 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.910
 clean hand it is already very nice 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.590
 yes in any case cool thing I know what 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.300
 I would like to mention the fact that 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.610
 the one directly to let that is you 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.400
 are allowed like myself Download 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.810
 try it out and rate it ourselves and we 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.940
 Hopefully see you next time 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.100
 again very angry why so short videos 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.140
 but I have to say it honestly 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.730
 yet can download the animals they 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.280
 Download it yourself 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.769
 us green only the first impression and 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.780
 the first upshot give so so 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.019
 thought already of physical friends and until 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.019
 soon
