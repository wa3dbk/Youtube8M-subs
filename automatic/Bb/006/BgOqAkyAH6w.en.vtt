00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.540
 while reappearing in theaters 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.400
 obscure the films in relief the thing is 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.219
 looks tonight on this technique well 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.420
 special 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.350
 today the trick is interested in 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.449
 relief images 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.580
 maybe you have already experienced these images 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.970
 spectacular that sometimes gives the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.289
 nausea 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.910
 know in any case that they are 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.920
 currently considered the future of the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.670
 cinema and so we need you some 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.199
 explanations 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.359
 first of all what is perception 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.920
 relief and then well it rests in 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.660
 much about our faculty to 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.420
 look at the world with two eyes and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.450
 rents an average of 65 mm if you 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.270
 look at the object with a sun then 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.090
 with each other you will find that he 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.829
 seems to have moved and when you 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.140
 will have both eyes these two images 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.239
 different are transmitted to the brain 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.520
 which superimposes them to restore 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.199
 distance and depth it's this 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.510
 neural process called vision 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.910
 stereoscopic film exploited by 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.289
 relief for doussain since the first 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.760
 stage is therefore to produce 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.500
 stereoscopic images 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.939
 ie to film the scene with two 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.430
 cameras one for each eye 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.409
 ideally his cameras to adjust from 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.180
 identical way will be placed as two 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.950
 eyes ie 65 thousand letters 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.560
 from each other it is not always 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.570
 easy the best is to use a camera 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.970
 stereoscopic that brings together two 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.770
 objectives in one housing that here 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.540
 we now have two 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.900
 close to our one scene for each 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.549
 eye 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.500
 but how to make sure that 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.720
 spectators only see the left rush 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.009
 with their eyes that red and the right 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.470
 with their eyes 3 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.420
 many existing processes first 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.180
 process the transformation of images 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.650
 stereoscopic anaglyph 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.759
 remember our video images are 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.960
 composed of complementary colors 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.729
 red green and blue the famous hervÃ© 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.010
 well we have kept left 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.990
 than the red component of the image and to 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.600
 right only the green components 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.979
 and blue then we overlapping the two 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.479
 sequences and we observe them at 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.700
 through glasses including glass 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.920
 left is a judge filter has the right to 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.030
 a filter 6 years go cyan is at the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.460
 sum of green and blue 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.560
 and here is the left eye only sees the 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.149
 red component of the scene captured by 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.130
 the left camera and the right eye 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.350
 conscious those who had been captured 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.980
 by the right camera the brain no longer 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.420
 to do his job 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.860
 obviously other colors 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.910
 complementary can be chosen 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.340
 for this process 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.730
 but in the era of digital image the rvb 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.950
 time to win second process the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.180
 polarized projection to simplify to 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.980
 the extreme know that the waves 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.800
 bright can be polarized 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.940
 that is, oriented in space 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.920
 so we're going this time 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.840
 use two projectors with 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.670
 polarizing filter the projector from 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.680
 left will project the film rush to 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.180
 left by polarizing it horizontally 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.269
 and the right projector 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.620
 the rush 3 polarized vertically we 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.110
 observe them through glasses 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.670
 polarizers whose left filter does not 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.190
 lets pass that horizontal waves 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.820
 and the right that waves up the 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.560
 you're done 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.810
 every eye sees only what it needs 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.730
 see you are the brain and new 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.709
 dishes done next third and 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.840
 even more at ithe projection 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.420
 alternate this time we project a 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.150
 picture of the left camera then one of the 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.930
 right camera then right bush books 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.820
 right left right right left 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.079
 left right why not glasses 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.090
 liquid crystal are then 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.670
 synchronize at this rate with 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.910
 light pulses 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.680
 their left and right glass clogs 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.360
 alternatively to fool our poor 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.890
 neurons current research 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.840
 relate to the possibilities of 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.640
 projection without the use of glasses 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.069
 the most effective is also the most 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.690
 simple the cross projection this time 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.310
 here we project our two sequences 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.500
 side by side but we place the 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.280
 sequence filmed right and left and 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.860
 reciprocally 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.840
 it only remains to squint for 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.700
 dislike this delicious sensation of 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.819
 relief and to train rich and without 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.130
 vomit for 90 minutes would have caught 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.590
 the relief images exploits the vision 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.810
 stereoscopic 3 projection method to 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.150
 glasses stands out the projection tana 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.250
 glyphs the polarized projection and the 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.750
 projection alternate projection without 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.850
 glasses is still under study 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.850
 See you soon for a new trick
