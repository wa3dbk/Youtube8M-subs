00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:22.380
 Percent meanwhile circulated 1 52 I think conversion target again at 9 70 

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:23.800

 have received the animal w-lan 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.110
 that's something your browser should enter 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.840
 but even if you want your musicians out, I want this music edition of this one 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.360

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.090

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.940
 this contained 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.120
 in the browser 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.120
 beforehand they do not do anything info 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.160
 what speaks for itself 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.510
 a rogue does not want to be prepared for those who know the countries 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.740
 more or less problems just have to leave fingers out it goes from the beginning 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.390

 The songs are now accessible via Wi-Fi on their own 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.180
 Witness the app to be opened or even stop background Wichmann tried 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.800

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:22.060
 to me 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.509
 an agency 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.509

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.459

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.749
 is yes 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.439
 inspired the house of the game the most 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.069
