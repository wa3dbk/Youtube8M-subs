in Grenoble at an altitude of 312 meters

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.440 
in Grenoble at an altitude of 312 meters
and<00:00:31.710> although<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.460> real<00:00:32.669> climbing<00:00:33.180> doesn't

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450

of<00:00:35.790> Grenoble<00:00:36.360> certainly<00:00:37.200> aren't<00:00:37.710> easy<00:00:47.809> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
of Grenoble certainly aren't easy the

with an elevation of 721 meters that

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.189 
with an elevation of 721 meters that
means<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.730> fair<00:00:57.030> bit<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.390> climbing<00:00:57.629> has<00:00:58.020> already

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
been done that's only gradual so we
