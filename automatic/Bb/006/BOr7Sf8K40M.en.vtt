 this video so here is so for 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.560
 the introduction what does it is that it 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.310
 gives it alternates between a ground 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.720
 and a back simply what is after he 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:52.170
 there is a second guitar in concert which 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.730
 done and that you can play 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.000
 all by itself what it takes to be able to 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.140
 make 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.510
 it's played on the ground and two wheels on the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.990
 third time on in lan barret on the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.990
 third party 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.979
 here and you enjoy doing this back 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.810
 on the third loan and then play 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.720
 the rope of the ground and the rope of the mir and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.190
 then again the ground rope and then 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.659
 after with your little finger you 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:30.990
 press the 5th fred of the agreement 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:33.110
 half and you play it here and the fact 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.110
 know 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.990
 the fourth time he just plays back 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.549
 and goes directly to crime so is 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.829
 Now I'll teach you 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.210
 cuts and so for couples and 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.250
 still a floor but there is no need 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.819
 to play it paris this time so that's 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.750
 1,2 concatenation of four chords 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.750
 the first is only c 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:02.020
 to reindeer 1-2 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.340
 and a liner gave you first 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.050
 sequence of four agreements then 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.099
 he takes again the a second sequence 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.170
 with whom also starts alone 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:17.739
 but this time live miners 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.780
 1 the migra and a stop here and that's 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.420
 his eight chords that picks up in everything 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.420
 cut like chantal and that name 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:44.440
 I leave it that of air and when 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:50.800
 you come to the end by the time he 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.510
 says you 're normally at a 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.220
 second in the order of the second 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.410
 chaining four agreements so 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.570
 after the minor you should make one to 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.070
 a minor but there you go 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.340
 directly would still not have the bed 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.540
 minor 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.120
 betty e mail and there he takes a floor 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.870
 just as it was again it's the 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.190
 same passage of the dice he will make 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.370
 frolics you the player parents bar and 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.370
 so 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:30.730
 millvina save my notes and only one 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:32.319
 seized and you learn him 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.750
 and you do it once and then 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.440
 directly from the second time 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.180
 you make the back and you go to 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.650
 passage where he sang an opera at 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.530
 on because this one is talking and we 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.450
 it has the agreements they have kim next 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.000
 it's exactly same sequence of 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.160
 eight chords from when he talks serious 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.090
 just the second the second 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.599
 agreement comes to you replace it with 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.599
 A psychologist 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:37.680
 here again we take a drink 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.490
 wii remake a dream so apple would have 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.960
 been insolent 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:51.479
 then closed a back and a floor in 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:53.550
 entrance a party or so and so then 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.169
 that he returns to the veil 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.400
 the assets that I showed you so 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.770
 that's all you need 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.240
 know to sing this song after 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.789
 what you can do if you have 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.990
 want a little bit of improvement 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.990
 when you play then 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:15.900
 the estates only has to the second 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:18.300
 times the 2nd sequence when he has 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.000
 you can with your little finger 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.000
 pressed on the 3rd freight half agreement 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:30.500
 that's no and then when you do 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.320
 when and his kidneys to death with your 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.760
 little finger on the third phase of 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.760
 mil so that gives 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.330
 I exaggerate a little bit but that's it 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:03.740
 what to do and that's it 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:06.229
 to wilson down good luck and with a little 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.190
 of practice it should have the result 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.380
 it's satisfying 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.620
 it's a very good goodbye song 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.620
