00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
France pit I'm going to pick the flint

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.200 
France pit I'm going to pick the flint
13's<00:00:06.390> not<00:00:07.170> because<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.830> don't<00:00:08.340> like<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.000> shoe

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
13's not because I don't like the shoe

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.370 
13's not because I don't like the shoe
this<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.420> my<00:00:09.660> favorite<00:00:10.019> color<00:00:10.139> wave

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
this is my favorite color wave

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.180 
this is my favorite color wave
Thirteen's<00:00:10.860> being<00:00:11.790> over<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.179> altitudes<00:00:13.190> it's

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
Thirteen's being over the altitudes it's

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.510 
Thirteen's being over the altitudes it's
my<00:00:14.400> favorite<00:00:14.730> color<00:00:14.759> were<00:00:15.030> 13<00:00:15.770> but<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.310> fact

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
my favorite color were 13 but the fact

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.750 
my favorite color were 13 but the fact
that<00:00:17.699> it's<00:00:18.510> missing<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.109> 3m<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.310> quality

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
that it's missing the 3m the quality

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.220 
that it's missing the 3m the quality
really<00:00:21.060> isn't<00:00:21.359> one<00:00:21.449> point<00:00:21.750> with<00:00:21.900> them<00:00:24.230> yeah

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
really isn't one point with them yeah

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.880 
really isn't one point with them yeah
that's<00:00:25.680> what<00:00:25.830> I'm<00:00:25.980> taking<00:00:26.279> well<00:00:27.050> ya<00:00:28.050> know<00:00:28.230> it's

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
that's what I'm taking well ya know it's

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.420 
that's what I'm taking well ya know it's
not<00:00:29.010> my<00:00:29.189> number<00:00:29.279> one<00:00:29.460> side<00:00:32.390> um<00:00:33.770> since<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.250> goes

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
not my number one side um since it goes

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.280 
not my number one side um since it goes
off<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.820> we'll<00:00:36.090> go<00:00:36.210> into<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.840> altitudes

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
off and we'll go into the altitudes

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.250 
off and we'll go into the altitudes
because<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.860> me<00:00:38.120> definitely<00:00:39.120> where<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> lower

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
because to me definitely where the lower

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.690 
because to me definitely where the lower
numbers<00:00:40.710> would<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.190> over<00:00:42.149> 13<00:00:43.489> both<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.610> these

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
numbers would be over 13 both of these

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.790 
numbers would be over 13 both of these
13<00:00:45.180> those<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.809> two<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> dopest<00:00:46.440> Khloe's

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
13 those are two of the dopest Khloe's

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.299 
13 those are two of the dopest Khloe's

to go with friends next pic apparently

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.520 
to go with friends next pic apparently
you<00:00:52.379> know<00:00:52.590> who<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.190> altitude<00:00:53.940> 13<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.960> Oreo

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
you know who the altitude 13 the Oreo

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.119 
you know who the altitude 13 the Oreo
sixes<00:00:56.600> but<00:00:57.600> also<00:00:57.809> another<00:00:58.170> cool<00:00:58.770> color<00:00:58.980> way

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
sixes but also another cool color way

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.779 
sixes but also another cool color way
but<00:00:59.399> kind<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.670> lacking<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.090> quality<00:01:00.449> again

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789

Scott that full grain leather it's just

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.780 
Scott that full grain leather it's just
it's<00:01:04.409> nice<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.100> not<00:01:05.250> too<00:01:06.150> nice<00:01:07.790> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790

either my next few choices would be the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.800 
either my next few choices would be the
cool<00:01:11.400> greys<00:01:11.549> physics<00:01:12.060> because<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.479> honestly

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
cool greys physics because I honestly

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.140 
cool greys physics because I honestly
think<00:01:12.990> other<00:01:13.260> she<00:01:13.500> should<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.920> done<00:01:14.220> or<00:01:14.460> are

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
think other she should get done or are

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.730 
think other she should get done or are
those<00:01:15.420> physics<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.960> say<00:01:16.140> cool<00:01:16.350> grey<00:01:16.470> school

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
success came really hard this year I

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.580 
success came really hard this year I
think<00:03:45.209> if<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.480> infrared<00:03:45.870> sixes<00:03:46.260> were<00:03:46.290> on<00:03:46.470> this

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
think if the infrared sixes were on this

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.080 
think if the infrared sixes were on this
table<00:03:46.829> it<00:03:47.100> would<00:03:47.190> have<00:03:47.310> been<00:03:47.400> above<00:03:47.670> this<00:03:47.820> in

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
table it would have been above this in

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.440 
table it would have been above this in
my<00:03:48.390> honest<00:03:48.720> opinion<00:03:49.579> but<00:03:50.579> still<00:03:50.910> really<00:03:51.180> doe

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
my honest opinion but still really doe

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.110 
my honest opinion but still really doe
shoe<00:03:51.799> qualities<00:03:52.799> not<00:03:53.040> not<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.640> bad<00:03:53.820> on<00:03:53.970> it

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
shoe qualities not not that bad on it

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.660 
shoe qualities not not that bad on it
compared<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.870> most<00:03:54.959> join<00:03:55.230> as<00:03:55.350> I<00:03:55.440> came<00:03:55.620> out<00:03:55.769> but

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.720 
be the most noticeable and so that's why
I<00:04:26.270> think<00:04:26.510> that<00:04:26.780> is<00:04:27.169> the<00:04:27.370> second-best<00:04:28.370> release

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
I think that is the second-best release

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.530 
I think that is the second-best release
of<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:28.970> year<00:04:29.230> really<00:04:30.230> don't<00:04:30.440> you<00:04:31.300> like<00:04:32.300> I<00:04:32.330> said

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
think it was just a foregone conclusion

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.670 
think it was just a foregone conclusion
to<00:05:13.460> begin<00:05:13.700> with<00:05:13.880> that<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.540> number<00:05:14.810> one<00:05:14.960> jordan

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
to begin with that the number one jordan

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.740 
to begin with that the number one jordan

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
doernbecher threes thing for most of us

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.690 
doernbecher threes thing for most of us
maybe<00:05:21.080> not<00:05:21.260> the<00:05:21.380> silver<00:05:21.740> but<00:05:22.190> the<00:05:22.430> fact<00:05:22.640> that

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
maybe not the silver but the fact that

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.250 
maybe not the silver but the fact that

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.310 
there's more that can be done to make
the<00:06:11.400> shoes<00:06:11.640> better<00:06:11.880> and<00:06:12.180> so<00:06:12.870> I<00:06:12.900> think<00:06:13.230> it

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
the shoes better and so I think it

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.900 
the shoes better and so I think it
should<00:06:13.500> beg<00:06:13.800> if<00:06:13.950> it<00:06:14.100> can<00:06:14.220> be<00:06:14.370> done<00:06:14.520> it<00:06:14.730> should

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
should beg if it can be done it should

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.130 
should beg if it can be done it should
be<00:06:15.060> done<00:06:15.500> I'm<00:06:16.500> seeing<00:06:16.830> like<00:06:17.450> little<00:06:18.450> strings
