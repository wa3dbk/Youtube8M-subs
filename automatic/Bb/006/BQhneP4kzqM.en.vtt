00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
I'm using on this guitar right here now

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.359 
I'm using on this guitar right here now
is<00:00:25.160> Nano<00:00:26.160> web<00:00:26.430> custom<00:00:27.000> light<00:00:27.210> elixirs<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.369> so

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
is Nano web custom light elixirs and so

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.490 
is Nano web custom light elixirs and so
you<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.599> kind<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.840> listen<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.199> how<00:00:31.320> these

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
you can just kind of listen to how these

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.709 
you can just kind of listen to how these
sound<00:00:31.830> then<00:00:32.489> compare<00:00:32.880> them<00:00:32.969> with<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.570> sigh

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
sound then compare them with one sigh

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.190 

so<00:00:49.780> scrubbing<00:00:51.150> here's<00:00:52.150> a<00:00:52.270> little<00:00:53.110> bit

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
so scrubbing here's a little bit

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:11.770 
so scrubbing here's a little bit
harmonics<00:00:53.800> lapping

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.260 

right<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> little<00:01:15.180> bit

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
right and then here is just a little bit

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:32.910 
right and then here is just a little bit
of<00:01:15.360> finger<00:01:15.479> picking

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.200

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
all right so I'm going to restring them

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.100 
all right so I'm going to restring them
and<00:01:36.490> let<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.579> compare<00:01:37.909> okay<00:01:40.659> all<00:01:41.659> right<00:01:41.810> so

I'm<00:01:42.289> back<00:01:42.500> got<00:01:42.979> some<00:01:43.280> new<00:01:43.399> strings<00:01:43.729> put<00:01:44.060> on<00:01:44.149> the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
I'm back got some new strings put on the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.279 
I'm back got some new strings put on the
guitar<00:01:44.600> here<00:01:46.240> now<00:01:47.240> remember<00:01:47.630> I<00:01:47.689> just<00:01:47.990> put<00:01:48.229> them

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
guitar here now remember I just put them

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.529 
guitar here now remember I just put them
on<00:01:48.409> so<00:01:48.770> they're<00:01:48.920> kind<00:01:49.220> of<00:01:49.460> still<00:01:50.179> a<00:01:50.210> little<00:01:50.360> bit

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
on so they're kind of still a little bit

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.270 
on so they're kind of still a little bit
tight<00:01:50.840> they<00:01:51.080> still<00:01:51.380> need<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.560> be<00:01:51.679> broken<00:01:52.130> in<00:01:52.250> a

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
tight they still need to be broken in a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.289 
tight they still need to be broken in a
little<00:01:52.399> bit<00:01:54.250> speaking<00:01:55.250> of<00:01:55.369> being<00:01:55.909> tight

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
little bit speaking of being tight

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.600 
little bit speaking of being tight
they're<00:01:56.539> tight<00:01:57.200> relatively<00:01:57.950> speaking<00:01:58.250> but

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
they're tight relatively speaking but

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.399 
they're tight relatively speaking but
these<00:01:58.789> strings<00:01:59.149> are<00:01:59.299> actually<00:01:59.479> really<00:02:00.049> loose

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
these strings are actually really loose

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.740 
these strings are actually really loose
strings<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.549> if<00:02:01.789> I<00:02:01.909> was<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.119> even<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:02.570> do<00:02:02.720> a

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
strings so if I was to even just do a

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.840 
strings so if I was to even just do a
whole<00:02:03.020> step<00:02:03.350> Bend<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.069> D<00:02:04.280> string<00:02:04.520> like

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
whole step Bend and the D string like

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.969 
whole step Bend and the D string like
this<00:02:07.959> look<00:02:08.959> at<00:02:09.080> all<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:09.289> zone<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.709> I<00:02:09.769> just

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
this look at all that zone that I just

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.050 
this look at all that zone that I just
had<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.190> cover<00:02:11.230> it's<00:02:12.230> pretty<00:02:13.010> far<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:13.940> they're

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
had to cover it's pretty far so they're

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.520 
had to cover it's pretty far so they're
kind<00:02:14.299> of<00:02:14.360> actually<00:02:14.690> typically<00:02:14.989> loose<00:02:15.230> strings

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
kind of actually typically loose strings

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.960 
kind of actually typically loose strings
so<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.709> probably<00:02:15.860> retune<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.519> now<00:02:16.640> ooh<00:02:18.970> all

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
so I probably retune that now ooh all

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.240 
so I probably retune that now ooh all
right<00:02:20.090> so<00:02:20.450> now<00:02:20.569> it's<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.959> relatively<00:02:21.830> more<00:02:22.010> in

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
right so now it's a relatively more in

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:36.460 
right so now it's a relatively more in
tune<00:02:22.459> so<00:02:22.870> here's<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.019> strumming<00:02:24.470> again

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.050 

it's<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.560> little<00:02:37.920> bit<00:02:38.040> less<00:02:38.220> projection<00:02:38.910> I'm

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
it's a little bit less projection I'm

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.520 
it's a little bit less projection I'm
not<00:02:39.210> sure<00:02:39.450> how<00:02:39.660> much<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:40.140> tell<00:02:40.320> with<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
not sure how much you can tell with the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.690 
not sure how much you can tell with the
iPhone<00:02:41.600> iPhone<00:02:42.600> microphone<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:44.280> here's<00:02:44.520> some

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
iPhone iPhone microphone so here's some

00:02:44.700 --> 00:03:05.130 
iPhone iPhone microphone so here's some
slapping<00:02:45.320> harmonics

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:23.290 

alright<00:03:06.140> then<00:03:06.709> here's<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.160> picking<00:03:22.300> alright

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
alright then here's the picking alright

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.699 
alright then here's the picking alright
so<00:03:23.540> this<00:03:23.720> point<00:03:24.020> you<00:03:24.110> can<00:03:24.260> make<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.410> decision

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
so this point you can make a decision

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.620 
so this point you can make a decision
for<00:03:25.430> yourself<00:03:25.489> which<00:03:25.970> one<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.239> like<00:03:26.420> more

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
for yourself which one you like more

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.290 
for yourself which one you like more
Summa<00:03:27.260> quick<00:03:27.470> things<00:03:27.770> that<00:03:28.100> are<00:03:28.910> different

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
Summa quick things that are different

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.190 
Summa quick things that are different
that<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:30.380> can<00:03:30.560> definitely<00:03:30.680> tell<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.310> harmonics

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
that I can definitely tell the harmonics

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.199 
that I can definitely tell the harmonics
don't<00:03:33.200> ring<00:03:33.560> nearly<00:03:34.099> as<00:03:34.220> much<00:03:34.459> on<00:03:34.700> these<00:03:34.849> as

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
don't ring nearly as much on these as

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.800 
don't ring nearly as much on these as
the<00:03:35.989> elixirs<00:03:36.580> just<00:03:37.580> because<00:03:37.760> they're<00:03:37.940> so<00:03:38.209> core

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
the elixirs just because they're so core
