00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
actually seven King g7 so 95 is that

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.860 
actually seven King g7 so 95 is that
really<00:02:42.569> possible<00:02:43.700> was<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.819> a<00:02:44.879> film<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.390> g2

really possible was that a film on g2

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.149 
really possible was that a film on g2
yeah<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.409> think<00:02:46.980> it's<00:02:47.099> gonna<00:02:47.220> backfire<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.819> g2

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.360 
yeah I think it's gonna backfire on g2
so<00:02:50.159> better<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.519> keep<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.879> close<00:02:51.659> probably

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
so better to keep this close probably

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:01.890 
so better to keep this close probably
will<00:02:53.370> just<00:02:53.400> create<00:02:53.790> false
