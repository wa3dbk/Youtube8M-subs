00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 and with us today in the city of 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.450
 Mexico we have observed a different sun 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.510
 to the other days and different looks to 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.920
 a perfect halo very bright this 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.139
 it happens in the highest part of the atmosphere 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.049
 there are the ice particles in 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.330
 suspension when receiving sunlight the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.880
 refract and form a spectrum of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 colors around precisely the sun is 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.930
 an optical effect similar to that which 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 It presents with a rainbow is recommended 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.140
 not observing the prolonged 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.720
 phenomenon to prevent the rays from 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.219
 Sun between directly in the eyes is very 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.620
 common that this type of phenomena 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.149
 present in the autumn and when the indexes 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.500
 of ultraviolet rays are found 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.180
 high as it is today because 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.180
 we are certainly not 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.910
 I used to say the city ​​of mexico but 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.170
 this natural phenomenon that you are 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.360
 watching on screen in case you have not had 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.010
 the opportunity to leave was also possible 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.900
 appreciate in the states of mexico and 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.540
 Hidalgo through social networks 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.760
 facebook and twitter users placed 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.570
 photographs of the solar halo from metepec 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:27.000
 toluca tecámac pachuca tula tulancingo and 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.000
 many other municipalities in these states 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.670
 and we are going to give precisely a turn 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.250
 through the streets of the city of mexico 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.830
 with my partner rafael trejo illuminated 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.740
 this afternoon precisely because of the sun with 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.140
 your wonderful year forward good 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.000
 Afternoons of presentations where open 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.390
 with Christ's pleasure because we already 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.980
 we found here are the immediate vicinity 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.560
 precisely from the delegation 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.220
 azcapotzalco in this afternoon as well 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.840
 you mention then of warm and also 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.710
 cleared in this western area of ​​the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.870
 city 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.810
 and indeed Daniel is this phenomenon 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.970
 atmospheric still continues in this 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.820
 moment and we are actually seeing the 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.640
 live image at this time of the afternoon 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.569
 You can still appreciate it, let's say 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.299
 that in all its dimension is something 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.889
 that precisely surrounds the sun and 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.290
 we heard the explanation that 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:25.620
 Daniel is therefore a phenomenon 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.079
 atmospheric but that without a doubt 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.099
 It attracts a lot of attention 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:34.129
 let's see then a kind of rainbow 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:37.170
 around the sun and inside this 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.689
 circumference then a gray color of 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.419
 somehow a darker gray than the 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.040
 that is observed outside this circle what 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:46.409
 which is called a lot of attention 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.260
 Daniel here where we are from 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:52.829
 done since many people have 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.169
 stopped to see this visual effect and 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.629
 Well, here we have to say that there is 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:00.900
 to do it with care since it was 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.209
 always look directly towards the sun 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.669
 Well, let's say it hurts a little 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.579
 view but certainly this is a nice 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:10.230
 atmospheric phenomenon that can be seen at 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.260
 simple sight in this afternoon is a 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.780
 phenomenon originated already begun by 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.939
 the refraction of light and well then that 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.650
 this afternoon you still see here in the 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:23.690
 clear sky of the capital 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.340
 Without a doubt, he calls the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.140
 attention is the report we have 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.180
 daniel and I thank you so much rafa 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.700
 I already said it can only be done 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.290
 see for a few seconds and then not 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.070
 hurt our eyes thanks rafa good 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.070
 Afternoons we are waiting
