00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
get close is to be able to print using

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.770 
get close is to be able to print using
an<00:01:13.960> icc<00:01:14.440> profile<00:01:14.890> you'll<00:01:15.729> notice<00:01:16.120> that<00:01:16.330> here

that<00:01:59.289> we're<00:01:59.439> going<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.710> print<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.280> canvas<00:02:00.789> if

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
that we're going to print to canvas if

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:02.999 
that we're going to print to canvas if
we're<00:02:01.899> going<00:02:02.049> to<00:02:02.140> do<00:02:02.350> that<00:02:02.530> I'm<00:02:02.740> going<00:02:02.859> to<00:02:02.920> go

we're going to do that I'm going to go

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.440 
we're going to do that I'm going to go
over<00:02:03.130> here<00:02:03.219> to<00:02:03.280> this<00:02:03.429> one<00:02:03.670> section<00:02:04.060> that<00:02:04.240> says

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
over here to this one section that says

over here to this one section that says
drivers<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:05.079> support<00:02:05.439> and<00:02:05.619> I'm<00:02:06.039> going<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.189> go

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
drivers and support and I'm going to go

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.880

go to my page setup and the page setup
for<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.290> printer<00:04:52.650> let's<00:04:52.890> say<00:04:52.980> that<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:53.160> have<00:04:53.280> my

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
for the printer let's say that I have my

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.210 
for the printer let's say that I have my
3,800<00:04:54.180> printer<00:04:54.450> there<00:04:54.660> I<00:04:54.870> can<00:04:55.470> select<00:04:55.740> my<00:04:55.920> size

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
3,800 printer there I can select my size

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.880 
3,800 printer there I can select my size
so<00:04:56.640> I'm<00:04:57.420> going<00:04:57.570> to<00:04:57.660> use<00:04:57.780> my<00:04:57.960> 13<00:04:58.320> by<00:04:58.500> 19

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
so I'm going to use my 13 by 19

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.840 
so I'm going to use my 13 by 19
borderless<00:04:59.520> I<00:04:59.760> click<00:05:00.720> OK<00:05:01.110> that<00:05:01.950> sets<00:05:02.400> all<00:05:02.640> of

change my overall size for this my

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.060 
change my overall size for this my
within<00:05:09.360> my<00:05:09.450> height<00:05:09.660> and<00:05:09.840> maybe<00:05:10.650> what<00:05:10.860> I'll<00:05:10.950> do

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
within my height and maybe what I'll do

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.410 
within my height and maybe what I'll do
is<00:05:11.160> I'll<00:05:11.280> do<00:05:11.370> a<00:05:11.400> zoom<00:05:11.670> to<00:05:11.850> fill<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:12.240> it

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
is I'll do a zoom to fill so that it

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.910 
is I'll do a zoom to fill so that it
goes<00:05:12.540> all<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:13.080> way<00:05:13.170> to<00:05:13.230> the<00:05:13.380> very<00:05:13.500> edge<00:05:13.740> of<00:05:13.830> the

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
goes all the way to the very edge of the

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.010 
goes all the way to the very edge of the
paper<00:05:14.660> having<00:05:15.660> that<00:05:16.050> all<00:05:16.290> set<00:05:16.650> then<00:05:16.950> I<00:05:17.190> have<00:05:18.150> my

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
paper having that all set then I have my
