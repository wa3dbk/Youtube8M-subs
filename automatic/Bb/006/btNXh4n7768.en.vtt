00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.920
 videos bye girls 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.590
 I'm going to take my creation or pencil 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.469
 eyeliner of the brand that is the hub and 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.949
 This is black and I'm going to 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.039
 start tracing like a cat there 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.409
 too thick only covering in 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.010
 the almond of the eye we will try not 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.010
 get on too 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.140
 Now I'm going to take this bristle brush 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.270
 natural that is a little piggy and 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.649
 I'm going to start blurring this color 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.000
 black and extend it up the 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.520
 eyelid 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.789
 we are going to go up little by little and 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.340
 fulminating very well and once this is done 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:30.310
 I'm going to take a black matte shadow 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.600
 and I'm going to apply it on the pencil that 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.720
 just put 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.860
 and I will gradually pull the color 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.860
 upwards 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.549
 we are going to apply as we see that 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.790
 you need color and we are blurring very 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.790
 all right 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.299
 with the same brush I will take a 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.270
 shadow dark brown mate and I'll 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.280
 apply above the black shadow 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.830
 this will be my transition color and with 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.190
 the one that I will perfectly blur the 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.380
 two tones so you do not see cuts and 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.230
 you see the harmony between the colors 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.790
 Now I'm going to take a brush 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.400
 blur 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.349
 and with circular movements will go 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.349
 blurring the color little by little 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.220
 remember that we must have a lot 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.220
 patience at the time of a girl 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.400
 we continue to fade gently with 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.640
 circular movements 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.579
 and now we go with the lower eyelid 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.250
 with an angular brush I'm going to take a 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.890
 Matte shadow in black 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.530
 and I'm going to apply it on the entire eyelid 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.530
 bottom below my eyelashes 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.440
 now with the same pencil eyeliner that 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.380
 I used at the beginning I'm going to outline the 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.950
 water line both lower and 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.950
 higher 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.819
 this step is optional but I like it 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.829
 do an extended outline of the side 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.920
 so that when applying lashes 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.170
 fake ones look much prettier but 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.930
 if you only apply in mask 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.930
 tabs you can skip this step 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:54.660
 now we are going to sing a song of 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.700
 sacrament and the capitals as you 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.120
 You can obviously take out 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.040
 simply more 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.040
 but I like it 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.860
 it's true 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.600
 and it looks much better with the lashes 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.470
 false and then with mask 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.010
 tabs 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.870
 vice change I will join the natural ones to 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.150
 false and will also apply 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.450
 Eyelash mascara on the eyelashes 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.450
 lower 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.710
 I'm going to use the flush number 49 ago 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.640
 a jordan a ros is a pink color 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.640
 how can you see very cute very nice what 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.780
 I will apply my cheeks as I 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.780
 to blur very well 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.220
 and with my compact powder of the brand of 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.520
 surfing and with the sponge that the 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.650
 same I will remove any trace 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.440
 black that has fallen from the shadow that 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.630
 I'm using now I 'm going to light the 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:10.480
 bone or eyebrow with this shadow in color 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.810
 matte cream 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.940
 it is a very nice finish and as 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.120
 I always tell them this is very important 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.120
 He passed 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:23.650
 finally I'm going to give it some color 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:27.460
 to my lips with this lipstick of the brand 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:30.270
 bird and trets is the number 02 is a color 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.270
 rosita 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.539
 and so we finish this makeup 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.050
 I hope it has been to your liking girls 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.850

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.640
