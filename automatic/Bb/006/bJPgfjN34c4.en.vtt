 calendar with cubes will be perfect in 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.670
 your desk or worktable 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.180
 to make this calendar you can 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.730
 use the downloadable template of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.419
 mail creative a color cardboard 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.270
 You prefer rule pencil scissors 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:30.110
 glue and all the material you want 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.110
 to decorate 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.960
 for this project you can use the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.640
 downloadable template of m that creative 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.649
 find the link in the box 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.420
 information of this video how can you 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.219
 see in the template come two molds 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.229
 for the cubes with which they will form the 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.899
 date one of the cubes have the 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:53.239
 numbers from 0 to 5 and in the other cube 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.329
 continue from 6 to 8 and repeat the 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.760
 number 0 1 and 2 in this way you can 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.609
 form all dates combining both 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.379
 something very interesting is that the 6 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.530
 you can flip it over and you'll have the 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.600
 number 9 on another sheet you will find the 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.880
 mold for the cube of the months as 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.619
 you can see on each side come two months 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.450
 and in the bottom part come some 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.179
 figures that you can use as molds 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.000
 to decorate cut one of the molds and 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:21.860
 mark all three times on a cardboard 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.960
 then cut out each piece and arm your 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.270
 cox then cora as you like 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.340
 you can save this step by printing 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.679
 the template in sheet or page here are 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.390
 my three cubes formed and decorated the 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.399
 I marked on a green card and 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.500
 I used the figures of the template to 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.750
 decorate with white and pink cartonboard 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.940
 also cut out each number and months 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.620
 to give them a nicer finish 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.570
 you do not want to use the template you can 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.490
 make your own designs by hand or in the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.170
 computer you just have to put the 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.600
 numbers where they correspond so that 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.130
 you can do all the combinations 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.380
 also remember that the 6 should look 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.500
 a 9 when flipping and the skill of my 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.390
 cubes is 4 centimeters ok when 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.100
 have the three distant cubes ready in 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.890
 one side and take the cardboard again 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.320
 Mark a rectangle of 15 x 24 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.840
 centimeters and cut it 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.210
 accommodate your piece horizontally is 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.460
 say that the 24-centimeter part that 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.120
 upwards good rule in the part 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:20.780
 upper and 10 centimeter marks 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.670
 15 17 and 22 then by the rule in the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.610
 bottom part and repeat these same 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.980
 brands now one of the brands above 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.290
 with the one below 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.330
 then fold each line 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.379
 help yourself with something pointy to mark 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.379
 previously the doubles 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.330
 now how do you give your figure to look like 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.130
 a little box like this one then it's 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.110
 little part will serve us as tabs 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.430
 so put glue on the eyelash and 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.430
 join with the side right away 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.480
 leave on one side while you finish 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.220
 explain and take back the cardboard 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.510
 Mark two rectangles of 7 x 4 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.510
 centimeters and we cut 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.140
 since you have the two singular cut 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.420
 take one and two marks to one centimeter 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.190
 on each side both up and down and 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.440
 on the sides 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.590
 then one of the brands with a line 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.050
 straight must stay a trace like 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.610
 he now cuts the four squares of 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.860
 the corners 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.230
 then fold each side and you 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.680
 it will remain like this repeats itself 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.329
 procedure with the missing piece 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.099
 once you have these beautiful 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.560
 you need to accommodate them in the 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.180
 holes of our previous figure with 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.609
 tania gone to the sides of the two pieces 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.290
 small to form the lashes with 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.290
 glue and arrange them in place 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.659
 and the base of the calendar will look like this 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.909
 He took the cardboard again and made a 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.480
 rectangle of 10 x 7 centimeters and 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.480
 cut out 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.450
 accommodates the figure so that the 7 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:57.280
 centimeters are up one 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.489
 rule at the top and make marks 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.290
 to the centimeter 1 and the 6 centimeter repeat 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.319
 these same marks on the bottom 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.629
 and join each brand with a straight line 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.030
 now for the corner corner rule and 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.519
 make a diagonal mark you will have left 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.630
 something like that now cuts down the line 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.190
 diagonal and you will have two pieces like these 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.320
 then double the lines you marked 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.360
 and remember that you can help yourself from your 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.580
 scissors 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.620
 these two pieces will be the sides of 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.500
 our base and they will be glued to this 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.349
 way this little eyelash will go behind 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.139
 the wall and is smaller in front 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.909
 and it will look like this now before you paste the 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.740
 you can shape it at the edges with 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:42.500
 help of some scissors with figures or 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.449
 leave them straight you said how you can see 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.580
 I decided to make some waves in the 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.009
 borders now yes what follows is to unite 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.469
 the three pieces but to the tab that 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.080
 will go behind with a glue 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:56.029
 in this part and the smallest tab 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.350
 You can paste the cover I'm going to 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:01.510
 cut 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.510
 do the same with the missing piece 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.670
 and we have already formed the basis of our 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.830
 beautiful calendar now the pieces will go 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.660
 accommodated here in practically 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.090
 we have finished the calendar what 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.190
 lack is to give the final touch to 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.220
 decorate you can use colored sheets 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.560
 Corrugated cardboard ribbons stickers photos 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:24.640
 or some figure that you like so 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.160
 hands to work and for here is 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.650
 finished my calendar cubes I 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.020
 decorate with pink ribbon in the part of 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.580
 inside I ordered white corrugated cardboard and 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.740
 at the top I hit this 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.020
 figure that I love is a butterfly 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.540
 with details of hearts and is made 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.790
 of wood and fascinates me and only missing 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.920
 accommodate the juices and get ready to 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.990
 change the date of your calendar every 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.610
 this calendar day I love it because it's 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.980
 something out of the ordinary you can 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.350
 customize it and even give it away this 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.850
 new year instead of the butterfly you can 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.520
 put a picture with your boyfriend and 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.530
 give it to your best friend too 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.630

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.740
 calendar is that it will serve you 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.030
 many years since it has no date 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.740
 expiration and I'm going 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.650
