it seems like it turns a little sharper
than<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.610> way<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.000> other

right<00:01:43.399> inside<00:01:43.759> itself<00:01:44.179> you<00:01:44.990> can<00:01:45.200> yeah<00:01:45.500> you

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
right inside itself you can yeah you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.690 
right inside itself you can yeah you
should<00:01:45.830> know<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:46.070> get<00:01:46.189> going<00:01:46.399> let's<00:01:46.520> weather

should know to get going let's weather
pretty<00:01:47.000> good<00:01:48.159> I<00:01:49.159> know<00:01:50.119> I<00:01:50.270> would<00:01:50.780> have<00:01:50.869> that

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
pretty good I know I would have that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.890 
pretty good I know I would have that
piece<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.590> fall<00:01:51.860> off

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.660 

it<00:01:58.350> makes<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.650> pretty<00:01:58.770> good<00:01:58.920> weight<00:01:59.190> though<00:01:59.400> for

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
it makes a pretty good weight though for

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.810 
it makes a pretty good weight though for
like<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.820> little<00:02:00.240> boat<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:05.490> might<00:02:05.640> be<00:02:05.730> running

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
like a little boat you might be running

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.680 
like a little boat you might be running
a<00:02:05.940> little<00:02:06.030> low<00:02:06.180> on<00:02:06.210> juice<00:02:06.330> too

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.510 

they<00:02:11.690> can<00:02:11.840> see<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:12.110> later<00:02:12.410> yeah<00:02:12.920> here<00:02:13.370> it's

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
they can see it later yeah here it's

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.150 
they can see it later yeah here it's
getting<00:02:13.670> less<00:02:15.010> less<00:02:16.010> power<00:02:16.310> its<00:02:16.640> power<00:02:18.160> that's

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
getting less less power its power that's

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.699 
getting less less power its power that's
wider<00:02:20.000> on<00:02:20.239> that<00:02:20.450> side<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:20.900> yeah<00:02:21.110> now<00:02:21.470> we're

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
wider on that side and yeah now we're

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.199 
wider on that side and yeah now we're
coming<00:02:21.920> this<00:02:22.160> side<00:02:22.340> men<00:02:22.610> could<00:02:22.760> go<00:02:22.910> wide<00:02:23.180> on

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
coming this side men could go wide on

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.559 
coming this side men could go wide on
that<00:02:23.450> side<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.849> can<00:02:25.849> you<00:02:25.910> see<00:02:26.090> like<00:02:26.270> spraying

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
that side and can you see like spraying

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.000 
that side and can you see like spraying
the<00:02:26.690> water<00:02:26.840> out<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.200> sides<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.590> boat<00:02:27.770> oh

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
the water out the sides of the boat oh

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:43.509 
the water out the sides of the boat oh
no<00:02:28.610> it's<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.030> water-cooled<00:02:29.630> engine<00:02:30.020> say<00:02:42.519> I'm

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
no it's a water-cooled engine say I'm

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.860 
no it's a water-cooled engine say I'm
guessing<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:46.239> yeah<00:02:47.239> he's<00:02:47.360> not<00:02:47.510> going<00:02:47.690> nearly

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
guessing so yeah he's not going nearly

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.650 
guessing so yeah he's not going nearly
as<00:02:47.989> fast

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
as fast

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.420 
as fast
yeah<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:50.959> only<00:02:51.110> been<00:02:51.290> three<00:02:51.830> minutes<00:02:52.310> and

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
yeah it's only been three minutes and

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.150 
yeah it's only been three minutes and
it's<00:02:52.549> supposed<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.760> go<00:02:52.880> for<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:53.090> 20<00:02:57.130> well<00:02:58.130> I

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
it's supposed to go for like 20 well I

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.770 
it's supposed to go for like 20 well I
will<00:02:58.670> drain<00:02:58.970> her<00:02:59.090> pretty<00:02:59.269> much<00:02:59.299> straight<00:02:59.569> dry

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
will drain her pretty much straight dry

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.330 
will drain her pretty much straight dry
so<00:03:00.110> then<00:03:00.260> I<00:03:00.290> can<00:03:00.380> get<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> better<00:03:00.709> charge<00:03:01.069> out<00:03:01.310> of

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
so then I can get a better charge out of

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.009 
so then I can get a better charge out of
it<00:03:01.549> they<00:03:02.090> said<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.390> battery<00:03:02.660> takes<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.900> while

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
it they said the battery takes a while

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:11.289 
it they said the battery takes a while
to<00:03:03.049> break<00:03:03.260> into<00:03:03.590> what<00:03:09.850> yeah<00:03:10.850> if<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.030> stop

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
to break into what yeah if you stop

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.640 
to break into what yeah if you stop
sometimes<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:11.900> can<00:03:12.019> make<00:03:12.110> a<00:03:12.140> wicked<00:03:12.319> sharp

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
sometimes so you can make a wicked sharp

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.539 
sometimes so you can make a wicked sharp
channel<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:13.010> just<00:03:13.130> let<00:03:13.340> off<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.519> throttle

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
channel you just let off the throttle

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.340 
channel you just let off the throttle
and<00:03:14.060> then<00:03:14.209> like<00:03:14.390> rip<00:03:14.720> on<00:03:14.900> it<00:03:15.019> as<00:03:15.109> soon<00:03:15.140> as<00:03:15.290> you

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
and then like rip on it as soon as you

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.930 
and then like rip on it as soon as you
let<00:03:15.470> go<00:03:15.500> yeah<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.280> then<00:03:16.519> yeah<00:03:16.670> I<00:03:16.700> think<00:03:16.820> you

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
let go yeah and then yeah I think you

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.039 
let go yeah and then yeah I think you
ever<00:03:17.000> another<00:03:17.239> one<00:03:17.359> yeah<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.570> can<00:03:17.720> turn<00:03:17.810> real

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
ever another one yeah you can turn real

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.590 
ever another one yeah you can turn real
sharp<00:03:18.910> yeah<00:03:19.910> it<00:03:20.000> should<00:03:20.180> be<00:03:20.269> able<00:03:20.329> to<00:03:20.420> turn

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
sharp yeah it should be able to turn

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:29.710 
sharp yeah it should be able to turn
that<00:03:20.750> sharp<00:03:21.079> just<00:03:21.380> drive<00:03:22.130> them<00:03:28.540> well<00:03:29.540> this<00:03:29.600> is

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
that sharp just drive them well this is

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.210 
that sharp just drive them well this is
about<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.079> fifth<00:03:30.290> or<00:03:30.470> sixth<00:03:30.739> time<00:03:30.769> I've<00:03:30.980> used
