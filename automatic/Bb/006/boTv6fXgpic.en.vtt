coral okay and then that way I can let
go<00:00:47.059> of<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:47.540> loop<00:00:48.170> without<00:00:48.650> letting<00:00:49.220> go<00:00:49.400> of<00:00:49.430> the

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
go of the loop without letting go of the

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:50.619 
go of the loop without letting go of the
Rings<00:00:49.940> okay

Rings okay

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.060

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.730 

and<00:01:07.020> then<00:01:07.980> I'm<00:01:08.370> just<00:01:08.400> going<00:01:08.730> to<00:01:08.850> bring<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.270> loop

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
and then I'm just going to bring my loop

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.050 
and then I'm just going to bring my loop
off<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.280> side<00:01:12.980> put<00:01:13.980> the<00:01:14.010> rope<00:01:14.340> all<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.850> one

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.320 

once<00:02:35.820> we've<00:02:36.060> done<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.590> then<00:02:37.590> we<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:38.330> throw

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
once we've done that then we can throw

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.620 
once we've done that then we can throw
the<00:02:39.630> loop<00:02:40.620> off<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.370> front<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.910> stopper

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
the loop off to the front of a stopper

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.750 
the loop off to the front of a stopper
horse<00:02:42.980> back<00:02:43.980> her<00:02:44.250> up

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
horse back her up

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.130 
horse back her up
and<00:02:45.350> whoa<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:48.030> we<00:02:48.210> could<00:02:48.480> start<00:02:48.750> teaching

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
and whoa so that we could start teaching

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.120 
and whoa so that we could start teaching
her<00:02:49.500> once<00:02:49.830> we<00:02:50.100> throw<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.670> loop<00:02:51.620> she<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.800> to

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
her once we throw that loop she is to

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:02.210 
her once we throw that loop she is to
stop<00:02:53.630> okay<00:02:58.340> hey<00:02:59.340> there<00:03:00.150> she<00:03:00.420> stopped<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.220> then

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
stop okay hey there she stopped and then
