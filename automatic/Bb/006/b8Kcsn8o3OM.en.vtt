laughter really is the best medicine I
chose<00:02:08.160> human<00:02:08.550> ingenuity<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.720> used<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.020> bit

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
chose human ingenuity and I used a bit

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.390 
chose human ingenuity and I used a bit
of<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.289> different<00:02:10.560> definition<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.310> because

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
of a different definition for it because

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.150 
of a different definition for it because
I<00:02:11.580> used<00:02:11.790> how<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.690> media<00:02:13.020> made<00:02:13.440> an<00:02:13.620> effect<00:02:13.950> on

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
I used how the media made an effect on

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.630 
I used how the media made an effect on
the<00:02:14.310> audience<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.970> chose<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.200> my<00:02:16.770> first<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.550> all

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
the audience I chose to my first of all

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.059 
the audience I chose to my first of all
chosed<00:02:18.000> human<00:02:18.510> ingenuity<00:02:18.870> because<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:19.950> was

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
chosed human ingenuity because it was

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.710 
chosed human ingenuity because it was
all<00:02:20.220> about<00:02:20.400> learning<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.060> process<00:02:21.269> of

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
all about learning the process of

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.949 
all about learning the process of
creating<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:23.340> new<00:02:23.819> product<00:02:24.239> in<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.569> case<00:02:24.780> it

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
creating a new product in this case it

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.530 
creating a new product in this case it
was<00:02:25.019> a<00:02:25.080> bike<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:26.489> large<00:02:27.030> part<00:02:27.269> of<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.420> was

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
was a bike and a large part of that was

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.600 
was a bike and a large part of that was
actually<00:02:27.690> learning<00:02:28.140> how<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.769> build<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.430> bike

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
actually learning how to build the bike

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.479 
actually learning how to build the bike
at<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:30.810> when<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.260> looked<00:02:31.560> at<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.860> again<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.190> also

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
at but when I looked at it again I also

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.820 
at but when I looked at it again I also
saw<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:33.209> large<00:02:33.600> part<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:33.989> it<00:02:34.110> was<00:02:34.260> learning<00:02:34.709> what

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
saw a large part of it was learning what

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.280 
saw a large part of it was learning what
type<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.040> learning<00:02:35.430> style<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.239> use<00:02:36.569> which<00:02:37.140> I

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
type of learning style I use which I

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.979 
type of learning style I use which I
relate<00:02:37.560> two<00:02:37.739> approaches<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.340> learning<00:02:38.989> my

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
advice for doing that's I'm starting

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.270 
advice for doing that's I'm starting
this<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.540> pick<00:02:42.720> something<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.680> don't<00:02:44.010> know

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
this is to pick something you don't know

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.100 
this is to pick something you don't know
up<00:02:44.430> too<00:02:44.790> much<00:02:44.940> about<00:02:45.239> but<00:02:45.569> I'll<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.080> a

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
up too much about but I'll and have a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.539 
up too much about but I'll and have a
great<00:02:46.350> interest<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.860> if<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.220> have<00:02:47.340> something
