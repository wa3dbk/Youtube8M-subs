the graphic memoir so the book seemed to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.920 
the graphic memoir so the book seemed to
follow<00:01:47.040> much<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.610> same<00:01:47.820> structure<00:01:48.360> fun<00:01:48.720> home

nailed some of these things down while
the<00:02:19.829> major<00:02:20.040> theme<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.430> fun<00:02:20.969> home<00:02:21.239> is

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
the major theme in fun home is

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.990 
the major theme in fun home is
literature<00:02:22.019> and<00:02:22.560> are<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.099> my<00:02:23.280> mother<00:02:23.609> its

psychoanalysis<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:25.500> on<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.799> surface<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.459> find

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
psychoanalysis and on the surface I find

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.030 
psychoanalysis and on the surface I find
psychoanalysis<00:02:27.209> so<00:02:27.959> much<00:02:28.109> less<00:02:28.319> interesting

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
psychoanalysis so much less interesting

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.069 
psychoanalysis so much less interesting
than<00:02:29.280> literature<00:02:29.909> and<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.480> was<00:02:30.599> really<00:02:30.840> not

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
than literature and I was really not

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.530 
than literature and I was really not
expecting<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:32.099> enjoy<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.609> much<00:02:32.790> at<00:02:32.939> all<00:02:33.090> it's

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
expecting to enjoy it much at all it's

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.899 
expecting to enjoy it much at all it's
not<00:02:33.659> by<00:02:34.109> any<00:02:34.290> means<00:02:34.439> that<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:35.069> disregard

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
not by any means that I disregard

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.199 
not by any means that I disregard
psychology<00:02:36.659> but<00:02:37.139> I<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.290> find<00:02:37.769> attempt<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.760> very

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
psychology but I do find attempt to very

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.349 
psychology but I do find attempt to very
clearly<00:02:39.540> defined<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.709> unconscious<00:02:41.489> less

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
clearly defined the unconscious less

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.660 
clearly defined the unconscious less
convincing<00:02:42.959> things<00:02:43.379> like<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.889> walked<00:02:44.250> into<00:02:44.489> a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
convincing things like I walked into a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.179 
convincing things like I walked into a
branch<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.510> poked<00:02:45.840> my<00:02:46.049> eyes<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:46.799> must

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
branch and poked my eyes so that must

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.399 
branch and poked my eyes so that must
mean<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.790> am<00:02:48.180> blind<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.810> something<00:02:49.169> in<00:02:49.290> my

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
mean that I am blind to something in my

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.009 
mean that I am blind to something in my
life<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.919> always<00:02:50.579> have<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.909> sense<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:51.359> the

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
life I always have the sense that the

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.140 
life I always have the sense that the
unconscious<00:02:52.709> is<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.340> much<00:02:53.549> more<00:02:53.730> mysterious

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
unconscious is so much more mysterious

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.720 
unconscious is so much more mysterious
and<00:02:54.659> vague<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.290> difficult<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.159> define<00:02:56.459> than

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
and vague and difficult to define than

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.849 
and vague and difficult to define than
that<00:02:56.909> my<00:02:57.180> mind<00:02:57.389> wasn't<00:02:57.659> changed<00:02:58.230> by<00:02:58.409> reading

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
that my mind wasn't changed by reading

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.890 
that my mind wasn't changed by reading
the<00:02:58.980> memoir<00:02:59.430> but<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.849> did<00:03:00.000> actually<00:03:00.239> find<00:03:00.480> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
the memoir but I did actually find the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.050 
the memoir but I did actually find the
academic<00:03:01.049> style<00:03:01.680> which<00:03:02.129> is<00:03:02.280> repeated<00:03:02.730> and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
academic style which is repeated and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.020 
academic style which is repeated and
argue<00:03:03.359> my<00:03:03.480> mother<00:03:03.720> from<00:03:04.049> fun<00:03:04.769> home

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
argue my mother from fun home

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.369 
argue my mother from fun home
interesting<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.329> I<00:03:06.389> feel<00:03:06.569> like<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.989> don't<00:03:07.139> see

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
interesting and I feel like I don't see

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.349 
interesting and I feel like I don't see
other<00:03:07.500> people<00:03:07.859> doing<00:03:08.099> that<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.700> bringing

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
other people doing that and bringing

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.679 
other people doing that and bringing
like<00:03:09.840> specific<00:03:10.500> texts<00:03:10.980> into<00:03:11.519> another<00:03:12.060> work<00:03:12.329> is

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
like specific texts into another work is

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.170 
like specific texts into another work is
pretty<00:03:13.049> difficult<00:03:13.379> people<00:03:14.220> tend<00:03:14.579> to<00:03:14.669> skip

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
pretty difficult people tend to skip

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.809 
pretty difficult people tend to skip
over<00:03:15.329> quotes<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.079> not<00:03:16.169> read<00:03:16.440> them<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.889> so<00:03:17.459> the

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
over quotes and not read them and so the

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.280 
over quotes and not read them and so the
ways<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.180> she<00:03:18.239> finds<00:03:18.659> to<00:03:18.750> do<00:03:18.900> that

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
ways that she finds to do that

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.140 
ways that she finds to do that
I<00:03:19.319> do<00:03:19.409> find<00:03:19.799> interesting<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.579> haven't<00:03:20.970> seen

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
I do find interesting and I haven't seen

and I had to start over and starting
over<00:04:30.710> was<00:04:31.099> difficult<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.659> didn't<00:04:32.900> look

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
over was difficult and it didn't look

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.619 
over was difficult and it didn't look
like<00:04:33.229> starting<00:04:33.919> over<00:04:34.099> from<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.669> outside<00:04:35.120> much

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:35.629 
like starting over from the outside much

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:37.360
