00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:20.580
 beauty itanet 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:25.430
 one more tip guys today with you 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.430
 can see a painting class lie 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 How do you make an improvised buoy? 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:42.629
 Okay, it's a thing, it's a tip I give. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:47.460
 Little people in New Orleans are here on the river. 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.409
 in Copacabana so has a lot of history 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.149
 a lot of campaigning for this thing so 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:57.569
 so if you want to improvise some 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:59.760
 Boy picks up the end of the year and goes to the beach . 

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:03.120
 Copacabana collect all the shops if you can 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.160
 ok cork stopper is in the house 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.020
 plastic making here is a 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.730
 more refined event but can take 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.150
 also suddenly a little pen of 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.440
 some color and painting the same let's 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.200
 show one thing that will get one 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.760
 The better you do not have to use this 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.860
 material that every team that picks up a 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.030
 little pen even for you to arrive already 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.980
 apply this top part with the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:37.440
 little pen makes the bottom in the buoy on the hour 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:40.050
 that needs to be the little bird and the float 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.060
 a leaf but will see now understood and 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.870
 there will already be ready for your pump 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.050
 improvised here everyone has a bath 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.480
 at home but I'm talking last time 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.480
 I do not know if it was suddenly there for some bush there. 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.060
 not goin to a street I'm talking about 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.760
 bullshit but you can find it saved 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.530
 some two things do not ring in the hotel 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.360
 fishing tackle ok 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.890
 only to improvise of juca of 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:13.310
 Suddenly, you're out of a buoy. 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:13.310
 anyway , there's a branch to break 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.580
 The deal for you, I'll be back soon. 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.970
 I started with the game and you pick up 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.239
 The whole example used an orange color ink 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:35.970
 orange is the acrylic paint 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:38.129
 Ok Just accepting here is difficult now. 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.349
 Quickly you make the ink believed 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.269
 picks up several materials 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.940
 You can see that she's going to fall 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.040
 little I do not know if there will be sugarcane 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.769
 I think you can still read one. 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.220
 bit to get down to this kind 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.910
 so just to be a pretty woman of 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.410
 cool after you fall off the second hand 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.900
 It's okay , I 've felt the phase. 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.180
 a proof that left this is as follows 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.440
 galley is the normal acrylic paint 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.450
 You can see here paying but everything. 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:19.200
 well we show you that people 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:23.190
 Are you okay? Are you going to the second? 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.019
 part and now goes back to the second part 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.569
 spain fear is getting pretty 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.160
 It is combined with the float, right? 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.519
 I reached the bottom of the now 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.519
 White paint 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.019
 in total but take it easy that it will not 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.599
 Doing all this dirt here is just for 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:51.690
 show you how you have 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:55.560
 That's okay, then this is it. 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.879
 here to see you come out a little 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.540
 dirt right 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:02.910
 but it's part of it but then you're doing it 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.310
 calmly but I will not get dirty then it is ok 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.980
 This is where the improvised buoy is. 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.720
 cup can do away with something cool is 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:17.340
 that orange that excited here the telex 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:20.269
 I came here not government code 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.269
 specific 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.050
 she did not come anything specific did not kill 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.900
 here and there orange even I do not know if 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:35.760
 you're read and fabric paint 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.530
 it's ok too 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.840

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:48.090

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:51.000
 It was too, that's all, folks. 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.330
 ready the buoy improvised and has a day 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.530
 to improvise in addition you can also 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.290
 put two things together to combine 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.330
 with the buoy of the game 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.850
 You can make us so at the end of year 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.190
 you can grab several multiple sheets 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.510
 and make several buoys leave 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.270
 saved is not there when you 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.760
 need you have improvised bramble 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.950
 that works as well as the others ok 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.160
