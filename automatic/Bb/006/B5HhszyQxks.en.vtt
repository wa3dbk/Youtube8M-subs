00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 ever wanted to listen to the radio 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.920
 from your smartphone with the speaker without 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.319
 have to connect a headset 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.970
 huge I am is free and I sent supra 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.700
 pixel and today I'm going to tell you how to do 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.679
 exactly this 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.540
 thank you very much to Federico Petrini who 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.039
 he sent us an email to our box 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.320
 mail info at super pixel 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.539
 dotcom that does exist we read all the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.400
 mails and we even answer them when we 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.560
 we took a time to do it he sent us 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.550
 this super active next to another more like this 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.199
 that in this video what are we going to 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.849
 replicate just this idea that he 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.199
 he sent you can write us and show us 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.700
 everything they do with the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.399
 videos that we are going to take with texts 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.140
 tips that are very easy let's grab 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.879
 any phone that has a radio 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.190
 fm let's go into the application of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.750
 radio and let's see what it says to me that 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.190
 connect the headset let's open the other 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.930
 time to listen to the radio 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.190
 obviously I do not want to comment anything very 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.890
 extravagant I do not even have to 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.149
 connect 25 meters of cable for nothing 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.920
 so it pulls I want to turn on either 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.410
 let me what we are going to do very 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.940
 simple let's go to the hardware store and you 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.460
 we ask our partner the hardware dealer 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.800
 che give me a 3.5 mm connector or 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.120
 3 and a half plug as sometimes they tend to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.940
 call justly 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.710
 free virgin so they do not have that way 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.480
 purchase so come note that if 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.970
 unscrew this black part we stay 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.770
 with which would connectors and 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.980
 we show a little more closely and 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.440
 notice that it is a mono connector that is 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.420
 only for one channel ie one 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.620
 channel only after obviously the other the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.150
 another part quote is what could be the 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.680
 negative where all the 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.510
 electricity let's say it that way a 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.220
 little technique but the reality is that a 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.920
 our purposes with this is more than 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.350
 enough notice that we connect 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.480
 let's open the radio application 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.480
 as about the application and we are going to take 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.010
 the radio let's see who takes the 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.390
 stations before going is great nor we 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.640
 I left but what we want to do 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.020
 listen with the speakers that you send 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.979
 speakers or speaker 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.979
 and there we see what 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.720
 it sounds perfectly good 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.120
 see that you hear there's approached 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.280
 microphone is really heard and not 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.680
 lose signal no matter how much we spend 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.990
 fingers but above if we touch it 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.850
 let's break the connector nothing by the 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.070
 style if the monkeys can not either 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.650
 great and nothing if you want to improve a bit 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.630
 the signal can put some cables in 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.670
 the year obviously peeling the cables and 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.650
 soldering the in each of these 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.970
 connectors but really for the purposes 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.800
 that we have and what we are looking for 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.070
 just this is not necessary is to say 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.510
 with only connecting this this is already 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.940
 enough to act as an antenna 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.380
 to fm obviously how are we 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.870
 listening forming speaker the truth 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.490
 that the sound quality is not going to be 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.840
 exceptionally the best in the universe 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.070
 but again for the purposes that 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.320
 we seek to simply listen to the 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.580
 radio with the acceptable quality by the 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.650
 speaker of our smartphone with this 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.970
 is more than enough this is all for 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.740
 today sir, the time that there is not much more 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.840
 because there is no more science than this if 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.550
 they want again to increase the range already 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.070
 I told them as they put this calorcito 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.480
 antenna grab old headphones and you 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.190
 they cut the headphones and they stay with 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.740
 the connector already armed with a little 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.600
 cable and ready that is the same so 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.010
 again 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.300
 there's not much more to say about 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.740
 This diaz me in the comments below 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.570
 it seemed to them if they used it if 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.370
 they knew if they would do it if you want 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.230
 send us on twitter photos of the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.220
 experiments supra tips to do if 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.220
 they want us to do some too 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.750
 tell me so we do it on video and that 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.690
 it's all gentlemen see you in the next 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.959
 videos 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.959
 It is very clear 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.959
 for
