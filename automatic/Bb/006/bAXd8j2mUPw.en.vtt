00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
well and when you need to have a finesse

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.390 
well and when you need to have a finesse
presentation<00:02:44.959> you<00:02:45.769> really<00:02:46.040> need<00:02:46.129> to<00:02:46.189> move

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
presentation you really need to move

presentation you really need to move
that<00:02:46.609> bait<00:02:46.819> slope<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.810> one<00:02:48.200> thing<00:02:48.499> that<00:02:48.530> i<00:02:48.769> do

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
that bait slope and one thing that i do

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.599 
that bait slope and one thing that i do
to<00:02:49.670> make<00:02:49.819> sure<00:02:49.879> that<00:02:50.420> i'm<00:02:50.510> doing<00:02:50.719> that<00:02:51.430> if<00:02:52.430> you

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
to make sure that i'm doing that if you

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.640 
to make sure that i'm doing that if you
can<00:02:52.730> see<00:02:52.969> my<00:02:53.180> rods<00:02:53.420> at<00:02:53.689> about<00:02:53.900> twelve<00:02:54.260> o'clock

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
can see my rods at about twelve o'clock

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.489 
can see my rods at about twelve o'clock
now<00:02:55.579> this<00:02:56.030> is<00:02:56.299> not<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.599> way<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:56.959> want<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.319> fish

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:57.499 
now this is not the way you want to fish

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.890 
now this is not the way you want to fish
a<00:02:57.530> wom<00:02:57.889> or<00:02:58.519> you<00:02:58.790> know<00:02:58.879> in<00:02:58.999> the<00:02:59.120> grass<00:02:59.329> or<00:02:59.689> things

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
a wom or you know in the grass or things

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.020 
a wom or you know in the grass or things
along<00:03:00.109> those<00:03:00.379> lines<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.519> simply<00:03:01.760> for

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
along those lines this is simply for

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.809 
along those lines this is simply for
shaky<00:03:02.389> head<00:03:02.480> fishing<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.519> basically<00:03:04.519> what<00:03:04.760> it

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
shaky head fishing and basically what it

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.989 
shaky head fishing and basically what it
allows<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.299> to<00:03:05.420> do<00:03:05.629> is<00:03:06.249> pull<00:03:07.249> the<00:03:07.279> bait<00:03:07.579> ever

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:07.999 
allows you to do is pull the bait ever

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.209 
allows you to do is pull the bait ever
so<00:03:08.389> slightly<00:03:08.719> maybe<00:03:09.079> like<00:03:09.290> an<00:03:09.439> inch<00:03:09.620> or<00:03:09.799> two<00:03:09.829> at

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
so slightly maybe like an inch or two at

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.039 
so slightly maybe like an inch or two at
a<00:03:10.279> time<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:11.150> especially<00:03:11.629> when<00:03:11.900> you're

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
a time and especially when you're

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.170 
a time and especially when you're
talking<00:03:12.200> about<00:03:12.529> little<00:03:12.859> dips<00:03:13.279> and<00:03:13.609> little

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
talking about little dips and little

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.809 
talking about little dips and little
like<00:03:14.389> ledges<00:03:15.049> and<00:03:15.290> drops<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:15.950> allows<00:03:16.549> you<00:03:16.730> to

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
like ledges and drops it allows you to

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.580 
like ledges and drops it allows you to
drag<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.239> fate<00:03:17.450> right<00:03:17.810> up<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.200> that<00:03:18.230> little

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
drag that fate right up to that little

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.280 
drag that fate right up to that little
ledge<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.219> then<00:03:19.999> just<00:03:20.180> ease<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.810> right<00:03:21.079> over

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
ledge and then just ease it right over

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.570 
ledge and then just ease it right over
I'm<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.310> really<00:03:22.639> it's<00:03:22.999> slow

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
I'm it really it's slow

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.680 
I'm it really it's slow
down<00:03:23.760> your<00:03:24.060> presentation<00:03:24.870> of<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.470> butt<00:03:25.680> and

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
down your presentation of the butt and

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.090 
down your presentation of the butt and
keeps<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:27.960> contact<00:03:28.140> with<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.650> bottom<00:03:28.830> a

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
keeps you in contact with the bottom a

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.590 
keeps you in contact with the bottom a
little<00:03:29.220> different<00:03:29.700> way<00:03:29.880> because<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.390> bait

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
little different way because the bait

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.810 
little different way because the bait
will<00:03:30.990> actually<00:03:31.500> when<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.430> your<00:03:32.550> rod

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
will actually when you have your rod

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.580 
will actually when you have your rod
like<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.780> tighten<00:03:34.020> up<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.380> line

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
like this and you tighten up the line

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.650 
like this and you tighten up the line
and<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.340> bait<00:03:35.550> drawing<00:03:35.880> forward<00:03:36.450> right

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
and so the bait drawing forward right

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.040 
and so the bait drawing forward right
away<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:37.110> stands<00:03:37.860> up<00:03:38.130> first<00:03:38.550> and<00:03:38.790> then<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.870> can

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
away it stands up first and then you can

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.570 
away it stands up first and then you can
kind<00:03:40.170> of<00:03:40.320> drag<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.710> a<00:03:40.740> little<00:03:40.890> bit<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.310> drag<00:03:41.550> it

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
kind of drag it a little bit you drag it

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.280 
kind of drag it a little bit you drag it
like<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:42.000> said<00:03:42.210> that<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:42.630> little<00:03:42.840> small

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
like I said that that little small

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.410 
like I said that that little small
amount<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.340> that's<00:03:44.520> really<00:03:44.670> important<00:03:45.300> with

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
amount and that's really important with

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.970 
amount and that's really important with
shaky<00:03:45.810> head<00:03:45.900> efficient<00:03:46.350> when<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.500> have<00:03:46.680> fish

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
shaky head efficient when you have fish

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.240 
shaky head efficient when you have fish
that<00:03:47.220> are<00:03:47.250> real<00:03:47.570> just<00:03:48.570> weird<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.560> know<00:03:49.680> weird

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
that are real just weird you know weird

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.010 
that are real just weird you know weird
and<00:03:50.490> mood<00:03:50.700> they're<00:03:51.090> finicky<00:03:51.450> they're<00:03:51.870> not

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
and mood they're finicky they're not

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.080 
and mood they're finicky they're not
eating<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.440> bait<00:03:52.590> all<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.010> way<00:03:53.160> another

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
eating the bait all the way another

that jig head and standing up so what I
can<00:04:06.510> do<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:07.020> if<00:04:07.350> I<00:04:07.500> leave<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.740> little<00:04:07.860> bit<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.430> a

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
can do is if I leave a little bit of a

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.730 
can do is if I leave a little bit of a
bow<00:04:08.700> in<00:04:08.880> my<00:04:08.910> line<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:09.480> just<00:04:10.050> go<00:04:10.230> like<00:04:10.470> that
