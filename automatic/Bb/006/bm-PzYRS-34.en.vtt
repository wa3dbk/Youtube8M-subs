I'm<00:00:20.620> here<00:00:20.890> with<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.100> Sehun<00:00:21.580> escape<00:00:22.890> 188<00:00:23.890> it<00:00:24.540> is

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
I'm here with the Sehun escape 188 it is

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.830 
I'm here with the Sehun escape 188 it is
the<00:00:25.690> smallest<00:00:26.110> dual<00:00:26.410> console<00:00:26.860> they<00:00:27.010> make<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
the smallest dual console they make the

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.870 
the smallest dual console they make the
poke<00:00:29.080> it<00:00:29.439> is<00:00:29.710> one<00:00:29.950> of<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.100> driest<00:00:30.369> smaller

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
poke it is one of the driest smaller

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.060 
poke it is one of the driest smaller
boats<00:00:31.210> you'll<00:00:31.419> ever<00:00:31.599> be<00:00:31.900> in<00:00:32.080> cuz<00:00:32.890> there's

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
boats you'll ever be in cuz there's

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.069 
boats you'll ever be in cuz there's
fifty<00:00:33.400> degrees<00:00:33.730> of<00:00:33.910> dead<00:00:34.090> rise<00:00:34.300> on<00:00:34.510> your<00:00:34.660> entry

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
fifty degrees of dead rise on your entry

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.780 
fifty degrees of dead rise on your entry
just<00:00:35.620> to<00:00:35.710> give<00:00:35.860> you<00:00:35.920> an<00:00:36.010> idea<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.310> how<00:00:36.430> sharp

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
just to give you an idea of how sharp

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.940 
just to give you an idea of how sharp
that<00:00:36.820> is<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.390> why<00:00:37.930> you<00:00:37.990> can<00:00:38.230> break<00:00:38.440> up<00:00:38.650> order

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
that is and why you can break up order

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.100 
that is and why you can break up order
so<00:00:39.130> well<00:00:39.340> fifty<00:00:40.120> degrees<00:00:40.360> of<00:00:40.480> dead<00:00:40.630> rise<00:00:40.870> is

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
so well fifty degrees of dead rise is

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.110 
so well fifty degrees of dead rise is
more<00:00:41.350> than<00:00:41.500> on<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.650> 26<00:00:42.280> foot<00:00:42.370> regulator<00:00:42.910> or

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
more than on a 26 foot regulator or

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.670 
more than on a 26 foot regulator or
hydro<00:00:43.480> swirl<00:00:43.720> which<00:00:43.870> is<00:00:43.989> about<00:00:44.110> forty<00:00:44.470> six

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
hydro swirl which is about forty six

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.700 
hydro swirl which is about forty six
degrees<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:45.100> that<00:00:45.220> rise<00:00:45.400> on<00:00:45.610> your<00:00:45.640> entry<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
degrees of that rise on your entry the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.029 
degrees of that rise on your entry the
flare<00:00:48.100> is<00:00:48.340> very<00:00:48.609> dramatic<00:00:49.180> and<00:00:49.329> prominent<00:00:50.050> it

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
flare is very dramatic and prominent it

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.610 
flare is very dramatic and prominent it
got<00:00:51.190> a<00:00:51.219> huge<00:00:51.430> reverse<00:00:51.789> shine<00:00:52.149> and<00:00:52.510> that<00:00:52.620> flare

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
got a huge reverse shine and that flare

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.689 
got a huge reverse shine and that flare
does<00:00:53.890> not<00:00:54.100> end<00:00:54.489> until<00:00:55.079> all<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.829> way<00:00:57.039> past<00:00:57.399> the

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
does not end until all the way past the

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.709 
does not end until all the way past the
driver<00:00:58.000> right<00:00:58.390> here<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.789> most<00:01:01.030> boats<00:01:01.300> the

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
driver right here so most boats the

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.720 
driver right here so most boats the
flare<00:01:01.989> ends<00:01:02.230> a<00:01:02.289> lot<00:01:02.530> sooner<00:01:02.949> than<00:01:03.070> that<00:01:03.250> and

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
flare ends a lot sooner than that and

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.340 
flare ends a lot sooner than that and
the<00:01:04.480> boat<00:01:04.690> goes<00:01:05.019> from<00:01:05.290> 50<00:01:05.740> degrees<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:08.200> the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
the boat goes from 50 degrees to the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.620 
the boat goes from 50 degrees to the
middle<00:01:08.710> which<00:01:09.160> is<00:01:09.280> 21<00:01:09.610> degrees<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.210> 16

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
middle which is 21 degrees and 16

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.150 
middle which is 21 degrees and 16
degrees<00:01:10.840> in<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.350> rear<00:01:11.590> which<00:01:11.830> gives<00:01:12.040> you<00:01:12.100> a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
degrees in the rear which gives you a

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.280 
degrees in the rear which gives you a
very<00:01:12.550> fast<00:01:13.000> planing<00:01:13.450> boat<00:01:13.660> they're<00:01:13.930> on<00:01:14.020> board
