00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.809
 Hi 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.030
 Look here again and today I came here. 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.369
 show you how to make a table 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.859
 brant the great for not being a meal 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.960
 very common is often doubts 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.720
 for the guests whether it's a cafÃ© 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.310
 I have lunch but it is actually 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.170
 precisely because it is a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.220
 between breakfast 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.529
 lunch 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.660
 usually all dishes are served 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.850
 traditional breakfasts are 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.520
 also added some hot dishes 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:44.309
 to complement one of the things I 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.829
 more like to be able to decorate and aromatize 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.180
 water is a bottle of water in a 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.670
 occasion of a great one that the people 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.680
 you can use a larger filter that still 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.180
 a more beautiful look the idea is to use 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.399
 anything that did not have much 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.770
 then work from a path of tam 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.030
 that you have at home a rosemary ninja one 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.760
 cinnamon stick is one thing 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.610
 nice to productions a little bit 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.710
 more sophisticated would be a 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.110
 Sicilian lemon celebrating blueberry 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.360
 It looks beautiful where we used it only. 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.760
 lemon with mint finally 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.770
 any of these ideas is a whim 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.130
 more it gets super nice and any 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.130
 thing is valid 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.710
 The main idea brant organization is to 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.619
 variety of delicious foods offered 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.610
 then the menu goes from breads to cheeses 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.750
 some sweet- baked fruit and some 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.579
 hot dishes 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.560
 was thinking about this diversity that 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.780
 people create a register to put in the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.250
 place of each guest with the options of 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.439
 hot dishes with the idea that 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.420
 first as the foods that are 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.789
 displayed on the table and then place the order 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.740
 with your favorite hot dish a 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.270
 great is one more occasion 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.350
 uncommitted so there is no 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.170
 breakfast 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.659
 nor an alcoholic lunch is lunch 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.179
 invalid can then use not only jesus 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.140
 Do you have any drinks at breakfast? 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.659
 cappuccino coffee with chocolate milk 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.330
 hot juices as well as the part 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.610
 alcoholic wine, very welcome and ours 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.319
 tip make a sangria a jar of rich 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.319
 that does not give grace at the table
