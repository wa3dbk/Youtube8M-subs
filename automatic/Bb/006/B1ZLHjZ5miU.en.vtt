00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hi this is marco de top info 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.500
 today unpacking video before the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.990
 test video that will arrive from here 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.510
 a few days of a brand mobile 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.719
 pretty little one will say it known in France 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.549
 must be realistic and not very cool 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.410
 also castle phone and despite everything 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.730
 yet we are aware of a lot of 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.930
 things especially we follow the news the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.189
 Chinese builders and this is the case 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.640
 here because we have a mobile brand 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.050
 that hugo a 100% Chinese brand know 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.650
 than in China designed for the market 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.480
 Chinese 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.910
 prevents that through some 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.420
 importers we get to get it for 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.890
 the hexagon 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.210
 and this is the case here with the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.570
 cube at p6 precisely this is the p5 then 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.059
 it is the p 05 p 672 that has been 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.190
 provided by tiny deal a shop so 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.090
 a tiny importer 10 points like that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.059
 I want to thank you for the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.140
 blow then thani the coop point which we 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.590
 so lets test today what 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.570
 famous mobile cubic p6 to p6 172 1 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.760
 for really the extreme to simplify 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.500
 the thing 1.5 inches and is including 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.090
 well I 'll come back I 'll come back on 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.160
 specs during the test 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.960
 that's a vote either but you have 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.580
 found that Chinese mobiles are 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.110
 generally well endowed and this is where 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.640
 also the peculiarity is that one 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.869
 is not sure to invite myself to the debate I 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.670
 you will see in a few moments 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.530
 we have a battery and a mobile there is 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.340
 a few extra things 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.100
 then the box in itself she is 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.960
 rather simple a format box I 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.880
 believe it's due and huy europe and that 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.710
 is like that I'm not sure if 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.920
 I plant well you will have the leisure 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.680
 you visionary voters for fun of me 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.150
 correct we'll say on the left side 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.170
 from the right of the box we find the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.490
 serial number but it's a big 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.140
 classic support us not much to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.700
 to say if it is only good or so 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.020
 know it's a model p 0.5 all 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.100
 just what is a 5 inch 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.140
 but this is the p6 172 guy nothing 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.880
 else the box she extremely clean 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.320
 so extremely clean why because 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.610
 that maybe we could say that 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.920
 it's a brand a little bit premium a 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.420
 little bit luxury or just because 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.520
 they would not bother to 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.990
 packing only mentions and 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.280
 others for me I have access a little 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.450
 both I have the impression that the brand 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.759
 try to have a little positioning 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.170
 more upscale even though side 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.939
 price you have to see it's really 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.040
 not at all high-end in terms 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.479
 of price anyway I hear and or 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.099
 so to simplify finally I think that 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.179
 it's a bit of both the price on our 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.130
 lives I did not want to give on the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.720
 shop especially 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.340
 an idyll it's off promotion to a 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.900
 just over 100 euros it is 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.730
 currently on sale for 81 euros 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.630
 so that's up to you to see if you 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.890
 find it's a good deal 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.500
 personally I find the price 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.070
 particularly aggressive so if we 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.810
 open the box 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.490
 here it is that smartphones to 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.310
 the interior is the mobile and you 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.590
 go see he is very well protected he 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.570
 is first on a cradle in 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.480
 plastic that really has the merit of the 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.710
 hold but fine as well and at 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.920
 back the geek word that is in the 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.200
 bubble wrap which then is in a 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.150
 little bag we will send before he 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.880
 arrives damaged you really have to go 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.850
 that was forced and he already has his first 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.850
 accessory that your tv that is already 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.230
 base which is a good all that power 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.310
 implies that they are so it's a 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.460
 clip cover what more to say a pinball 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.650
 with his famous flip cover so the flap 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.750
 is built into the battery cover it's me 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.430
 position on the latte of the phone the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.020
 first contact and there is even a movie of 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.310
 protection on the water on the screen on the 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.640
 front side you've seen yourself 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.810
 level 2 finish maybe not 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.490
 that's not how we call it 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.900
 but the level of attention to detail is 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.620
 rather this is the attention to detail of the 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.320
 part of the manufacturer 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.150
 it's me it's already done calista includes 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.560
 the phone in hand my first one 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.570
 is already quite surprised enough 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.130
 sympathetically surprised by this pinball 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.810
 which already has basic built is already 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.100
 positioned on the basic phone there 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.900
 there is even a full movie that 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.580
 good protector that's it's good 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.380
 is good spirit that I find it 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.490
 it's positive 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.310
 so that's the phone itself 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.570
 a little heavy good grip but the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.030
 weight is quite consistent I think 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.950
 that we happily exceed 143 150 g 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.720
 I will come back to this on this aspect 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.010
 during the test for the shot against the 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.610
 weight of a also a sense of 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.110
 solidity 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.910
 we have there dimensions that are 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.340
 rather special it 's 5 inches 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.380
 but it's human, we have sides that 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.000
 are pretty square enough enough 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.680
 rectangular that it really gives a 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.340
 feeling of strength but the weight 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.440
 also helps 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.700
 this notion there then inside of 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.770
 the question box will find find 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.120
 a back to back a battery cover 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.320
 extra that allows you everything 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.060
 just to remove the sppe 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.380
 explains cover and switch everything 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.840
 simply on a classic dock we go 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.090
 to say then we find foam 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.500
 story of well packed all that 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.050
 we find inside the box a 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.260
 headset with plastic headphones 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.630
 gross to jack 3.5 in a packet says it all 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.850
 what I like with a microphone input that 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.400
 well here I confirm with particular and 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.040
 well just a button at 9 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.570
 here we also find a usb cable 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.550
 micro usb white you'll have noticed 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.210
 which like the pedestrian kit and an adapter 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.699
 sector 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.710
 just as white as the pedestrian kit and 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.320
 usb micro usb cable found 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.699
 also a little bit of documentation 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.710
 she is in English good in absolute 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.840
 it's not very surprising and it stinks 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.180
 is called a quick start bid gaïd 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.220
 start i rebound down you open that and 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.669
 you know how to insert your card 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.530
 sim 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.770
 how in particular removed the back of the 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.690
 phone the main buttons the 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.550
 excess screens do since visibly 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.460
 you're worth is a mark that is to insert 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.090
 some custom wallpapers is going 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.500
 personalize 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.060
 we mean lillers so here I am 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.530
 reminds unpacking video today 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.979
 before the test medium because once 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.169
 few days of the cube in the country 05 p 672 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.810
 or more simply p6 a mobile with 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.340
 a 5-inch screen sold for less than 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.600
 100 euros on the shop whose times 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.940
 idyll that allows us to test this 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.380
 mobile today is so mobile 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.650
 which is accompanied by good 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.780
 accessories we see the attention to detail 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.520
 classic pedestrian power adapter 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.780
 for the blow that could perhaps 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.460
 to do cheap because it's listening 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.340
 raw plastics action a usb cable 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.349
 micro usb a spare shell 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.880
 additional black plastic the 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.039
 phone is then the phone I the 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.810
 reminds his son cover already integrated 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.150
 and a protective film on the face 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.620
 before that it's a state of mind that you 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.840
 not much maybe 10 cents 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.700
 but it's more than ali and it's 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.720
 really appreciated and appreciated

 thank you so much for watching the

 unpacking video that precedes the video 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.310
 to test the cube to p6 to do more 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.650
 simple 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.700
