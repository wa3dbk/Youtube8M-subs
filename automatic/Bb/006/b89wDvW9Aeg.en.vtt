most boring games I played a thief and a

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.740 
most boring games I played a thief and a
long<00:00:22.920> time<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.550> was<00:00:23.789> kind<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> chances

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
long time this was kind of the chances

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.359 
long time this was kind of the chances
he<00:00:24.779> created<00:00:25.230> crazy<00:00:25.590> long<00:00:25.830> shots<00:00:26.099> not

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
he created crazy long shots not

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.730 
he created crazy long shots not
untargeted<00:00:26.939> whatsoever<00:00:27.480> he<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.260> stood<00:00:28.500> back

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
untargeted whatsoever he just stood back

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.800 
untargeted whatsoever he just stood back
with<00:00:29.010> seven<00:00:29.340> players<00:00:29.609> most<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.300> time<00:00:30.570> and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
with seven players most of the time and

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.479 
with seven players most of the time and
I<00:00:30.900> simply<00:00:31.380> couldn't<00:00:31.650> break<00:00:31.949> him<00:00:31.980> down<00:00:32.130> this

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
I simply couldn't break him down this

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.120 
I simply couldn't break him down this
was<00:00:32.669> my<00:00:32.820> biggest<00:00:33.059> chance<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:34.410> his<00:00:34.800> keeper

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
was my biggest chance but his keeper

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.350 
was my biggest chance but his keeper
would<00:00:35.219> save<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.700> apart<00:00:36.030> from<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.210> I

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
would save it and apart from that I

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.959 
would save it and apart from that I
actually<00:00:36.719> didn't<00:00:37.620> create<00:00:37.770> anything<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
actually didn't create anything but the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.180 
actually didn't create anything but the
goal<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.780> end<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.500> game<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:41.100> was

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
goal in the end of the game that was

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.430 
goal in the end of the game that was
pretty<00:00:41.430> much<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.700> like<00:00:42.120> nothing<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.170> in

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
pretty much it like nothing going on in

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.290 
pretty much it like nothing going on in
the<00:00:43.590> game<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.010> had<00:00:44.160> two<00:00:44.370> shots<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.789> target<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the game I had two shots on target the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.020 
the game I had two shots on target the
one<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.600> saw<00:00:46.250> where<00:00:47.250> where's<00:00:47.579> keeper<00:00:47.940> would

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
one you saw where where's keeper would

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.639 
one you saw where where's keeper would
save<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> header<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.200> went<00:00:49.500> in

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
save it and then the header that went in

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.529 
save it and then the header that went in
but<00:00:49.829> apart<00:00:50.160> from<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.370> yeah<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:51.120> much<00:00:51.270> stuff

but apart from that yeah not much stuff

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.020 
but apart from that yeah not much stuff
going<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> game<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:52.620> still<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.219> managed

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
going on in the game but still I managed

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.819 
going on in the game but still I managed
to<00:00:54.059> win<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.570> make<00:00:54.750> my<00:00:54.899> way<00:00:54.930> into<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.620> file

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
to win it and make my way into the file

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
to win it and make my way into the file
which<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> whole<00:00:57.180> lot<00:00:57.210> more

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
which was going to be a whole lot more

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.540 
which was going to be a whole lot more
interesting<00:00:57.840> compared<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.710> really

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
interesting compared to that really

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.310 
interesting compared to that really
blowing<00:00:59.730> semi-final<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.719> then<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.020> come<00:01:01.199> up

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
blowing semi-final and then we come up

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.500 
blowing semi-final and then we come up
against<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.890> serie<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.340> side<00:01:02.640> once<00:01:02.940> again<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.449> I
