00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hey people today i show you like you 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.179
 build these gestures and here yourself 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.030
 can be for about 0 euro to 2 euro 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.830
 depends on how much of the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.770
 sharing home even has the most 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.470
 but has every household so relative 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.000
 cool thing checks out the video I have 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.650
 that already uploaded so not 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.180
 but I had copyright 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.560
 hints because I used to music 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.180
 have cut into it you do not 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.500
 Right it had over now 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.150
 so the video had to be deleted 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.120
 Here is the new video about it 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.680
 six out of what we have for the tester and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.410
 actually only need relative 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.969
 few things first a gopro 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:45.510
 Mitchell hooke bake relatively easy then 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.780
 we need the gopro quick release 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.090
 Everybody has the plate at each one 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.110
 Basket Romans who need the purchase 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.600
 we too need one of us 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.760
 backpack two of such parts 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.219
 there are always with the carriers and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.199
 Although attach the transverse googles to the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.880
 So you can do with the breast 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.670
 not the hip belt but explains at 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.170
 The chest in the old backpack is perfect 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.950
 then you have those parts that are very 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.930
 useful and then you need one more 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.030
 old bike helmet I have nine now 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.380
 So I do not use that but now 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.409
 what exactly of the bike helmet 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.180
 this is the band I need here 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.040
 but it is believed that it is one 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.409
 actually tied with every helmet 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.390
 is that a band made and we 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.509
 need this click system here 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.400
 either that or we just take one 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.259
 normal click system synonymous with 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.810
 bike helmet and then you still need 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.439
 of course, as always with me an old one 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.220
 ski suspenders just like a rubber band 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.899
 As is the theme here that would be perfect 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.399
 and maybe it's still here 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.700
 but it really is apart 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.820
 with every ski braces so the weir 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.200
 we come to the construction manual as 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.049
 First of all we will be in the quick 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.770
 release plate three slits and make 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.020
 the first here on the side of the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.940
 second here on the side and third 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.709
 above 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.930
 We need my tip 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.019
 easy with a carpet knife 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.780
 Keep the carpet knife on the lighter and there 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.790
 behind it just seems like through 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.040
 That's why butter 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.510
 prepared because i have the jazz band 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.400
 yes I've already built it, I hope it is 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.060
 still okay for you and understandable 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.879
 the video 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.680
 we see here now we have here 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.180
 first step we have here 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.439
 second and up here 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.870
 we know we are not so good now 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:44.819
 the third we all as next 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:46.590
 make is take our suspenders 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.450
 here where diverge and cut 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.970
 down first, that we only have 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.459
 These two longitudinal parts you have stop 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.590
 also over the shoulder to go and 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.030
 where we cut it down we thread 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.530
 that through the hole here that we have this 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.629
 appreciate if the quick release plate 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.180
 have done this up here and 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.400
 call it to it if we are here now 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.959
 attract 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.549
 that does not know you are here 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.049
 bombproof and therefore we have too 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.519
 already a small biggest idea 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.389
 but that is not really useful now 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:21.419
 so it is definitely on 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:24.840
 the other side here on one side it 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:28.590
 Does not matter what we take our band 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.079
 that we get out at the radl helmet relatively 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.900
 easy is also quite long so long 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.939
 enough loose for us and now has 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.099
 Look that the band is so long that 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.379
 about a quarter of your time 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.590
 body is that means that the band 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.840
 if it carries on the body already so until 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.959
 end of the quick release plate withstands 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.919
 that would be very good of course if now 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.239
 have a lot of equipment like for example 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.590
 ski jacket protector then you can 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.689
 soon, of course, a bit longer 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.150
 we will make the dress then the ribbon here 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:02.669
 and now it hangs here at the side 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.340
 sewed it just double on the 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:12.540
 other side is just like that 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:16.199
 hook a lesch where the counterpart to 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.729
 our clip is in and I will 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.609
 already the basic structure of this part 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.670
 We have three things here and there 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.970
 become relatively easy now 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:30.380
 These parts must be back here 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.530
 our transversely well secured and 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:38.040
 if we put it here now 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:41.100
 we see that this is ours 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.230
 Being good on the right side, how are you coming here ? 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.410
 and this is going to be our left well 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:50.610
 who has to go somewhere further for that 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.470
 need these parts the two comes 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.680
 now just click here on this band 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.650
 Look that they are right on it 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:03.360
 are 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:04.530
 Number one and number two should do this 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.660
 second turn 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.510
 and now it's easy on the test 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.000
 it farther inside it comes here too 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.010
 the log in further it logically now 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.440
 you have to, it is important for us to look 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:23.640
 in order to be, we must turn the now 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.760
 over here and then we find that 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:31.970
 simply by doing it best here 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:36.270
 down through here below and then 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:39.810
 on the one side from below again 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.340
 over there it is quite solid and 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.430
 will not slip the same 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.750
 make like on the other side now 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.500
 wonderful would have to look at her 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.970
 the part is now adjustable and length 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.540
 Of course, it is also broad 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.320
 imaginable that we see here now 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.160
 We can just put it on the side 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.540
 slip or slip back 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.530
 wonderful 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.710
 now only one is missing 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:09.450
 Part of it must be this counterpart 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:11.130
 the end of the chest so the book short 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:15.300
 rum or chest harness all depends on each 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:19.380
 after where you mount it and then you are 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.150
 we already finished it now likes it 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.380
 I'm fine 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:28.730
 Let's see it in a relatively short time 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.730
 Now let's just take our gopro 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:36.510
 click on it 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:38.670
 movies shit no card in there but we 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.620
 are still done by a few right 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.480
 like to shoot and do that for 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.980
 almost no money 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.570
 of course you can get on the edges here 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.820
 grind if you want you have to 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.590
 but not if you still have such videos 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.910
 want to see or have fallen into you 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.600
 then just give your thumbs up 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.710
 subscribe me and if you have questions 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.900
 and in the comments 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.380
 see you next time with before 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.380
 free skier
