coins<00:04:02.400> he<00:04:02.580> has<00:04:02.700> 92<00:04:03.090> pace<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.630> 73<00:04:04.140> heading<00:04:04.470> and

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
I think he has a bit of height by

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.030 
I think he has a bit of height by
overall<00:04:06.780> which<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:07.050> why<00:04:07.230> he's<00:04:07.410> over<00:04:07.560> quite

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
overall which is why he's over quite

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.770 
overall which is why he's over quite
which<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.490> why<00:04:08.610> goes<00:04:08.790> for<00:04:08.910> quite<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.090> bit<00:04:09.300> even

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
which is why goes for quite a bit even

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.150 
which is why goes for quite a bit even
though<00:04:09.870> he's<00:04:10.020> in<00:04:10.230> a<00:04:10.320> weird<00:04:10.530> league<00:04:10.800> and<00:04:11.040> we're

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
though he's in a weird league and we're

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.860 
though he's in a weird league and we're

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
very good all however he does play a

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.960 
very good all however he does play a
thing<00:04:25.380> that's<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.590> card

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
thing that's a card

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.400 
thing that's a card
if<00:04:26.000> so<00:04:26.240> that's<00:04:26.630> why<00:04:26.810> he<00:04:26.930> goes<00:04:27.080> for<00:04:27.350> the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
if so that's why he goes for the

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.720 
if so that's why he goes for the
consumer<00:04:27.860> amount<00:04:28.100> of<00:04:28.190> well<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.430> think<00:04:28.490> that

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
consumer amount of well I think that

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.640 
consumer amount of well I think that
2000<00:04:29.300> coin<00:04:29.450> isn't<00:04:29.840> too<00:04:29.960> bad<00:04:30.080> on<00:04:30.230> him<00:04:30.380> Ashley

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
2000 coin isn't too bad on him Ashley

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.410 
2000 coin isn't too bad on him Ashley
1.7<00:04:31.220> k<00:04:31.250> so<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:31.580> by<00:04:31.700> it<00:04:31.760> isn't<00:04:32.030> actually<00:04:32.150> too

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
1.7 k so that by it isn't actually too

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.840 
1.7 k so that by it isn't actually too
good<00:04:32.690> but<00:04:33.290> it's<00:04:33.410> still<00:04:33.440> profit<00:04:33.920> and<00:04:34.190> fritzy<00:04:34.700> at

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
good but it's still profit and fritzy at

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.960
