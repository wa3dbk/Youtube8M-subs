00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
and that would be it I mean okay I

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.140 
and that would be it I mean okay I
understand<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.769> only<00:03:53.799> catch<00:03:54.220> is<00:03:54.519> that<00:03:55.060> it

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
understand the only catch is that it

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.430 
understand the only catch is that it
would<00:03:55.269> probably<00:03:55.420> have<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.870> be<00:03:55.989> on<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.260> bottom

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
would probably have to be on the bottom

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.500 
would probably have to be on the bottom
level<00:03:56.890> like<00:03:57.280> on<00:03:57.430> ground<00:03:57.760> level<00:03:57.880> because<00:03:58.360> there

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
level like on ground level because there

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.210 
level like on ground level because there
might<00:03:58.630> be<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.780> bit<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:58.989> noise<00:03:59.140> but<00:03:59.799> if<00:03:59.890> you<00:03:59.980> put

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
might be a bit of noise but if you put

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.970 
might be a bit of noise but if you put
some<00:04:00.430> fucking<00:04:01.150> pads<00:04:01.570> on<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.959> ground<00:04:02.260> then<00:04:02.829> the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
some fucking pads on the ground then the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.740 
some fucking pads on the ground then the
