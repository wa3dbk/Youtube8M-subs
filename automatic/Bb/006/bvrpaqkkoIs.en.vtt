into the basket we bring it up we lower
down<00:01:22.439> into<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.920> tank<00:01:23.250> which<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.670> knockout

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
down into this tank which is a knockout

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.870 
down into this tank which is a knockout
tank<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.810> co2<00:01:25.049> bubbling<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
tank we have co2 bubbling in there and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.550 
tank we have co2 bubbling in there and
it'll<00:01:27.060> nessa<00:01:27.390> ties<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.900> fish<00:01:28.140> we'll<00:01:28.409> give

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it'll nessa ties the fish we'll give

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.230 
it'll nessa ties the fish we'll give
them<00:01:28.650> maybe<00:01:28.829> three<00:01:29.189> four<00:01:29.400> or<00:01:29.549> five<00:01:29.700> minutes<00:01:30.090> in

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
them maybe three four or five minutes in

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.060 
them maybe three four or five minutes in
there<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.079> bring<00:01:31.290> them<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.560> there<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
there then we bring them up there just a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.310 
there then we bring them up there just a
little<00:01:32.340> easier<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.850> handle<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.110> see

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
little easier to handle as you can see

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:43.940 
little easier to handle as you can see
the<00:01:35.159> basket<00:01:35.640> gets<00:01:35.820> opened<00:01:36.180> up<00:01:42.710> so<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.829> can

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
the basket gets opened up so we can

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.850 
the basket gets opened up so we can
handle<00:01:44.159> them<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.579> from<00:01:45.180> here<00:01:45.630> as<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.560> see

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
to get the eggs out there could be a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.530 
to get the eggs out there could be a
chance<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.800> rupture<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.490> eggs<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.120> so

food<00:03:30.120> pantries<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.600> benefit<00:03:31.110> from<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.560> fish

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
food pantries that benefit from the fish

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.830 
food pantries that benefit from the fish
that<00:03:31.920> we<00:03:32.070> plucked<00:03:32.340> here<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:33.330> fish<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.750> are

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
that we plucked here the fish that are

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.080 
that we plucked here the fish that are
in<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.050> container<00:03:35.010> go<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.519> company<00:03:36.030> that

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
in this container go to a company that

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.699 
in this container go to a company that
grinds<00:03:36.540> them<00:03:36.570> up<00:03:36.720> for<00:03:36.930> liquid<00:03:37.170> fertilizer

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
grinds them up for liquid fertilizer

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.830 
grinds them up for liquid fertilizer
so<00:03:38.190> nothing<00:03:38.550> goes<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.850> waste<00:03:39.030> no<00:03:39.330> waste<00:03:39.630> at

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
so nothing goes the waste no waste at

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.509 
so nothing goes the waste no waste at
all<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.290> we<00:03:40.440> are<00:03:40.530> doing<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.890> good<00:03:41.040> deed<00:03:41.100> by

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
we let that sitting here and right now

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.170 
we let that sitting here and right now
these<00:04:01.590> eggs<00:04:01.829> are<00:04:01.980> being<00:04:02.069> fertilized<00:04:02.579> all

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
these eggs are being fertilized all

basically right now taking these eggs

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.820 
basically right now taking these eggs
that<00:04:18.570> sat<00:04:18.900> for<00:04:18.930> two<00:04:19.380> minutes<00:04:21.470> if<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.560> have<00:04:22.590> to

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
that sat for two minutes if you have to

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.070 
that sat for two minutes if you have to
wash<00:04:23.009> them<00:04:23.220> off<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:24.030> know<00:04:24.180> what<00:04:24.389> you've<00:04:24.870> got

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.740 
wash them off you know what you've got
dead<00:04:25.320> dead<00:04:25.800> sperm<00:04:26.070> on<00:04:26.340> ur<00:04:26.370> dead<00:04:26.699> milk<00:04:26.970> some<00:04:27.660> of

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
dead dead sperm on ur dead milk some of

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.930 
dead dead sperm on ur dead milk some of
the<00:04:27.810> eggs<00:04:27.960> have<00:04:28.199> ruptured<00:04:28.470> let's<00:04:28.919> say<00:04:29.160> well

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
the eggs have ruptured let's say well

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.760 
the eggs have ruptured let's say well
it's<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.120> basically<00:04:30.570> cleaning<00:04:30.870> process<00:04:31.470> we<00:04:31.650> got

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
it's a basically cleaning process we got

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.040 
it's a basically cleaning process we got
fresh<00:04:32.009> water<00:04:32.310> here<00:04:32.729> and<00:04:33.330> he's<00:04:33.479> rinsing<00:04:33.900> all

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
fresh water here and he's rinsing all

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.100 
fresh water here and he's rinsing all
those<00:04:34.199> eggs<00:04:34.410> off<00:04:35.090> if<00:04:36.090> he<00:04:36.300> did<00:04:36.479> not<00:04:36.630> rinse<00:04:36.960> those

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
those eggs off if he did not rinse those

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.960 
those eggs off if he did not rinse those
off<00:04:37.320> they<00:04:37.620> would<00:04:37.770> get<00:04:37.889> real<00:04:38.099> gelatinous<00:04:38.669> and

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
off they would get real gelatinous and

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.189 
off they would get real gelatinous and
they<00:04:39.030> would<00:04:39.180> stick<00:04:39.449> together<00:04:39.599> and<00:04:40.020> they<00:04:40.110> would

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
they would stick together and they would

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.469 
they would stick together and they would
clump<00:04:40.470> together<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:40.949> so<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:41.610> can<00:04:41.729> see<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.180> lot

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
clump together and so you can see a lot

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.570 
clump together and so you can see a lot
of<00:04:42.599> foam<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.840> lot<00:04:43.229> of<00:04:43.410> ruptured<00:04:43.979> eggs<00:04:44.160> coming

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
of foam a lot of ruptured eggs coming

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.670 
of foam a lot of ruptured eggs coming
out<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.840> these<00:04:46.020> are<00:04:46.199> where<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.530> eggs

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
out and these are where the eggs

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.310 
out and these are where the eggs
actually<00:04:47.130> they<00:04:47.490> have<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.759> water<00:04:47.940> harden<00:04:48.449> you

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
actually they have to water harden you

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.719 
actually they have to water harden you
wouldn't<00:04:49.590> want<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.770> transport<00:04:50.340> these<00:04:50.460> eggs

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
wouldn't want to transport these eggs

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.219 
wouldn't want to transport these eggs
immediately<00:04:51.389> you<00:04:51.630> want<00:04:51.810> them<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:52.080> water

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
immediately you want them to water

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.560 
immediately you want them to water
harden<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:53.010> would<00:04:53.490> say<00:04:53.699> two<00:04:53.760> hours<00:04:54.120> they're

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
harden I would say two hours they're

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.200 
harden I would say two hours they're
gonna<00:04:54.659> be<00:04:54.870> in<00:04:55.020> here<00:04:55.380> water<00:04:56.039> hardening<00:04:56.580> and

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
gonna be in here water hardening and

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.879 
gonna be in here water hardening and
they<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.780> guys<00:04:57.930> down<00:04:58.199> here<00:04:58.349> just<00:04:58.470> keep<00:04:58.680> track

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
they the guys down here just keep track

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.589 
they the guys down here just keep track
of<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.130> time<00:04:59.310> something<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.210> wants<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.510> eggs

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
of the time something I wants the eggs

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.740 
of the time something I wants the eggs
harden<00:05:00.990> what<00:05:01.229> happens<00:05:01.530> on<00:05:01.710> well<00:05:02.659> the<00:05:03.659> eggs

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
harden what happens on well the eggs

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.330 
harden what happens on well the eggs
hard<00:05:04.020> they<00:05:04.229> go<00:05:04.380> into<00:05:04.560> coolers<00:05:04.949> they<00:05:05.159> get

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
hard they go into coolers they get

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.279 
hard they go into coolers they get
disinfected<00:05:06.240> first<00:05:06.510> we<00:05:06.960> disinfect

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
disinfected first we disinfect

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.080 
disinfected first we disinfect
everything<00:05:07.770> with<00:05:07.889> iodine<00:05:08.250> here<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.760> eggs<00:05:08.880> are

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
everything with iodine here the eggs are

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.610 
everything with iodine here the eggs are
disinfected<00:05:09.780> just<00:05:09.930> because<00:05:10.169> we<00:05:10.349> don't<00:05:10.500> want

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
disinfected just because we don't want
