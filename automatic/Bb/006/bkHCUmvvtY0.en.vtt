00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
up with some interesting ways to let you

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.910 
up with some interesting ways to let you
know<00:02:12.870> what's<00:02:13.050> going<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.349> in<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.530> world

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
know what's going on in the world

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920 
know what's going on in the world
you<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.520> continues<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.000> sci-fi<00:02:15.209> theme<00:02:15.660> very

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
you that continues the sci-fi theme very

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.440 
you that continues the sci-fi theme very
well<00:02:16.140> for<00:02:16.740> example<00:02:16.880> Isaac's<00:02:17.880> health<00:02:18.090> bar<00:02:18.300> and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
well for example Isaac's health bar and

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.059 
well for example Isaac's health bar and
Kinesis<00:02:18.780> meter<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:19.170> actually<00:02:19.590> placed<00:02:19.830> along

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
Kinesis meter is actually placed along

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.979 
Kinesis meter is actually placed along
the<00:02:20.099> spine<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.700> his<00:02:20.819> suit<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.599> can<00:02:21.780> always

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
the spine of his suit so you can always

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.570 
the spine of his suit so you can always
see<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.590> how<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.860> are<00:02:23.040> affected<00:02:23.520> as

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
see it and how you are affected as

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.339 
see it and how you are affected as
enemies<00:02:23.849> latch<00:02:24.030> on<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.480> or<00:02:24.810> take<00:02:25.050> swipes

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
enemies latch on to you or take swipes

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.449 
enemies latch on to you or take swipes
at<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.560> if<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.770> let<00:02:25.890> them<00:02:25.920> get<00:02:26.130> too<00:02:26.250> close

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
at you if you let them get too close

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.059 
at you if you let them get too close
also<00:02:27.180> since<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.900> are<00:02:28.020> in<00:02:28.140> deep<00:02:28.290> space<00:02:28.410> there

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
also since you are in deep space there

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.260 
also since you are in deep space there
are<00:02:29.190> portions<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.640> levels<00:02:29.880> where<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.090> ship

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
are portions of levels where the ship

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.270 
are portions of levels where the ship
has<00:02:30.420> been<00:02:30.540> breached<00:02:30.780> by<00:02:30.959> space<00:02:31.260> debris<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.830> so

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
has been breached by space debris and so

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.740 
has been breached by space debris and so
Isaac<00:02:32.489> will<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.970> rush<00:02:33.150> through<00:02:33.330> portions

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
Isaac will have to rush through portions

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.180 
Isaac will have to rush through portions
of<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.959> game<00:02:34.140> as<00:02:34.319> he<00:02:34.410> watches<00:02:34.680> his<00:02:34.739> oxygen

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
of the game as he watches his oxygen

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.610 
of the game as he watches his oxygen
tank<00:02:35.220> slowly<00:02:35.819> deplete<00:02:36.300> there<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.140> also<00:02:37.500> how

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
tank slowly deplete there is also how

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.050 
tank slowly deplete there is also how

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
you gather information about the ship as

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.059 
you gather information about the ship as
