there so many square up the deck to the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.319 
there so many square up the deck to the
front<00:03:04.629> it<00:03:04.720> looks<00:03:04.750> like<00:03:05.019> this<00:03:05.549> but<00:03:06.549> you<00:03:07.150> have

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
going to cut to the break so you're

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.379 
going to cut to the break so you're
going<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.930> go<00:03:14.049> one<00:03:14.639> two<00:03:16.560> three<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:18.180> then<00:03:19.180> make

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
going to go one two three and then make

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.809 
going to go one two three and then make
sure<00:03:19.419> you<00:03:19.720> get<00:03:19.870> past<00:03:20.139> that<00:03:20.380> break<00:03:20.769> you'll<00:03:21.639> be
