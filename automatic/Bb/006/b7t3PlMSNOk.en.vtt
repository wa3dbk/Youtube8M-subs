00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.130
 welcome to a video today we are not in 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.930
 gameplay 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.170
 today we are excited because the 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.619
 trailer or it puts us all as well as 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.619
 super mega 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.830
 trailer has different things that it 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.180
 see how many cinematics I do not feel 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.349
 that the trailer has done as well as 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.150
 of gameplay because it has come up 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.800
 November to see how it will bring us and 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.800
 however, issues like this 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.530
 like this 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.460
 ah 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.229
 it's absolutely better as the low cost 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.049
 because the truth is that for the front 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.250
 it looks amazing on every side in the network 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.500
 and it has a lot of different places 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.810
 who they read are saying that dais is 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.180
 doing baroud front in a way like 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.759
 jeopardize your career or in 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.750
 other words or baron front works or 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.750
 dais is not 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.360
 there 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.369
 you already saw enter that not that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.840
 they thought they were good or they thought 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.130
 only a cinematic of course 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.780
 that the gameplay will come later but in 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.759
 Right now we only have what 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.409
 we have to be able to see if the game is worth 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.460
 or not worth it and from this moment 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.789
 for the quality of the kinematics I'm 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.109
 super 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.969
 we give that it will be a small mini blog 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.429
 talking about baroud front and wait to see 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.020
 what do you think about the trailer and 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.579
 about what comes from this game 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.740
 then so if you like video 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.789
 favorites and if we have seen what 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.789
 they feel like it and until next time
