findings this one is going to be about

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.060 
findings this one is going to be about
pins<00:00:08.130> so<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.210> have<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> selection<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.170> pins<00:00:10.800> here

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
pins so I have a selection of pins here

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.589 
pins so I have a selection of pins here
for<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.910> show<00:00:12.120> you

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
and there is mainly three kind of pins I

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.040 
and there is mainly three kind of pins I
use<00:00:16.890> with<00:00:17.130> polymer<00:00:17.520> clay<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:18.060> another<00:00:18.510> one<00:00:18.779> I

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
use with polymer clay and another one I

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.300 
use with polymer clay and another one I
don't<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.590> have<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.949> tell<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.250> about

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
it first this is an eye pin it has a

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.099 
it first this is an eye pin it has a
circle<00:00:25.830> loop<00:00:26.400> i<00:00:26.699> whatever<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.660> want<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.960> call

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
circle loop i whatever you want to call

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.860 
circle loop i whatever you want to call
it<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:29.130> end<00:00:30.140> there<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.320> also<00:00:32.510> have<00:00:33.510> pins

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it on one end there is also have pins

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.650 
it on one end there is also have pins
which<00:00:34.290> have<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> flat<00:00:35.219> end<00:00:37.309> and<00:00:38.329> there<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.450> also

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
which have a flat end and there is also

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.340 
which have a flat end and there is also
ball<00:00:40.110> pins<00:00:40.410> which<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:42.050> around

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
ball pins which have around

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.450 
ball pins which have around
shiny<00:00:43.950> ball<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.059> end<00:00:45.920> there<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.039> also<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
shiny ball on the end there is also a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.540 
shiny ball on the end there is also a
fourth<00:00:48.300> kind<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.440> don't<00:00:49.680> really<00:00:49.860> use<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.460> I

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
fourth kind that I don't really use so I

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.950 
fourth kind that I don't really use so I
don't<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.940> any<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.300> show<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.570> which<00:00:51.930> is

with allergies because I want to offer
options<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.560> them<00:01:31.740> too<00:01:32.180> they<00:01:33.180> come<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.810> all

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
options for them too they come in all

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.670 
options for them too they come in all
kind<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.470> lengths<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:36.000> kind<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.869> linkage

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
kind of lengths the kind of the linkage

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.660 
kind of lengths the kind of the linkage
is<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> most<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.700> one<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.750> about<00:01:40.670> 25

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
is the most is this one this is about 25

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.819 
is the most is this one this is about 25
millimeters<00:01:42.360> or<00:01:42.810> an<00:01:43.740> inch<00:01:44.780> but<00:01:45.780> they<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.649> be

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
millimeters or an inch but they can be

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.679 
millimeters or an inch but they can be
as<00:01:46.979> long<00:01:47.220> as<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.640> want<00:01:47.850> them<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.000> be<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.450> one

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
as long as you want them to be this one

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.120 
as long as you want them to be this one
is<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.409> believe<00:01:49.820> 5<00:01:50.820> centimeters<00:01:51.750> or<00:01:52.049> 2<00:01:52.740> inches

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
is I believe 5 centimeters or 2 inches

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.510 
is I believe 5 centimeters or 2 inches
but<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.390> shorter<00:01:55.320> ones<00:01:55.530> are<00:01:55.770> perfect<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.369> my

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
but the shorter ones are perfect for my

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.050 
but the shorter ones are perfect for my
miniatures<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.960> use<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.409> long<00:01:58.740> ones<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.250> have

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
miniatures if I use the long ones I have

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.700 
miniatures if I use the long ones I have
to<00:02:00.210> cut<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.570> rest<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.350> goes<00:02:01.500> to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
to cut the rest and it just goes to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.940 
to cut the rest and it just goes to
waste

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.809 

sometimes<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.430> come<00:02:05.780> cooked<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.819> and

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
sometimes they come cooked like this and

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.150 
sometimes they come cooked like this and
I<00:02:09.330> believe<00:02:09.390> there<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.080> some<00:02:10.349> kind<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.770> players

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
I believe there is some kind of players

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
I believe there is some kind of players
that<00:02:11.340> is

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
that is

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.770 
that is
is<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.450> flatten<00:02:12.810> them<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.620> just<00:02:13.829> kind<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.780> run

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
is to flatten them you just kind of run

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.420 
is to flatten them you just kind of run
it<00:02:15.930> through<00:02:16.079> the<00:02:16.230> players<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.890> flatten<00:02:17.280> them

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
it through the players to flatten them

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.209 
it through the players to flatten them
but<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:18.269> can<00:02:18.450> also<00:02:18.540> do<00:02:19.379> these<00:02:19.560> just<00:02:19.890> with<00:02:20.099> your

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
but you can also do these just with your

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:24.380 
but you can also do these just with your
fingers<00:02:20.930> just<00:02:21.930> slightly<00:02:22.409> paint<00:02:22.859> them<00:02:23.390> into

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
fingers just slightly paint them into

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.629 
fingers just slightly paint them into
shape<00:02:24.689> until<00:02:25.049> they<00:02:25.739> are<00:02:25.859> straight<00:02:26.280> again<00:02:26.609> a

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:28.639 
shape until they are straight again a

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.849 
shape until they are straight again a
bit<00:02:29.639> better<00:02:29.849> than<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.319> but<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.590> get<00:02:31.739> the

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
bit better than that but you get the

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.300 
bit better than that but you get the
idea<00:02:32.450> now<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.510> most<00:02:33.870> asked<00:02:34.139> question<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.829> when

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
idea now the most asked question is when

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.780 
idea now the most asked question is when
do<00:02:35.579> you<00:02:35.810> put<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.139> pin<00:02:37.379> I<00:02:37.680> pinball<00:02:38.129> pin<00:02:38.340> help<00:02:38.609> in

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
do you put the pin I pinball pin help in

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.709 
do you put the pin I pinball pin help in
whatever<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.299> are<00:02:39.420> using<00:02:39.859> into<00:02:40.859> the<00:02:40.950> clay<00:02:41.129> and

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:41.719 
whatever you are using into the clay and

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.440 
whatever you are using into the clay and
the<00:02:42.719> answer<00:02:43.049> is<00:02:43.230> before<00:02:43.859> baking<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.939> when

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
the answer is before baking it but when

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.479 
the answer is before baking it but when
before<00:02:45.659> baking<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.470> your<00:02:46.680> decision<00:02:46.859> it

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
before baking it is your decision it

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.879 
before baking it is your decision it
changes<00:02:48.209> according<00:02:48.359> to<00:02:48.780> what<00:02:49.260> piece<00:02:49.590> are<00:02:49.739> you

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
changes according to what piece are you

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.089 
changes according to what piece are you
doing<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.540> have<00:02:51.540> an<00:02:51.629> example<00:02:51.900> here<00:02:52.049> I<00:02:52.530> just<00:02:52.560> took

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
doing I have an example here I just took

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.220 
doing I have an example here I just took
a<00:02:53.400> bunch<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.760> scrubs<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.389> mixed<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:55.049> make

a bunch of scrubs and mixed it to make

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.729 
a bunch of scrubs and mixed it to make
an<00:02:55.439> ugly<00:02:55.769> color<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:57.349> it's<00:02:58.349> full<00:02:58.709> of

fill<00:03:01.200> in<00:03:01.349> things<00:03:01.530> let's<00:03:02.040> say<00:03:02.250> first<00:03:02.639> you<00:03:03.000> have

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
fill in things let's say first you have

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.309 
fill in things let's say first you have
to<00:03:04.040> sort<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.250> measure<00:03:05.639> how<00:03:06.150> long<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.840> pin<00:03:07.169> is

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
to sort of measure how long the I pin is

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:18.860 
to sort of measure how long the I pin is
going<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.769> go<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:10.879> cut<00:03:11.879> it

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.729 

and<00:03:20.000> you're<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.239> going<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.629> sort<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.530> who

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
and you're just going to sort of who

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.009 
and you're just going to sort of who
gets<00:03:22.920> word<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.519> center<00:03:24.120> or<00:03:24.300> what<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.690> want<00:03:24.900> it

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
gets word the center or what you want it

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.520 
gets word the center or what you want it
to<00:03:25.050> go<00:03:25.290> in<00:03:25.580> poke<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.879> holding<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.900> very<00:03:28.170> gently

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
to go in poke it holding it very gently

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.650 
to go in poke it holding it very gently
so<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.310> don't<00:03:29.489> warp<00:03:29.760> or<00:03:30.060> distort<00:03:30.510> the

so that you don't warp or distort the
shape<00:03:31.970> just<00:03:32.970> like<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.420> do<00:03:34.050> you<00:03:34.110> want<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.410> make

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
shape just like that do you want to make

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.559 
shape just like that do you want to make
it<00:03:34.709> just<00:03:34.980> like<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:35.340> nothing<00:03:36.060> will<00:03:36.209> happen<00:03:36.390> to

it just like this nothing will happen to

the metal or the clay the metal will be

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.300 
the metal or the clay the metal will be
fine<00:03:38.819> in<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.150> oven<00:03:39.450> after<00:03:40.410> breaking<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:41.040> can

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
fine in the oven after breaking you can

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.949 
fine in the oven after breaking you can
just<00:03:41.610> sort<00:03:42.150> of<00:03:42.420> pull<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.299> dip<00:03:45.299> this<00:03:45.540> in<00:03:45.810> a

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
just sort of pull it and dip this in a

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.910 
just sort of pull it and dip this in a
little<00:03:46.110> bit<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.410> glue<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.099> stick<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:47.940> right<00:03:47.970> in

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
little bit of glue and stick it right in

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.640 
little bit of glue and stick it right in
so<00:03:49.920> that<00:03:50.069> it<00:03:50.340> sticks<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:51.030> them<00:03:51.500> polymer<00:03:52.500> clay

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
so that it sticks to them polymer clay

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.850 
so that it sticks to them polymer clay
and<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.099> won't<00:03:53.340> fall<00:03:53.579> down<00:03:54.079> I've<00:03:55.079> seen<00:03:55.560> some

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
and it won't fall down I've seen some

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.150 
and it won't fall down I've seen some
people<00:03:56.099> recommending<00:03:57.060> using<00:03:57.510> TLS<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.769> baking

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
people recommending using TLS and baking

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.509 
people recommending using TLS and baking
it<00:03:59.220> but<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.290> don't<00:04:01.290> think<00:04:01.799> that<00:04:01.980> works<00:04:02.250> very

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
it but I don't think that works very

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.780 
it but I don't think that works very
well<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:03.540> will<00:04:04.140> is<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.980> still<00:04:05.370> has<00:04:05.640> the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
well it will is it still has the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.150 
well it will is it still has the
tendency<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.450> fall<00:04:06.720> it's<00:04:06.989> not<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.470> safest<00:04:07.980> a

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
tendency to fall it's not the safest a

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.970 
tendency to fall it's not the safest a
super<00:04:09.120> glue<00:04:09.299> or<00:04:09.690> an<00:04:09.930> industrial<00:04:10.230> glue<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:10.739> I

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
super glue or an industrial glue so I

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.839 
super glue or an industrial glue so I
prefer<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.579> use<00:04:11.610> glue<00:04:12.860> if<00:04:13.860> you<00:04:14.310> still<00:04:14.579> worried

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
prefer to use glue if you still worried

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.629 
prefer to use glue if you still worried
about<00:04:14.970> your<00:04:15.480> chums<00:04:15.870> falling<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:17.190> can<00:04:17.400> use<00:04:17.609> a

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
about your chums falling you can use a

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.430 
about your chums falling you can use a
head<00:04:18.000> pin<00:04:18.239> instead<00:04:18.799> all<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:19.859> have<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.519> do<00:04:20.669> is

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
head pin instead all you have to do is

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.460 
head pin instead all you have to do is
poke<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.800> like<00:04:23.550> this<00:04:23.910> still<00:04:24.660> holding<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.229> very

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
poke it like this still holding it very

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.409 
poke it like this still holding it very
gently<00:04:26.039> you<00:04:26.340> don't<00:04:26.880> want<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.479> warp<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.870> shape

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
gently you don't want to warp the shape

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.969 
gently you don't want to warp the shape
until<00:04:30.419> it<00:04:31.280> goes<00:04:32.280> through<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.820> other<00:04:32.910> way<00:04:33.210> and

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
until it goes through the other way and

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.589 
until it goes through the other way and
just<00:04:35.539> like<00:04:36.539> that<00:04:37.190> now<00:04:38.190> you<00:04:38.250> have<00:04:38.610> this<00:04:38.789> end<00:04:39.120> to

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
just like that now you have this end to

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.200 
just like that now you have this end to
secure<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.200> polymer<00:04:40.560> clay<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:41.039> can<00:04:41.400> just<00:04:41.789> cut

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
secure the polymer clay you can just cut

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.610 
secure the polymer clay you can just cut
this<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.750> make<00:04:43.169> a<00:04:43.200> loop<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:45.139> since<00:04:46.139> the<00:04:46.349> pin

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
this and make a loop and since the pin

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.089 
this and make a loop and since the pin
is<00:04:46.770> going<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.580> whole<00:04:47.610> way<00:04:48.090> through<00:04:48.120> your<00:04:48.630> clay

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
is going the whole way through your clay

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.520 
is going the whole way through your clay
it<00:04:50.099> won't<00:04:50.430> fall<00:04:50.700> down<00:04:50.780> so<00:04:51.780> you<00:04:51.840> won't<00:04:52.139> have<00:04:52.320> any

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
it won't fall down so you won't have any

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.629 
it won't fall down so you won't have any
loss<00:04:52.889> finally<00:04:53.400> any<00:04:53.610> lost<00:04:54.090> terms<00:04:55.190> now<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:56.250> can

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
loss finally any lost terms now you can

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.659 
loss finally any lost terms now you can
still<00:04:57.030> work<00:04:57.440> around<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.740> finding<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.490> can

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
still work around the finding you can

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.440 
still work around the finding you can
still<00:05:00.060> change<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.110> shape<00:05:01.500> refine<00:05:02.220> it<00:05:02.550> make<00:05:03.210> it

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
still change the shape refine it make it

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.510 
still change the shape refine it make it
whatever<00:05:03.930> you<00:05:04.169> want<00:05:04.380> and<00:05:04.680> since<00:05:04.919> this<00:05:05.190> looks

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
whatever you want and since this looks

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.010 
whatever you want and since this looks
kinda<00:05:06.030> like<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.210> strawberry<00:05:07.160> let's<00:05:08.160> say<00:05:08.490> I<00:05:09.020> want

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
kinda like a strawberry let's say I want

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.790 
kinda like a strawberry let's say I want
to<00:05:10.110> make<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.680> holes<00:05:11.010> of<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.490> strawberry<00:05:11.970> I

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
to make the holes of the strawberry I

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.650 
to make the holes of the strawberry I
can<00:05:13.800> actually<00:05:14.250> use<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.729> wire<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.960> hold<00:05:16.169> it

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
can actually use the wire to hold it

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.690 
can actually use the wire to hold it
without<00:05:18.660> touching<00:05:19.139> the<00:05:19.560> clay<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:20.010> therefore

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
without touching the clay and therefore

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.250 
without touching the clay and therefore
not<00:05:21.599> disturbing<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.910> little<00:05:24.360> strawberry

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
not disturbing the little strawberry

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.760 
not disturbing the little strawberry
seeds<00:05:26.300> if<00:05:27.300> your<00:05:27.539> polymer<00:05:27.870> clay<00:05:28.110> is<00:05:28.229> too<00:05:28.500> soft

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
seeds if your polymer clay is too soft

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.399 
seeds if your polymer clay is too soft
from<00:05:29.099> handing<00:05:29.640> you<00:05:29.940> may<00:05:30.150> want<00:05:30.390> to<00:05:30.570> let<00:05:30.719> it<00:05:30.870> go

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
from handing you may want to let it go

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.589 
from handing you may want to let it go
all<00:05:31.499> down<00:05:31.739> for<00:05:32.189> a<00:05:32.219> couple<00:05:32.789> of<00:05:32.909> minutes<00:05:33.330> maybe

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
all down for a couple of minutes maybe

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.449 
all down for a couple of minutes maybe
about<00:05:34.019> seven<00:05:34.409> minutes<00:05:34.529> until<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.219> clay<00:05:35.399> is

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:35.459 
about seven minutes until the clay is

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:40.549 
about seven minutes until the clay is
more<00:05:35.639> firm<00:05:36.289> you<00:05:37.289> can<00:05:37.439> even<00:05:37.649> freeze<00:05:38.129> it<00:05:38.369> but<00:05:39.559> it

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:40.559 
more firm you can even freeze it but it

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:43.779 
more firm you can even freeze it but it
makes<00:05:40.949> putting<00:05:41.699> in<00:05:41.999> the<00:05:42.149> charm<00:05:42.449> a<00:05:42.599> lot<00:05:42.899> harder

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
makes putting in the charm a lot harder

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:50.269 
makes putting in the charm a lot harder
look<00:05:44.789> I<00:05:45.029> can't<00:05:45.449> even<00:05:45.739> wash<00:05:46.739> it<00:05:48.169> and<00:05:49.169> in<00:05:50.039> the<00:05:50.159> end

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279 
look I can't even wash it and in the end

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:53.479 
look I can't even wash it and in the end
you<00:05:50.429> end<00:05:50.459> up<00:05:50.669> using<00:05:50.849> even<00:05:51.149> more<00:05:51.419> strength<00:05:52.489> so

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:53.489 
you end up using even more strength so

00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:56.449 
you end up using even more strength so
it's<00:05:53.639> best<00:05:53.879> if<00:05:54.119> you<00:05:54.300> just<00:05:54.569> try<00:05:54.959> to<00:05:54.989> use<00:05:55.349> a<00:05:55.619> very

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:56.459 
it's best if you just try to use a very

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:59.689 
it's best if you just try to use a very
soft<00:05:56.759> touch<00:05:57.029> and<00:05:57.989> let<00:05:58.499> it<00:05:58.649> cool<00:05:58.860> just<00:05:59.279> very

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
soft touch and let it cool just very

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.159 
soft touch and let it cool just very
slightly<00:06:00.059> looking<00:06:00.509> I<00:06:01.139> even<00:06:01.739> got<00:06:01.919> it<00:06:02.099> all<00:06:02.279> wrong

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
slightly looking I even got it all wrong

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.629 
slightly looking I even got it all wrong
so<00:06:04.169> that's<00:06:04.469> it<00:06:04.679> I<00:06:04.860> hope<00:06:05.069> you<00:06:05.249> found<00:06:05.399> it<00:06:05.579> useful
