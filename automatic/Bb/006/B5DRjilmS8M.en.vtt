00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
this the therapy off with no testing but

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.730 
this the therapy off with no testing but
oftentimes<00:01:41.060> we<00:01:41.450> need<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.659> very<00:01:42.319> comprehensive

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
approach because these are complicated

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.480 
approach because these are complicated
problems<00:01:45.520> okay<00:01:46.520> what<00:01:46.999> do<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.119> call<00:01:47.329> it<00:01:47.389> a
