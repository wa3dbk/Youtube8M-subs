00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.910
 Though it is e-mail magazine such as bed of this week 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:14.050
 I think I want to do a little bit about the back strike method 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.620
 Well because myself not at all use the back and try to do it yourself 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:21.170
 It is better to do this 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:24.320
 Such a Kaato where it 's such a successful look at the Toka form of the top players Tokoroki 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.920
 I would like to explain for a moment where it is better to add 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:32.570
 a Correctly it's time to hit the back side 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.320
 There is a person who tends to go up the head, but this is a bit different from myself 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.610
 I think 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.530
 After all it is hard or after 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.750
 Have fallen finesse to yellow the racket head and have a look at that back of good players 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.310
 It is in the state of being turned towards oneself 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.600
 It is shaped like a start swinging the color 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:53.750
 I can't make much of this here, and I'm shaking it from this place and drive 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.940
 There is a point that such basic technology is not stable 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.940
 After that is the time of shaking 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.270
 Issue a target 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:07.060
 Too late 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:10.900
 Moller Rodents Tara tip want to get off doing this in order to give people power that would go to the side 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.260
 Becomes the Tteyuu know I do this but I 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.440
 The time to return is delayed 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.440
 this 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.570
 The center is about to lie 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.240
 If you stop it, it 's a continuous attack 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:30.660
 It can be to in the two points because there is a place Tteyuu can quickly prepare for the next ball 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.250
 I thought I could do well if I was careful 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:38.360
 Well, I can't really do it on the other side because it's an impression I'm trying to do 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.510
 Well back eyes small middle and old car 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.010
 It is for 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.150
 I think that what information can be used 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.080
 The 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.080
 Please watch the video 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.420
 The 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.000
 Hmm 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.090
 pa 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.360
 th 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.939
 What 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.440
 th 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.649
