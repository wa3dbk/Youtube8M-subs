00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.759
 my today's loks challenge exists 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.529
 to remove a graffiti from the train 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.090
 That's why I follow the rules here 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.230
 I drove in berlin extra 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.790
 thrown and meet me there now 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.870
 front with the guys and then we look 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.530
 Let's get off the train as we did the thing 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.760
 be beaten 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.930
 let's detlef funny today you go 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.990
 into the graffiti and we have already 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.570
 beautifully dressed protective clothing 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.130
 why it is due to the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.289
 you have to have occupational safety 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.390
 Safety gloves once suit 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.570
 wear goggles and you have here 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.410
 below it all, we designed place 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.550
 also from dull - to the color reste 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.410
 catch 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.750
 which are then professional not disposed of 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.489
 okay what exactly are we doing today specifically 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.449
 Are we doing that today? 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.190
 about ten square meters thorens yes we 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.129
 Carry the graffiti removal agent 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.129
 on the vehicle and will that 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.000
 let it react for about five 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.190
 to six minutes 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.229
 we will see that graffiti comes off 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.610
 and then we will do it by means of a 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.150
 deduct deduction 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.189
 the leftovers fall on the mats then 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.710
 let it out let us begin to 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.509
 thing exactly 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.820
 the first step we do that 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.549
 Applying graffiti removal 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.530
 medium yes it has such a common 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.060
 Consistent right there are two 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.820
 different medium 814 elektra the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.000
 game then there is still liquid that 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.479
 we'll do it in second gear and 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.960
 it just becomes circular 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.430
 we have a maximum of two here 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.500
 layers together 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.960
 she is herself it is relatively fast 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.319
 and simple well, unfortunately, is not always 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.319
 the case 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:56.259
 we do not always do that much for us 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.659
 piece for the art the graffiti 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.020
 away is also that the paint of the 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.250
 vehicle damaged would be okay yes that 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.390
 means this means attacks the lag 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.410
 actually already on 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.299
 Well then we come to the second 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.459
 have walked the example sold 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.459
 we have to deduct 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.440
 than then you can shoot 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.099
 then the shutdown is on the mats 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:34.159
 Everything is beautiful and there are so many graffiti 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.959
 are removed so because of the day 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.940
 It always depends on it so I can 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.180
 now only the number be, we have this 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:48.930
 year 7100 square meters approximately from 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:50.069
 Vehicles removed 7103 we have 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.819
 the second phase is about 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.510
 We accept the liquid payment 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.510
 and do it exactly 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.099
 Here are some places that are extreme 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.739
 are stubborn, we are secretly the 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.450
 edit in the wake must first 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.250
 see that we have to do it all now 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.370
 down and then we have to start with 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.590
 to neutralize neutralize means 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.150
 that we would remove the graffiti 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.120
 completely bring down again 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.829
 ok and neutralize also means that 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.629
 This medium-graffiti no longer 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.470
 can work and therefore that means you 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.470
 times much water 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.670
 yes that's fun 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.980
 what kind of harm is there for 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.799
 the tracks as by vandalism about 30 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.120
 millions of vandalism not only as 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.950
 captain but also destruction of 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.780
 Interior and falls to me, of course 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.819
 the question where all this graffiti 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.579
 ever be opened mostly in 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.180
 the parking facilities the sprayers we are 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:10.150
 Not at all in which danger you problem 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.000
 explain the track overheads at 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.019
 The subway in this stream fell but 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.019
 later extremely 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.070
 So I think we have the condition 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.880
 is getting properly clean again 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.980
 Of course there are a few more 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.510
 be reworked because I will 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.590
 I'll continue right away, too 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.810
 would say that I already have the 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.160
 Challenge I have noticed, however 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.510
 that too is a pagan work 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.040
 graffiti from the train back down 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.600
 my poor ones are getting heavy but it 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.169
 does not help anything I have to go back 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.169
 insofar
