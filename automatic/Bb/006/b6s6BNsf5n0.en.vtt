very long to build yeah are going to be
futures<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.060> series<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.290> I

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
futures in this series just because I

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.030 
futures in this series just because I
don't<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.909> them<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.810> normal<00:01:10.680> spirit

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
don't see them as really normal spirit

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.340 
don't see them as really normal spirit
built<00:01:11.250> or<00:01:11.460> house<00:01:11.670> building<00:01:12.030> videos<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.290> do

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
built or house building videos but I do

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.620 
built or house building videos but I do
would<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.640> make<00:01:14.939> some<00:01:15.240> videos<00:01:15.600> about

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
would like to make some videos about

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.170 
would like to make some videos about
them<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:17.189> imagine<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.700> people

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
them because I can imagine that people

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.969 
them because I can imagine that people
would<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.479> see<00:01:18.810> me<00:01:18.869> building<00:01:19.409> stuff<00:01:19.710> and

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
would like to see me building stuff and

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.870 
would like to see me building stuff and
then<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.509> perfect<00:01:22.220> yeah<00:01:23.220> this

then this is just the perfect yeah this
can<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.240> give<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.720> some<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.110> inspiration

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
can just give you some more inspiration

can just give you some more inspiration
maybe<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.310> that's<00:01:26.520> actually<00:01:26.850> why<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.270> might

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
maybe so that's actually why I might

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.800 
maybe so that's actually why I might
make<00:01:28.200> these<00:01:28.409> videos<00:01:28.799> because<00:01:29.329> these<00:01:30.329> English

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
make these videos because these English

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.690 
make these videos because these English
videos<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.409> will<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.829> make<00:01:32.070> us<00:01:32.340> some<00:01:33.000> smaller

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
videos I will just make us some smaller

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.249 
videos I will just make us some smaller
you<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.820> buildings<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> world<00:01:37.049> I'm

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you have buildings for in the world I'm

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.289 
you have buildings for in the world I'm
creating<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.400> actually<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> first

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
creating so this is actually the first

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.670 
creating so this is actually the first
bridge<00:01:39.860> then<00:01:40.860> I've<00:01:41.040> created<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.610> new<00:01:42.270> world

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
bridge then I've created for new world

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.310 
bridge then I've created for new world
so<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.070> Beach<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.970> next<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:45.899> will<00:01:46.290> be

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
so this is Beach one and next up will be

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.719 
so this is Beach one and next up will be
part<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.909> believe<00:01:48.320> but<00:01:49.490> yeah<00:01:50.490> that's

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
part one I believe but yeah that's

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.130 
part one I believe but yeah that's
actually<00:01:51.030> what<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:52.380> series<00:01:52.920> kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.460> real

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
actually what this series kind of real

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.590 
actually what this series kind of real
give<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.100> so<00:01:55.250> actually<00:01:55.550> it<00:01:55.730> are<00:01:55.910> just<00:01:56.180> normal

give you so actually it are just normal

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.030 
give you so actually it are just normal
speed<00:01:56.870> built<00:01:57.140> only<00:01:57.740> then<00:01:58.250> they<00:01:59.000> are<00:01:59.390> in<00:01:59.840> a<00:02:00.470> road

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
speed built only then they are in a road

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.100 
speed built only then they are in a road
you<00:02:01.280> probably<00:02:01.880> don't<00:02:02.210> know<00:02:02.360> yet<00:02:02.600> just<00:02:02.870> because

it's the world that I've just started to

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.200 
it's the world that I've just started to
create<00:02:05.900> so<00:02:07.270> yeah<00:02:08.270> as<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.570> can<00:02:08.600> see<00:02:08.750> um<00:02:09.290> this

create so yeah as you can see um this

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.350 
create so yeah as you can see um this
building<00:02:11.210> or<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:12.020> Beach<00:02:12.320> is<00:02:13.060> not<00:02:14.060> really<00:02:14.330> a

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
building or this Beach is not really a

special thing I believe or yeah
something<00:02:51.830> like<00:02:51.890> that

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
something like that

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.500 
something like that
and<00:02:53.710> yes<00:02:54.710> it's<00:02:55.070> on<00:02:55.460> the<00:02:55.610> island<00:02:55.640> that<00:02:56.360> we've

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
and yes it's on the island that we've

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.260 
and yes it's on the island that we've
created<00:02:56.840> in<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.560> first<00:02:57.770> part<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.459> this<00:02:58.760> series

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
created in the first part of this series

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.100 
created in the first part of this series
and<00:02:59.570> you've<00:03:00.380> probably<00:03:00.650> seen<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:02.450> island<00:03:02.930> when

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
and you've probably seen the island when

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.160 
and you've probably seen the island when
you've<00:03:03.260> seen<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.560> series<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:05.360> think<00:03:05.720> it's

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
you've seen a series and I think it's

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.500 
you've seen a series and I think it's
that<00:03:07.070> item<00:03:07.459> turned<00:03:07.610> out<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.910> look<00:03:08.030> pretty<00:03:08.270> cool

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
that item turned out to look pretty cool

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.920 
that item turned out to look pretty cool
and<00:03:08.840> this<00:03:09.350> building<00:03:10.340> will<00:03:10.459> also<00:03:10.550> quite<00:03:11.030> fit

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
and this building will also quite fit

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.590 
and this building will also quite fit
quite<00:03:12.140> well<00:03:12.500> on<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:13.430> island<00:03:13.640> gasps<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.390> think

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
quite well on the island gasps I think

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.500 
quite well on the island gasps I think
it<00:03:15.500> turns<00:03:15.860> out<00:03:16.070> to<00:03:16.220> be<00:03:16.250> quite<00:03:16.610> busy<00:03:16.910> as<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.360> can

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
it turns out to be quite busy as you can

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.890 
it turns out to be quite busy as you can
see<00:03:17.720> at<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:17.959> moment<00:03:18.260> I'm<00:03:18.410> adding<00:03:18.800> some<00:03:19.040> beach

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
see at the moment I'm adding some beach

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.860 
see at the moment I'm adding some beach
we<00:03:20.900> have<00:03:21.050> themed<00:03:21.620> or<00:03:21.890> textured<00:03:22.870> wall

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
we have themed or textured wall

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.620 
we have themed or textured wall
paintings<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.709> building<00:03:25.310> so<00:03:25.640> in<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.480> end

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
paintings to the building so in the end

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.650 
paintings to the building so in the end
I<00:03:26.810> think<00:03:27.050> it<00:03:27.140> will<00:03:27.290> turn<00:03:27.530> out<00:03:27.650> pretty<00:03:27.980> cool<00:03:28.660> so

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
you some inspiration with for example

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.240 
you some inspiration with for example
textures<00:03:45.890> or<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.610> ways<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.420> built<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:48.410> fathers

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
textures or a ways I built so I fathers

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.940 
textures or a ways I built so I fathers
would<00:03:49.370> be<00:03:49.520> quite<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.820> good<00:03:50.180> idea

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
would be quite a good idea

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.890 
would be quite a good idea
to<00:03:51.950> do<00:03:52.130> because<00:03:52.340> ever<00:03:52.700> would<00:03:52.940> have<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.360> do<00:03:53.630> more

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
to do because ever would have to do more

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.480 
to do because ever would have to do more
at<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:55.310> building<00:03:55.850> video<00:03:56.420> to<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.370> just<00:03:58.370> the

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
at this building video to the just the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.240 
at this building video to the just the
normal<00:03:58.910> parts<00:03:59.300> of<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.630> series<00:04:00.080> I<00:04:00.350> think<00:04:00.710> it

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
normal parts of the series I think it

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.210 
normal parts of the series I think it
would<00:04:01.490> take<00:04:01.940> too<00:04:02.240> long<00:04:02.420> to<00:04:02.660> create<00:04:03.440> one<00:04:03.860> part

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
would take too long to create one part

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.460 
would take too long to create one part
of<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.520> series<00:04:04.970> no<00:04:05.660> so<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:05.900> know<00:04:05.960> that<00:04:06.110> some

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
of the series no so I know that some

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.790 
of the series no so I know that some
people<00:04:06.500> would<00:04:06.890> just<00:04:06.920> like<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.310> watch<00:04:07.880> only

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
people would just like to watch only

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.260 
people would just like to watch only

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
building videos in which I build this

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.290 
building videos in which I build this
and<00:04:11.510> not<00:04:11.630> just<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:12.020> world<00:04:12.230> so<00:04:12.800> you<00:04:13.730> kind<00:04:14.240> of

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
of making that building and now in the

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.830 
of making that building and now in the
second<00:04:28.640> group<00:04:28.760> kind<00:04:29.150> of<00:04:29.270> started<00:04:29.660> with<00:04:29.750> the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
second group kind of started with the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.320 
second group kind of started with the
landscaping<00:04:30.470> adding<00:04:30.980> some<00:04:31.190> more<00:04:31.340> beach<00:04:31.670> areas

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
landscaping adding some more beach areas

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.020 
landscaping adding some more beach areas
I<00:04:32.810> add<00:04:33.470> some<00:04:33.740> sand<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:34.310> was<00:04:34.490> quite<00:04:34.790> difficult

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
I add some sand it was quite difficult

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.210 
I add some sand it was quite difficult
to<00:04:35.270> find<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.750> goods<00:04:36.110> or<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.440> right<00:04:36.740> color<00:04:37.040> of

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
to find the goods or the right color of

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.090 
to find the goods or the right color of
sand<00:04:37.580> actually<00:04:37.820> no<00:04:38.600> no<00:04:38.720> why<00:04:38.960> I<00:04:38.990> think<00:04:39.860> it

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
sand actually no no why I think it

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.040 
sand actually no no why I think it
should<00:04:40.430> be<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.820> urban<00:04:41.120> maybe<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.420> don't<00:04:41.540> have

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
should be the urban maybe I don't have

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.140 
should be the urban maybe I don't have
the<00:04:42.320> right<00:04:42.830> color<00:04:43.100> offset<00:04:43.310> I<00:04:43.760> don't<00:04:43.970> really

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
the right color offset I don't really

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.220 
the right color offset I don't really
know<00:04:44.480> but<00:04:45.410> yeah<00:04:45.950> that<00:04:46.160> was<00:04:46.220> kinda<00:04:46.520> strange<00:04:47.230> so

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
know but yeah that was kinda strange so

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.850 
know but yeah that was kinda strange so
we<00:04:48.530> kind<00:04:48.950> of<00:04:49.040> add<00:04:49.310> like<00:04:49.730> a<00:04:50.600> longer<00:04:51.170> piece<00:04:51.410> and

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
we kind of add like a longer piece and

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.640 
we kind of add like a longer piece and
then<00:04:52.190> in<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.580> end<00:04:52.790> which<00:04:53.510> is<00:04:53.690> about<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.230> ocean

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
then in the end which is about the ocean

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.340 
then in the end which is about the ocean
I<00:04:54.860> think<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:55.700> can<00:04:55.910> understand<00:04:56.390> that<00:04:56.570> there

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
I think you can understand that there

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.860 
I think you can understand that there
will<00:04:57.380> also<00:04:57.680> be<00:04:57.860> some<00:04:58.430> other<00:04:58.610> seating<00:04:59.090> areas

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
will also be some other seating areas

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.310 
will also be some other seating areas
yes<00:05:00.110> you<00:05:00.260> can<00:05:00.560> see<00:05:00.890> it<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:02.000> also<00:05:02.300> add<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.930> boat

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
yes you can see it and also add a boat

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.680 
yes you can see it and also add a boat
which<00:05:04.100> i<00:05:04.220> think<00:05:04.370> is<00:05:04.520> pretty<00:05:04.670> epic<00:05:05.060> because

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
which i think is pretty epic because

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.370 
which i think is pretty epic because
already<00:05:05.960> like<00:05:06.350> boats<00:05:07.390> so<00:05:08.390> we<00:05:08.750> add<00:05:08.900> some<00:05:09.110> stone

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
already like boats so we add some stone

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.380 
already like boats so we add some stone
some<00:05:09.680> decoration<00:05:10.310> just<00:05:10.340> some<00:05:10.670> plants<00:05:11.180> and

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
some decoration just some plants and

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.290 
some decoration just some plants and
then<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:12.680> speedboat<00:05:13.130> will<00:05:13.430> be<00:05:13.610> done<00:05:13.910> already

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
then the speedboat will be done already

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.250 
then the speedboat will be done already
in<00:05:14.630> like<00:05:15.200> a<00:05:15.230> minute<00:05:15.590> or<00:05:15.800> something<00:05:16.250> I'll<00:05:16.610> come

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
in like a minute or something I'll come

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.890 
in like a minute or something I'll come
unfortunately<00:05:18.260> make<00:05:18.620> a<00:05:19.420> flight<00:05:20.420> or<00:05:20.600> video

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
unfortunately make a flight or video

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.890 
unfortunately make a flight or video
because<00:05:21.560> yeah<00:05:22.520> I<00:05:22.760> have<00:05:22.970> to<00:05:23.090> build<00:05:23.360> this<00:05:23.570> kind

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
because yeah I have to build this kind

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.320

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
of in creative world but then in the

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.850 
of in creative world but then in the
sims<00:05:26.750> edit<00:05:27.110> mode<00:05:27.290> so<00:05:27.650> I<00:05:27.890> can't<00:05:28.450> really<00:05:29.800> how<00:05:30.800> to

say that just make a fly to like a

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.530 
say that just make a fly to like a
normally

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
normally

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.460 
normally
