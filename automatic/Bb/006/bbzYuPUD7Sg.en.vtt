the web md's in the comments section are
saying<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.040> guy<00:02:40.190> probably<00:02:40.460> has<00:02:40.700> a

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
saying that this guy probably has a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.160 
saying that this guy probably has a
heart<00:02:41.090> condition<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.540> he<00:02:41.660> needs<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.900> get<00:02:42.080> it

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.590 
but my guess is that you can't actually
diagnose<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.070> heart<00:02:46.400> condition<00:02:46.520> from<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.270> granny
