that<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.830> spawns<00:03:08.130> are<00:03:08.280> hugely<00:03:08.550> important<00:03:09.120> in

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
that the spawns are hugely important in

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.390 
that the spawns are hugely important in
this<00:03:09.540> construction<00:03:09.959> here<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.350> there<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:11.130> pays

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
this construction here and there it pays

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.740 
this construction here and there it pays
off<00:03:11.580> because<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.150> guy<00:03:12.270> just<00:03:12.330> spawn<00:03:12.660> behind

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
off because that guy just spawn behind

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.510 
off because that guy just spawn behind
me<00:03:12.990> then<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.230> spawn<00:03:13.440> behind<00:03:13.560> him<00:03:13.890> then<00:03:14.100> someday

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
me then I spawn behind him then someday

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.650 
me then I spawn behind him then someday
I'll<00:03:14.610> spawn<00:03:14.820> behind<00:03:14.940> me<00:03:15.209> it's<00:03:15.330> madness<00:03:16.310> yeah

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
I'll spawn behind me it's madness yeah
