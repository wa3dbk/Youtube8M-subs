there and today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.799> make<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.490> upside<00:00:09.420> down<00:00:09.630> fire<00:00:10.019> that's

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
how to make a upside down fire that's

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.400 
how to make a upside down fire that's
what<00:00:11.730> it's<00:00:11.880> can<00:00:12.300> be<00:00:12.420> called<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.809> pyramid<00:00:13.200> fire

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
what it's can be called a pyramid fire

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.430 
what it's can be called a pyramid fire
it's<00:00:14.009> got<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> load<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.429> different<00:00:14.700> names<00:00:14.880> but

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
it's got a load of different names but

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.810 
it's got a load of different names but
basically<00:00:17.060> you<00:00:18.060> get<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.270> base<00:00:18.680> sticks<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.189> then

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
basically you get a base sticks and then

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.990 
basically you get a base sticks and then
you<00:00:21.000> pile<00:00:21.449> your<00:00:21.570> sticks<00:00:22.279> crisscrossed<00:00:23.279> sort

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
you pile your sticks crisscrossed sort

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.050 
you pile your sticks crisscrossed sort
of<00:00:24.180> them<00:00:24.390> you'd<00:00:25.170> build<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.560> up<00:00:25.619> like<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:26.060> log

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
of them you'd build it up like a log

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.790 
of them you'd build it up like a log
cabin<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.039> then<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.250> coals<00:00:30.210> will<00:00:30.779> burn<00:00:31.500> down

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
cabin and then the coals will burn down

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.740 
cabin and then the coals will burn down
from<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> top<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.700> burn<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.210> down<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.719> it

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
from the top and burn it down so it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.170 
from the top and burn it down so it
feeds<00:00:34.170> itself<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.190> leave<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:36.090> you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
feeds itself so you can leave it and you

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.060 
feeds itself so you can leave it and you
don't<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.750> look<00:00:37.350> after<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.800> or<00:00:37.920> add

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
don't have to look after it or add

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.850 
don't have to look after it or add
anything<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.840> so<00:00:39.840> when<00:00:40.110> I've<00:00:40.410> never<00:00:40.620> tried

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
anything on it so when I've never tried

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.920 
anything on it so when I've never tried
this<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.250> before<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.579> she'll<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.480> good<00:00:42.629> see

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
this one before so she'll be good see

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.100 
this one before so she'll be good see
what<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.590> what<00:00:43.980> happens<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.809> got<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.899> idea

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
what it what happens I got this idea

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.189 
what it what happens I got this idea
from<00:00:46.410> an<00:00:47.059> eyesore<00:00:48.230> what's<00:00:49.230> his<00:00:49.379> name<00:00:51.199> hedgehog

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
from an eyesore what's his name hedgehog

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.470 
from an eyesore what's his name hedgehog
leatherworks<00:00:52.800> he's<00:00:53.520> another<00:00:53.910> bushcraft

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
leatherworks he's another bushcraft

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.240 
leatherworks he's another bushcraft
channel<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.899> he<00:00:55.050> did<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.320> idea<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.100> I

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
channel and he did this idea and I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.830 
channel and he did this idea and I
thought<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.670> quite<00:00:56.879> good<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> try<00:00:57.360> out<00:00:57.539> so

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
thought to be quite good to try out so

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.270 
thought to be quite good to try out so
when<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.469> back<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.949> I've<00:00:59.070> started

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
when I get back to you and I've started

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.969 
when I get back to you and I've started
to<00:00:59.489> build<00:00:59.640> it<00:01:03.019> alright<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.320> we've<00:01:04.500> got<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> base

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
to build it alright so we've got a base

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.890 
to build it alright so we've got a base
and<00:01:05.369> now<00:01:06.210> we're<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.689> start

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and now we're just going to start

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.500 
and now we're just going to start
putting<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> sticks<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.400> grate<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
putting the sticks on it to grate it and

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.430 
putting the sticks on it to grate it and
build<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.780> up

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.160 

make<00:01:16.440> sure<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.740> get<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> good<00:01:16.980> amount<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:18.170> each

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
make sure you get a good amount of each

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:35.300 
make sure you get a good amount of each
slot<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.770> put<00:01:19.980> on

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.399 

so<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.360> should<00:01:36.540> look<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:36.780> something<00:01:37.380> that

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
so it should look like something that

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.710 
so it should look like something that
dark<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.040> then<00:01:38.579> I'm<00:01:39.329> going<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.540> make<00:01:39.689> a

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
dark and then I'm going to make a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.499 
dark and then I'm going to make a
pyramid<00:01:40.079> out<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.829> sticks<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.880> put<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.149> tinder

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
pyramid out of sticks to put the tinder

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.539 
pyramid out of sticks to put the tinder
inside<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:43.619> I'll<00:01:43.799> help<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.399> get

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
inside and then I'll help it to get

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.380 
inside and then I'll help it to get
going<00:01:44.789> so<00:01:46.340> I've<00:01:47.340> made<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> pyramid<00:01:48.090> for<00:01:48.329> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
going so I've made the pyramid for it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.810 
going so I've made the pyramid for it
now<00:01:48.539> so<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.350> got<00:01:49.619> some<00:01:49.770> tinder<00:01:50.189> dry<00:01:50.520> tinder

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
now so just got some tinder dry tinder

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.899 
now so just got some tinder dry tinder
in<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.119> middle<00:01:51.360> there<00:01:51.830> then<00:01:52.830> some<00:01:53.310> very<00:01:53.549> thin

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
in the middle there then some very thin

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.830 
in the middle there then some very thin
small<00:01:54.240> twigs<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.049> some<00:01:55.710> birch<00:01:56.159> bark<00:01:56.840> so

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
small twigs and then some birch bark so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.389 
small twigs and then some birch bark so
then<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.140> pyramids<00:01:58.500> built<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.860> around<00:01:59.009> that

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
then the pyramids built up around that

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.760 
then the pyramids built up around that
so<00:01:59.700> then<00:01:59.850> when<00:01:59.970> I<00:02:00.000> put<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.509> set<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.049> fire<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
so then when I put it set that fire it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.580 
so then when I put it set that fire it
should<00:02:02.070> just<00:02:02.100> all<00:02:02.429> go<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:03.960> I'm<00:02:04.049> hoping<00:02:04.350> anyway

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
should just all go so I'm hoping anyway

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:40.490 
should just all go so I'm hoping anyway
so<00:02:04.880> let's<00:02:05.880> try

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.850 

off<00:02:41.500> rieter<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:43.060> get<00:02:43.240> about<00:02:43.540> 30<00:02:43.930> seconds<00:02:44.620> now

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
off rieter and get about 30 seconds now

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.550 
off rieter and get about 30 seconds now
and<00:02:45.250> then<00:02:45.430> it's<00:02:46.270> already<00:02:46.420> got<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.690> pretty<00:02:47.350> good

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
and then it's already got a pretty good

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.740 
and then it's already got a pretty good
flame<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.819> I'm<00:02:48.880> quite<00:02:49.090> impressed<00:02:49.209> with<00:02:49.600> it

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
flame so I'm quite impressed with it

00:02:49.750 --> 00:03:19.430 
flame so I'm quite impressed with it
then<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:52.750> startup<00:02:53.650> method<00:02:54.450> it's<00:02:55.450> quite<00:02:55.690> good

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.380 

alright<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.740> this<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.340> fire<00:03:21.760> after<00:03:22.150> about

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
alright and this is a fire after about

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.460 
alright and this is a fire after about
I'd<00:03:22.959> say<00:03:23.020> about<00:03:23.200> 10<00:03:23.620> minutes<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:26.260> going

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
I'd say about 10 minutes and it's going

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.860 
I'd say about 10 minutes and it's going
brilliantly<00:03:26.740> it's<00:03:27.730> just<00:03:28.209> burning<00:03:28.420> straight

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
brilliantly it's just burning straight

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.900 
brilliantly it's just burning straight
down<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.140> middle<00:03:30.180> very<00:03:31.180> hot<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:32.190> guess<00:03:33.190> good

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
down the middle very hot I guess good

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.400 
down the middle very hot I guess good
thing<00:03:34.060> about<00:03:34.180> this<00:03:34.390> sort<00:03:34.630> of<00:03:34.720> far<00:03:34.930> as<00:03:35.080> well<00:03:35.260> you

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
thing about this sort of far as well you

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.229 
thing about this sort of far as well you
can<00:03:35.440> write<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:36.040> decide<00:03:36.610> how<00:03:36.880> long<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:37.120> want

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
can write and decide how long you want

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.510 
can write and decide how long you want
it<00:03:37.510> burning<00:03:37.780> if<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.620> put<00:03:38.800> a<00:03:38.830> lot<00:03:39.040> on<00:03:39.100> it'll

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
it burning if you put a lot on it'll

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.680 
it burning if you put a lot on it'll
burn<00:03:39.640> for<00:03:39.670> longer<00:03:40.120> if<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.330> don't<00:03:40.510> put<00:03:40.660> that

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
burn for longer if you don't put that

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.630 
burn for longer if you don't put that
much<00:03:40.810> on<00:03:41.140> then<00:03:41.319> it'll<00:03:41.560> obviously<00:03:41.770> won't<00:03:42.400> burn

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
much on then it'll obviously won't burn

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.530 
much on then it'll obviously won't burn
for<00:03:42.850> as<00:03:42.910> long<00:03:43.060> but<00:03:43.470> it's<00:03:44.470> definitely<00:03:45.010> a

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
for as long but it's definitely a

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.620 
for as long but it's definitely a
brilliant<00:03:46.540> way<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:47.190> starting<00:03:48.190> your<00:03:48.280> fire<00:03:48.630> when

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
brilliant way of starting your fire when

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.600 
brilliant way of starting your fire when
it<00:03:49.750> gets<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:50.080> bit<00:03:50.110> when<00:03:50.530> there's<00:03:50.800> more<00:03:50.950> coals<00:03:51.370> I

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
it gets a bit when there's more coals I

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.030 
it gets a bit when there's more coals I
think<00:03:51.790> we're<00:03:52.030> going<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.410> stick<00:03:53.410> some<00:03:53.590> food<00:03:53.860> on

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
think we're going to stick some food on

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.670 
think we're going to stick some food on
there<00:03:54.310> or<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:55.269> I<00:03:55.510> just<00:03:55.840> let<00:03:56.019> it<00:03:56.140> burn<00:03:56.320> for<00:03:56.620> a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
there or and I just let it burn for a

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.320 
there or and I just let it burn for a
bit<00:03:56.800> longer<00:03:59.040> all<00:04:00.040> right<00:04:00.190> it's<00:04:00.489> an<00:04:00.820> probably

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
bit longer all right it's an probably

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.360 
bit longer all right it's an probably
off<00:04:01.630> about<00:04:01.840> 20<00:04:02.170> minutes<00:04:02.320> now<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.830> I've

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
off about 20 minutes now and I've

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.100 
off about 20 minutes now and I've
decided<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.209> put<00:04:04.420> my<00:04:04.830> bill<00:04:05.830> eating<00:04:06.160> on<00:04:07.110> boil

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
decided to put my bill eating on boil

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.949 
decided to put my bill eating on boil
some<00:04:08.260> water<00:04:08.410> some<00:04:08.950> soup<00:04:09.540> put<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.690> flames
