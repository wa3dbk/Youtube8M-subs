 the hotel we moved to 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.520
 located in downtown seat close to 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.560

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:33.170
 there is immediately a locker for clothes 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:36.719
 I still had almost nothing to put on the safe and 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.690
 some boxes in my bag is worth nothing 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.379
 such as here on the side ironing 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.370
