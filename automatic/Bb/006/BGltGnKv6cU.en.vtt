loyal<00:00:05.580> excitement<00:00:06.089> is<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.210> culmination<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:07.109> a

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
loyal excitement is a culmination of a

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.350 
loyal excitement is a culmination of a
year's<00:00:07.890> worth<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.429> hard<00:00:08.700> training<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.240> we've

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
year's worth of hard training that we've

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.740 
year's worth of hard training that we've
done<00:00:09.860> in<00:00:10.860> all<00:00:11.070> phases<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.519> war<00:00:11.790> lots<00:00:12.570> of

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
done in all phases of war lots of

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.140 
done in all phases of war lots of
exercises<00:00:13.559> both<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.980> battalion<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.910> Brigade

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
exercises both a battalion and Brigade

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.510 
exercises both a battalion and Brigade
level<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.949> essentially<00:00:16.949> what's<00:00:17.130> happening

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
level and essentially what's happening

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.490 
level and essentially what's happening
is<00:00:17.699> there's<00:00:18.000> three<00:00:18.420> stands<00:00:18.840> have<00:00:19.109> been<00:00:19.260> set<00:00:19.470> up

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
is there's three stands have been set up

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.609 
is there's three stands have been set up
so<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.250> first<00:00:20.460> stand<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.090> an<00:00:22.020> assault<00:00:22.380> boat

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
so the first stand is an assault boat

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.920 
so the first stand is an assault boat
range<00:00:23.310> which<00:00:23.820> allows<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.330> soldiers<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.810> do

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
range which allows the soldiers to do

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.800 
range which allows the soldiers to do
something<00:00:25.289> which<00:00:25.470> normally<00:00:26.070> isn't<00:00:26.340> done<00:00:26.460> and

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
something which normally isn't done and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.720 
something which normally isn't done and
it's<00:00:27.810> firing<00:00:28.080> live<00:00:28.470> from<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.250> assault<00:00:29.490> boats

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
it's firing live from the assault boats

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.290 
it's firing live from the assault boats
on<00:00:30.029> targets<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> lake<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.470> our<00:00:31.590> rear<00:00:38.300> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
on targets on the lake to our rear to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.850 
on targets on the lake to our rear to
other<00:00:39.480> stands<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.079> set<00:00:40.260> up<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
other stands we have set up one is a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.310 
other stands we have set up one is a
very<00:00:41.430> challenging<00:00:41.670> rappel<00:00:42.360> site<00:00:42.690> stand<00:00:43.079> on

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
very challenging rappel site stand on

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.799 
very challenging rappel site stand on
the<00:00:43.469> Quebec<00:00:43.800> side<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.940> Ottawa<00:00:45.180> River<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the Quebec side of the Ottawa River and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.560 
the Quebec side of the Ottawa River and
it's<00:00:45.989> about<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.260> 350<00:00:47.160> foot<00:00:47.460> rappel<00:00:48.090> down<00:00:48.510> a

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it's about a 350 foot rappel down a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.720 
it's about a 350 foot rappel down a
pretty<00:00:49.289> challenging<00:00:49.530> cliff<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.340> that'll

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
pretty challenging cliff and that'll

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.400 
pretty challenging cliff and that'll
really<00:00:50.969> give<00:00:51.270> them<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.480> good<00:00:51.510> test<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.140> see<00:00:52.199> how

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
really give them a good test to see how

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.080 
really give them a good test to see how
they<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.590> come<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:52.949> over<00:00:53.219> top<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.610> cliff

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
they do come on over top of that cliff

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.130 
they do come on over top of that cliff
face<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.449> looking<00:00:54.930> straight<00:00:55.170> down<00:00:55.199> 350<00:00:56.070> feet

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.720 

the<00:01:01.140> third<00:01:01.410> stand<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:01.890> set<00:01:02.309> up<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the third stand we have set up is a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.960 
the third stand we have set up is a
simunition<00:01:03.570> range<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.100> Petawawa<00:01:05.489> fibula

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
simunition range in the Petawawa fibula

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.870 
simunition range in the Petawawa fibula
site<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.990> really<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.860> range<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.340> set<00:01:08.520> up<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
site and really this range is set up to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.830 
site and really this range is set up to
enable<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.900> junior<00:01:10.680> soldiers<00:01:11.430> an

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
enable the junior soldiers an

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.200 
enable the junior soldiers an
opportunity<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.110> lead<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.680> section<00:01:14.520> through<00:01:14.880> an

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
opportunity to lead a section through an

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.690 
opportunity to lead a section through an
ovule<00:01:15.630> range<00:01:15.930> essentially<00:01:16.619> lets<00:01:17.159> them<00:01:17.369> really

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
ovule range essentially lets them really

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.219 
ovule range essentially lets them really
lead<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.479> attack<00:01:18.920> planet<00:01:19.920> lead<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.229> it's

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
lead the attack planet lead it and it's

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.390 
lead the attack planet lead it and it's
a<00:01:22.320> lot<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.500> fun<00:01:22.710> doing<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.220> this

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
a lot of fun doing it with this

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.920 
a lot of fun doing it with this
ammunition<00:01:29.420> certainly<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> soldiers<00:01:30.840> are

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
ammunition certainly the soldiers are

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.719 
ammunition certainly the soldiers are
going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.110> be<00:01:31.170> talking<00:01:31.380> about<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:31.829> days<00:01:32.460> or

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
going to be talking about it for days or

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.090 
going to be talking about it for days or
weeks<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.060> come<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:34.110> challenging<00:01:34.710> for<00:01:34.950> them

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
weeks to come it's challenging for them

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.560 
weeks to come it's challenging for them
and<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:35.790> seeing<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.180> they're<00:01:36.450> being

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
successful on the stands coming back out

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.940 
successful on the stands coming back out
of<00:01:39.869> all<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> sense<00:01:40.740> of
