a<00:01:37.409> dual<00:01:38.310> clutch<00:01:38.520> transmission<00:01:39.270> means<00:01:39.899> that

a dual clutch transmission means that

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.529 
a dual clutch transmission means that

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.930 
each gear and be able to shift it like
you<00:02:13.200> would<00:02:13.380> our<00:02:13.950> previous<00:02:14.370> electric<00:02:14.730> shift

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
you would our previous electric shift

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.250 
you would our previous electric shift
model<00:02:15.180> very<00:02:15.329> similar<00:02:15.720> with<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> button<00:02:16.170> style

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260

shifter on the left handlebar and on top

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.410 
shifter on the left handlebar and on top
of<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.500> DCT<00:02:19.980> comes<00:02:20.370> with<00:02:20.579> a<00:02:20.609> high-low

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
of that the DCT comes with a high-low

of that the DCT comes with a high-low
sub<00:02:21.660> transmission<00:02:22.019> so<00:02:22.500> not<00:02:22.980> only<00:02:23.130> are<00:02:23.340> you

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
sub transmission so not only are you

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.069 
sub transmission so not only are you
getting<00:02:23.549> five<00:02:23.849> gears<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.269> high<00:02:24.420> five<00:02:24.840> years

getting five gears of high five years
and<00:02:25.200> low<00:02:25.319> so<00:02:25.590> we<00:02:25.709> look<00:02:25.859> at<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.040> as<00:02:26.130> basically<00:02:26.730> a

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
and low so we look at it as basically a

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.339 
and low so we look at it as basically a
10<00:02:27.030> speed<00:02:27.239> transmission<00:02:27.840> which<00:02:27.989> we're<00:02:28.200> very

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
10 speed transmission which we're very

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.490 
10 speed transmission which we're very
proud<00:02:28.560> of

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.980 

sounds<00:02:32.160> simple<00:02:32.340> right<00:02:32.730> but<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.480> question<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
sounds simple right but the question the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.560 
sounds simple right but the question the
begs<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.470> be<00:02:34.560> answered<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.100> why<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.120> the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
begs to be answered is why and the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.420 
begs to be answered is why and the
answer<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.110> question<00:02:37.680> may<00:02:37.980> be<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.160> lot

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
answer to that question may be a lot

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.940 
answer to that question may be a lot
simpler<00:02:38.850> than<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.390> originally<00:02:39.600> thought<00:02:40.020> we

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
simpler than you originally thought we

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.370 
simpler than you originally thought we
have<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.100> very<00:02:41.340> diverse<00:02:41.520> regional<00:02:42.330> aspect<00:02:43.230> of

many customers lifestyles that require a

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.730 
many customers lifestyles that require a
manual<00:02:45.570> transmission<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.320> that's<00:02:46.470> what<00:02:46.620> they

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
manual transmission and that's what they

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.800 
manual transmission and that's what they
prefer<00:02:47.070> if<00:02:47.520> they<00:02:47.700> have<00:02:47.820> a<00:02:47.850> towing<00:02:48.240> application

that<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.600> gives<00:03:54.840> us<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:55.080> unique<00:03:55.590> aspect<00:03:56.010> of

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
that it gives us a unique aspect of

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.940 
that it gives us a unique aspect of
being<00:03:56.459> able<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.760> design<00:03:57.209> tests<00:03:57.959> develop<00:03:58.800> and

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
being able to design tests develop and

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.070 
being able to design tests develop and
manufacture<00:03:59.370> all<00:04:00.030> within<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.660> confines<00:04:01.020> of

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
manufacture all within the confines of

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.229 
manufacture all within the confines of
the<00:04:01.380> areas<00:04:01.709> where<00:04:01.860> we<00:04:02.069> sell<00:04:02.280> our<00:04:02.430> units<00:04:02.760> we're

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
the areas where we sell our units we're

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.030 
the areas where we sell our units we're
very<00:04:03.450> proud<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.720> our<00:04:03.900> testing<00:04:04.260> procedures<00:04:04.770> and

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
very proud of our testing procedures and

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.710 
very proud of our testing procedures and
it's<00:04:05.489> one<00:04:05.730> reason<00:04:05.850> why<00:04:06.060> Honda<00:04:06.360> has<00:04:06.510> the

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
it's one reason why Honda has the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.630 
it's one reason why Honda has the
durability<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:07.350> quality<00:04:07.440> standards<00:04:08.100> that

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
durability and quality standards that

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.979 
durability and quality standards that
you<00:04:08.940> know<00:04:09.030> we<00:04:09.150> feel<00:04:09.360> kind<00:04:09.630> of<00:04:09.660> rise<00:04:09.840> above<00:04:11.989> so

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
you know we feel kind of rise above so

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.540 
you know we feel kind of rise above so
looking<00:04:13.290> forward<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.680> automatic<00:04:14.160> DCT

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
looking forward it automatic DCT

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.710 
looking forward it automatic DCT
technology<00:04:15.090> we're<00:04:15.239> definitely<00:04:15.420> going<00:04:15.660> to

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
technology we're definitely going to

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.960 
technology we're definitely going to
continue<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:16.200> evolve<00:04:16.440> this<00:04:16.680> system<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.760> really

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
continue to evolve this system it really

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.940 
continue to evolve this system it really
comes<00:04:18.150> down<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.419> efficiency<00:04:18.540> this<00:04:19.410> technology

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
comes down to efficiency this technology

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.830 
comes down to efficiency this technology
you<00:04:20.489> know<00:04:20.579> increases<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.150> efficiency<00:04:21.630> of<00:04:21.660> the

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
you know increases the efficiency of the
