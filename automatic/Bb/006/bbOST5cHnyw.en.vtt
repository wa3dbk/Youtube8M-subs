00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello together today I have one 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.400
 Review for you and that is about the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.860
 kts cosmetic / boost and i have now 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.540
 not so much about it just because of that 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.469
 I'll just go with you today 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.139
 debug 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.300
 you get her by I think rossmann 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.480
 and dm will contain 449 are 0 8 grams 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.789
 and it should be very easy and indeed 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.369
 Do you have a layer of mascara 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.949
 then dischargeable this Leffers and then 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.930
 another layer of mascara and then should 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.570
 it will bring you volume and also 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.300
 extensions of the wind when the lexus 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.300
 is not suitable for 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.680
 contact lens wearer and yes 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.680
 there is more information about it 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.180
 nothing more and then I was just 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.879
 Let's try it, let's just try it 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.530
 I'll give you a little bit now 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.379
 health with the whole then 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.629
 I'll be fine now 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.829
 Just for the extreme of essens 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.309
 maybe you should also take one 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.899
 You really only take mascara 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.430
 still used for this lesch plus 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.200
 because there are certainly some 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.390
 this case something in the mascara 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.010
 land and I believe that we are not there 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.810
 That's why I still recommend 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.369
 one that is cheaper than the one from 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.680
 Essens I think that's very good 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.630
 and now they are slow with me 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.790
 it does not matter to me that it dries up 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.799
 take her for it and then I would 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.890
 let's just try it out 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.720
 I will be mine first 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.720
 lashes are lying 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.490
 then I will be a layer now 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.500
 Apply mascara and is a review 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.090
 I try to just now times 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.340
 the upper and lower eyelashes 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.050
 try it and see how then 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.790
 the result is so i'm starting now 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:02:15.150
 first of all a story of its own 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:02:17.520
 to apply mascara so first layer it 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.350
 on it and now we use the same 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.350
 once the tigers 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.680
 I also have the feeling that I am 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.680
 get that in the eye 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.660
 I believe that I can not now so 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.500
 right percent because you have some fibers 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.990
 of it 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.910
 and now you should just have one 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:21.570
 pass over second layer of mascara and 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:23.880
 that if we do so now too 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.400
 every single case you will become one 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.340
 have become quite long and I think so 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.600
 also a lot of volume is in it and 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.240
 we'll just try one 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.750
 second layer of times is then see 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.750
 looks 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.610
 and that's the result after two 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.010
 layers of the lakers and I have to 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.239
 say I am quite positively surprised 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.769
 I really like her very well 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.599
 Do not think much further then 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.700
 So I would go a third layer 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.109
 I do not recommend it now I think 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.150
 me also that this free what im 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.380
 may also run down the day 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.989
 fall and then you can go here 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.870
 under the eye so a few black ones 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.340
 Fleckchen land i see it too 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.110
 a bit now that I have one 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.090
 few black dots and had something here 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.470
 But it is not that bad we think 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.500
 can do it over others in the morning 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.479
 also compare and as you can see so 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.400
 I have to say you can see it 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.830
 I made a very clear difference 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.919
 think that's always really good brand 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.180
 So I have to say for 449 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.770
 I think that's completely okay and as I said 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.240
 they are definitely longer 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.390
 I think you can see that now 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.450
 such a camera do not worry a few if 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.640
 you are born rather long 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.289
 you did it again one better 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.510
 look and that you see that on everyone 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.800
 fall I find this eyelash very long 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.930
 So, if I'm after now 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.550
 looks up then you can see that already 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.640
 she has become very tall and I have 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.530
 personally very short eyelashes and also 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.360
 So very straight procedure I have 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.610
 say I'm really excited 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.960
 I really like it and I like it 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.729
 I'll do the second car now 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.270
 Make-up and then we'll see you soon 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.010
 Again so my judgment is on everyone 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.560
 Both thumbs up 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.810
 I have to say something like that should be more often 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.310
 give a drugstore and pity that it 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.169
 not in this standard assortment 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.580
 the white of a limited edition but 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.740
 I should still get it 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.139
 namely just bought by 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.610
 two days I believe and I am 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.930
 really surprised by that 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.550
 I do not really have the result 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.650
 believed that there really was one 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.680
 difference looks but it gives you 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.419
 really volume and length and you 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.890
 get going a bit in the eye 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.900
 I have to say that I am now 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.630
 I did not bother so much at the beginning 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.720
 has opened and then it will 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:05.460
 of it wiped away on your eye 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:07.560
 separated and so I'm really convinced 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.390
 from the result and I would do it 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.960
 Definitely buy it again for 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.490
 a 4 49 is going to be there for sure 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.970
 I also hold a Christmas party 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.610
 I will not use it every day 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.140
 gladly in between and you 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.030
 maybe not too much then by 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.860
 I now have two layers of 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.330
 I think that was completely ok 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.150
 I think if you keep going then 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.370
 it very crumbly crumbly and looks 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.180
 then I do not think so nice anymore 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.070
 on the plan 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.080
 but otherwise I have to say I am 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.640
 you are very convinced of the product 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.340
 We would also like to leave it there 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.620
 because you like the saying if you too 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.479
 have a positive 400 or so far 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.070
 just negative that would be me 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:49.650
 of course also interested 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.990
 I like to leave comments because I forget 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.810
 not the thumb up and of course 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.729
 subscribe for more videos to accident in 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.710
 Mary Hughes wants to see some of them 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.419
 Products always write it 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.349
 I would like to see and then I would say 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:03.349
 We'll see you next time
