if this was just me but the dark below
DLC<00:01:31.680> gave<00:01:31.920> me<00:01:32.070> higher<00:01:32.310> level<00:01:32.670> light<00:01:32.820> armor<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
into the dark below deal see it was just

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.510 
into the dark below deal see it was just
me<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.380> getting<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> feel<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.400> if

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
me that was getting it but I feel as if

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.429 
me that was getting it but I feel as if
the<00:01:38.700> double<00:01:39.030> odiously<00:01:39.450> does<00:01:39.750> rank<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.290> lot

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the double odiously does rank up a lot

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.050 
the double odiously does rank up a lot
quicker<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.070> would<00:01:41.280> recommend<00:01:41.700> getting<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.880> dar

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
quicker so would recommend getting a dar

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.300 
quicker so would recommend getting a dar
