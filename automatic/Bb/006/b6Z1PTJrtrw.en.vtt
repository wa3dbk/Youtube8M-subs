 Beit Sitti translates as "The House of my Grandmother" 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.359
 So we are my sisters and me. 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.500
 A long time ago when we used to come, we cooked together with my grandmother Arlette 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.920
 and then when she passed away we decided we wanted 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:20.519
 honor your memory 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.549
 and teach the guests 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.600
 the dishes that she used to teach us to cook 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.280
 So, this is why we opened Beit Sitti 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:28.409
 and this is your house. You can even see 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.369
 your photos everywhere
