00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
kind of spread this out a little ways

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.679 
kind of spread this out a little ways
and<00:01:07.979> let<00:01:08.979> off<00:01:09.189> of<00:01:09.220> your<00:01:09.820> right-click<00:01:10.450> button

and let off of your right-click button

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.100 
and let off of your right-click button
so<00:01:11.470> it<00:01:11.619> looks<00:01:11.829> like<00:01:12.030> they're<00:01:13.030> both<00:01:13.060> both<00:01:13.960> the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
so it looks like they're both both the

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.719 
so it looks like they're both both the
upper<00:01:14.409> and<00:01:14.439> lower<00:01:14.530> sides<00:01:14.920> are<00:01:15.189> highlighted

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.580 
upper and lower sides are highlighted
and<00:01:16.259> type<00:01:17.259> in<00:01:17.530> O<00:01:19.170> let's<00:01:20.170> say<00:01:20.320> we're<00:01:20.440> going<00:01:20.530> to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
and type in O let's say we're going to

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.550 
and type in O let's say we're going to
make<00:01:21.360> four<00:01:22.360> different<00:01:22.390> sizes<00:01:22.960> of<00:01:23.140> cabinets

make four different sizes of cabinets
type<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.159> for<00:01:24.700> X<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:27.690> and<00:01:28.690> hit<00:01:29.140> enter<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:30.180> what

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
type in for X in and hit enter and what

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.690 
type in for X in and hit enter and what
it<00:01:31.299> did<00:01:32.370> it<00:01:33.370> gave<00:01:33.580> us<00:01:33.610> four<00:01:34.799> four<00:01:35.799> new<00:01:35.979> sides<00:01:36.340> to

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
it did it gave us four four new sides to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.880 
it did it gave us four four new sides to
work<00:01:36.729> with<00:01:37.120> here<00:01:39.330> if<00:01:40.330> we<00:01:40.479> got<00:01:40.630> enough<00:01:40.900> room<00:01:41.170> and

cabinets some might be custom sized one

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.210 
cabinets some might be custom sized one
thing<00:04:03.270> let's<00:04:04.270> say<00:04:04.360> of<00:04:05.020> course<00:04:05.110> um<00:04:05.500> a<00:04:05.770> lot<00:04:06.100> of

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
thing let's say of course um a lot of

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.170 
thing let's say of course um a lot of
kitchens<00:04:06.610> you're<00:04:06.850> going<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.030> have<00:04:07.120> a

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
kitchens you're going to have a

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.500 
kitchens you're going to have a
dishwasher<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.370> let's<00:04:09.370> say<00:04:09.550> that<00:04:09.820> we<00:04:10.480> are

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
dishwasher so let's say that we are

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.660 
dishwasher so let's say that we are
going<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.750> have<00:04:10.960> a<00:04:11.260> dishwasher<00:04:11.680> between<00:04:12.370> this

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
going to have a dishwasher between this

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.170 
going to have a dishwasher between this
cabinet<00:04:13.240> and<00:04:13.390> this<00:04:13.780> cabinet<00:04:14.940> so<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:15.970> know

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
cabinet and this cabinet so you know

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.970 
cabinet and this cabinet so you know
there's<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:16.450> space<00:04:16.810> left<00:04:17.110> out<00:04:17.320> at<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.590> bottom

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
there's a space left out at the bottom

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.230 
there's a space left out at the bottom
so<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:20.140> standard<00:04:20.709> opening<00:04:21.190> for<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.030> dishwasher

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
so the standard opening for a dishwasher

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.350 
so the standard opening for a dishwasher
is<00:04:22.780> 30<00:04:23.140> inches<00:04:23.680> so<00:04:24.490> you'd<00:04:24.700> still<00:04:25.000> have<00:04:25.030> an

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
is 30 inches so you'd still have an

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.950 
is 30 inches so you'd still have an
upper<00:04:25.720> cabinet<00:04:27.030> with<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.180> lower<00:04:28.420> cabinet

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
upper cabinet with the lower cabinet

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.070 
upper cabinet with the lower cabinet
left<00:04:29.200> out<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:30.460> like<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.300> might<00:04:31.690> want<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:31.930> make

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
left out so like you might want to make

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.270 
left out so like you might want to make
an<00:04:32.230> extra<00:04:32.800> 30<00:04:33.610> inch<00:04:33.910> cabinet<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:35.530> we'll

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
an extra 30 inch cabinet so we'll

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.110 
an extra 30 inch cabinet so we'll
highlight<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.910> cabinet<00:04:39.540> use<00:04:40.540> my<00:04:40.780> move<00:04:41.020> tool

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120
