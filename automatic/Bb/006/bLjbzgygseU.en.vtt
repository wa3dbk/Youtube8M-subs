America<00:00:13.590> for<00:00:14.219> fishing<00:00:14.580> I'm<00:00:14.940> going<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.269> test

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
America for fishing I'm going to test

America for fishing I'm going to test
this<00:00:15.630> hook<00:00:15.839> out<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.260> fishery<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.800> see<00:00:17.010> if

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
this hook out in that fishery to see if

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.849 
this hook out in that fishery to see if
it's<00:00:17.580> better<00:00:17.820> at<00:00:18.090> catching<00:00:18.779> halibut<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.710> then

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
it's better at catching halibut and then

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.080 
it's better at catching halibut and then
caught<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:21.150> as<00:00:21.300> many<00:00:21.539> yellow<00:00:22.320> eye<00:00:22.410> canary

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
caught and not as many yellow eye canary

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.370 
caught and not as many yellow eye canary
rockfish<00:00:24.090> which<00:00:24.359> are<00:00:24.539> endangered<00:00:24.810> right<00:00:25.199> now

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
rockfish which are endangered right now

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.500 
rockfish which are endangered right now
so<00:00:25.769> hold<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.519> up<00:00:26.730> closer<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.240> could<00:00:27.390> have

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
so hold this up closer you could have

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.400 
so hold this up closer you could have
better<00:00:27.660> look<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:29.990> I'm<00:00:30.990> going<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> be

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
better look at it I'm going to be

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.690 
better look at it I'm going to be
starting<00:00:31.619> out<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:31.980> some<00:00:32.040> quarter<00:00:32.550> inch

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
starting out with some quarter inch

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.410 
starting out with some quarter inch
brass<00:00:32.969> rod<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.440> first<00:00:34.739> hooks<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.210> are

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
brass rod and the first hooks so are

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.729 
brass rod and the first hooks so are
some<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> first<00:00:36.960> books<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.320> were<00:00:37.500> made

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
some of the first books that were made

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.459 
some of the first books that were made
by<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.950> McLeod<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.640> metal<00:00:39.350> traditionally<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
by the McLeod of metal traditionally the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.760 
by the McLeod of metal traditionally the
or<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.250> spruce<00:00:41.579> root<00:00:42.530> but<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
or you and spruce root but the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.580 
or you and spruce root but the
government<00:00:44.670> had<00:00:44.850> sent<00:00:45.059> out<00:00:45.149> some<00:00:45.590> pitchforks

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
government had sent out some pitchforks

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.869 
government had sent out some pitchforks
because<00:00:46.920> they<00:00:47.010> wanted<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.280> make<00:00:47.430> farmers

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
because they wanted to make farmers

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.990 
because they wanted to make farmers
under<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> cob<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.370> salty<00:00:50.370> air<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
under the cob but the salty air and the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.700 
under the cob but the salty air and the
rocky<00:00:51.449> soil<00:00:51.660> didn't<00:00:52.079> take<00:00:52.230> too<00:00:52.469> well<00:00:52.500> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
rocky soil didn't take too well to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040 
rocky soil didn't take too well to
farming<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.660> pitchforks<00:00:54.660> were<00:00:54.780> turned

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
farming and so pitchforks were turned

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.639 
farming and so pitchforks were turned
into<00:00:55.199> fish<00:00:55.440> hooks<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.520> there<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:56.820> go<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:01.109> first

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
into fish hooks so there we go the first

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.889 
into fish hooks so there we go the first
thing<00:01:01.770> I'm<00:01:01.949> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.219> do<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.640> thin<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> hook

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
thing I'm going to do is thin the hook

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.500 
thing I'm going to do is thin the hook
so<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.320> matches<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.739> size<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:06.299> other

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
so it matches the size of this other

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.859 
so it matches the size of this other
hook<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:10.850> don't<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.119> grinder<00:01:12.450> so

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
hook here and I don't have a grinder so

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:24.520 
hook here and I don't have a grinder so
I'm<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.260> use<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> cheater

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.770 

well<00:01:25.220> now<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.550> have<00:01:25.850> here<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.150> rod<00:01:26.390> that<00:01:26.660> was

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
well now I have here a rod that was

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.410 
well now I have here a rod that was
ground<00:01:27.020> down<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.650> I<00:01:28.100> matched<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.730> size<00:01:29.030> up<00:01:29.270> as

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
ground down and I matched the size up as

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.260 
ground down and I matched the size up as
I<00:01:29.840> was<00:01:29.990> grinding<00:01:30.260> and<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:31.700> length<00:01:31.940> that<00:01:32.150> this

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
I was grinding and the length that this

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.410 
I was grinding and the length that this
is<00:01:32.450> about<00:01:32.720> 11<00:01:33.680> inches<00:01:33.770> long<00:01:34.220> this<00:01:34.880> one's<00:01:35.180> cut

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
is about 11 inches long this one's cut

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.260 
is about 11 inches long this one's cut
about<00:01:35.630> 12<00:01:35.990> but<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:36.770> had<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.010> little<00:01:37.190> extra<00:01:37.640> room

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
about 12 but I had a little extra room

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.180 
about 12 but I had a little extra room
because<00:01:38.690> I<00:01:38.720> made<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.110> point<00:01:39.320> too<00:01:39.530> sharp<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:40.100> I

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
because I made the point too sharp and I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.120 
because I made the point too sharp and I
was<00:01:40.280> able<00:01:40.550> to<00:01:41.080> bring<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.110> point<00:01:42.410> down<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:42.979> it

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
was able to bring the point down so it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.440 
was able to bring the point down so it
wasn't<00:01:43.520> so<00:01:43.729> pointy<00:01:44.890> okay<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.640> next<00:01:47.000> step<00:01:47.240> is

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
wasn't so pointy okay the next step is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.040 
wasn't so pointy okay the next step is
going<00:01:47.660> to<00:01:47.780> be<00:01:47.900> to<00:01:48.490> start<00:01:49.490> bending<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.180> steel

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
going to be to start bending the steel

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.460 
going to be to start bending the steel
so<00:01:51.410> it<00:01:51.530> matches<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:51.979> same<00:01:52.550> shape<00:01:52.940> as<00:01:53.420> the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
so it matches the same shape as the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.730 
so it matches the same shape as the
original<00:01:54.470> Trabuco<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:56.229> I'm<00:01:57.229> just<00:01:57.440> going<00:01:57.680> to

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
original Trabuco and I'm just going to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.540 
original Trabuco and I'm just going to
try<00:01:57.979> with<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.250> pair<00:01:59.119> of<00:02:00.040> with<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.160> ranch<00:02:01.399> right

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
try with a pair of with the ranch right

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.790 
try with a pair of with the ranch right
now<00:02:01.670> I<00:02:02.000> may<00:02:02.240> need<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.420> apply<00:02:03.050> some<00:02:03.080> heat<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.710> get

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
now I may need to apply some heat to get

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.010 
now I may need to apply some heat to get
at<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.040> bend<00:02:04.280> but<00:02:04.460> I<00:02:04.880> have<00:02:05.149> no<00:02:05.300> idea<00:02:05.330> how<00:02:05.869> this

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
at the bend but I have no idea how this

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.290 
at the bend but I have no idea how this
is<00:02:06.200> gonna<00:02:06.290> go<00:02:06.410> so<00:02:08.679> I'll<00:02:09.679> start<00:02:09.979> bending<00:02:10.250> here

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.640 

yeah<00:02:14.300> if<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.540> lay<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.840> right<00:02:14.870> alongside<00:02:15.230> the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
yeah if you lay it right alongside the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.620 
yeah if you lay it right alongside the
other<00:02:15.680> one<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.130> pretty<00:02:16.430> pretty<00:02:16.940> easy<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.450> see

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
other one is pretty pretty easy to see

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.320 
other one is pretty pretty easy to see
where<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.020> need<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.610> your<00:02:19.610> pending<00:02:19.970> points

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
where you need to your pending points

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:36.970 
where you need to your pending points
need<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.630> be<00:02:20.780> at

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.890 

it's<00:02:37.980> pretty<00:02:38.340> easy<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.760> do<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> first<00:02:39.390> Bend<00:02:39.690> on

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
it's pretty easy to do the first Bend on

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.309 
it's pretty easy to do the first Bend on
the<00:02:39.930> Shaboom<00:02:40.379> here<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:41.489> matched<00:02:41.909> and<00:02:42.870> match<00:02:43.110> the

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
the Shaboom here I matched and match the

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.289 
the Shaboom here I matched and match the
two<00:02:43.349> up<00:02:43.680> pretty<00:02:43.860> well<00:02:43.950> but<00:02:44.849> I'm<00:02:44.970> having

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
two up pretty well but I'm having

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.190 
two up pretty well but I'm having
trouble<00:02:45.659> with

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
trouble with

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.440 
trouble with
Shaboom<00:02:46.980> wanting<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.400> go<00:02:47.519> sideways<00:02:47.849> on<00:02:48.299> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
Shaboom wanting to go sideways on the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.110 
Shaboom wanting to go sideways on the
corner<00:02:48.840> here<00:02:49.049> when<00:02:49.799> I<00:02:49.830> get<00:02:50.099> to<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.400> hard<00:02:50.819> part

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
corner here when I get to this hard part

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.020 
corner here when I get to this hard part
so<00:02:51.989> I'm<00:02:52.200> gonna<00:02:52.530> try<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.010> apply<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.700> little<00:02:53.910> bit

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
so I'm gonna try to apply a little bit

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.130 
so I'm gonna try to apply a little bit
of<00:02:54.150> heat<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:55.290> can<00:02:55.440> see<00:02:55.470> on<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.890> inside<00:02:56.010> here

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
of heat you can see on the inside here

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.539 
of heat you can see on the inside here
that<00:02:58.140> they'd<00:02:58.290> use<00:02:58.530> something<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.190> there<00:02:59.370> to

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
that they'd use something in there to

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.240 
that they'd use something in there to
bend<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.239> hook<00:03:00.420> around<00:03:00.739> where<00:03:01.739> my<00:03:01.890> fingers

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
bend the hook around where my fingers

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.580 
bend the hook around where my fingers
moving

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
moving

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.009 
moving
they<00:03:04.590> must<00:03:04.769> have<00:03:04.920> grabbed<00:03:05.129> it<00:03:05.250> with<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.430> similar

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
they must have grabbed it with a similar

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.059 
they must have grabbed it with a similar
device<00:03:08.930> having<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.989> hard<00:03:10.200> time<00:03:10.260> not<00:03:10.680> holding

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069

the<00:03:11.160> medal<00:03:11.489> while<00:03:12.090> I'm<00:03:14.299> bending<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:15.629> I'm

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
the medal while I'm bending it so I'm

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.170 
the medal while I'm bending it so I'm
with<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> drillable<00:03:16.200> you're<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:17.370> couple<00:03:18.000> holes

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
with a drillable you're a couple holes

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:46.820 
with a drillable you're a couple holes
and<00:03:18.420> tried<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:19.430> see<00:03:20.430> if<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:20.640> helps

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.590 

so<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.490> wood<00:03:47.700> actually<00:03:47.910> isn't<00:03:48.210> strong<00:03:48.570> enough

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
so the wood actually isn't strong enough

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.960 
so the wood actually isn't strong enough
to<00:03:48.900> hold<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:49.710> I<00:03:49.950> wouldn't<00:03:50.490> have<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.670> find

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
to hold that so I wouldn't have to find

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.880 
to hold that so I wouldn't have to find
a<00:03:51.150> piece<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.750> metal<00:03:52.050> I<00:03:54.530> don't<00:03:55.530> have<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.680> piece<00:03:55.860> of

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
a piece of metal I don't have a piece of

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.580 
a piece of metal I don't have a piece of
metal<00:03:56.160> hand<00:03:56.490> so<00:03:56.760> I'm<00:03:56.850> just<00:03:57.000> gonna<00:03:57.320> clap<00:03:58.320> a

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
metal hand so I'm just gonna clap a

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.330 
metal hand so I'm just gonna clap a
crescent<00:03:59.550> wrench<00:03:59.610> down<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.120> my<00:04:00.270> table<00:04:00.630> here

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
crescent wrench down to my table here

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.850 
crescent wrench down to my table here
that<00:04:02.340> should<00:04:02.550> give<00:04:03.330> me<00:04:03.480> enough<00:04:06.650> leverage<00:04:07.650> to

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
that should give me enough leverage to

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:33.550 
that should give me enough leverage to
bend<00:04:08.610> this<00:04:08.760> book<00:04:27.530> yeah<00:04:28.530> that's<00:04:28.770> much<00:04:28.950> easier

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.090 

well<00:04:34.560> what<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.800> did<00:04:34.980> instead<00:04:35.100> is<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:36.980> have<00:04:37.980> to

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
well what I did instead is a I have to

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.920 
well what I did instead is a I have to
press<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.490> right<00:04:38.730> down<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.210> table<00:04:39.510> here

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
press it right down to the table here

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.730 
press it right down to the table here
and<00:04:41.270> it's<00:04:42.270> really<00:04:42.450> easy<00:04:42.600> to<00:04:42.960> bend<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.710> metal

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
and it's really easy to bend the metal

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.930 
and it's really easy to bend the metal
with<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.700> crescent<00:04:44.940> wrench<00:04:45.210> because

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
with the crescent wrench because

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.150 
with the crescent wrench because
the<00:04:47.390> sharp<00:04:47.630> edges<00:04:47.870> are<00:04:48.140> a<00:04:48.170> testament<00:04:48.740> rich

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
the sharp edges are a testament rich

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.070 
the sharp edges are a testament rich
besides<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:50.210> prevent<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.660> from<00:04:50.690> slipping

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
besides and prevent it from slipping

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.200 
besides and prevent it from slipping
while<00:04:51.440> you're<00:04:51.590> trying<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.860> bend<00:04:52.130> really<00:04:53.060> easy

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
while you're trying to bend really easy

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.850 
while you're trying to bend really easy
to<00:04:53.420> work<00:04:53.570> with

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
to work with

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.210 
to work with
I<00:04:54.860> could<00:04:55.130> probably<00:04:55.250> knock<00:04:55.580> out<00:04:57.010> one<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.130> the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
I could probably knock out one of the

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.300 
I could probably knock out one of the
cooks<00:04:58.460> in<00:04:59.080> 20<00:05:00.080> minutes<00:05:00.380> now<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:00.890> I<00:05:00.920> know<00:05:01.070> it

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
cooks in 20 minutes now that I know it

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.020 
cooks in 20 minutes now that I know it
how<00:05:01.700> to<00:05:01.760> do<00:05:02.030> it<00:05:02.860> after<00:05:03.860> about<00:05:04.130> 20<00:05:04.580> minutes<00:05:04.610> of

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
how to do it after about 20 minutes of

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.750 
how to do it after about 20 minutes of
bending<00:05:05.450> I<00:05:05.600> was<00:05:05.960> able<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.290> make<00:05:07.010> a<00:05:07.040> pretty<00:05:07.550> good

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
bending I was able to make a pretty good

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.090 
bending I was able to make a pretty good
replica<00:05:08.300> it's<00:05:08.510> not<00:05:08.690> perfectly<00:05:09.350> straight<00:05:09.470> but

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
replica it's not perfectly straight but

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.850 
replica it's not perfectly straight but
I'll<00:05:12.220> put<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.340> finishing<00:05:13.670> touches<00:05:14.000> on<00:05:14.270> later

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
I'll put the finishing touches on later

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.260 
I'll put the finishing touches on later
the<00:05:15.860> next<00:05:16.010> part<00:05:16.430> is<00:05:16.730> to<00:05:17.360> put<00:05:17.900> a<00:05:18.080> bar<00:05:18.410> bond<00:05:18.710> and

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
the next part is to put a bar bond and

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.240 
the next part is to put a bar bond and
this<00:05:20.270> bar<00:05:20.630> they're<00:05:20.900> soldered<00:05:21.200> in<00:05:21.560> right<00:05:21.950> here

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
this bar they're soldered in right here

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.740 
this bar they're soldered in right here
and<00:05:22.720> there's<00:05:23.720> actually<00:05:24.200> a<00:05:24.230> steel<00:05:25.570> this<00:05:26.570> is

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
and there's actually a steel this is

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.670 
and there's actually a steel this is
brass<00:05:27.260> and<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:28.010> barb<00:05:28.250> is<00:05:28.460> made<00:05:29.030> out<00:05:29.180> of<00:05:29.300> steel

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
brass and the barb is made out of steel

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.740 
brass and the barb is made out of steel
so<00:05:30.680> I'm<00:05:30.800> gonna<00:05:30.950> have<00:05:31.220> to<00:05:31.460> either<00:05:32.060> sharper<00:05:32.630> than

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
so I'm gonna have to either sharper than

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.420 
so I'm gonna have to either sharper than
a<00:05:32.930> ohh<00:05:32.960> looks<00:05:33.290> like<00:05:33.440> this<00:05:33.590> is<00:05:33.710> probably<00:05:33.740> a<00:05:34.160> nail

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
a ohh looks like this is probably a nail

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.020 
a ohh looks like this is probably a nail
that<00:05:34.700> was<00:05:34.850> sharpened<00:05:35.360> and<00:05:36.430> look<00:05:37.430> it's<00:05:37.610> flat<00:05:38.000> on

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
that was sharpened and look it's flat on

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.500 
that was sharpened and look it's flat on
one<00:05:38.210> side<00:05:38.390> and<00:05:38.960> it<00:05:39.080> has<00:05:39.110> a<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:40.520> edge<00:05:40.700> comes<00:05:41.300> in

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
one side and it has a the edge comes in

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.360 
one side and it has a the edge comes in
right<00:05:41.660> there<00:05:41.930> so<00:05:42.290> I<00:05:42.500> want<00:05:43.130> to<00:05:43.160> try<00:05:43.310> to

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
right there so I want to try to

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:54.490 
right there so I want to try to
replicate<00:05:43.610> that<00:05:50.710> well<00:05:51.710> I<00:05:51.740> was<00:05:52.040> able<00:05:52.190> to<00:05:53.470> make<00:05:54.470> a

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
replicate that well I was able to make a

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.070 
replicate that well I was able to make a
barb<00:05:54.920> for<00:05:55.130> the<00:05:55.220> hook<00:05:55.370> pretty<00:05:55.610> easy<00:05:55.850> it's<00:05:56.750> two

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
barb for the hook pretty easy it's two

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.750 
barb for the hook pretty easy it's two
and<00:05:57.230> a<00:05:57.260> half<00:05:57.440> inches<00:05:57.770> long<00:05:57.800> I'm<00:05:58.190> gonna<00:05:58.340> trim<00:05:58.640> it

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
and a half inches long I'm gonna trim it

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:13.810 
and a half inches long I'm gonna trim it
off<00:05:58.940> now

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.750 

well<00:06:14.820> next<00:06:15.090> stage<00:06:15.360> here<00:06:15.660> is<00:06:16.550> attached<00:06:17.550> the

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
well next stage here is attached the

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.379 
well next stage here is attached the
steel<00:06:18.419> bar<00:06:19.139> clip<00:06:20.070> to<00:06:20.340> the<00:06:20.580> rest<00:06:20.970> of<00:06:21.090> the<00:06:21.210> chip

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
steel bar clip to the rest of the chip

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.909 
steel bar clip to the rest of the chip
boot<00:06:21.570> and<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:22.979> best<00:06:23.190> I<00:06:23.370> can<00:06:23.430> tell<00:06:23.729> is<00:06:23.790> that<00:06:24.030> the

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
boot and the best I can tell is that the

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.980 
boot and the best I can tell is that the
this<00:06:25.919> section<00:06:26.340> right<00:06:26.490> here<00:06:26.520> with<00:06:26.790> lead<00:06:27.090> was

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
this section right here with lead was

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.610 
this section right here with lead was
steel<00:06:28.470> lid<00:06:28.889> and<00:06:29.190> then<00:06:29.419> brass<00:06:30.419> it<00:06:31.320> was<00:06:31.440> just

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
steel lid and then brass it was just

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.409 
steel lid and then brass it was just
kind<00:06:31.830> of<00:06:31.889> gooped<00:06:32.160> around<00:06:32.550> here<00:06:33.000> and<00:06:33.180> then<00:06:33.300> you

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
kind of gooped around here and then you

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.390 
kind of gooped around here and then you
have<00:06:33.510> to<00:06:33.630> file<00:06:33.870> off<00:06:34.110> the<00:06:34.139> excess<00:06:34.710> and<00:06:34.770> then<00:06:35.010> the

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
have to file off the excess and then the

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.030 
have to file off the excess and then the
next<00:06:35.699> stage<00:06:35.910> is<00:06:36.120> to<00:06:36.270> tie<00:06:36.479> it<00:06:36.540> and<00:06:39.740> need<00:06:40.740> to<00:06:40.770> make

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
next stage is to tie it and need to make

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.920 
next stage is to tie it and need to make
it<00:06:41.190> look<00:06:41.310> like<00:06:41.550> this<00:06:41.990> so<00:06:44.479> here's<00:06:45.479> one<00:06:45.750> that's

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
it look like this so here's one that's

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.930 
it look like this so here's one that's
not<00:06:46.110> finished<00:06:46.380> you<00:06:46.710> can<00:06:46.830> see<00:06:47.070> how<00:06:47.310> the<00:06:47.610> older

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
not finished you can see how the older

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.820 
not finished you can see how the older
one<00:06:48.120> here<00:06:48.389> this<00:06:48.479> is<00:06:48.600> a<00:06:48.660> regular<00:06:49.110> fishhook<00:06:49.590> and

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
one here this is a regular fishhook and

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.070 
one here this is a regular fishhook and
then<00:06:49.979> the<00:06:50.729> lead<00:06:50.940> here<00:06:51.240> was<00:06:51.450> just<00:06:51.479> looped

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
then the lead here was just looped

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.960 
then the lead here was just looped
around<00:06:52.229> there<00:06:52.770> and<00:06:53.070> that's<00:06:53.880> what<00:06:54.060> holds<00:06:54.210> it<00:06:54.479> on

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.060 

well<00:06:59.970> here<00:07:00.240> we<00:07:00.389> are<00:07:00.419> some<00:07:00.780> hours<00:07:01.080> later<00:07:01.380> this

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
well here we are some hours later this

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.860 
well here we are some hours later this
is<00:07:02.220> the<00:07:02.340> original<00:07:02.550> hook<00:07:03.000> that<00:07:03.150> I<00:07:03.210> started<00:07:03.660> with

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
is the original hook that I started with

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:12.320 
is the original hook that I started with
and<00:07:05.419> this<00:07:06.419> is<00:07:06.630> the<00:07:09.919> remake<00:07:10.919> that<00:07:11.190> I<00:07:11.310> made<00:07:11.520> took

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
and this is the remake that I made took

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.550 
and this is the remake that I made took
me<00:07:12.479> awhile<00:07:12.539> to<00:07:12.690> figure<00:07:12.960> out<00:07:13.139> how<00:07:13.200> to<00:07:13.229> do<00:07:13.440> the

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
me awhile to figure out how to do the

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.740 
me awhile to figure out how to do the
windings<00:07:13.979> on<00:07:14.160> it<00:07:14.340> but<00:07:14.520> it<00:07:15.330> looks<00:07:15.360> like<00:07:15.539> it

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
windings on it but it looks like it

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.860 
windings on it but it looks like it
would<00:07:15.870> work<00:07:16.280> maybe<00:07:17.280> we'll<00:07:18.150> go<00:07:18.240> try<00:07:18.419> this<00:07:18.660> thing

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
would work maybe we'll go try this thing

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:24.589 
would work maybe we'll go try this thing
up<00:07:19.020> next<00:07:21.770> well<00:07:22.770> I<00:07:22.800> just<00:07:22.889> got<00:07:23.250> done<00:07:23.550> drilling<00:07:24.510> a

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 
up next well I just got done drilling a

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:29.089 
up next well I just got done drilling a
hole<00:07:24.630> in<00:07:24.990> the<00:07:25.080> tribute<00:07:25.580> right<00:07:26.580> here<00:07:26.970> and<00:07:28.099> it's

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 
hole in the tribute right here and it's

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:31.610 
hole in the tribute right here and it's
about<00:07:29.370> a<00:07:29.599> 564<00:07:30.599> at<00:07:30.690> the<00:07:30.810> drill<00:07:31.050> that<00:07:31.080> what<00:07:31.590> I

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 
about a 564 at the drill that what I

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.610 
about a 564 at the drill that what I
used<00:07:31.919> to<00:07:32.010> go<00:07:32.160> through<00:07:32.220> there
