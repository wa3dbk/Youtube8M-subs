00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.480
 Ha 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:19.890
 Then let's explain 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:21.539
 I would like to focus on the winner this time, but it is the year that is representative of it 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.940
 Prima Ham's 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.640
 Here is the school lesson 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.640
 I would like to give a walk as a subject 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.700
 Let's look at the raw material name of the system 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.630
 This is Shibo which is nine minutes to the song 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:47.040
 Reduced starch syrup salt protein hydrolyzate 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:51.960
 There does and potassium filled in, such as amino acid phosphoric acid, which was trying to see win spice Sato 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:55.930
 It is a preservative Sungbin's rice modifier Modifier antioxidant in vitamin c 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:00.070
 Sodium nitrate is used as a coloring agent 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:06.400
 I think it was good to talk about the last Roth Ham 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:08.690
 It is said that you should not eat it because sodium nitrite is used in this product coloring agent 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:14.560
 I put things in my arms 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:16.520
 Or Motsu, I focused on the equipment for Conques preservation , but I also focused on Aso . 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.400
 That day prefecture 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.460
 Naa thing 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:31.470
 The same voice as the same sodium nitrite is subject to test, so this time 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:38.370
 I kinda would like to commentary by focusing on the series of the sorbic acid 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:41.390
 It is here that this sorbate potassium sorbates a large number of people and a lot of sense of light 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:47.659
 It is something that is in the form of indifference 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:49.580
 In short, the absorption rate is abandon the things that firmly basic because the ion is built went fast 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.580
 There is a feature of 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:02:01.409
 Sorbic acid is also strong here but most of the skeleton of sorbic acid 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.730
 It is managed in here and I thought that one more easy-to-understand as described here in the same number 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.130
 Had 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:12.739
 Mainly used for pickled jam and cheese 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.000
 Because really objective is modified subjected Renault also abandoned the objective to modal number in the is that preservatives Gunma 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:20.270
 If there 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.280
 That's why I'm from the last line of the animal, cutting a bit or repairing the bacterial gene 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.080
 Because there is an obstacle 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:33.020
 When the dignity Mr. of human cells has the potential to suddenly day and the cells cancerous 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.020
 Materials used in those that aim to prevent the leave Well of course that I is Firefox 3.0 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.020
 is 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.240
 It is powerful 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.950
 Because it is like a private agent 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:48.140
 Then too the other for it's the mother of that person 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.980
 It is not a very good thing to go too much, and that such an influence will come out 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.260
 You 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.560
 So a few people cold likely that this is in, but include those of potassium sorbate 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:02.020
 I will never eat anything that is 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:07.660
 I'm getting a little more tired, but I can't eat it again 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:13.660
 This is the position where he is actually making kirk products at the in- house instrument music maker 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:16.420
 From what comes with antiseptics are those that can be put on the skin, even if they are shampoos 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.870
 I think it is better not to eat even if it is 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:25.730
 Even if it is only one, it is very powerful 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.069
 It is better to absolutely avoid using something that has a city ​​courtesy aid background 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.430
 I feel Fu say 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:37.049
 And finally it is good to leave it to your own judgment 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.769
 Today's commentary Thank you for listening to the last that will be more than 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.769
 Let's meet again 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:58.780
