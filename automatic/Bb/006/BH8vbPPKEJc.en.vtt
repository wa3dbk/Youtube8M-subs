00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:30.839 
they've been shot in the den for 12

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.900 
they've been shot in the den for 12
weeks<00:00:30.990> now<00:00:31.289> which<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.189> similar<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.579> length<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
weeks now which is similar to length the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.790 
weeks now which is similar to length the
time<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.240> mum<00:00:33.420> would<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.960> caved-in<00:00:34.440> in

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
time that mum would be in a caved-in in

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.950 
time that mum would be in a caved-in in
the<00:00:34.890> wild<00:00:35.310> but<00:00:36.060> it's<00:00:36.210> now<00:00:36.360> time<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.660> them<00:00:36.900> to

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the wild but it's now time for them to

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.510 
the wild but it's now time for them to
venture<00:00:37.470> out<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.830> explore<00:00:38.160> their<00:00:38.340> new

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
venture out and explore their new

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.520 
venture out and explore their new
surroundings<00:00:45.050> snow<00:00:46.050> leopards<00:00:46.320> are<00:00:46.410> quite

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
surroundings snow leopards are quite

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.230 
surroundings snow leopards are quite
cautious<00:00:46.740> animals<00:00:47.400> so<00:00:47.610> we<00:00:47.730> didn't<00:00:47.940> expect

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
cautious animals so we didn't expect

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.610 
cautious animals so we didn't expect
them<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.390> come<00:00:48.630> running<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> den

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
them to come running out of the den

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.800 
them to come running out of the den
straightaway<00:00:50.220> obviously<00:00:50.970> it's<00:00:51.090> quite<00:00:51.240> a<00:00:51.330> big

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
straightaway obviously it's quite a big

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.020 
straightaway obviously it's quite a big
thing<00:00:51.840> quite<00:00:52.380> scary<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.340> way<00:00:53.490> for<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.760> Cubs

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
thing quite scary in a way for the Cubs

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.820 
thing quite scary in a way for the Cubs
they<00:00:54.240> don't<00:00:54.630> know<00:00:54.810> this<00:00:55.050> environment<00:00:55.560> at<00:00:55.740> the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
they don't know this environment at the

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.830 
they don't know this environment at the
moment<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.490> there's<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.120> lot<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> things<00:00:57.630> that

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
moment so there's a lot of things that

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930 
moment so there's a lot of things that
they<00:00:57.960> they're<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.260> sure<00:00:58.650> about<00:00:58.830> so<00:00:59.580> they're

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
they they're not sure about so they're

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
aren't any danger in the enclosure that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.310 
aren't any danger in the enclosure that
they're<00:01:11.820> gonna<00:01:11.970> come<00:01:12.270> into<00:01:12.420> contact<00:01:12.630> with<00:01:12.930> so

she'll she'll want it to be very gradual
and<00:01:16.140> she'll<00:01:16.350> let<00:01:16.530> them<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.830> when<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.159> okay

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and she'll let them know when it's okay

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.320 
and she'll let them know when it's okay
to<00:01:17.550> to<00:01:18.030> wonder<00:01:18.360> any<00:01:18.510> further

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.960 

snow<00:01:26.330> leopards<00:01:26.510> are<00:01:26.780> endangered<00:01:27.320> species

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
snow leopards are endangered species

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.850 
snow leopards are endangered species
there<00:01:28.970> aren't<00:01:29.330> there<00:01:30.140> aren't<00:01:30.320> too<00:01:30.470> many<00:01:30.500> zoos

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
there aren't there aren't too many zoos

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.550 
there aren't there aren't too many zoos
that<00:01:31.160> have<00:01:31.340> breeding<00:01:31.910> snow<00:01:32.120> leopards<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.570> I

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
that have breeding snow leopards and I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.800 
that have breeding snow leopards and I
mean<00:01:34.250> for<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:34.430> species<00:01:34.640> there's<00:01:34.970> about<00:01:35.090> 5,000

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
mean for the species there's about 5,000

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.140 
mean for the species there's about 5,000
left<00:01:35.960> in<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.170> wild<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.909> considerably<00:01:37.909> less

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
left in the wild and considerably less

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.940 
left in the wild and considerably less
than<00:01:38.180> that<00:01:38.420> in<00:01:38.690> captivity<00:01:39.050> probably<00:01:39.619> about<00:01:39.740> 10

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
than that in captivity probably about 10

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.670 
than that in captivity probably about 10
percent<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:41.119> that<00:01:41.450> that's<00:01:41.990> quite<00:01:42.110> rare<00:01:42.440> for<00:01:42.470> a

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
percent so that that's quite rare for a

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.640 
percent so that that's quite rare for a
global<00:01:42.920> population<00:01:43.300> so<00:01:44.300> you<00:01:45.050> know<00:01:45.170> all<00:01:45.560> the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
global population so you know all the

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.140 
global population so you know all the
zoos<00:01:45.830> that<00:01:45.860> have<00:01:46.160> them<00:01:46.340> breed<00:01:46.520> snow<00:01:46.790> leopards

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
zoos that have them breed snow leopards

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.490 
zoos that have them breed snow leopards
are<00:01:47.300> contributing<00:01:47.930> to<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.259> overall

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
are contributing to the overall

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.890 
are contributing to the overall
population<00:01:49.220> just<00:01:49.910> sort<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:50.270> preserve<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
population just sort of preserve the

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.200 
population just sort of preserve the
genetics<00:01:51.380> for<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.650> future<00:01:52.009> so<00:01:52.700> it's<00:01:53.030> really

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
genetics for the future so it's really

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.639 
genetics for the future so it's really
important<00:01:53.690> and<00:01:53.869> it's<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.110> really<00:01:54.440> nice

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
important and it's a really nice

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.040
