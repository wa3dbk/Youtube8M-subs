I'm<00:00:08.330> putting<00:00:09.330> some<00:00:09.540> finishing<00:00:09.690> touches<00:00:10.200> on

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
I'm putting some finishing touches on

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.740 
I'm putting some finishing touches on
this<00:00:10.710> piece<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.309> decided<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.299> wanted

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.790 

and<00:00:15.080> I'm<00:00:15.920> going<00:00:16.309> to<00:00:16.450> begin<00:00:17.450> using<00:00:18.200> a<00:00:18.560> little

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
and I'm going to begin using a little

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.690 
and I'm going to begin using a little
bit<00:00:18.890> of<00:00:19.450> umber<00:00:20.500> the<00:00:22.660> raw<00:00:23.660> umber<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:24.320> the<00:00:25.220> tent

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
bit of umber the raw umber and the tent

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.830 
bit of umber the raw umber and the tent
and<00:00:26.060> of<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.260> lightest<00:00:28.010> gray<00:00:28.369> and<00:00:28.970> I'm

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
and of the lightest gray and I'm

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.710 
and of the lightest gray and I'm
combining<00:00:30.140> those<00:00:30.829> because<00:00:31.490> I<00:00:31.520> don't<00:00:31.970> want<00:00:32.360> to

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
combining those because I don't want to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.170 
combining those because I don't want to
make<00:00:33.680> it<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.700> lightest<00:00:35.240> light<00:00:35.480> I<00:00:35.810> can<00:00:36.350> make<00:00:36.680> it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
make it the lightest light I can make it

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.000 
make it the lightest light I can make it
until<00:00:38.180> I'm<00:00:38.960> really<00:00:39.770> ready<00:00:39.980> a<00:00:40.220> little<00:00:40.550> bit<00:00:40.760> of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
until I'm really ready a little bit of

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.900 
until I'm really ready a little bit of
form<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:44.600> little<00:00:44.960> bit<00:00:45.140> of<00:00:45.579> space<00:00:46.579> working

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
form and a little bit of space working

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.600 
form and a little bit of space working
it<00:00:47.210> out<00:00:47.330> where<00:00:47.960> I<00:00:47.990> want<00:00:48.320> it<00:00:48.440> to<00:00:48.500> I'm<00:00:49.250> going<00:00:49.520> to

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
it out where I want it to I'm going to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.420 
it out where I want it to I'm going to
give<00:00:49.790> this<00:00:50.120> a<00:00:50.390> little<00:00:50.780> bit<00:00:51.050> of<00:00:51.320> a<00:00:51.440> darker<00:00:52.010> under

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
give this a little bit of a darker under

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:00.670 
give this a little bit of a darker under
cloud<00:00:55.480> using<00:00:56.480> this<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.720> angle<00:01:00.080> here

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
cloud using this the the angle here

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.030 
cloud using this the the angle here
because<00:01:01.130> that<00:01:01.370> gives<00:01:01.640> me<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:02.210> good<00:01:03.020> control<00:01:03.560> and

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
because that gives me a good control and

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.690 
because that gives me a good control and
I<00:01:04.850> can<00:01:05.150> get<00:01:05.770> fairly<00:01:06.770> narrow<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:08.710> wider<00:01:09.710> angles

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
I can get fairly narrow to wider angles

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.960 
I can get fairly narrow to wider angles
it's<00:01:11.509> nice<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.560> be<00:01:12.680> able<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.130> get<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:15.820> just<00:01:16.820> a

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
it's nice to be able to get the just a

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.470 
it's nice to be able to get the just a
touch<00:01:17.360> more<00:01:17.860> than<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:18.890> stroke<00:01:19.490> in<00:01:19.820> some<00:01:20.360> of

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
touch more than a stroke in some of

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.630 
touch more than a stroke in some of
these<00:01:20.600> areas<00:01:20.930> because<00:01:21.260> that<00:01:21.710> can<00:01:21.950> give<00:01:22.159> me<00:01:22.400> a

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
these areas because that can give me a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.520 
these areas because that can give me a
variety<00:01:23.210> in<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.680> look<00:01:25.280> of<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:26.000> cloud<00:01:26.540> even

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
variety in the look of the cloud even

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.800 
variety in the look of the cloud even
out<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.100> soften<00:01:28.550> some<00:01:29.300> of<00:01:29.450> these<00:01:29.600> areas<00:01:30.260> a

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
out and soften some of these areas a

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:47.520 
out and soften some of these areas a
couple<00:01:32.810> more<00:01:32.960> touches<00:01:33.770> of<00:01:34.010> strong<00:01:34.580> white
