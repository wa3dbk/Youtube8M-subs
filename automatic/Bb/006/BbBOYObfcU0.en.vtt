00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
different angles and also i'm going to

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.300 
different angles and also i'm going to
go<00:00:22.330> over<00:00:22.359> the<00:00:22.630> specs<00:00:22.900> the<00:00:23.199> features<00:00:23.679> are<00:00:24.099> all

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
go over the specs the features are all

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.159 
go over the specs the features are all
kind<00:00:24.609> all<00:00:24.820> sorts<00:00:25.029> of<00:00:25.210> thing<00:00:25.449> we're<00:00:25.869> gonna<00:00:25.960> go

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
kind all sorts of thing we're gonna go

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.439 
kind all sorts of thing we're gonna go
really<00:00:26.410> in<00:00:26.679> depth<00:00:26.949> with<00:00:27.070> this<00:00:27.369> Xperia<00:00:27.880> T<00:00:28.119> and

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
really in depth with this Xperia T and

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.960 
really in depth with this Xperia T and
in<00:00:28.779> this<00:00:28.960> video<00:00:29.109> so<00:00:29.769> first<00:00:29.980> um<00:00:30.310> why<00:00:30.730> you<00:00:30.759> guys

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
in this video so first um why you guys

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.180 
in this video so first um why you guys
are<00:00:31.179> looking<00:00:31.630> at<00:00:32.259> the<00:00:32.320> photos<00:00:32.739> which<00:00:32.950> should

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
are looking at the photos which should

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.069 
are looking at the photos which should
be<00:00:33.310> playing<00:00:33.550> right<00:00:33.640> now<00:00:33.790> I'm<00:00:34.180> going<00:00:34.840> to<00:00:34.960> be

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
be playing right now I'm going to be

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.600 
be playing right now I'm going to be
going<00:00:35.320> over<00:00:35.530> some<00:00:35.770> specs<00:00:36.070> so<00:00:36.190> first<00:00:36.430> of<00:00:36.550> all

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
going over some specs so first of all

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.250 
going over some specs so first of all
it's<00:00:36.790> going<00:00:36.910> to<00:00:36.970> have<00:00:37.090> a<00:00:37.149> four<00:00:37.449> point<00:00:37.719> six<00:00:37.960> inch

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
it's going to have a four point six inch

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.700 
it's going to have a four point six inch
HD<00:00:38.949> display<00:00:39.370> one<00:00:39.940> day<00:00:39.969> mean<00:00:40.329> HD<00:00:40.899> it's<00:00:41.230> probably

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
HD display one day mean HD it's probably

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.880 
HD display one day mean HD it's probably
not<00:00:41.980> 1080p<00:00:42.579> it's<00:00:43.059> probably<00:00:43.660> going<00:00:43.870> to<00:00:43.930> be<00:00:44.019> 720p

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
not 1080p it's probably going to be 720p

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.729 
not 1080p it's probably going to be 720p
HD<00:00:45.280> so<00:00:45.879> which<00:00:46.180> means<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.539> resolution<00:00:47.079> 1280<00:00:47.559> by

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
HD so which means the resolution 1280 by

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.099 
HD so which means the resolution 1280 by
720<00:00:48.190> maybe<00:00:48.820> even<00:00:49.030> greater<00:00:49.449> so<00:00:49.780> that's<00:00:49.960> what

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
720 maybe even greater so that's what

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.889 
720 maybe even greater so that's what
I'm<00:00:50.320> assuming<00:00:51.030> there's<00:00:52.030> one<00:00:52.269> phone<00:00:52.510> i<00:00:52.660> believe

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
I'm assuming there's one phone i believe

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.290 
I'm assuming there's one phone i believe
the<00:00:53.050> LG<00:00:53.530> phone<00:00:53.800> that<00:00:54.070> has<00:00:54.190> a<00:00:54.250> 1080p<00:00:54.850> display

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
the LG phone that has a 1080p display

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.180 
the LG phone that has a 1080p display
but<00:00:55.539> i<00:00:55.570> don't<00:00:55.719> see<00:00:55.780> being<00:00:56.109> really<00:00:56.649> necessary

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
but i don't see being really necessary

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.660 
but i don't see being really necessary
at<00:00:57.309> this<00:00:57.460> point<00:00:57.760> so<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:59.530> gonna<00:00:59.739> just<00:01:00.250> say<00:01:00.429> that

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
at this point so I'm gonna just say that

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.939 
at this point so I'm gonna just say that
it's<00:01:00.789> a<00:01:00.879> 720p<00:01:01.420> again<00:01:01.929> that's<00:01:02.109> my<00:01:02.199> speculation

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
it's a 720p again that's my speculation

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.430 
it's a 720p again that's my speculation
and<00:01:03.160> it's<00:01:04.089> probably<00:01:04.390> if<00:01:04.540> I<00:01:04.809> get<00:01:04.989> proven<00:01:05.260> wrong

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
and it's probably if I get proven wrong

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.500 
and it's probably if I get proven wrong
I<00:01:05.620> would<00:01:05.680> love<00:01:05.950> that<00:01:06.010> but<00:01:06.490> it's<00:01:07.030> just<00:01:07.240> I<00:01:07.360> don't

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
I would love that but it's just I don't

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.690 
I would love that but it's just I don't
see<00:01:07.690> being<00:01:07.960> a<00:01:08.020> 1080p<00:01:08.470> display<00:01:08.950> it's<00:01:09.520> also

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
see being a 1080p display it's also

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.249 
see being a 1080p display it's also
going<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:09.909> have<00:01:10.030> a<00:01:10.060> Snapdragon<00:01:10.630> s4<00:01:10.750> processor

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
going to have a Snapdragon s4 processor

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.780 
going to have a Snapdragon s4 processor
we're<00:01:11.680> not<00:01:11.799> sure<00:01:11.920> what<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.159> clock<00:01:12.369> speed<00:01:12.640> is

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
we're not sure what the clock speed is

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.640 
we're not sure what the clock speed is
at<00:01:12.970> assuming<00:01:13.600> it's<00:01:13.750> going<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:14.020> be<00:01:14.079> a<00:01:14.110> dual-core

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
at assuming it's going to be a dual-core

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.609 
at assuming it's going to be a dual-core
processor<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:16.299> not<00:01:16.479> as<00:01:17.200> far<00:01:17.380> as<00:01:17.409> I<00:01:17.560> know

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
processor it's not as far as I know

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.410 
processor it's not as far as I know
right<00:01:17.740> now<00:01:17.950> it's<00:01:18.280> not<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.430> pro<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:19.210> many

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
right now it's not the pro that many

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.940 
right now it's not the pro that many
people<00:01:19.720> are<00:01:19.810> talking<00:01:20.140> about<00:01:20.229> it's<00:01:20.500> just<00:01:20.770> a

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
people are talking about it's just a

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.880 
people are talking about it's just a
standard<00:01:21.520> Snapdragon<00:01:22.119> s4<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:23.530> example

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
standard Snapdragon s4 for example

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.160 
standard Snapdragon s4 for example
that's<00:01:24.040> in<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.399> samsung<00:01:24.790> galaxy<00:01:24.820> s3<00:01:25.299> this<00:01:26.049> is

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
that's in the samsung galaxy s3 this is

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.990 
that's in the samsung galaxy s3 this is
also<00:01:26.350> going<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.560> have<00:01:26.740> one<00:01:27.070> gigabyte<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.700> RAM

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
also going to have one gigabyte of RAM

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.510 
also going to have one gigabyte of RAM
so<00:01:28.240> it's<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.509> one<00:01:28.899> gig<00:01:29.200> lower<00:01:29.770> than<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.189> galaxy

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
so it's a one gig lower than the galaxy

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.789 
so it's a one gig lower than the galaxy
s3<00:01:30.759> for<00:01:30.970> comparison<00:01:31.540> and<00:01:31.750> it's<00:01:32.409> also<00:01:32.590> going<00:01:32.740> to

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
s3 for comparison and it's also going to

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.580 
s3 for comparison and it's also going to
have<00:01:32.920> 16<00:01:33.460> gigabytes<00:01:34.090> of<00:01:34.270> internal<00:01:34.689> memory<00:01:35.259> but

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
have 16 gigabytes of internal memory but

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.170 
have 16 gigabytes of internal memory but
you<00:01:35.680> don't<00:01:35.829> have<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:35.979> worry<00:01:36.280> because<00:01:36.490> if<00:01:36.640> 16

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
you don't have to worry because if 16

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.940 
you don't have to worry because if 16
gig<00:01:37.390> isn't<00:01:37.600> enough<00:01:37.990> for<00:01:38.020> you<00:01:38.320> then<00:01:38.829> you're

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
gig isn't enough for you then you're

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.830 
gig isn't enough for you then you're
also<00:01:39.100> gonna<00:01:39.340> have<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.549> micro<00:01:40.030> SD<00:01:40.060> card<00:01:40.780> slot

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
also gonna have a micro SD card slot

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.359 
also gonna have a micro SD card slot
which<00:01:41.049> is<00:01:41.469> going<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.680> be<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.829> deciding<00:01:42.130> factor

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
which is going to be a deciding factor

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.160

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
but this is apparently going to be the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.500 
but this is apparently going to be the
new<00:02:37.930> flagship<00:02:38.620> device<00:02:39.040> we<00:02:40.000> saw<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.329> on<00:02:40.480> the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
new flagship device we saw this on the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.869 
new flagship device we saw this on the
roadmap<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:41.140> leaked<00:02:41.590> way<00:02:42.099> my<00:02:42.340> like<00:02:42.610> in<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
roadmap that leaked way my like in the

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.420 
roadmap that leaked way my like in the
early<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.269> 2012<00:02:43.989> we<00:02:44.409> saw<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.620> road<00:02:44.920> map<00:02:45.159> and

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
early of 2012 we saw the road map and

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.819 
early of 2012 we saw the road map and
the<00:02:45.640> Xperia<00:02:46.150> meant<00:02:46.720> was<00:02:47.019> I<00:02:47.200> think<00:02:47.409> set<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.709> come

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
the Xperia meant was I think set to come

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.460 
the Xperia meant was I think set to come
out<00:02:47.980> in<00:02:48.129> quarter<00:02:48.459> 3<00:02:48.700> or<00:02:48.879> quarter<00:02:49.180> for<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.750> 2012

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
out in quarter 3 or quarter for of 2012

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.930 
out in quarter 3 or quarter for of 2012
so<00:02:50.590> apparently<00:02:51.069> that's<00:02:51.280> when<00:02:51.459> it's<00:02:51.609> going<00:02:51.849> to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
so apparently that's when it's going to

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.640 
so apparently that's when it's going to
come<00:02:52.030> out<00:02:52.090> but<00:02:52.420> it's<00:02:53.019> going<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.200> be<00:02:53.319> unveiled

what I'm assuming this is also it has a

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.240 
what I'm assuming this is also it has a
bit<00:03:31.419> of<00:03:31.450> Sony's<00:03:31.840> customization<00:03:32.739> built<00:03:33.010> right

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
bit of Sony's customization built right

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.009 
bit of Sony's customization built right
into<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.819> has<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:33.970> new<00:03:34.209> multi-tasking<00:03:34.959> menu

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
into it it has a new multi-tasking menu

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.740 
into it it has a new multi-tasking menu
the<00:03:35.829> widgets<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.459> looked<00:03:36.639> like<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.030> widgets<00:03:37.540> a

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
the widgets it looked like the widgets a

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.270 
the widgets it looked like the widgets a
bit<00:03:37.930> changed<00:03:38.169> a<00:03:38.410> bit<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.709> way<00:03:38.859> you<00:03:38.919> put

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
bit changed a bit the way you put

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.009 
bit changed a bit the way you put
widgets<00:03:39.639> on<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.910> screen<00:03:40.150> things<00:03:40.690> like<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:40.989> I

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
widgets on the screen things like the I

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.110 
widgets on the screen things like the I
still<00:03:41.470> has<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.769> transparency<00:03:42.489> look<00:03:42.879> and

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
still has that transparency look and

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.539 
still has that transparency look and
feel<00:03:43.780> or<00:03:44.230> actually<00:03:44.680> I<00:03:44.889> wouldn't<00:03:45.099> know<00:03:45.250> feel

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
feel or actually I wouldn't know feel

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.550 
feel or actually I wouldn't know feel
but<00:03:45.790> if<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.209> does<00:03:46.389> it<00:03:46.629> is<00:03:46.840> probably<00:03:47.169> gonna<00:03:47.349> feel

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
but if it does it is probably gonna feel

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.309 
but if it does it is probably gonna feel
the<00:03:47.680> same<00:03:47.889> way<00:03:48.010> as<00:03:48.069> xperia<00:03:48.549> s<00:03:48.870> but<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:50.019> seems

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
the same way as xperia s but it seems

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.050 
the same way as xperia s but it seems
very<00:03:50.500> nice<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:50.980> seems<00:03:51.220> like<00:03:51.400> it's<00:03:51.579> not<00:03:51.730> letting

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
very nice it seems like it's not letting

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.819 
very nice it seems like it's not letting

know how it feels but it seems to look a

bit thicker than the galaxy s3 for
comparison<00:04:40.650> but<00:04:41.280> it's<00:04:41.340> probably<00:04:42.210> going<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:42.630> be

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
comparison but it's probably going to be

what I would hope it also seems to have

hopefully it's a prototype and they

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.089 
hopefully it's a prototype and they
might<00:05:27.090> change<00:05:27.270> in<00:05:27.449> final<00:05:27.750> version<00:05:28.020> and<00:05:28.199> if<00:05:28.889> not
