00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
roof of the building now there are two

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.220 
roof of the building now there are two
different<00:00:33.210> ways<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.480> doing<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> will

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
different ways of doing this and I will

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.260 
different ways of doing this and I will
explain<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.920> few<00:00:35.070> moments<00:00:35.489> time<00:00:35.700> but

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
explain in just a few moments time but

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.150 
explain in just a few moments time but
first<00:00:36.510> as<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.050> see<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.590> can't<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:37.980> walk

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
first as you can see you can't just walk

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.470 
first as you can see you can't just walk
straight<00:00:38.460> through<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.670> main<00:00:38.790> doors<00:00:39.120> because

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
straight through the main doors because

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.360 
straight through the main doors because
the<00:00:39.570> doors<00:00:39.780> themselves<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:40.379> closed<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.980> it's

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the doors themselves are closed and it's

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.010 
the doors themselves are closed and it's
a<00:00:41.520> CL<00:00:41.850> building<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:42.840> mentioned

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
a CL building but as mentioned

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.510 
a CL building but as mentioned
previously<00:00:43.200> there<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.010> glitch<00:00:44.309> which

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
previously there is a glitch which

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.340 
previously there is a glitch which
allows<00:00:44.760> us<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:44.969> access<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.600> building<00:00:46.020> but<00:00:46.289> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
allows us to access this building but to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.260 
allows us to access this building but to
use<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.620> glitch<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.520> first<00:00:47.820> will<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
use that glitch you first will have to

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.220 
use that glitch you first will have to
make<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.600> way<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> roof<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
building and to do that you have two

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.549 
building and to do that you have two
options<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.690> either<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:52.020> yourself<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
options you can either get yourself a
