00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
that instead castling was jumping in the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.349 
that instead castling was jumping in the
middle<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.560> 5<00:00:28.800> he<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:29.670> really<00:00:29.910> group<00:00:30.060> with<00:00:30.210> his

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
middle of 5 he was really group with his

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.389 
middle of 5 he was really group with his
team<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.810> fix<00:00:31.050> could<00:00:31.260> use<00:00:31.439> away<00:00:31.890> them<00:00:32.130> all<00:00:32.279> at

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
team so fix could use away them all at

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.340 
team so fix could use away them all at
the<00:00:32.489> same<00:00:32.640> time<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.329> think<00:00:33.840> they<00:00:34.079> display

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the same time and I think they display

the same time and I think they display
the<00:00:34.469> team<00:00:34.620> fights<00:00:34.829> really<00:00:35.040> valid<00:00:35.340> they<00:00:35.460> play

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the team fights really valid they play

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.520 
the team fights really valid they play
them<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.880> bit<00:00:36.030> better<00:00:36.210> who<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.780> been<00:00:36.960> much

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.020 
as it used to be not not as the sky she
used<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.860> that's<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.159> sure<00:01:26.430> before<00:01:26.909> he

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
used to be that's for sure before he

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.399 
used to be that's for sure before he
will<00:01:27.150> use<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.509> first<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.049> win<00:01:28.259> almost

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
will use we first we can win almost

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.130 
will use we first we can win almost
every<00:01:28.650> game<00:01:28.920> now<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.659> could<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:30.930> he<00:01:31.110> was

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
every game now you you could see he was

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.510 
every game now you you could see he was
not<00:01:31.380> about<00:01:31.500> champion<00:01:31.890> he<00:01:32.009> was<00:01:32.159> really<00:01:32.369> good

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
not about champion he was really good

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.399 
not about champion he was really good
and<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.210> think<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.509> everyone<00:01:33.930> kind<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.259> saw

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and I think that everyone kind of saw

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.289 
and I think that everyone kind of saw
that<00:01:34.439> he<00:01:34.680> had<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.829> lot<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.070> potential<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:35.670> he

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
that he had a lot of potential but he

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.569 
that he had a lot of potential but he
was<00:01:36.450> always<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.920> not<00:01:37.920> doing<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.220> much<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.549> he

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
was always a not doing as much as he

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.460 
was always a not doing as much as he
could<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.880> think<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> lot<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.479> fights<00:01:39.780> him<00:01:40.320> and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
could I think in a lot of fights him and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.200 
could I think in a lot of fights him and
Catholics<00:01:40.799> who<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> split<00:01:41.369> especially

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
Catholics who the split especially

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
Catholics who the split especially

candy copenhagen wolves have the ability

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.920 
candy copenhagen wolves have the ability
to<00:04:54.170> play<00:04:54.560> aggressive<00:04:55.010> early<00:04:55.420> and<00:04:56.420> I<00:04:56.630> think

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
to play aggressive early and I think

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.390 
to play aggressive early and I think
they're<00:04:57.110> gonna<00:04:57.200> need<00:04:57.620> to<00:04:57.830> do<00:04:57.980> that<00:04:58.010> in<00:04:58.280> this

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
they're gonna need to do that in this

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.760 
they're gonna need to do that in this
next<00:04:58.610> game<00:04:58.670> if<00:04:59.000> they<00:04:59.300> elect<00:04:59.690> denial<00:05:00.140> set<00:05:00.650> the

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
not the right moment to go in just let

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.290 
not the right moment to go in just let
them<00:05:30.890> take<00:05:31.040> a<00:05:31.130> Drake<00:05:31.340> what<00:05:31.550> is<00:05:31.640> a<00:05:31.760> drag<00:05:31.910> anyways

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
them take a Drake what is a drag anyways

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.920 
them take a Drake what is a drag anyways
a<00:05:32.330> 800<00:05:33.140> goal<00:05:33.290> especially<00:05:33.650> before<00:05:34.430> mini<00:05:34.930> 31

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
a 800 goal especially before mini 31

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.180 
a 800 goal especially before mini 31
Drake<00:05:36.170> is<00:05:36.290> not<00:05:36.470> that<00:05:36.560> much<00:05:36.620> when<00:05:36.950> you<00:05:37.040> have<00:05:37.160> a

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
Drake is not that much when you have a

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.650 
Drake is not that much when you have a
better<00:05:37.370> set<00:05:37.610> of<00:05:37.730> like<00:05:37.880> I<00:05:37.970> think<00:05:38.180> open<00:05:38.420> items

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
better set of like I think open items

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.450 
better set of like I think open items
will<00:05:38.840> have<00:05:38.870> either<00:05:39.620> when<00:05:39.770> it<00:05:39.890> come<00:05:40.040> to<00:05:40.190> minute

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
will have either when it come to minute

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.400 
will have either when it come to minute
if<00:05:40.640> we<00:05:40.880> do<00:05:41.090> an<00:05:41.240> equal<00:05:41.570> to<00:05:41.720> me<00:05:41.810> a<00:05:41.870> foreign<00:05:42.170> I

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
if we do an equal to me a foreign I

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.310 
if we do an equal to me a foreign I
think<00:05:43.010> they<00:05:43.100> will<00:05:43.250> have<00:05:43.370> managed<00:05:43.670> to<00:05:43.820> use<00:05:44.000> win

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
think they will have managed to use win

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.200 
think they will have managed to use win
easier<00:05:45.320> than<00:05:45.350> trying<00:05:46.160> to<00:05:46.340> fight<00:05:46.550> early<00:05:46.910> for<00:05:47.180> a

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
easier than trying to fight early for a

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.180 
easier than trying to fight early for a
Drake<00:05:47.540> so<00:05:48.260> whatever<00:05:48.410> they<00:05:48.650> do<00:05:48.710> they<00:05:48.860> have<00:05:49.070> to

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
Drake so whatever they do they have to

Drake so whatever they do they have to
do<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.460> was<00:05:49.610> a<00:05:49.640> conviction<00:05:50.120> we're<00:05:50.690> gonna<00:05:50.780> take

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
do it was a conviction we're gonna take

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.210 
do it was a conviction we're gonna take
a<00:05:51.050> quick<00:05:51.290> breather<00:05:51.530> but<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:51.950> action

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
a quick breather but the action

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.010 
a quick breather but the action
continues<00:05:52.340> when<00:05:52.970> we<00:05:53.000> return<00:05:53.150> with<00:05:53.540> Game<00:05:53.780> two

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020
