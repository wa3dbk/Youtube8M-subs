00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
idea what's lacking is make sure its

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.870

attacks<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.869> high<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.590> make<00:02:02.430> sure<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.729> has

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880

good<00:02:03.149> speed<00:02:03.509> as<00:02:03.810> well<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.710> way<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.520> can<00:02:05.610> just

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
good speed as well that way you can just

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.700 
good speed as well that way you can just
attack<00:02:06.180> straight<00:02:06.540> away<00:02:06.869> take<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
pokemon and then the turn ability

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.880 
pokemon and then the turn ability
doesn't<00:02:09.599> even<00:02:09.810> matter<00:02:10.080> because<00:02:10.379> you've<00:02:10.860> just

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.740 
facade does beside again doubles your
attack<00:03:12.280> power<00:03:12.310> if<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.300> has<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.480> status

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
attack power if it has a status

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.570 
attack power if it has a status
condition<00:03:14.350> so<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.680> think<00:03:14.920> about<00:03:15.220> all<00:03:15.520> that

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
condition so you think about all that

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.970 
condition so you think about all that
power<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.510> move<00:03:16.720> you've<00:03:17.320> got<00:03:17.440> an<00:03:17.500> animator

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
power in the move you've got an animator

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.430 
power in the move you've got an animator
serene<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:18.489> it<00:03:18.580> detects<00:03:18.940> already<00:03:19.570> better<00:03:20.080> than

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
serene so it detects already better than

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.100 
serene so it detects already better than
every<00:03:20.950> other<00:03:20.980> stat<00:03:21.519> then<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.180> have<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.870> gut

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
every other stat then you have the gut

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.140 
every other stat then you have the gut
ability<00:03:23.739> which<00:03:24.220> means<00:03:24.489> its<00:03:24.670> attack<00:03:24.970> is

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
ability which means its attack is

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.449 
ability which means its attack is
doubled<00:03:25.780> if<00:03:26.019> it's<00:03:26.530> got<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> status<00:03:26.980> condition

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
doubled if it's got a status condition

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.880 
doubled if it's got a status condition
which<00:03:27.820> it<00:03:28.030> will<00:03:28.300> and<00:03:28.690> then<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:29.260> uses<00:03:29.410> facade

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
which it will and then it uses facade

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.190 
which it will and then it uses facade
which<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.489> attack<00:03:30.730> power<00:03:30.970> is<00:03:31.120> doubled<00:03:31.810> so

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
which the attack power is doubled so

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.930 
which the attack power is doubled so
facade<00:03:32.709> could<00:03:33.070> be<00:03:33.160> one<00:03:33.310> of<00:03:33.340> those<00:03:33.519> powerful

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
facade could be one of those powerful

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.090 
facade could be one of those powerful
