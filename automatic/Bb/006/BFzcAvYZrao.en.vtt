00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.290
 the dense fog continues to affect the activities of the inhabitants of the area 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.609
 north of sinaloa 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:11.849
 for just over a week 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.660
 intense banks have registered in the municipality of ahome and with it accidents 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.980
 that already claimed the life of a person on the international highway 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.080
 authorities specialized in the subject 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.230
 warn that the weather conditions will continue in a 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.170
 similar for that direct line presents them the following points that 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.060
 many will help you to prevent accidents 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.090
 the fog reduces visibility some tens of meters and sometimes some 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.460
 meters I only tried the visibility now that the drivers for us 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.950
 see well 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.170
 our troops may become irritated by the fixity with which we are going 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.620
 looking a few meters in front of the vehicle 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.660
 also sounds with fog want muffled and this data does not 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.390
 we can calculate the distances well 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.220
 on the other hand of the country while it is usually wet or at least humid with 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.910
 danger of slip 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.230
 consequently a reduction in speed is imposed in such a way 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.230
 that we can stop the vehicle in a visible space in front 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.790
 we also have a space of 30 meters we can not circulate more than 50 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.030
 kilometers per hour there that still produced change of direction we should 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.789
 take extreme precautions for lack of visibility 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:24.760
 to make it 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.660
 we will operate the windshield wipers and direct this hot air current 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.170
 likewise in the interior 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.799
 the driving fog is very intense fatigue so we will watch 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.100
 constantly 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.570
 without lowering the guard for fatigue and fatigue 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.730
 sometimes I rested circularly behind another vehicle that precedes us but 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.140
 if we do this we will keep the safety distance in any case increased 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.570
 because we can not foresee the decrease in speed that will be his behavior 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.680
 before a danger that we do not but 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.619
 from a road and double direction of circulation 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.399
 we will try to advance it because of the risk that this supposes if the fog is very 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:04.480
 special 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.320
 to see us better we will use the low lights and if we have installed the 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.690
 fog lights we can also make use of them with just the legs or 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.279
 only those of me 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:19.319
 to be seen better by the back we will use lighting 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.459
 ordinary and also the rear fog lighting 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.590
 if we have 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.809
 and the existing fog 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.790
 It is convenient to check the operation of the taillights and their cleaning to 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.320
 drive with less risk of leaving the field 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.910
 we will look at the pavement lines that usually lend a valuable 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.910
 help both the center and the one on our right side 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:43.329
 circulating with fog we will follow in principle to reduced visibility 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.249
 reduced speed 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.949
 We bet at the maximum speed indicated by signaling 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.459
 specific 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.769
 so to spend a white Christmas still with fog remember to respect the 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.530
 Speed â€‹â€‹limits use the seatbelt keep prudent distance 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.290
 between one car and another 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.979
 Proper use of intermittent directional lights 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.879
 observe traffic instructions, whether they are signaling traffic lights and 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:09.939
 official 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.180
 and do not forget that the holiday season has already begun, let's avoid that fog 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.089
 speed and alcohol 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:18.909
 there are moments that are to enjoy as a family 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.879
 with images of soul rose aguirre reported that the direct line portal 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.109
