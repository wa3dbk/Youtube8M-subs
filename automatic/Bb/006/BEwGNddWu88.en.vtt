00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:24.439
 hello how are we today with a review 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.439
 of the rom to have 12 for samsung i7500 lm 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.140
 good this new has been just released 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.079
 yesterday is still 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.570
 and it is finished although some subjects 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.250
 that are still not being done 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.890
 example I have the post topic 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.250
 and still lacks a bit of development 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.430
 but if the meeting is finished what 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.150
 is fluency is as normal as in any 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.460
 side 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.880
 ram consumption have been improved 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.880
 still 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.460
 we have a hundred with sites used and 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.520
 We are currently using settings 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.059
 an equalizer a widget another widget a 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.210
 music player maps veas audio and 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.080
 other applications when they have we have 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.470
 spent little 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.110
 therefore it is a good performance 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.870
 besides, it seems to me if we go on battery 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.810
 we have two hours busy worried 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.000
 basically with music and the rest in 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.530
 waiting time but now we are going to 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.250
 try how are we going to deactivate 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.840
 airplane mode and we're going to extend what 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.119
 are the 3g data 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.119
 and let's see how the battery goes 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.869
 what is the first time I have 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.960
 flaked has not yet given him the 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.700
 first load is since I did the 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.409
 the rom so let's see how it 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.899
 it includes the battery from its first 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.119
 installed logically when the 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.820
 time and will be more regularized 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.070
 drums 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.630
 there he entered the browser quickly without 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.990
 no problem what is wifi or wifi 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.480
 Also works 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.970
 you are going to activate it 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.070
 and being where no network is because 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.280
 I do not have a router activated but if 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.280
 works 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.260
 is based on a 2.3 gingerbread 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.680
 and good everything works 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.489
 see the whole music plays 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.489
 perfectly 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.330
 water allows us a little bit what is the 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.330
 position and 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.940
 Of course 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.360
 we can not go back to overtake 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.360
 everything is normal 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.550
 from what I tell them they can also 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.550
 do what 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.049
 and one in this version 2 has also been 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:23.510
 improved what is the audio I do not know if it 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:27.909
 can notice but that is with a little 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.909
 we have uploaded and listened well 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.900
 and in this populous down only 1% 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:37.129
 and we are still creating music from 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.110
 done plays all normal videos 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:43.930
 our fluidity and so on 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.900
 the memories in the old version 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.940
 were reversed in this version has been 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.400
 improved and now allows the option to 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.900
 exchange them or have them normal I would 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.870
 I have exchanged to put more 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.870
 applications which benefits me 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.010
 the camera also works perfectly 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.409
 the same is not going to take much the bottom 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.409
 why 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:23.159
 with is some photo 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.229
 of what is a table and other photos that 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:27.419
 they're getting out there all here 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.020
 normally there is no problem in that gravel 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.020
 teapot 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.110
 and the battery good if nothing has gone down 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.080
 in what games are also 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.789
 they work normal there's no problem in that 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.919
 and some has been all for this little 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.870
 revision the forgiveness is what is the 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.650
 quickly I have done it and we give everything 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.000
 but I was with a lot of trouble it will be 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.000
 so it's all 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.849
 and good , see you next video 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.290
 sorry 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.490
 what is the installation in this version 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.320
 It has included some glasses that are for 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.880
 a better interface all this is going to be 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.890
 in a post that are laws in the video 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.960
 so they know how to install it so 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.330
 review the description of the video where 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.490
 is going to do a post and the tutorial and 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.670
 review until next time
