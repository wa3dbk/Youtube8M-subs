Holley sends in a question and I thought
was<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.009> pretty<00:01:10.160> good<00:01:10.430> one<00:01:10.640> what<00:01:11.539> is<00:01:11.720> the

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
was a pretty good one what is the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.600 
was a pretty good one what is the
importance<00:01:12.440> of<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:12.710> spark<00:01:13.009> plug<00:01:13.039> I<00:01:13.430> thought

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
importance of the spark plug I thought

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.420 
importance of the spark plug I thought
that<00:01:13.789> was<00:01:13.880> fitting<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:15.009> there's<00:01:16.009> actually

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
that was fitting and there's actually

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.160 
that was fitting and there's actually
more<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:16.759> a<00:01:16.789> spark<00:01:17.149> plug<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.630> what<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:17.840> lot<00:01:18.080> of

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
more to a spark plug and what a lot of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.219 
more to a spark plug and what a lot of
people<00:01:18.410> think<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:18.770> I<00:01:18.950> thought<00:01:19.369> I'd<00:01:19.520> go<00:01:20.229> take

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
people think so I thought I'd go take

people think so I thought I'd go take
