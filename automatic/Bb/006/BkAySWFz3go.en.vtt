accurate measurements to make sure these

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.000 
accurate measurements to make sure these
walls<00:00:44.950> just<00:00:45.190> fall<00:00:45.400> right<00:00:45.640> into<00:00:45.820> place<00:00:45.910> I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
walls just fall right into place I

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.229 
walls just fall right into place I
didn't<00:00:48.010> know<00:00:48.100> anything<00:00:48.400> about<00:00:48.700> superior

he showed us this house across the
street<00:00:56.620> that<00:00:56.950> was<00:00:57.100> currently<00:00:57.460> under

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
street that was currently under

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.380 
street that was currently under
construction<00:00:59.520> using<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.610> superior<00:01:01.120> wall

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
construction using the superior wall

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.170 
construction using the superior wall
system<00:01:02.250> showed<00:01:03.250> us<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.460> benefits<00:01:03.940> of<00:01:04.089> the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
system showed us the benefits of the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.380 
system showed us the benefits of the
walls<00:01:04.449> I<00:01:04.870> was<00:01:05.500> able<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.880> convince<00:01:06.880> us<00:01:07.120> that<00:01:07.150> it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
walls I was able to convince us that it

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.310 
walls I was able to convince us that it
was<00:01:07.510> a<00:01:07.540> good<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:08.170> good<00:01:09.130> way<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.370> go<00:01:09.670> for<00:01:10.320> energy

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
was a good a good way to go for energy

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.560 
was a good a good way to go for energy
conservation<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:14.190> quick<00:01:15.570> construction

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
conservation and quick construction

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.090 
conservation and quick construction
processes<00:01:17.940> so<00:01:18.940> again<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:20.650> can<00:01:20.800> see<00:01:20.950> these

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
processes so again you can see these

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.620 
processes so again you can see these
guys<00:01:21.340> are<00:01:21.400> putting<00:01:21.790> that<00:01:21.970> wall<00:01:22.180> right<00:01:22.450> into

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
guys are putting that wall right into

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.020 
guys are putting that wall right into
place<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.890> as<00:01:24.070> you<00:01:24.250> can<00:01:24.430> tell<00:01:24.670> from<00:01:24.700> the

way to go in our new home saving energy

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.960 
way to go in our new home saving energy
every<00:02:19.110> day<00:02:19.140> because<00:02:19.650> these<00:02:19.860> walls<00:02:20.160> they're

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
every day because these walls they're

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.210 
every day because these walls they're
gonna<00:02:21.090> save<00:02:21.450> us<00:02:21.660> at<00:02:21.810> least<00:02:21.959> 30<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.530> 35<00:02:22.980> percent

gonna save us at least 30 to 35 percent

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.030 
gonna save us at least 30 to 35 percent
on<00:02:23.550> our<00:02:23.670> energy<00:02:24.150> heat<00:02:25.080> loss<00:02:25.319> in<00:02:25.560> our<00:02:25.680> new<00:02:25.830> home

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
on our energy heat loss in our new home

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.339
