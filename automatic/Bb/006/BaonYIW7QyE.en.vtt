I can see on the end there's the piece

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.139 
I can see on the end there's the piece
for<00:01:54.720> using<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> water<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.790> all<00:01:56.939> has<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
for using the water and it all has a

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.880 
for using the water and it all has a
purpose<00:01:57.270> which<00:01:57.960> we'll<00:01:58.140> explain<00:01:58.469> as<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:58.680> go

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
purpose which we'll explain as we go

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.310 
purpose which we'll explain as we go
along<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.399> these<00:02:00.030> wafers<00:02:00.570> need<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:01.079> cut

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
along and these wafers need to be cut

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.959 
along and these wafers need to be cut
into<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.619> specific<00:02:01.890> pattern<00:02:02.310> which<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.820> does

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
into a specific pattern which it does

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.370 
into a specific pattern which it does
show<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> box<00:02:03.689> go<00:02:03.899> ahead<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.170> put<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
show you on the box go ahead and put the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.649 
show you on the box go ahead and put the
last<00:02:04.530> cut<00:02:04.860> through<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.280> one<00:02:05.460> there<00:02:05.659> alright

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
last cut through that one there alright

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.940 
last cut through that one there alright
and<00:02:06.719> let<00:02:07.049> me<00:02:07.140> see<00:02:07.290> what<00:02:07.469> we've<00:02:07.590> got<00:02:07.740> these

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and let me see what we've got these

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.380 
and let me see what we've got these
pieces<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.759> then<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> other<00:02:09.030> one<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
pieces and then the other one is a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.029 
pieces and then the other one is a
little<00:02:09.569> different<00:02:09.720> pattern<00:02:10.259> but<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.890> very

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
little different pattern but it's very

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.200 
little different pattern but it's very
important<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.730> do<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> way
