00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:59.549
 Next to the disadvantage of the person's advantages

 In a caring mind, one person is also charming . 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.709
 The part of my abilities that I can look attractive to others 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.970

 For example, please give me a lot of people. 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:47.810

 So I get to organize and then I respond to people in a sick relationship 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:20.900
 How to write a good way to acknowledge and sympathize with people 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:26.450
 I think that you can become a person with a charm , and your favorite field 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:30.470
 If you have a good field, I'll tell you something about that occasionally. 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:35.449
 I have a lot of fun with it. 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:40.490
 Anyone who has been interested in one or two things for a long time, 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:45.350
 The related topic seems to be able to entertain the story . 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.120

 How fun to look out for if you feel a smile ku feedback 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.169
 I write everything down to notes 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:17.720
 I think I 'm getting a sense of humor through these efforts. 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:21.470
 It's a little bit of a sense of humor or something special . 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:25.820
 Any deep interest in something special or this work 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:31.070
 I think you can have time passing, and you'll be attracted to me right now. 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:37.160
