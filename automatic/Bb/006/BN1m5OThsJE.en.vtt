transport<00:00:13.280> these<00:00:14.280> are<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.670> three<00:00:15.000> ways<00:00:15.330> in

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
transport these are the three ways in

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.689 
transport these are the three ways in
which<00:00:16.160> substances<00:00:17.300> move<00:00:18.300> into<00:00:19.109> or<00:00:19.859> out<00:00:20.580> of

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
which substances move into or out of

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.310 
which substances move into or out of
cells<00:00:21.439> like<00:00:22.439> diffusion<00:00:23.279> osmosis<00:00:24.019> or<00:00:25.019> active

cells like diffusion osmosis or active
transport<00:00:27.500> diffusion<00:00:30.050> is<00:00:31.550> when<00:00:34.309> molecules

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
transport diffusion is when molecules

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.530 
transport diffusion is when molecules
move<00:00:36.210> from<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.110> region<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.739> their<00:00:38.040> high

the<00:01:09.160> process<00:01:09.670> is<00:01:09.940> described<00:01:10.750> as<00:01:11.020> being

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
the process is described as being

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.370 
the process is described as being
passive<00:01:12.990> because<00:01:13.990> we<00:01:14.410> do<00:01:14.650> not<00:01:14.830> have<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.280> add

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
passive because we do not have to add

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.530 
passive because we do not have to add
energy<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:20.290> energy<00:01:20.890> comes<00:01:21.550> from<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.970> kinetic

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
energy the energy comes from the kinetic

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.180 
energy the energy comes from the kinetic
energy<00:01:23.170> of<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.860> molecules<00:01:24.010> themselves

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:41.100 

osmosis<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.280> movement<00:01:33.550> of<00:01:36.300> water<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
osmosis is the movement of water the

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.560 
osmosis is the movement of water the
rule<00:01:41.350> for<00:01:41.620> us<00:01:41.650> mosses<00:01:42.190> is<00:01:42.400> that<00:01:42.940> water<00:01:43.210> will

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
rule for us mosses is that water will

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.690 
rule for us mosses is that water will
move<00:01:43.840> from<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:45.100> dilute<00:01:46.060> solution<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:50.290> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
move from the dilute solution to the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:01.540 
move from the dilute solution to the
concentrated<00:01:51.700> solution<00:01:53.640> through<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.910> membrane

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.610 

here<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.860> contents<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.730> cell<00:02:05.000> are

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
here the contents of the cell are

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.290 
here the contents of the cell are
concentrated<00:02:06.620> and<00:02:06.830> it's<00:02:07.490> surrounded<00:02:08.060> by<00:02:08.119> a

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
concentrated and it's surrounded by a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:17.820 
concentrated and it's surrounded by a
solution<00:02:12.220> which<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.540> dilute

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:26.010 

and<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:19.050> water<00:02:20.460> enters<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.490> cell<00:02:22.260> or<00:02:24.810> we<00:02:25.810> can

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
and so water enters the cell or we can

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.330 
and so water enters the cell or we can
have<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.800> cell<00:02:27.130> in<00:02:28.140> which<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.500> contents<00:02:30.160> are

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
have the cell in which the contents are

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.260 
have the cell in which the contents are
dilute<00:02:31.060> in<00:02:31.740> comparison<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.610> surrounding

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
dilute in comparison to the surrounding

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.210 
dilute in comparison to the surrounding
fluid<00:02:35.140> around<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.130> cell<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:37.750> which<00:02:37.810> case<00:02:38.320> the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
fluid around the cell in which case the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.430 
fluid around the cell in which case the
prediction<00:02:39.820> according<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.570> rule<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:41.110> that

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
prediction according to the rule is that

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.070 
prediction according to the rule is that
water<00:02:41.950> will<00:02:42.310> move<00:02:42.520> from<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.060> dilute<00:02:43.510> solution

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
water will move from the dilute solution

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.370 
water will move from the dilute solution
inside<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.920> cell<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.700> cytoplasm<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
inside the cell in the cytoplasm to the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.650 
inside the cell in the cytoplasm to the
concentrated<00:02:48.190> solution<00:02:48.820> surrounding<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
concentrated solution surrounding the

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.420 
concentrated solution surrounding the
cell<00:02:50.160> this<00:02:51.160> is<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.880> process<00:02:52.360> of<00:02:52.600> osmosis

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
cell this is the process of osmosis

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.620 
cell this is the process of osmosis
where<00:02:54.430> water<00:02:55.170> moves<00:02:56.170> from<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:56.950> dilute<00:02:57.490> solution

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
where water moves from a dilute solution

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.850 
where water moves from a dilute solution
to<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.660> concentrated<00:02:59.500> solution<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:02.470> third

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
to a concentrated solution the third

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:10.449 
to a concentrated solution the third
process<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:04.000> called<00:03:04.930> active<00:03:06.959> transport

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.160 

in<00:03:11.329> this<00:03:11.629> situation<00:03:13.239> molecules<00:03:14.239> can<00:03:14.780> be<00:03:14.810> moved

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
in this situation molecules can be moved

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.910 
in this situation molecules can be moved
from<00:03:15.799> outside<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.579> cell<00:03:16.849> to<00:03:17.120> inside<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:18.140> cell

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.030 

where<00:03:21.920> they've<00:03:22.370> build<00:03:22.819> up<00:03:23.120> high

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
where they've build up high

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.360 
where they've build up high
concentration<00:03:25.150> inside<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.180> cell<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:28.040> notice

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
concentration inside the cell so notice

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.559 
concentration inside the cell so notice
that<00:03:28.400> we're<00:03:28.790> going<00:03:28.969> from<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.329> low

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
that we're going from a low

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.289 
that we're going from a low
concentration<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.790> high<00:03:32.060> concentration

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
concentration to a high concentration

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.199 
concentration to a high concentration
and<00:03:33.139> this<00:03:33.799> means<00:03:34.069> that<00:03:34.219> we<00:03:34.549> have<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:34.909> add

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
and this means that we have to add

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.629 
and this means that we have to add
energy<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:38.180> is<00:03:38.359> what<00:03:38.629> makes<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.049> process

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
energy this is what makes the process

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.170 
energy this is what makes the process
active<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:42.530> we<00:03:42.560> transport<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.700> molecules

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
active so we transport the molecules

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.309 
active so we transport the molecules
from<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.599> low<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.590> high<00:03:46.599> low<00:03:48.159> to<00:03:49.159> high

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
from a low to a high low to high

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.890 
from a low to a high low to high
concentration<00:03:51.319> but<00:03:51.980> we<00:03:52.129> must<00:03:52.430> add<00:03:52.700> energy<00:03:53.419> to

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
concentration but we must add energy to

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.520 
concentration but we must add energy to
the<00:03:54.470> system<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:55.340> achieve<00:03:55.459> this<00:03:56.290> this<00:03:57.290> can

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
the system to achieve this this can

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.300 
the system to achieve this this can
equally<00:03:58.129> happen<00:03:58.549> in<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.939> opposite<00:03:59.450> direction

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
equally happen in the opposite direction

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.899 
equally happen in the opposite direction
where<00:04:01.310> molecules<00:04:01.609> are<00:04:02.439> actively<00:04:03.909> transported

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
where molecules are actively transported

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.119 
where molecules are actively transported
out<00:04:05.359> of<00:04:05.419> the<00:04:05.719> cell<00:04:06.250> from<00:04:07.250> a<00:04:07.489> low<00:04:07.849> concentration

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
out of the cell from a low concentration

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.649 
out of the cell from a low concentration
to<00:04:10.129> the<00:04:10.250> high<00:04:10.480> concentration<00:04:11.480> of<00:04:11.569> the

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
to the high concentration of the

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.099 
to the high concentration of the
molecule<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:13.280> would<00:04:13.549> still<00:04:14.030> require<00:04:14.239> energy

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
molecule this would still require energy

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.930 
molecule this would still require energy
this<00:04:15.620> is<00:04:15.859> still<00:04:16.220> an<00:04:16.340> example<00:04:16.970> of<00:04:17.530> active

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
this is still an example of active

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.940 
this is still an example of active
transport
