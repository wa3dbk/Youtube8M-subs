00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
ready you know for the studio because of

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.470 
ready you know for the studio because of
that<00:03:09.010> sign<00:03:09.489> of<00:03:09.609> quality<00:03:09.969> so<00:03:10.120> they're<00:03:10.269> really

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
that sign of quality so they're really

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:29.539

great

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.070 

since<00:03:30.549> I've<00:03:30.670> been<00:03:30.700> an<00:03:31.120> endorsing<00:03:31.599> artist<00:03:31.959> I

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
since I've been an endorsing artist I

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.539

think<00:03:32.290> I've<00:03:32.409> had<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.680> chance<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.040> playing<00:03:33.370> just

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
think I've had a chance to playing just

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.759 
think I've had a chance to playing just
about<00:03:33.640> every<00:03:34.150> line<00:03:34.360> of<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.200> Zildjian<00:03:35.590> cymbals

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
about every line of the Zildjian cymbals

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
really great about the Kuro 22-inch is

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.340 
really great about the Kuro 22-inch is
that<00:04:15.760> it<00:04:15.849> really<00:04:16.090> cuts<00:04:16.389> and<00:04:16.720> it's<00:04:16.989> very<00:04:17.169> much<00:04:17.320> a

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
that it really cuts and it's very much a

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.170 
that it really cuts and it's very much a
definitive<00:04:17.769> sound<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.489> was<00:04:18.579> very<00:04:18.760> interesting

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
definitive sound it was very interesting

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.960 
definitive sound it was very interesting
when<00:04:19.329> I<00:04:19.359> was<00:04:19.449> playing<00:04:20.139> it<00:04:20.380> earlier<00:04:20.700> it's<00:04:21.700> like

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
when I was playing it earlier it's like

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.390 
when I was playing it earlier it's like
man<00:04:22.270> like<00:04:22.510> right<00:04:22.930> out<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.260> box<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.830> just<00:04:23.889> gets

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
man like right out the box it just gets

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.370 
man like right out the box it just gets
right<00:04:24.669> to<00:04:24.880> that<00:04:25.000> very<00:04:25.240> clear<00:04:25.570> sound<00:04:25.840> so<00:04:26.349> I

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
right to that very clear sound so I

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.420 
right to that very clear sound so I
really<00:04:26.680> think<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.919> Kuralt

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
really think the Kuralt

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.250 
really think the Kuralt
22-inch<00:04:27.940> cymbal<00:04:28.419> is<00:04:28.539> going<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:28.750> really<00:04:28.930> fill

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
22-inch cymbal is going to really fill

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.440 
22-inch cymbal is going to really fill
in<00:04:29.410> that<00:04:29.560> gap<00:04:29.620> of<00:04:30.130> getting<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.970> ride<00:04:31.180> cymbal

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
in that gap of getting a ride cymbal

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.339 
in that gap of getting a ride cymbal
that<00:04:31.750> can<00:04:32.020> cross<00:04:32.380> all<00:04:32.680> kind<00:04:33.160> of<00:04:33.280> genres<00:04:33.760> and

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
that can cross all kind of genres and

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.510 
that can cross all kind of genres and
specifically<00:04:35.349> in<00:04:35.500> jazz<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:35.979> has<00:04:36.099> a<00:04:36.130> broad

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
specifically in jazz it has a broad

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:50.520 
specifically in jazz it has a broad
range

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.830 

I've<00:04:51.530> spent<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.490> full<00:04:52.820> gamut<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.330> Hyatts<00:04:53.690> I

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
I've spent the full gamut of Hyatts I

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.990

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
that I used to just use to crash cymbals

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.130

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
is the 20 because it really surprised me

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.040 
is the 20 because it really surprised me
because<00:05:35.870> I<00:05:36.080> again<00:05:36.650> I'm<00:05:36.800> a<00:05:36.890> 22<00:05:37.310> guy<00:05:37.520> but<00:05:38.300> uh<00:05:38.330> when

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
because I again I'm a 22 guy but uh when

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.530 
because I again I'm a 22 guy but uh when
I<00:05:39.080> played<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:39.680> 20<00:05:40.100> inch<00:05:40.220> it<00:05:40.910> had<00:05:41.270> so<00:05:41.480> much

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
I played the 20 inch it had so much

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.240 
I played the 20 inch it had so much
range<00:05:42.020> you<00:05:42.440> know<00:05:42.560> and<00:05:42.680> it<00:05:42.770> had<00:05:42.920> a<00:05:42.950> really

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
range you know and it had a really

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.570 
range you know and it had a really
really<00:05:44.120> great<00:05:44.270> definitive<00:05:45.170> sort<00:05:45.470> of<00:05:45.590> cut<00:05:46.430> when

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
really great definitive sort of cut when

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.190 
really great definitive sort of cut when
I<00:05:46.610> wrote<00:05:46.910> you<00:05:47.150> know<00:05:47.270> did<00:05:47.570> my<00:05:47.720> ride<00:05:47.900> cymbal

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
I wrote you know did my ride cymbal

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.750 
I wrote you know did my ride cymbal
pattern<00:05:48.230> on<00:05:48.620> it<00:05:48.800> but<00:05:49.250> then<00:05:49.430> when<00:05:49.610> I<00:05:49.640> started

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
pattern on it but then when I started

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.790 
pattern on it but then when I started
crashing<00:05:50.480> on<00:05:50.600> it<00:05:50.720> it<00:05:50.900> was<00:05:51.230> really<00:05:51.350> great<00:05:51.650> and

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
crashing on it it was really great and

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.590 
crashing on it it was really great and
so<00:05:51.920> it<00:05:52.040> was<00:05:52.190> the<00:05:52.580> one<00:05:52.790> symbol<00:05:53.060> to<00:05:53.240> me<00:05:53.390> that<00:05:53.570> I

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
so it was the one symbol to me that I

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.200 
so it was the one symbol to me that I
think<00:05:54.290> can<00:05:54.470> mix<00:05:54.830> you<00:05:55.490> know<00:05:55.610> in<00:05:55.820> so<00:05:56.060> many

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
think can mix you know in so many

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.330 
think can mix you know in so many
different<00:05:56.750> styles<00:05:57.200> not<00:05:57.530> that<00:05:57.680> the<00:05:57.770> others<00:05:58.040> can

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
different styles not that the others can

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.980 
different styles not that the others can
but<00:05:58.880> it<00:05:59.030> was<00:05:59.150> the<00:05:59.240> one<00:05:59.390> symbol<00:05:59.600> that<00:05:59.720> really

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
but it was the one symbol that really

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
but it was the one symbol that really
surprised<00:06:00.380> me<00:06:00.560> in<00:06:00.710> terms<00:06:00.860> of<00:06:01.010> the<00:06:01.100> fullness
