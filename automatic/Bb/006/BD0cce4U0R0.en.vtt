well<00:00:05.600> what<00:00:05.750> exactly<00:00:05.870> is<00:00:06.319> genetically

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
well what exactly is genetically

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.400 
well what exactly is genetically
modified<00:00:07.220> food<00:00:07.490> you<00:00:07.880> know<00:00:08.029> I<00:00:08.480> think<00:00:09.050> people

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
modified food you know I think people

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.990 
modified food you know I think people
that<00:00:09.740> appropriate<00:00:10.370> testing<00:00:10.700> has<00:00:10.820> been<00:00:10.940> done

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
that appropriate testing has been done

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.390 
that appropriate testing has been done
and<00:00:11.480> I<00:00:11.630> happier<00:00:11.960> with<00:00:12.170> it<00:00:12.200> but<00:00:12.980> I<00:00:13.070> think<00:00:13.100> it's

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
and I happier with it but I think it's

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.119 
and I happier with it but I think it's
the<00:00:13.550> fear<00:00:13.730> of<00:00:13.850> not<00:00:14.030> really<00:00:14.269> knowing<00:00:14.950> what<00:00:15.950> if

was bad so do much about it made I trust

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.819 
was bad so do much about it made I trust
the<00:03:32.910> scientists<00:03:33.390> they<00:03:34.049> think<00:03:34.290> I'd<00:03:34.380> buy<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.590> on

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
the scientists they think I'd buy it on

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.949 
the scientists they think I'd buy it on
the<00:03:34.860> section<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.579> was<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:36.540> if<00:03:36.630> I<00:03:36.720> knew<00:03:36.840> what

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
the section you it was so if I knew what

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.380 
the section you it was so if I knew what
it<00:03:37.049> was<00:03:37.200> then<00:03:37.560> yeah<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.519> makes<00:03:38.730> agriculture

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
it was then yeah it makes agriculture

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.210 
it was then yeah it makes agriculture
more<00:03:39.510> productive<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.049> stuff<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:41.010> more

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
more productive and stuff and more

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.039

people in planet this farmland I think

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.059
