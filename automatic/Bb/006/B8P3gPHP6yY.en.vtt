doing is training for a speed and you

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
see if I can do all those fast but all

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.350 
see if I can do all those fast but all
those<00:00:40.170> control<00:00:40.770> now<00:00:41.610> I'm<00:00:41.910> talking<00:00:42.180> about

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
those control now I'm talking about

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900 
those control now I'm talking about
game-like<00:00:42.780> speed<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.789> able

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
game-like speed so you have to be able

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.170 
game-like speed so you have to be able
to<00:00:45.090> follow<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.200> levels<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.309> checkpoints<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
to follow the levels the checkpoints to

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.160 
to follow the levels the checkpoints to
truly<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:48.899> fast<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:50.059> here's<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> drill<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.600> have

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
truly be fast so here's the drill I have

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.630 
truly be fast so here's the drill I have
one<00:00:52.410> ball<00:00:52.590> that's<00:00:52.770> colored<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.579> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
one ball that's colored this is going to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.189 
one ball that's colored this is going to
serve<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.030> visual<00:00:54.239> because<00:00:54.809> you're<00:00:55.110> going

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
serve as a visual because you're going

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.040 
serve as a visual because you're going
to<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.550> ball<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
to see that one ball is going to be the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.740 
to see that one ball is going to be the
pin<00:00:58.260> ball<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.010> ball<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.609> never<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.660> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
pin ball and this ball is never going to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.009 
pin ball and this ball is never going to
pick<00:01:00.960> up<00:01:01.140> its<00:01:01.350> dribble<00:01:02.120> until<00:01:03.120> my<00:01:03.539> partner's

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
pick up its dribble until my partner's

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.560 
pick up its dribble until my partner's
holding<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> color<00:01:04.860> ball<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.729> point<00:01:06.299> I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
holding the color ball at that point I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.660 
holding the color ball at that point I
can<00:01:07.350> finally<00:01:07.619> stop<00:01:07.979> my<00:01:08.159> trip

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
can finally stop my trip

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
can finally stop my trip
so<00:01:09.119> that's<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.600> restriction<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:10.500> your

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
so that's your restriction that's your

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.630 
so that's your restriction that's your
guideline<00:01:11.189> here<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.920> then<00:01:13.950> cross<00:01:14.430> cross

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
guideline here we go then cross cross

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.130 
guideline here we go then cross cross
got<00:01:15.270> my<00:01:15.360> pass<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.259> let<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:17.780> always<00:01:18.780> pin<00:01:19.020> in

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
got my pass and let that always pin in

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.270 
got my pass and let that always pin in
the<00:01:19.200> color<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.680> got<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.159> drop<00:01:25.070> quick<00:01:26.070> quick

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the color you got a drop quick quick

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.760 
the color you got a drop quick quick
good<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.060> got<00:01:27.180> his<00:01:27.299> moves<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:28.110> got<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.290> drop<00:01:28.590> so

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
good you got his moves you got a drop so

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.640 
good you got his moves you got a drop so
you<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.369> without<00:01:29.970> losing<00:01:30.420> speed<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
you can do this without losing speed and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.010 
you can do this without losing speed and
always<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.280> control<00:01:32.670> now<00:01:33.420> your<00:01:33.689> game

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
always have it control now your game

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.280 
always have it control now your game
like<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.780> that's<00:01:36.900> how<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.140> get

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
like that and that's how you get

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.170 
like that and that's how you get
game-like<00:01:37.560> results<00:01:43.670> another<00:01:44.670> version<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
game-like results another version of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.880 
game-like results another version of
this<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.540> obviously<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.020> give<00:01:46.320> myself<00:01:46.500> more

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
this is obviously to give myself more

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.980 
this is obviously to give myself more
moves<00:01:47.399> now<00:01:48.180> I'm<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.479> focus<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.840> mine

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
moves now I'm going to focus on mine

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.469 
moves now I'm going to focus on mine
through<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> legs<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:50.280> after<00:01:50.700> my<00:01:50.820> ball<00:01:51.240> is

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
through the legs so after my ball is

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.160 
through the legs so after my ball is
pinned

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
pinned

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.560 
pinned
I<00:01:52.200> perform<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.070> through<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> legs<00:01:53.670> move<00:01:53.939> my

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
I perform it through the legs move my

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.660 
I perform it through the legs move my
feet<00:01:54.899> always<00:01:55.320> beating<00:01:55.890> my<00:01:55.979> defenders<00:01:56.430> feet

feet always beating my defenders feet
that<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.689> my<00:01:58.290> scoop<00:01:58.619> pass<00:01:58.860> keeping<00:01:59.250> myself<00:01:59.369> low

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
that is my scoop pass keeping myself low

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.209 
that is my scoop pass keeping myself low
while<00:02:00.540> maintaining<00:02:00.810> my<00:02:01.229> dribble<00:02:01.590> before<00:02:02.009> I

while maintaining my dribble before I
make<00:02:02.430> my<00:02:02.460> last

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
make my last

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.330 
make my last
I<00:02:03.710> must<00:02:04.520> get<00:02:05.060> my<00:02:05.120> other<00:02:05.330> side<00:02:05.660> to<00:02:06.590> pass<00:02:06.770> my<00:02:07.010> part

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.200 

now<00:02:10.340> we're<00:02:10.460> going<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.610> change<00:02:10.760> it<00:02:10.910> up<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.120> little

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
now we're going to change it up a little

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.720 
now we're going to change it up a little
bit<00:02:11.450> I'm<00:02:11.720> going<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:11.990> control<00:02:12.590> as<00:02:12.950> fast<00:02:13.460> as<00:02:13.640> I

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
bit I'm going to control as fast as I

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.390 
bit I'm going to control as fast as I
