in<00:00:00.140> this<00:00:01.100> video<00:00:01.370> we<00:00:01.910> will<00:00:02.060> review<00:00:02.120> the

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:02.689 
in this video we will review the

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.460 
in this video we will review the
combined<00:00:03.139> separate<00:00:04.129> and<00:00:04.310> merge<00:00:04.790> tools<00:00:05.470> while

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
combined separate and merge tools while

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.379 
combined separate and merge tools while
working<00:00:06.680> Amaya<00:00:07.069> you<00:00:07.339> may<00:00:07.549> find<00:00:07.759> it<00:00:07.910> useful<00:00:07.939> to

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
working Amaya you may find it useful to

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.049 
working Amaya you may find it useful to
combine<00:00:08.690> objects<00:00:09.410> together<00:00:09.559> as<00:00:09.980> one<00:00:10.400> object

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
combine objects together as one object

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.270 
combine objects together as one object
the<00:00:11.719> combined<00:00:12.139> tool<00:00:12.349> is<00:00:12.650> what<00:00:12.799> you<00:00:12.950> will<00:00:13.099> want

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
the combined tool is what you will want

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.080 
the combined tool is what you will want
to<00:00:13.339> use<00:00:13.450> I'm<00:00:14.450> going<00:00:14.690> to<00:00:14.929> create<00:00:15.230> a<00:00:15.349> sphere<00:00:15.650> and

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
to use I'm going to create a sphere and

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.900 
to use I'm going to create a sphere and
a<00:00:17.090> cylinder<00:00:17.650> and<00:00:18.650> it<00:00:19.369> will<00:00:19.460> change<00:00:19.699> the

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
a cylinder and it will change the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.859 
a cylinder and it will change the
subdivisions<00:00:20.630> on<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:21.560> objects<00:00:22.630> this<00:00:23.630> will

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
subdivisions on the objects this will

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:24.820 
subdivisions on the objects this will
come<00:00:24.019> into<00:00:24.140> play<00:00:24.380> later

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
come into play later

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.160 
come into play later
when<00:00:25.550> we<00:00:25.699> will<00:00:25.849> be<00:00:26.000> merging<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.720> objects

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
when we will be merging the objects

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.320 
when we will be merging the objects
together<00:00:27.500> but<00:00:28.340> for<00:00:28.519> right<00:00:28.640> now<00:00:28.699> let's<00:00:28.849> move

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
together but for right now let's move

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.460 
together but for right now let's move
the<00:00:29.390> objects<00:00:29.900> into<00:00:30.140> position<00:00:35.200> I'm<00:00:36.200> going<00:00:36.380> to

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
the objects into position I'm going to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.830 
the objects into position I'm going to
duplicate<00:00:36.950> both<00:00:37.160> these<00:00:37.310> objects<00:00:37.820> to<00:00:38.090> just<00:00:38.720> so

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
duplicate both these objects to just so

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.350 
duplicate both these objects to just so
I<00:00:38.870> can<00:00:38.990> show<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.530> difference<00:00:39.860> between

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
I can show the difference between

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.580 
I can show the difference between
merging<00:00:41.360> and<00:00:43.690> combining<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:44.960> objects<00:00:47.590> now

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
merging and combining the objects now

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.500 
merging and combining the objects now
that<00:00:48.770> we<00:00:48.890> have<00:00:49.100> our<00:00:49.280> objects<00:00:49.730> together<00:00:49.850> let's

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
that we have our objects together let's

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.900 
that we have our objects together let's
go<00:00:50.690> about<00:00:50.810> combining<00:00:51.170> both<00:00:52.070> of<00:00:52.250> these<00:00:52.430> objects

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
go about combining both of these objects

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.240 
go about combining both of these objects
together<00:00:53.080> first<00:00:54.080> you'll<00:00:54.350> want<00:00:54.560> to<00:00:54.650> select

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
together first you'll want to select

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.840 
together first you'll want to select
both<00:00:56.060> of<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.450> objects<00:00:56.990> that<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:58.430> want<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.760> go

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
both of the objects that you want to go

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.140 
both of the objects that you want to go
bine<00:00:59.260> then<00:01:00.260> go<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:01.220> mesh<00:01:02.560> combine<00:01:03.560> and<00:01:04.090> now<00:01:05.090> you

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
bine then go to mesh combine and now you

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.420 
bine then go to mesh combine and now you
can<00:01:05.390> see<00:01:05.660> that<00:01:06.320> two<00:01:06.530> objects<00:01:06.980> have<00:01:07.280> been

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
can see that two objects have been

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.960 
can see that two objects have been
combined<00:01:07.910> into<00:01:08.180> one<00:01:09.100> so<00:01:10.100> anytime<00:01:10.310> we<00:01:10.490> select

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
combined into one so anytime we select

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.530 
combined into one so anytime we select
this<00:01:11.600> object<00:01:11.900> it<00:01:12.620> turns<00:01:13.250> green<00:01:14.890> if<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:17.390> need

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
this object it turns green if you need

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.350 
this object it turns green if you need
to<00:01:17.660> separate<00:01:18.140> these<00:01:18.290> objects<00:01:18.800> again<00:01:19.210> we<00:01:20.210> can

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
to separate these objects again we can

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.600 
to separate these objects again we can
do<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:20.750> by<00:01:20.930> using<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.680> separate<00:01:22.190> command

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
do that by using the separate command

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.400 
do that by using the separate command
and<00:01:23.020> that's<00:01:24.020> located<00:01:24.530> under<00:01:24.830> mesh<00:01:25.040> and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
and that's located under mesh and

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.990 
and that's located under mesh and
separate<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:29.270> now<00:01:29.510> you<00:01:29.570> can<00:01:29.750> see<00:01:29.960> we<00:01:30.409> have

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
separate and now you can see we have

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.149 
separate and now you can see we have
separated<00:01:32.000> our<00:01:32.210> objects<00:01:32.720> back<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.950> two

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
separated our objects back to two

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.790 
separated our objects back to two
objects<00:01:34.640> again<00:01:38.200> sometimes<00:01:39.200> you<00:01:39.409> may<00:01:39.560> want<00:01:39.590> to

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
objects again sometimes you may want to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.190 
objects again sometimes you may want to
merge<00:01:40.070> your<00:01:40.100> objects<00:01:40.760> together<00:01:41.060> now<00:01:41.780> merging

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
merge your objects together now merging

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.320 
merge your objects together now merging
is<00:01:42.320> different<00:01:42.740> than<00:01:42.890> combining<00:01:43.460> when<00:01:44.210> you

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
is different than combining when you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.180 
is different than combining when you
combine<00:01:44.720> you're<00:01:45.260> essentially<00:01:45.740> taking<00:01:46.070> two

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
combine you're essentially taking two

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.010 
combine you're essentially taking two
objects<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.850> having<00:01:47.120> them<00:01:47.270> behave<00:01:47.630> as<00:01:47.810> one

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
objects and having them behave as one

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.100 
objects and having them behave as one
when<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.100> merge<00:01:49.400> objects<00:01:50.090> together<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:50.990> will

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
when you merge objects together you will

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.370 
when you merge objects together you will
be<00:01:51.229> deleting<00:01:51.650> faces<00:01:52.130> from<00:01:52.370> both<00:01:52.550> objects<00:01:53.090> and

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
be deleting faces from both objects and

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.020 
be deleting faces from both objects and
merging<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.500> vertices<00:01:54.830> together<00:01:55.370> to<00:01:55.880> make

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
merging the vertices together to make

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.930 
merging the vertices together to make
one<00:01:56.299> seamless<00:01:56.720> object<00:01:57.470> let<00:01:58.250> me<00:01:58.340> demonstrate

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
one seamless object let me demonstrate

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.770 
one seamless object let me demonstrate
first<00:01:59.840> let's<00:02:00.350> recombine<00:02:01.070> this<00:02:01.670> object<00:02:04.780> grab

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
first let's recombine this object grab

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.809 
first let's recombine this object grab
both<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.140> objects<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:06.890> hit<00:02:07.790> combine<00:02:09.670> when<00:02:10.670> we

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
both the objects and hit combine when we

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.860 
both the objects and hit combine when we
go<00:02:10.970> into<00:02:11.090> wireframe<00:02:11.330> mode

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
go into wireframe mode

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.149 
go into wireframe mode
you<00:02:13.049> can<00:02:13.230> see<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:15.180> full<00:02:15.480> sphere<00:02:15.659> and<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.980> full

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
you can see the full sphere and the full

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.180 
you can see the full sphere and the full
cylinder<00:02:17.670> they're<00:02:18.599> just<00:02:18.959> acting<00:02:19.830> as<00:02:20.010> one

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
cylinder they're just acting as one

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.509 
cylinder they're just acting as one
object<00:02:23.510> now<00:02:24.510> let's<00:02:25.110> go<00:02:25.590> back<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:25.830> shaded<00:02:26.370> mode

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
object now let's go back to shaded mode

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.770 
object now let's go back to shaded mode
and<00:02:27.890> let's<00:02:28.890> prepare<00:02:29.069> these<00:02:29.459> objects<00:02:30.000> for

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
and let's prepare these objects for

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.569 
and let's prepare these objects for
merging<00:02:32.540> first<00:02:33.540> let's<00:02:34.200> delete<00:02:34.409> some<00:02:34.890> faces

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
merging first let's delete some faces

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:47.080 
merging first let's delete some faces
off<00:02:35.819> of<00:02:36.239> this<00:02:36.360> sphere<00:02:41.150> first<00:02:42.150> let's<00:02:42.329> go<00:02:42.480> to

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.550 

component<00:02:48.090> mode<00:02:48.269> select<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.930> faces<00:02:49.200> we'd

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
component mode select the faces we'd

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.339 
component mode select the faces we'd
like<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.890> delete<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.870> delete<00:02:51.870> them<00:02:54.170> now<00:02:55.170> let's

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
like to delete and delete them now let's

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.380 
like to delete and delete them now let's
do<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.650> same<00:02:55.970> for<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.150> cylinder<00:02:59.060> but<00:03:00.060> what<00:03:00.269> we

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
do the same for the cylinder but what we

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.300 
do the same for the cylinder but what we
want<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.690> do<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.989> just<00:03:01.230> delete<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.680> faces<00:03:02.159> on

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
want to do is just delete the faces on

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:11.180 
want to do is just delete the faces on
the<00:03:02.430> top<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.599> cylinder<00:03:09.890> if<00:03:10.890> we<00:03:11.010> look

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
the top of the cylinder if we look

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.430 
the top of the cylinder if we look
inside<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:12.269> can<00:03:12.390> see<00:03:12.599> we<00:03:12.750> only<00:03:12.780> have<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.260> top

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
inside you can see we only have the top

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.110 
inside you can see we only have the top
faces<00:03:13.890> selected<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.519> let's<00:03:15.209> delete<00:03:15.569> these

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
faces selected and let's delete these

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.210 
faces selected and let's delete these
now<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.810> we<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:19.049> these<00:03:19.200> faces<00:03:19.739> deleted

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
now that we have these faces deleted

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.940 
now that we have these faces deleted
we'll<00:03:20.639> be<00:03:20.849> able<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.120> merge<00:03:21.900> these<00:03:22.500> vertices

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
we'll be able to merge these vertices

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.690 
we'll be able to merge these vertices
together<00:03:23.599> after<00:03:24.599> we<00:03:24.720> combine<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.230> object<00:03:25.700> so

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
together after we combine the object so

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.150 
together after we combine the object so
let's<00:03:26.849> go<00:03:26.970> back<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.239> object<00:03:27.359> mode<00:03:27.919> select<00:03:28.919> both

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
let's go back to object mode select both

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.729 
let's go back to object mode select both
of<00:03:29.310> our<00:03:29.430> objects<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.209> go<00:03:31.200> up<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.440> mesh<00:03:31.940> combine

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
of our objects and go up to mesh combine

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.220 
of our objects and go up to mesh combine
and<00:03:34.739> now<00:03:34.919> you<00:03:34.980> can<00:03:35.160> see<00:03:35.340> we<00:03:35.700> have<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.810> top<00:03:37.079> of

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
and now you can see we have the top of

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.800 
and now you can see we have the top of
the<00:03:37.319> sphere<00:03:37.379> and<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:39.150> bottom<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.629> the

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
the sphere and the bottom of the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.390 
the sphere and the bottom of the
cylinder<00:03:40.250> combined<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.430> one<00:03:41.579> object<00:03:43.400> now

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
cylinder combined is one object now

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.740 
cylinder combined is one object now
there<00:03:44.579> are<00:03:44.669> a<00:03:44.730> few<00:03:44.910> different<00:03:45.180> tools<00:03:45.389> we<00:03:45.599> can

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
there are a few different tools we can

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.199 
there are a few different tools we can
use<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:46.019> merge<00:03:46.379> our<00:03:46.530> vertices<00:03:47.010> together<00:03:47.209> the

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
use to merge our vertices together the

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.349 
use to merge our vertices together the
first<00:03:48.510> is<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:49.260> merge<00:03:49.530> vertex<00:03:50.250> tool<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:51.269> I'll

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
first is the merge vertex tool and I'll

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.140 
first is the merge vertex tool and I'll
show<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.569> how<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:51.989> tool<00:03:52.199> works<00:03:54.199> let's<00:03:55.199> go<00:03:55.560> to

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
show you how that tool works let's go to

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.319 
show you how that tool works let's go to
edit<00:03:57.150> mesh<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.919> down<00:03:58.919> to<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.370> merge<00:03:59.669> vertex

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
edit mesh and down to the merge vertex

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.689 
edit mesh and down to the merge vertex
tool<00:04:00.620> as<00:04:01.620> soon<00:04:01.799> as<00:04:01.859> we<00:04:01.980> do<00:04:02.129> that<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.430> can<00:04:02.459> see

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
tool as soon as we do that you can see

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.479 
tool as soon as we do that you can see
we<00:04:02.819> go<00:04:03.060> right<00:04:03.329> to<00:04:03.359> component<00:04:03.959> mode<00:04:04.139> and<00:04:04.489> we're

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
we go right to component mode and we're

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.420 
we go right to component mode and we're
looking<00:04:06.090> at<00:04:06.180> our<00:04:06.239> vertices<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.199> if<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.069> take<00:04:08.250> my

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
looking at our vertices and if I take my

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.390 
looking at our vertices and if I take my
cursor<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:09.090> put<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.599> near<00:04:10.019> a<00:04:10.169> vertex<00:04:10.680> you<00:04:11.250> can

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
cursor and put it near a vertex you can

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.030 
cursor and put it near a vertex you can
see<00:04:11.549> it<00:04:11.639> gets<00:04:11.910> highlighted<00:04:12.510> as<00:04:12.629> red<00:04:13.139> this<00:04:13.980> is

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
see it gets highlighted as red this is

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.430 
see it gets highlighted as red this is
going<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:14.609> be<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.879> vertex<00:04:15.299> that<00:04:15.540> we<00:04:15.660> move<00:04:15.989> and

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
going to be the vertex that we move and

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.400 
going to be the vertex that we move and
if<00:04:17.039> I<00:04:17.160> click<00:04:17.519> on<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.849> you<00:04:18.269> can<00:04:18.389> see<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.840> the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
if I click on it you can see that the

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.339 
if I click on it you can see that the
vertex<00:04:19.769> changes<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.340> little<00:04:20.519> bit<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.229> with<00:04:22.229> the

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
vertex changes a little bit and with the

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.709 
vertex changes a little bit and with the
mouse<00:04:22.500> button<00:04:22.860> still<00:04:23.159> selected<00:04:23.789> I<00:04:23.969> can<00:04:24.210> drag

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:24.719 
mouse button still selected I can drag

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:25.710 
mouse button still selected I can drag
up

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
up

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.750 
up
to<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.140> vertex<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:26.680> would<00:04:26.980> like<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.280> move<00:04:27.460> this

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
to the vertex I would like to move this

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.010 
to the vertex I would like to move this
one<00:04:28.060> too

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
one too

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.010 
one too
and<00:04:29.110> merge<00:04:30.010> them<00:04:30.280> together<00:04:30.600> so<00:04:31.600> when<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:31.750> let<00:04:31.990> go

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
and merge them together so when I let go

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.760 
and merge them together so when I let go
on<00:04:32.200> my<00:04:32.320> mouse<00:04:32.500> button<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:34.240> vertex<00:04:34.720> jumps<00:04:35.200> to

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
on my mouse button the vertex jumps to

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.880 
on my mouse button the vertex jumps to
the<00:04:35.890> same<00:04:36.070> position<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.730> merges<00:04:37.270> as<00:04:37.450> one<00:04:37.890> let

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
the same position and merges as one let

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.390 
the same position and merges as one let
me<00:04:38.950> show<00:04:39.100> you<00:04:39.190> how<00:04:39.280> this<00:04:39.430> works<00:04:39.610> again<00:04:41.400> bring

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400

these are merged together

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.840 
these are merged together
I'll<00:04:53.830> hit<00:04:54.010> queued<00:04:54.370> I<00:04:54.550> get<00:04:54.730> out<00:04:54.850> of<00:04:54.970> this<00:04:55.090> tool

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
I'll hit queued I get out of this tool

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.960 
I'll hit queued I get out of this tool
let's<00:04:57.850> move<00:04:58.210> over<00:04:58.330> to<00:04:58.600> these<00:04:59.070> vertexes<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.280> I

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
let's move over to these vertexes and I

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.040 
let's move over to these vertexes and I
will<00:05:01.120> show<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:01.420> the<00:05:02.290> next<00:05:02.560> tool<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:04.690> next<00:05:04.900> one

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
will show you the next tool the next one

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.220 
will show you the next tool the next one
is<00:05:05.200> called<00:05:05.380> merge<00:05:05.950> to<00:05:06.340> Center<00:05:06.730> tool<00:05:07.000> this<00:05:07.990> one

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
is called merge to Center tool this one

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.320 
is called merge to Center tool this one
works<00:05:08.560> by<00:05:08.770> selecting<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.400> vertices<00:05:09.880> you

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
works by selecting the vertices you

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.720 
works by selecting the vertices you
would<00:05:10.480> like<00:05:10.630> to<00:05:10.780> merge<00:05:10.960> together<00:05:11.260> first<00:05:11.830> so

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
would like to merge together first so

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.260 
would like to merge together first so
let's<00:05:12.940> select<00:05:13.480> the<00:05:14.230> two<00:05:14.820> vertices<00:05:15.820> we'd<00:05:16.120> like

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
let's select the two vertices we'd like

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.420 
let's select the two vertices we'd like
to<00:05:16.420> merge<00:05:16.600> and<00:05:17.310> then<00:05:18.310> go<00:05:18.580> up<00:05:18.700> to<00:05:18.730> edit<00:05:19.180> mesh<00:05:19.390> and

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
to merge and then go up to edit mesh and

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.850 
to merge and then go up to edit mesh and
merge<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.700> Center

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
merge to Center

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.560 
merge to Center
and<00:05:23.860> now<00:05:24.160> you<00:05:24.250> can<00:05:24.400> see<00:05:24.669> what<00:05:25.120> this<00:05:25.300> tool<00:05:25.510> does

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
and now you can see what this tool does

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.960 
and now you can see what this tool does
is<00:05:25.840> takes<00:05:26.350> the<00:05:26.530> two<00:05:26.710> vertexes<00:05:27.520> that<00:05:27.730> you<00:05:27.850> would

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
is takes the two vertexes that you would

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.630 
is takes the two vertexes that you would
like<00:05:28.120> to<00:05:28.270> merge<00:05:28.480> and<00:05:28.840> kind<00:05:29.800> of<00:05:29.890> moves<00:05:30.190> them

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
like to merge and kind of moves them

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.590 
like to merge and kind of moves them
both<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.390> meet<00:05:31.570> in<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.900> middle<00:05:36.330> let<00:05:37.330> me<00:05:37.450> show

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
both to meet in the middle let me show

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.780 
both to meet in the middle let me show
you<00:05:37.660> again<00:05:37.870> how<00:05:38.080> this<00:05:38.230> works<00:05:38.470> select<00:05:39.220> the<00:05:39.580> two

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
you again how this works select the two

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.460 
you again how this works select the two
vertexes<00:05:40.480> you<00:05:40.750> would<00:05:40.840> like<00:05:41.050> to<00:05:41.290> merge

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
vertexes you would like to merge

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.960 
vertexes you would like to merge
together<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:43.330> go<00:05:43.479> up<00:05:43.600> to<00:05:43.720> edit<00:05:43.900> mesh<00:05:44.729> merge<00:05:45.729> to

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
together and go up to edit mesh merge to

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.150 
together and go up to edit mesh merge to
Center<00:05:46.330> and<00:05:47.250> they<00:05:48.250> merge<00:05:48.580> in<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:50.710> middle<00:05:50.979> of

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
Center and they merge in the middle of

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.740 
Center and they merge in the middle of
where<00:05:51.700> they<00:05:51.880> were<00:05:51.940> both<00:05:52.180> positioned<00:05:54.690> now<00:05:55.690> we

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
where they were both positioned now we

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.570 
where they were both positioned now we
can<00:05:55.960> use<00:05:56.110> either<00:05:56.290> one<00:05:56.440> of<00:05:56.620> these<00:05:56.740> tools<00:05:57.220> all

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
can use either one of these tools all

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
can use either one of these tools all
the<00:05:57.640> way<00:05:58.210> around<00:05:58.540> our<00:05:58.690> object<00:06:00.120> to<00:06:01.120> merge<00:06:01.330> these

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
the way around our object to merge these

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.719 
the way around our object to merge these
vertexes<00:06:02.140> together<00:06:02.470> but<00:06:03.100> depending<00:06:03.520> on<00:06:03.610> the

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
vertexes together but depending on the

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.790 
vertexes together but depending on the
complexity<00:06:04.240> of<00:06:04.390> your<00:06:04.510> object<00:06:05.080> that<00:06:05.350> could<00:06:05.590> be

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
complexity of your object that could be

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.159 
complexity of your object that could be
very<00:06:06.010> time-consuming<00:06:06.570> there's<00:06:07.570> another<00:06:07.840> tool

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
very time-consuming there's another tool

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.930 
very time-consuming there's another tool
we<00:06:08.410> could<00:06:08.590> use<00:06:08.800> to<00:06:08.979> speed<00:06:09.250> up<00:06:09.370> the<00:06:09.490> process

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
we could use to speed up the process

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:17.270 
we could use to speed up the process
that<00:06:10.780> is<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.080> merge<00:06:11.290> tool<00:06:11.620> let<00:06:12.520> me<00:06:12.610> undo<00:06:13.290> these

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.710 

merges<00:06:18.280> that<00:06:18.490> I<00:06:18.520> have<00:06:18.790> done<00:06:19.030> so<00:06:19.450> we<00:06:19.540> can<00:06:19.660> get

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
merges that I have done so we can get

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.469 
merges that I have done so we can get
back<00:06:19.960> to<00:06:20.260> our<00:06:20.530> full<00:06:21.280> split<00:06:22.060> object<00:06:24.180> the<00:06:25.180> merge

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
back to our full split object the merge

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.810 
back to our full split object the merge
tool<00:06:25.810> will<00:06:26.229> allow<00:06:26.350> us<00:06:26.650> to<00:06:26.860> select<00:06:27.340> a<00:06:27.610> large

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
tool will allow us to select a large

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.450 
tool will allow us to select a large
number<00:06:28.120> of<00:06:28.240> vertexes<00:06:28.870> and<00:06:29.280> merge<00:06:30.280> them

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
number of vertexes and merge them

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.700 
number of vertexes and merge them
together<00:06:30.700> at<00:06:31.060> one<00:06:31.270> time<00:06:31.510> let<00:06:32.200> me<00:06:32.320> show<00:06:32.380> you<00:06:32.590> how

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
together at one time let me show you how

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.570 
together at one time let me show you how
this<00:06:32.860> works<00:06:34.560> now<00:06:35.560> that<00:06:35.830> we're<00:06:35.979> in<00:06:36.070> component

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
this works now that we're in component

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.460 
this works now that we're in component
mode<00:06:37.470> we<00:06:38.470> will<00:06:38.710> go<00:06:39.099> in

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
mode we will go in

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.540 
mode we will go in
select<00:06:39.800> all<00:06:40.100> the<00:06:40.490> vertexes<00:06:42.040> that<00:06:43.040> we<00:06:43.190> need<00:06:43.400> to

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
select all the vertexes that we need to

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.880 
select all the vertexes that we need to
merge<00:06:43.760> together<00:06:44.030> so<00:06:44.660> I'll<00:06:44.750> go<00:06:44.900> to<00:06:44.930> front<00:06:45.830> view

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:45.890 
merge together so I'll go to front view

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:51.310 
merge together so I'll go to front view
and<00:06:46.570> select<00:06:47.570> all<00:06:48.500> of<00:06:48.820> those<00:06:49.930> vertexes<00:06:50.930> that<00:06:51.200> we

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
and select all of those vertexes that we

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.920 
and select all of those vertexes that we
want<00:06:51.560> to<00:06:51.620> merge<00:06:51.860> together<00:06:52.540> once<00:06:53.540> we<00:06:53.630> have<00:06:53.810> them

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
want to merge together once we have them

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.400 
want to merge together once we have them
selected<00:06:54.110> we<00:06:54.800> can<00:06:54.830> go<00:06:55.100> up<00:06:55.220> to<00:06:55.370> edit<00:06:55.520> mesh<00:06:55.790> and

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.410 
selected we can go up to edit mesh and

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.540 
selected we can go up to edit mesh and
merge<00:06:59.350> now<00:07:00.350> it<00:07:00.500> looks<00:07:00.680> like<00:07:00.860> it<00:07:01.160> didn't<00:07:01.430> do

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.550 
merge now it looks like it didn't do

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.240 
merge now it looks like it didn't do
anything<00:07:01.790> but<00:07:02.780> first<00:07:03.350> let's<00:07:03.590> take<00:07:03.740> a<00:07:03.800> look<00:07:03.890> at

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
anything but first let's take a look at

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.960 
anything but first let's take a look at
our<00:07:04.550> options<00:07:05.680> under<00:07:06.680> poly<00:07:06.920> merge<00:07:07.220> vertex<00:07:07.760> we

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:07.970 
our options under poly merge vertex we

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.520 
our options under poly merge vertex we
can<00:07:08.090> see<00:07:08.240> our<00:07:08.390> first<00:07:08.660> option<00:07:08.960> is<00:07:09.350> called

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
can see our first option is called

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.940 
can see our first option is called
distance<00:07:10.070> a<00:07:10.960> distance<00:07:11.960> determines<00:07:12.470> how<00:07:12.620> far

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:12.950 
distance a distance determines how far

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.640 
distance a distance determines how far
away<00:07:13.280> your<00:07:13.640> vertices<00:07:14.150> can<00:07:14.390> be<00:07:14.420> before<00:07:15.230> Maya

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
away your vertices can be before Maya

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.700 
away your vertices can be before Maya
will<00:07:16.190> be<00:07:16.310> able<00:07:16.460> to<00:07:16.640> merge<00:07:17.090> them<00:07:17.330> together<00:07:17.710> so

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710 
will be able to merge them together so

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.450 
will be able to merge them together so
let's<00:07:18.980> try<00:07:19.190> increasing<00:07:19.520> this<00:07:19.940> number<00:07:20.270> a<00:07:20.300> bit

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:21.460 
let's try increasing this number a bit

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.690 
let's try increasing this number a bit
let's<00:07:22.460> raise<00:07:22.670> this<00:07:22.880> to<00:07:23.030> 0.1<00:07:23.510> and<00:07:24.430> already<00:07:25.430> by

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:25.700 
let's raise this to 0.1 and already by

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.050 
let's raise this to 0.1 and already by
changing<00:07:26.330> that<00:07:26.360> number<00:07:26.780> to<00:07:26.930> 0.1<00:07:27.880> my<00:07:28.880> eye<00:07:28.910> was

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.060 
changing that number to 0.1 my eye was

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.350 
changing that number to 0.1 my eye was
able<00:07:29.420> to<00:07:29.450> find<00:07:29.840> the<00:07:30.350> vertexes<00:07:31.000> that<00:07:32.000> we<00:07:32.120> wanted

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 
able to find the vertexes that we wanted

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.060 
able to find the vertexes that we wanted
to<00:07:32.450> merge<00:07:32.750> and<00:07:33.050> it<00:07:33.230> has<00:07:33.350> merged<00:07:33.650> them<00:07:33.919> all

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.070 
to merge and it has merged them all

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:40.240 
to merge and it has merged them all
together<00:07:35.620> we<00:07:36.620> go<00:07:36.800> to<00:07:36.860> object<00:07:37.310> mode<00:07:39.100> select<00:07:40.100> our

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.250 
together we go to object mode select our

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.670 
together we go to object mode select our
object<00:07:40.730> and<00:07:40.820> smooth<00:07:41.210> it<00:07:41.419> you<00:07:41.900> can<00:07:42.110> see<00:07:42.380> it's

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680 
object and smooth it you can see it's

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.230 
object and smooth it you can see it's
perfectly<00:07:42.919> smooth<00:07:43.490> and<00:07:44.740> all<00:07:45.740> these<00:07:46.520> vertexes

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 
perfectly smooth and all these vertexes

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.500 
perfectly smooth and all these vertexes
and<00:07:47.480> edges<00:07:47.810> are<00:07:47.960> all<00:07:48.110> merged<00:07:48.410> together<00:07:49.210> if<00:07:50.210> we

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:50.510 
and edges are all merged together if we

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.960 
and edges are all merged together if we
go<00:07:50.630> to<00:07:50.720> the<00:07:50.840> front<00:07:51.080> view<00:07:51.169> and<00:07:51.560> we<00:07:52.490> look<00:07:52.669> at<00:07:52.790> both

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:52.970 
go to the front view and we look at both

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.909 
go to the front view and we look at both
of<00:07:53.000> these<00:07:53.210> objects<00:07:53.810> in<00:07:53.960> wireframe<00:07:54.200> mode<00:07:54.710> you

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919 
of these objects in wireframe mode you

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:58.450 
of these objects in wireframe mode you
can<00:07:55.070> see<00:07:55.190> the<00:07:55.310> difference<00:07:55.700> between<00:07:57.460> combining

00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:58.460 
can see the difference between combining

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.760 
can see the difference between combining
which<00:07:59.120> we<00:07:59.300> still<00:07:59.510> have<00:07:59.720> our<00:07:59.750> sphere<00:08:00.320> and<00:08:00.530> our

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:00.770 
which we still have our sphere and our

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.000 
which we still have our sphere and our
cylinder<00:08:01.250> intact<00:08:01.669> and<00:08:01.970> merging<00:08:02.960> where<00:08:03.830> we

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.010 
cylinder intact and merging where we

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.760 
cylinder intact and merging where we
took<00:08:04.220> the<00:08:04.640> top<00:08:04.850> of<00:08:05.030> the<00:08:05.150> sphere<00:08:05.210> and<00:08:05.660> the

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:05.770 
took the top of the sphere and the

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.230 
took the top of the sphere and the
bottom<00:08:06.770> of<00:08:06.890> the<00:08:07.010> cylinder<00:08:07.220> and<00:08:07.669> merge<00:08:08.030> them

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 
bottom of the cylinder and merge them

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.979 
bottom of the cylinder and merge them
together<00:08:08.450> as<00:08:08.750> one<00:08:09.020> seamless<00:08:09.380> object
