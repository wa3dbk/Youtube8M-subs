00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
from your dormant sign wood so this is a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.610 
from your dormant sign wood so this is a
way<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.430> grafting<00:00:41.700> when<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.810> bark<00:00:43.020> cannot<00:00:43.440> be

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
way of grafting when the bark cannot be

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.650 
way of grafting when the bark cannot be
slipped<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.220> you're<00:00:44.550> still<00:00:44.820> able<00:00:44.970> to<00:00:45.180> graft<00:00:45.480> a

seedling root stock that has been piece

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.050 
seedling root stock that has been piece
rooted<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.150> grow<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> apple<00:00:52.800> tree<00:00:53.070> from<00:00:53.520> seed<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
rooted I grow a apple tree from seed and

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.540 
rooted I grow a apple tree from seed and
then<00:00:54.720> one<00:00:55.020> at<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.380> end<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.650> the<00:00:55.740> season<00:00:56.130> I<00:00:56.250> dig

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
then one at the end of the season I dig

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.670 
then one at the end of the season I dig
it<00:00:56.670> up<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.000> cut<00:00:57.390> pieces<00:00:57.810> of<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> roots<00:00:58.500> out

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
it up and cut pieces of the roots out

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.260 
it up and cut pieces of the roots out
and<00:00:58.860> then<00:00:58.950> plant<00:00:59.190> those<00:00:59.370> pieces<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> roots

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270

what<00:02:05.549> I'm<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.819> want<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.119> match<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:06.450> with

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
what I'm going to want to match up with

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.130 
what I'm going to want to match up with
my<00:02:06.990> chip<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.129> cut<00:02:08.340> from<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.640> sign<00:02:08.879> would

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
my chip that I cut from the sign would

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.660 
my chip that I cut from the sign would
so<00:02:10.140> kind<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.099> measuring<00:02:11.519> it<00:02:11.670> first<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.569> make<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
so kind of measuring it first I make the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.830 
so kind of measuring it first I make the
45-degree<00:02:14.670> downward<00:02:15.150> cut<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.819> getting<00:02:18.750> as

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
45-degree downward cut and getting as

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.930 
45-degree downward cut and getting as
close<00:02:19.019> as<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.379> can<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:19.950> same<00:02:20.280> size

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
close as I can to the same size

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:30.860 
close as I can to the same size
I<00:02:21.680> cut<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.709> chip<00:02:23.069> off<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:24.049> sign<00:02:25.049> would<00:02:29.690> this<00:02:30.690> is

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
I cut a chip off the sign would this is

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.449 
I cut a chip off the sign would this is
what<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.170> end<00:02:31.200> up<00:02:31.470> with

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.630 

and<00:02:37.939> I<00:02:38.030> see<00:02:38.269> how<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.599> fits<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:42.459> it<00:02:43.459> looks

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
and I see how that fits and it looks

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.280 
and I see how that fits and it looks
like<00:02:43.819> it's<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.090> little<00:02:44.359> longer<00:02:44.569> so<00:02:45.079> I'm<00:02:45.140> going

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
like it's a little longer so I'm going

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.869 
like it's a little longer so I'm going
to<00:02:45.319> make<00:02:45.439> the<00:02:45.590> pocket<00:02:45.799> longer<00:02:51.609> see<00:02:52.609> how<00:02:52.670> that

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
to make the pocket longer see how that

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.610 
to make the pocket longer see how that
fits

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
fits

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.150 
fits
that's<00:02:55.220> pretty<00:02:55.430> good<00:02:56.500> now<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.620> guys<00:02:57.800> that<00:02:58.010> do

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
that's pretty good now the guys that do

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.589 
that's pretty good now the guys that do
this<00:02:58.280> for<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.520> living<00:02:58.910> or<00:02:59.030> laughing<00:02:59.360> at<00:02:59.450> me

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
this for a living or laughing at me

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.839 
this for a living or laughing at me
right<00:02:59.630> now<00:02:59.870> because<00:03:00.380> they<00:03:01.250> do<00:03:01.310> one<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:01.730> these

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
right now because they do one of these

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.520 
right now because they do one of these
in<00:03:02.060> about<00:03:02.209> five<00:03:02.480> seconds<00:03:02.959> because<00:03:03.050> they<00:03:03.380> have

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
in about five seconds because they have

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.350 
in about five seconds because they have
thousands<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.130> thousands<00:03:04.610> on<00:03:04.730> them<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.209> do

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
thousands and thousands on them to do

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.540 
thousands and thousands on them to do
I'm<00:03:06.260> going<00:03:06.500> slow<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.980> be<00:03:07.069> able<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.310> show<00:03:07.489> you

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
I'm going slow to be able to show you

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.839 
I'm going slow to be able to show you
see<00:03:08.060> how<00:03:08.180> both<00:03:08.420> sides<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:08.930> line<00:03:09.170> up<00:03:09.349> with

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
see how both sides of it line up with

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.000 
see how both sides of it line up with

the bottom holds it in there pretty

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.690 
the bottom holds it in there pretty
securely<00:03:25.459> I'll<00:03:25.670> hold<00:03:25.849> it<00:03:25.970> by<00:03:26.150> itself<00:03:27.580> now<00:03:28.580> I'll

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
securely I'll hold it by itself now I'll

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.759 
securely I'll hold it by itself now I'll
take<00:03:29.230> our<00:03:30.230> pair<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.560> film<00:03:30.709> tape<00:03:32.500> which<00:03:33.500> does

not need to be cut as this starts

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.009 
not need to be cut as this starts
growing<00:03:37.519> but<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.269> could<00:03:38.420> use<00:03:38.569> some<00:03:38.840> other

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
growing but you could use some other

growing but you could use some other
tape<00:03:39.290> also<00:03:39.849> as<00:03:40.849> long<00:03:41.060> as<00:03:41.150> you<00:03:41.239> remember<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.690> go

tape also as long as you remember to go

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.180 
tape also as long as you remember to go
back<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.140> cut<00:03:42.319> it<00:03:42.410> once<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.739> bud<00:03:42.890> starts

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
back and cut it once the bud starts

growing I'm covering covering over the
butt<00:03:45.860> itself<00:03:46.250> because<00:03:46.580> it<00:03:46.730> will<00:03:46.910> bud<00:03:47.450> through

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
butt itself because it will bud through

season if it hasn't sprouted yet you'll

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.490 
season if it hasn't sprouted yet you'll
take<00:04:24.040> your<00:04:24.160> clippers<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:25.780> cut<00:04:26.020> off<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.320> root
