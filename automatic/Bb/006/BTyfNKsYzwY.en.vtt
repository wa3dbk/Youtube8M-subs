00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.600
 from that yucca paper with cheese the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.220
 story comes from my ancestor in my 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.590
 my grandparents were planting yucca and 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.270

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.810
 dragging or that I come dragging 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.820

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.500
 the girl looks really and I have a bush 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.180
 of yucca and I have a banana tree because 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.430
 wherever we go we sow 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.890

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.649
 and so 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.109
 and now and cassava in the field I have already 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:43.100
 eaten a lot of video from there and the yucca 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:46.130
 It is not yet since you learned to 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.899
 prepare that cake or the cake or not the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.000
 prepare for the first time at age 17 and 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.539
 I learned it to do in my house with my 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.800
 aunt because I lived for a while my aunt and 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:03.240
 she taught me 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.630
 and after I got married then because 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.330
 I with more pleasure towards the papelón wants 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.370
 say that you conquer the one you today 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.820
 wife if you win then there's a lot 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.770
 people fascinate them and when I hard a 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.260
 little time without doing it tells me mommy 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.920
 let's go on the nape of the neck and when 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.069
 we prepare together but the yucca 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.530
 and she puts it to boil that paper is 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:34.760
 so good because the cost it takes 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.920
 and besides that she knows how to prepare the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.069
 my son in smaller and he knows 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.330
 do the cheese pattern with yucca 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:47.000
 because he has not seen me working 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.310
 what I learned by seeing him in the kitchen 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.989
 I stayed with her the kitchen when 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.370
 I was already preparing it, I always 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.560
 I'm watching her to learn to 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.239
 do it the first time I did it 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.530
 it was a friend of mine what form to visit me 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.060
 so I say good guys 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.410
 we go to one as then to prepare a 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.780
 paper for you to see what I know 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.410
 do and give them to them because you 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.830
 you chose that cake or specifically 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:13.000
 to participate in the contest that 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.930
 papelón I chose it because a papelón 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.709
 original no no does not carry so much thing is a 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.900
 simple dish and I get melancholy 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.630
 when I do it that's why I chose it for 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.050
 take part 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.470
 because I remember in me 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.220
 my mother 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.160
 Y 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.170
 we did we sat at the table all 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.800
 there in the big patio and we all ate there 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:47.210
 when we met with mpm family 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.030
 they're my feelings 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.520
 when I prepare the paper because you 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.500
 do you think that cake where yucca with 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.630
 cheese can be the winner of the million 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.750
 weights there's a girl because I'm 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.690
 sure that it is the final touch 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.780
 is going to give the reality this role of 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.870
 heel that you look at it a motivation 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.480
 you know that the heart does not fail 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.840
 for me cooking is an art or a 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.920
 vocation because I learned it by vocation 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.890
 it was because I already bring the art that is the 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.550
 vocation of my ancestor then 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:30.000
 besides being an art, it is a vocation 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.180
 to prepare my cassava paper first 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.979
 hair two and a half pounds of yucca and 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.560
 I put to boil with salt 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.440
 then when they are soft prepare 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.159

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.400

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:50.879

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:08.430
 then lightning the half pound of cheese 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:11.819

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.500

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:26.650

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:31.449

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:35.020
