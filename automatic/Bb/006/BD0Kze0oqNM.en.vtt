mini-map as well as actually shooting

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.310 
mini-map as well as actually shooting
without<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.970> silencer<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.780> that's<00:01:13.049> definitely

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
without a silencer so that's definitely

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.740 
without a silencer so that's definitely
something<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:14.400> bear<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.700> mind<00:01:14.909> no<00:01:15.509> for<00:01:15.689> the

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
important perks in my opinion the first

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.729 
important perks in my opinion the first
one<00:03:06.420> being<00:03:06.569> light<00:03:06.810> weight<00:03:07.080> increases<00:03:07.620> your

one being light weight increases your
movement<00:03:08.010> speed<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.610> believe<00:03:09.060> by<00:03:09.360> twenty

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
movement speed I believe by twenty

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.809

percent<00:03:10.080> that's<00:03:10.650> how<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:10.950> usually<00:03:11.190> works<00:03:11.430> with

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
percent that's how it usually works with

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.910

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.199 
actually prevents you from being seen
from<00:03:26.970> enemy<00:03:27.359> UAVs<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.140> also<00:03:29.069> tracking<00:03:29.459> run<00:03:29.940> so

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
from enemy UAVs and also tracking run so

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.759 
from enemy UAVs and also tracking run so
that's<00:03:30.450> definitely<00:03:30.690> interested<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.530> looks

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
that's definitely interested it looks

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.349 
that's definitely interested it looks
like<00:03:32.010> we're<00:03:32.459> going<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.730> get<00:03:32.819> some<00:03:33.000> kind<00:03:33.269> of

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
like we're going to get some kind of

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.030 
like we're going to get some kind of
tracking<00:03:33.660> runs<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.319> they're<00:03:34.739> they're<00:03:34.890> going

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
tracking runs and they're they're going

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.370 
tracking runs and they're they're going
to<00:03:35.130> act<00:03:35.310> like<00:03:35.519> a<00:03:35.880> recon<00:03:36.480> from<00:03:36.720> previous<00:03:37.170> call

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
to act like a recon from previous call

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.650 
to act like a recon from previous call
of<00:03:37.560> duties<00:03:37.920> as<00:03:38.100> so<00:03:38.579> maybe<00:03:38.880> that's<00:03:39.269> going<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.569> be

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
of duties as so maybe that's going to be

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.470 
of duties as so maybe that's going to be
a<00:03:39.690> very<00:03:39.870> very<00:03:40.410> useful<00:03:40.769> perk<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.549> use<00:03:41.819> moving<00:03:42.389> on

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
a very very useful perk to use moving on

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.240 
a very very useful perk to use moving on
to<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.690> third<00:03:42.900> perk<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:43.440> going<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.709> be<00:03:43.799> danger

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
to the third perk is going to be danger

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.150 
to the third perk is going to be danger
cross<00:03:44.519> increases<00:03:45.359> your<00:03:45.510> explosive<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.410> score

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
cross increases your explosive and score

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.280 
cross increases your explosive and score
streak<00:03:47.519> damage<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:48.660> is<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.870> bit<00:03:49.079> different

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
streak damage so this is a bit different

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.780 
streak damage so this is a bit different
we've<00:03:49.620> never<00:03:49.829> really<00:03:50.069> seen<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.549> perk

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
we've never really seen this perk

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.150 
we've never really seen this perk
increased<00:03:51.359> scorestreak<00:03:51.930> damage<00:03:52.350> so<00:03:52.769> this<00:03:52.980> is

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
increased scorestreak damage so this is

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.470 
increased scorestreak damage so this is
definitely<00:03:53.430> going<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.880> be<00:03:53.940> interesting<00:03:54.450> to

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
definitely going to be interesting to

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.990 
definitely going to be interesting to
see<00:03:54.780> if<00:03:54.959> this<00:03:55.500> perk<00:03:55.799> is<00:03:56.010> going<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.370> be<00:03:56.489> balanced

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
see if this perk is going to be balanced

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.550 
see if this perk is going to be balanced
with<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:57.540> game<00:03:57.840> then<00:03:58.290> we<00:03:58.440> have

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
with in the game then we have

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.009 
with in the game then we have
overcharged<00:03:59.549> as<00:03:59.670> our<00:04:00.000> fourth<00:04:00.450> perk<00:04:00.720> within

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
overcharged as our fourth perk within

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.620 
overcharged as our fourth perk within
the<00:04:01.109> red<00:04:01.319> tier<00:04:01.560> which<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.340> create<00:04:02.819> extends

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
the red tier which in create extends

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.500 
the red tier which in create extends

shocks enemies on impact of a boost

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.240 
shocks enemies on impact of a boost
slump<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:09.959> that's<00:04:10.230> really<00:04:10.440> really<00:04:10.769> cool<00:04:10.889> of

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
going to be flat jackets which of course

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.270 
going to be flat jackets which of course
increases<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.870> kind<00:04:32.139> of<00:04:32.259> damage<00:04:32.590> from

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
increases the kind of damage from

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.369 
increases the kind of damage from
explosive<00:04:34.000> so<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.210> don't<00:04:34.509> actually<00:04:34.750> die<00:04:35.169> by

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:35.379

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
one simple grenade so that is going to

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.420 
one simple grenade so that is going to
prevent<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:37.930> from<00:04:37.960> dying<00:04:38.379> from<00:04:38.770> explosives

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
prevent you from dying from explosives

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.249 
prevent you from dying from explosives
and<00:04:39.580> of<00:04:39.969> course<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.330> really<00:04:40.780> really<00:04:40.960> useful

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
and of course a really really useful

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.649 
and of course a really really useful
perk<00:04:41.680> especially<00:04:42.610> looking<00:04:42.789> back<00:04:43.210> at<00:04:43.419> the

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:43.659 
perk especially looking back at the

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:45.480 
perk especially looking back at the
reveal<00:04:43.930> trailer<00:04:44.319> there<00:04:44.830> was<00:04:44.949> definitely<00:04:45.400> a

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
reveal trailer there was definitely a

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.969 
reveal trailer there was definitely a
lot<00:04:45.699> of<00:04:45.849> explosives<00:04:46.659> and<00:04:46.840> stuff<00:04:47.020> like<00:04:47.199> that<00:04:47.259> so

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
lot of explosives and stuff like that so

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.830 
lot of explosives and stuff like that so
maybe<00:04:48.250> this<00:04:48.580> is<00:04:48.789> going<00:04:48.969> to<00:04:49.030> be<00:04:49.120> one<00:04:49.360> of<00:04:49.509> the<00:04:49.629> key

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
maybe this is going to be one of the key

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.929 
maybe this is going to be one of the key
