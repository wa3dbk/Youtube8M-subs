out<00:03:53.939> what<00:03:54.090> they<00:03:54.239> do<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.659> already<00:03:55.439> mentioned<00:03:55.709> the

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
out what they do I already mentioned the

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.409 
out what they do I already mentioned the
victory<00:03:56.069> points<00:03:56.400> on<00:03:56.519> buildings<00:03:56.909> and<00:03:57.060> some

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
victory points on buildings and some

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.360 
victory points on buildings and some
buildings<00:03:57.840> are<00:03:58.049> gonna<00:03:58.230> be<00:03:58.319> worth<00:03:58.439> no<00:03:59.010> victory

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
buildings are gonna be worth no victory

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.589 
buildings are gonna be worth no victory
points<00:03:59.669> but<00:03:59.790> that's<00:03:59.909> because<00:04:00.209> they're<00:04:00.389> more

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
points but that's because they're more

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.780 
points but that's because they're more
useful<00:04:00.870> there's<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:01.889> cost<00:04:02.159> of<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> building<00:04:02.639> so

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
useful there's a cost of the building so

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.759 
useful there's a cost of the building so
for<00:04:03.150> example<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.599> build<00:04:03.689> a<00:04:03.840> steel<00:04:04.049> mill<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.500> need

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
for example to build a steel mill I need

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.449 
for example to build a steel mill I need
two<00:04:04.980> wood<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:06.359> gold<00:04:06.689> coin<00:04:07.129> which<00:04:08.129> I<00:04:08.400> don't

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
two wood and a gold coin which I don't

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.920 
two wood and a gold coin which I don't
have<00:04:08.730> at<00:04:08.849> this<00:04:08.939> point<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.299> time<00:04:09.450> but<00:04:09.629> let's<00:04:09.810> say

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
have at this point in time but let's say

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.440 
have at this point in time but let's say
I<00:04:09.959> did<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.169> could<00:04:10.409> then<00:04:10.530> build<00:04:10.829> it<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.280> then<00:04:12.030> at

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
I did I could then build it and then at

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.000 
I did I could then build it and then at

simply<00:04:34.560> gives<00:04:34.740> me<00:04:34.860> an<00:04:34.949> iron<00:04:35.159> but<00:04:35.940> this<00:04:36.120> one's

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
simply gives me an iron but this one's

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.000 
simply gives me an iron but this one's
much<00:04:36.449> more<00:04:36.510> expensive<00:04:37.260> so<00:04:37.530> which<00:04:37.680> one<00:04:37.860> do<00:04:37.979> I

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
much more expensive so which one do I

down here I can put get a worker to

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.409 
down here I can put get a worker to

apple no matter what and there's
different<00:04:49.020> buildings<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:49.680> so<00:04:49.800> for<00:04:49.979> a<00:04:50.039> while

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
different buildings and so for a while

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.890 
different buildings and so for a while
you're<00:04:50.759> gonna<00:04:50.880> go<00:04:51.060> around<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.479> look<00:04:51.659> at<00:04:51.780> all

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
you're gonna go around and look at all

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.850 
you're gonna go around and look at all
the<00:04:52.020> different<00:04:52.320> buildings<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.770> are

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
the different buildings that are

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.490 
the different buildings that are
available<00:04:53.099> and<00:04:53.970> as<00:04:54.120> time<00:04:54.389> goes<00:04:54.419> by<00:04:54.659> these

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
available and as time goes by these

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.379 
available and as time goes by these
buildings<00:04:55.919> will<00:04:56.130> get<00:04:56.340> better<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:56.759> better<00:04:56.909> in

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
buildings will get better and better in

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.990 
buildings will get better and better in
fact<00:04:57.630> near<00:04:58.199> the<00:04:58.380> end<00:04:58.530> of<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.710> game<00:04:58.889> let's<00:04:59.610> show

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
fact near the end of the game let's show

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.600 
fact near the end of the game let's show
you<00:05:00.090> one<00:05:00.210> here<00:05:00.240> for<00:05:00.479> example<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:02.340> church

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
you one here for example the the church

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.640 
you one here for example the the church
you<00:05:03.150> can<00:05:03.270> see<00:05:03.419> that<00:05:03.539> their<00:05:03.659> victory<00:05:04.020> points<00:05:04.409> go

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
you can see that their victory points go

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.950 
you can see that their victory points go
up<00:05:04.680> substantially<00:05:05.009> and<00:05:05.789> this<00:05:06.539> one<00:05:06.690> here<00:05:06.810> gives

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
up substantially and this one here gives

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.890 
up substantially and this one here gives
you<00:05:07.080> two<00:05:07.259> victory<00:05:07.889> points<00:05:07.919> as<00:05:08.280> income<00:05:08.940> of

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
you two victory points as income of

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.540 
you two victory points as income of

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
resources that they bring you and you

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.920 
resources that they bring you and you
