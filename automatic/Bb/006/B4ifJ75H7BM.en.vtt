00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.150
 from my experience I realized that what 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.250
 more important is to cover all 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.750
 disciplines and that's a bit what you 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.820
 is trying to transmit inside the 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.480
 curriculum also a musician 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.599
 of the future must be able to 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.640
 play solo as an orchestra can 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.989
 make good chamber music and be a 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.620
 good camera musician a person 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.899
 sensitive and receptive being able to be a good 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.430
 pedagogue that means to know 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.969
 transmit with words what you do 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.969
 with instruments 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.760
 do not 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.610
 the curriculum is designed from 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.710
 way that the one addressed to the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.850
 interpreters an instrumentalist to a 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.320
 Young lad when he starts doing 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.000
 music wants to play the instrument 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.769
 I want to be I want to be an interpreter musician 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.110
 therefore you need time to 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.509
 study needs all your time all 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.460
 the subjects addressed so that 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.509
 Form correctly and can be able to 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.509
 an excellence cell 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.530
 what we have tried from the faculty 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.390
 of music and the arts in the UAX is 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.920
 to bring to different profiles of 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.740
 teachers so that people can 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.659
 choose what you want with whom 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.970
 wants to study equipment by configuring 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.619
 different teams of great pedagogues 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.140
 mixed with great performers 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.810
 international so they can so that 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.310
 can make a binomial and can be created 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.320
 let's say a complete training that 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.540
 encompass all the disciplines 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.790
 and all the necessary information for 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.110
 build 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.110
 a musician of tomorrow 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.560
 Y 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:32.080
 in the intellect 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.040
 I live from my tube practice and to be 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.250
 meet and concentrate 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.950
 there is a differentiation 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.070
 respect to the other races here there 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.500
 a ratio 11 that changes everything we have 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.030
 very clear that the student 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.040
 will learn a lot faster 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.990
 the closer you are to the professional 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.520
 then the fact of combining the groups 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.960
 of camera with teachers doing 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.560
 mixed concerts students with 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.390
 teachers 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.490
 Orchestra concerts with teachers 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.560
 and solo students sharing lectern 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.090
 that's a unique amazing experience 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.130
 for them what is it that is going to 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.360
 approach very much to the reality of 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.360
 professional world as soon as possible 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:20.550
 we have been able to join a team 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.410
 professional human of people who is 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.780
 wonderful that is wonderful to be able to 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.240
 work door to door with someone 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.740
 that you want and admire and respect and 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.620
 that is something fundamental to be believed 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.620
 a motor a dynamic and an energy that 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.380
 transmit that to everyone on 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.130
 enthusiasm for purpose to build and 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.130
 for creating something nice
