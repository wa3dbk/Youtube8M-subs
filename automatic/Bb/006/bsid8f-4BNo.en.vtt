00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.179
 or that of people like first good 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.500
 days or whatever over there like I said in 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.259
 the description for those who read the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.109
 description I do not remember if I warned in 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.910
 the videos that I was going to put the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.450
 minecraft for linux preferably 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.600
 canaima 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.360
 this 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.800
 I did not say today but it was going to be what 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.860
 better dated then then first it 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.410
 goes 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.930
 the link to leave in the description that 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.240
 it would be this is on this page 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:42.600
 download the file to download 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.539
 you have to be registered 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.140
 they record something simple so much does not arrive 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.450
 just mail the name and have 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.760
 already 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.280
 they are registered and can download them 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.360
 because then when they already have 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.750
 are registered 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.120
 maybe in download them make them regular 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.040
 They waited 5 seconds 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.960
 and this will come out 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.060
 and they simply write this here 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.840
 download ok 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.030
 the good download I do not download it for 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.060
 what 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.950
 it lasts 64 minutes because we're going to do it 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.049
 a being has all the versions up 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.180
 which will come out is upgradeable 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.820
 all pirated and premium versions 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.180
 you can of the two premium forms and 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.580
 pirate or not premium 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.970
 theoretical pirate because good 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.580
 I close here since I handle that and I 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.730
 leave 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.270
 this file they say extract here and you 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.750
 this folder will come out 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.570
 they open it for canaima I do not know if for others 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.420
 linux will come out we have verified that 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.770
 maybe in control h you control the button 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.190
 that is down on the buttons below to 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.050
 the left 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.810
 in which are the little tips you take them 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.250
 control y and the output is another 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.910
 folder that will be autonomic folder 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.890
 hidden carme defense 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.460
 well first they put not me not me not what 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.310
 I'm going to do ok because I already have it here 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:27.090
 but they would have to put this first 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.790
 here I 'm not going to do it because 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.160
 it's there and I'm not going to do it because 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.130
 is there 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.400
 and other things do not put in this 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:42.300
 folder on the desk here because 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.990
 it will be rotated for the cameras 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:50.100
 what they should do 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:53.000
 and to minimize here open the folder 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.000
 of canaima 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.520
 and will put in control has done again 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.010
 this would be like in windows put by 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.340
 percent pp data percent only that 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.680

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.980

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.770
 who put it on the desk 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.560
 I will have it 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.930
 is the start to open the launcher and 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.880
 Now I'm going to explain how to use the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.720
 first so 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.620
 wait for the entire launcher to open 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.920
 right now as it is recording is going 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.380
 earning a lot ok 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.760
 this was opening all end of 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:24.750
 open the launch was already open is 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:27.960
 good only here will they be able to 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.070
 say have at hand you could say 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.680
 three versions 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.680
 you here step edit 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.770
 6.2 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:48.480
 then on behalf of the profile you 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.480
 you can change you want 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.080
 and this simply for 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.080
 that is to say 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:02.140
 there is forgiveness here also here 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:05.380
 choose the version you want from 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:09.580
 the 1.0 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.890
 I knew I was up to the newest 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.740
 that was 1.7 methods they put it using the 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.310
 latest version available also serves 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.689
 I prefer to tread here and tread save 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.790
 profile 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:26.070
 after that you will appear here 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.740
 name then in the name and password 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.350
 but with a sign do not agree with the name 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.380
 my name is would be penalties and then they step 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.290
 where where would I go to play then is 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.850
 would charge something here they should wait for 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.010
 that is charged would have to have internet 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.430
 because that is something that is 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.610
 downloading 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.420
 then opens the main craft so do not have 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.940
 that watch games play offline and if you already 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.320
 the game is opening that serves to 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.600
 any version some with the version 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.400
 Here I already explained how to update it and 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.870
 how and how as not ok already on the manga 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.840
 perfect everything fine 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.920
 they step on playing here and now the 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.139
 worlds 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.919
 this data and the servers 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:17.409
 options and they would already have the minecraft 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.969
 ok so if there is a problem with this 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:22.749
 minecraft is that you can not change the 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:24.969
 skin but let's go I'm going to put 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:27.310
 any version for linux is not 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:30.689
 finds in almost those paradigms up 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.689
 here leave the video and chau chau
