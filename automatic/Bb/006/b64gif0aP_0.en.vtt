00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.250
 He opens the scene with the best buddy 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.330
 on a boat slashed river and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.300
 The sea is drifting and there is a dive 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.530
 human corpse and that shines 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.340
 but very fast as a zombie too 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.229
 yield 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.210
 to show and then with a 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.740
 harpoon killed but does not do so 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.050
 thoughts right as if the in 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.360
 the second day was come as itself 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.979
 then suddenly in cuba a lot 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.900
 Introduce zombies you know that way 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.640
 right where they come from confused that 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.680
 Horn with his buddies just as 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.300
 dissidents infiltrated by the usa 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.280
 who always behave like that 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.570
 to bring capitalism to cuba with it 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.170
 Gets this zombie coming 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.550
 a wonderfully political ironic 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.440
 mesh still with the really impressed 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.090
 funny is in one moment or another 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.710
 and while everyone is actually fleeing 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.750
 want and also the best buddies of 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.399
 But Juan is forming a march of marriage 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.229
 has decided that one from it too 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.539
 could make the business namely the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.250
 troop of the dead we kill yours 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.539
 dearest and with that you can enter 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.069
 earn little money and thus 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.410
 the film deals with this 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.600
 group of men he his best buddy 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.039
 a masculine anabolic steroids type of but 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.420
 No blood can be seen all the time 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.789
 must fight blindly and something 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.500
 He asexual people who more like 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.119
 a little easy by the zombie 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.020
 landscape beat that on brute 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.240
 witty and sometimes quite yet 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.600
 hard way because of that the fsk 16 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.660
 here 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.220
 and yes those are the 280 minutes of film and 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.670
 they are not so funny 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.290
 you say 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.360
 just because of course you say ok 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.880
 cuban zombie movie is that now 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.620
 somehow that tom he figured, of course 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.330
 I do not have to say that quite positively 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.220
 Surprised is not a hammer movie but 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.980
 a refreshing change and also 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.450
 the gameplay is so nice 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.280
 un-American that it is quite funny 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.810
 look at that 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.370
 but exactly once two times 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.950
 I have to see where all of the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.840
 date is a film for which I am absolute 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.069
 barely had attention because you hardly 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.959
 what you have heard this movie but 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.160
 just for genre fans maybe one 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.440
 right grip and I can say that 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.690
 have a huge raffle on the weekend 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.040
 with eleven examples of 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.390
 this movie or tenth ten or eleven 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.650
 Examples of this film 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.000
 that is why you can also until the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.130
 wait for the weekend and blu rays and dvds 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.160
 descend and get from me now 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.209
 this movie because he really only the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.130
 Constantly a bit of comedy 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.260
 a bit sexy women a bit 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.209
 politically incorrect and a few 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.790
 So bring together zombies and all that 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.350
 okay, it's still okay 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.380
 six and a half out of ten possible points 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.150
 as a zombie comedy altogether a movie na 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.620
 yes that's okay not the hammer 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.450
 you do not have to see one can see 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.980
 five and a half out of 10 possible points 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.600
 if the band has never heard film 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.860
 what I am with many of you 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.900

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.380
 over here what else from me 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.150

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.950
 if you found my review really good 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.739
 thinks of the thumb again and again 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.940
