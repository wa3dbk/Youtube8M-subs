my<00:00:47.670> face<00:00:47.879> now<00:00:48.149> remember<00:00:48.750> we're<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.140> doing

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
my face now remember we're just doing

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.010 
my face now remember we're just doing
the<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.640> right<00:00:50.879> side<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.719> see<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the the right side so you can see the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.709 
the the right side so you can see the
difference<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.829> then<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.000> turn<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.480> one

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
difference and then I just turn in one

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.260 
difference and then I just turn in one
and<00:00:55.850> then<00:00:56.850> let<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.090> work<00:00:57.629> into<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.289> skin<00:00:59.270> so

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
and then let it work into your skin so

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.450 
and then let it work into your skin so
it<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.600> get<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.620> dead<00:01:01.800> skin<00:01:01.829> cells

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it can get all of the dead skin cells

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.260 
it can get all of the dead skin cells
loosened<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.149> off<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> screen

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.560 

that's<00:01:07.899> pretty<00:01:08.049> good

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.840 

you<00:01:14.110> close<00:01:14.440> your<00:01:14.620> eyes<00:01:14.680> when<00:01:14.800> you<00:01:15.100> did<00:01:15.280> close

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
let it soak in the next step and the

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.210 
let it soak in the next step and the
last<00:03:00.130> step<00:03:00.580> this<00:03:01.270> is<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.890> regeneration<00:03:02.890> type

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
last step this is the regeneration type

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.240
