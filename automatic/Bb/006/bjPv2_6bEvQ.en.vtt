00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.880
 hello friends i am nancy rodrÃ­guez 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.740
 champion in mexico 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.860
 today we are going to show you a routine that 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.590
 may include the day of your leg 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.660
 hello I am vanesa garcÃ­a and I am a competitor 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.760
 of the bikini category my 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.760
 preparers are waldo garcÃ­a and we 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.100
 let's work the press is a 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.970
 exercise that helps us to work the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.620
 quadriceps and gluteus 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.210
 we hope that in taking care that the knees 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.210
 in the same entity as our points 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.560
 we can make variants accommodating the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.570
 feet in different ways 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.440
 and here it is worth doing as time 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.810
 frog 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.810
 it's important you do not have to extend the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.960
 knees to avoid injuries in the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.960
 joints 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.970
 We are going to make 4 series of 15 to 20 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.970
 repetitions 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.800
 next exercise free squat 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.290
 this exercise will help us 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.370
 work more quadriceps and above all 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.890
 the glute 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.500
 We will perform the same 4 series until the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.110
 I miss the repetitions that we can most 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.600
 it is important to open your feet to the height 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.780
 of the shoulders and lower the most right 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.420
 that we can 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.850
 When they need assistance, know how 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.119
 take them to be able to help them take 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.650
 of the shoulder part and we're going to do 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.650
 the exercise together with them 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.480
 this is only in case it stays below 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.480
 can help her climb 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.069
 right away let's start compliÃ³ 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.980
 metric in squat this is for 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:23.470
 work more muscle fibers and so 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.470
 give a better revolution to the muscle 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.290
 we will do a round 10 steps one way and 10 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.290
 back 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.910
 next lying femoral exercise 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.430
 this is going to help us to give it a better 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.420
 shape our leg to 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.500
 that the moral muscle grows and this 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.500
 will give us a better symmetry 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.100
 we will do 4 series of 12 to 15 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.100
 repetitions 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.640
 finally we will make with tractor 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.310
 glute in this way we will give you a 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.200
 greater roundness to our gluteus 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.480
 it is important to take care that the 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.580
 roller and perform the movement 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.580
 positive and negative at the same speed 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.560
 We will do 4 sets of 15 to 20 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.560
 repetitions 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.300
 best
