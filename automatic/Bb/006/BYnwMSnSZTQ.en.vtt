it's<00:02:05.850> basically<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.509> pig<00:02:06.990> 10<00:02:07.320> perc<00:02:07.770> system<00:02:08.340> so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
it's basically a pig 10 perc system so

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.320 
it's basically a pig 10 perc system so
now<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.800> pick<00:02:11.039> two<00:02:11.340> things<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.910> put<00:02:12.300> them

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
now you can pick two things and put them

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.650 
now you can pick two things and put them
on<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.140> perk

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
on to a perk

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.390 
on to a perk
from<00:02:15.660> like<00:02:15.930> other<00:02:16.230> games<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.070> know<00:02:17.280> like

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
from like other games and you know like

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.620 
from like other games and you know like
other<00:02:17.550> call<00:02:17.790> duties<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:19.340> but<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:21.120> will<00:02:21.480> not

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
other call duties and but you will not

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.110 
other call duties and but you will not
reach<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.900> pro<00:02:22.380> version<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:22.980> perk<00:02:23.370> until

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
reach the pro version of that perk until

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.940 
reach the pro version of that perk until
you<00:02:24.300> earn<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.780> whatever<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.560> combination

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
you earn it whatever that combination

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.310 
you earn it whatever that combination
maybe<00:02:26.580> now<00:02:27.210> I<00:02:27.240> thought<00:02:27.510> about<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:27.870> wow

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
maybe now I thought about that like wow

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.740 
maybe now I thought about that like wow
that's<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.830> great<00:02:29.100> idea<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:30.240> mean<00:02:30.630> that's

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
that's a great idea I mean that's

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.470 
that's a great idea I mean that's
something<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.380> Activision<00:02:32.250> would<00:02:32.760> do<00:02:33.000> they

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
something that Activision would do they

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.090 
something that Activision would do they
would<00:02:33.510> do<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.900> pick<00:02:34.080> 10<00:02:34.290> system<00:02:34.710> with<00:02:34.860> black

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
would do the pick 10 system with black

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.120 
would do the pick 10 system with black
ops<00:02:35.340> 2<00:02:35.580> with<00:02:36.270> with<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:37.040> attachments<00:02:38.040> and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
ops 2 with with the attachments and

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.700 
ops 2 with with the attachments and
everything<00:02:38.460> but<00:02:39.030> then<00:02:39.300> Infinity<00:02:39.990> Ward<00:02:40.230> we<00:02:40.590> do

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
everything but then Infinity Ward we do

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.410 
everything but then Infinity Ward we do
the<00:02:40.830> flip<00:02:41.040> side<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.400> do<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.000> pic<00:02:42.180> tense

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
the flip side of that do the pic tense

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.990 
the flip side of that do the pic tense
system<00:02:43.260> with<00:02:43.410> all<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.770> perks<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.850> know

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
system with all the perks you know

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.970 
system with all the perks you know
basically<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.660> same<00:02:45.840> style<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.830> can

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
basically the same style you you can

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.800 
basically the same style you you can
combo<00:02:47.400> up<00:02:47.520> certain<00:02:47.790> one<00:02:48.030> certain<00:02:48.420> ones<00:02:48.600> will

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
combo up certain one certain ones will

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.040 
combo up certain one certain ones will
not<00:02:48.840> go<00:02:49.140> together<00:02:49.290> obviously<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.840> maybe<00:02:51.840> this

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
not go together obviously and maybe this

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.750 
not go together obviously and maybe this
is<00:02:52.170> what<00:02:52.380> we're<00:02:52.530> looking<00:02:52.830> at<00:02:52.950> now<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.550> came

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
is what we're looking at now that came

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.150 
is what we're looking at now that came
to<00:02:53.880> me<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.120> like<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.600> know<00:02:54.720> what<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.620> idea<00:02:55.890> is

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
to me is like you know what that idea is

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.460 
to me is like you know what that idea is
too<00:02:56.490> awesome<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:57.540> probably<00:02:57.840> won't<00:02:58.140> see<00:02:58.320> that

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
too awesome you probably won't see that

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.220 
too awesome you probably won't see that
an<00:02:58.620> infinity<00:02:59.070> ward<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.550> just<00:03:00.150> gave<00:03:00.390> them<00:03:00.690> their

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
an infinity ward I just gave them their

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.770 
an infinity ward I just gave them their
next<00:03:01.650> engine<00:03:02.459> for<00:03:03.030> their<00:03:03.150> next<00:03:03.300> call<00:03:03.630> duty

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
next engine for their next call duty

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.110 
next engine for their next call duty
maybe<00:03:04.050> black<00:03:04.290> ops<00:03:04.530> 3<00:03:04.800> considered<00:03:05.700> picked<00:03:05.910> a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
maybe black ops 3 considered picked a

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.030 
maybe black ops 3 considered picked a
we're<00:03:06.390> gonna<00:03:06.480> do<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.810> big<00:03:07.020> 10<00:03:07.290> perc<00:03:07.560> system

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
we're gonna do the big 10 perc system

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.420 
we're gonna do the big 10 perc system
and<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.660> what<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:09.990> should<00:03:10.020> be<00:03:10.380> but<00:03:10.860> it's

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
and this is what it should be but it's

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.550 
and this is what it should be but it's
not<00:03:11.550> what<00:03:12.540> I'm<00:03:12.690> looking<00:03:12.990> at<00:03:13.110> right<00:03:13.170> here<00:03:13.350> is

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
not what I'm looking at right here is

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.340 
not what I'm looking at right here is
basically<00:03:14.060> taking<00:03:15.060> all<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.930> perks<00:03:16.200> from

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
basically taking all of the perks from

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.560 
basically taking all of the perks from
like<00:03:16.560> call<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:16.950> duty<00:03:17.250> 4<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.790> modern<00:03:18.090> warfare<00:03:18.239> 2

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
like call of duty 4 and modern warfare 2

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.870 
like call of duty 4 and modern warfare 2
and<00:03:18.840> mixing<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.650> together<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.459> then<00:03:20.519> coming

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
and mixing it together and then coming

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.759 
and mixing it together and then coming
up<00:03:21.090> with<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.239> couple<00:03:21.420> new<00:03:21.660> ones<00:03:21.769> scavenger

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
up with a couple new ones scavenger

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.990 
up with a couple new ones scavenger
obviously<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.910> not<00:03:24.120> new<00:03:24.360> um<00:03:24.800> this<00:03:25.800> flak<00:03:26.610> jacket

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
obviously is not new um this flak jacket

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.520 
obviously is not new um this flak jacket
with<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> grenade<00:03:27.269> in<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.660> shield<00:03:27.989> we

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
with a grenade in the shield we

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.050 
with a grenade in the shield we
obviously<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:29.459> only<00:03:29.610> thing<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.850> pretty

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
obviously the only thing is pretty

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.759 
obviously the only thing is pretty
puzzling<00:03:30.420> is<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.260> does<00:03:31.440> look<00:03:31.470> like<00:03:31.650> a

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
puzzling is that that does look like a

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.759 
puzzling is that that does look like a
grenade<00:03:31.950> launcher<00:03:32.959> but<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.290> could<00:03:34.590> be<00:03:34.739> a

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
grenade launcher but it could be a

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.400 
grenade launcher but it could be a
rocket<00:03:35.040> for<00:03:35.790> instance<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.660> may<00:03:36.900> not<00:03:37.080> be<00:03:37.320> able

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
rocket for instance you may not be able

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.290 
rocket for instance you may not be able
to<00:03:37.590> use<00:03:37.860> rockets<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.610> need<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.820> perk<00:03:39.090> to

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
to use rockets and you need to perk to

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.380 
to use rockets and you need to perk to
use<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.750> rocket<00:03:40.320> in<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.950> game<00:03:41.160> or<00:03:41.430> it's<00:03:42.150> like

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
use a rocket in the game or it's like

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.990 
use a rocket in the game or it's like
called<00:03:42.660> 84<00:03:43.170> where<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.980> have<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.580> instead<00:03:44.910> of

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
called 84 where you have to instead of

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.960 
called 84 where you have to instead of
that<00:03:45.209> instead<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:45.959> having<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.970> grenade

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
that instead of having a grenade

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.380 
that instead of having a grenade
launcher<00:03:48.390> as<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:49.010> attachment<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.190> is<00:03:50.760> instead<00:03:51.150> a

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
launcher as a attachment it is instead a

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.380 
launcher as a attachment it is instead a
perp<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.920> that's<00:03:53.550> what<00:03:53.700> I'm<00:03:53.790> thinking<00:03:53.820> and

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
perp so that's what I'm thinking and

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.110 
perp so that's what I'm thinking and
then<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.959> commando<00:03:55.440> guy<00:03:55.880> with<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:56.970> knife

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
then the commando guy with the knife

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.940 
then the commando guy with the knife
underneath<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:58.380> know<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.769> all
