smelter that's a new one so if we put

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.839 
smelter that's a new one so if we put
some<00:00:27.930> wood<00:00:28.140> there<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:29.220> going<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.429> smell<00:00:29.519> that

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
it's going to drain some power from the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.709 
it's going to drain some power from the
current<00:00:32.430> engine<00:00:32.610> which<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.300> create<00:00:33.450> event

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
current engine which is you create event

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.380 
current engine which is you create event
in<00:00:33.809> distances<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.790> use<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.059> to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
in distances and going to use that to

smelt the it would nice here here's the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.670 
smelt the it would nice here here's the
advanced<00:00:42.270> smelter<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.079> advanced<00:00:43.350> Croft

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
advanced smelter and the advanced Croft

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.950 
advanced smelter and the advanced Croft
there<00:00:44.030> here<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.120> go<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.510> two<00:00:45.780> new

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
there here we go we have two new

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.209 
there here we go we have two new
features<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.620> both<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.719> instance

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
features that both have so for instance

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
features that both have so for instance
this<00:00:50.219> part<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.670> I've<00:00:50.879> set<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.300> Indian

going to move whatever is being smelted
to<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> onion<00:00:57.840> part<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.160> same<00:00:59.309> thing

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
see it's it's a to infinite mode that

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.640 
see it's it's a to infinite mode that
means<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:15.900> going<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.110> smell<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.470> much

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
means that it's going to smell as much

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.320 
means that it's going to smell as much
as<00:01:16.830> possible<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.000> click<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.210> again

as possible but we can click it again
and<00:01:18.630> now<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:19.500> come<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> another<00:01:19.950> mode<00:01:20.400> which<00:01:21.060> is

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
and now we come to another mode which is

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.200 
and now we come to another mode which is
the<00:01:21.270> limit<00:01:21.509> limit<00:01:22.110> stock<00:01:22.380> items<00:01:22.770> mode<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
basically we have 88 so that means we

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.620 
basically we have 88 so that means we
want<00:01:26.340> eight<00:01:26.520> items<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.330> eight

want eight items if we have I eight
items<00:01:27.840> already<00:01:28.200> then<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.890> don't<00:01:29.009> need<00:01:29.130> any

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
items already then we don't need any

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.359 
items already then we don't need any

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
that means that we won't crop anything

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.690 
that means that we won't crop anything
at<00:01:36.900> all<00:01:37.020> no<00:01:37.290> matter<00:01:37.470> what<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.369> then<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> can

infinitive mode again so that's that
these<00:01:42.930> same<00:01:43.140> thing<00:01:43.439> goes<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.920> crafter

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
these same thing goes with the crafter

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.249 
these same thing goes with the crafter
and<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.360> multiple<00:01:45.659> smelters<00:01:46.229> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and you can have multiple smelters and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.870 
and you can have multiple smelters and
crosses<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> same<00:01:47.100> card<00:01:47.369> even<00:01:47.729> though<00:01:47.850> I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
crosses in the same card even though I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.630 
crosses in the same card even though I
you<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.479> one<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:49.079> each<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.829> halo

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
you just have one of each in this halo

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.710 
you just have one of each in this halo
next<00:01:51.390> card<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:52.939> here<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
next card here here we have the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.770 
next card here here we have the
information<00:01:55.320> provider<00:01:56.009> which<00:01:56.909> basically<00:01:57.390> has

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
information provider which basically has

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.200 
information provider which basically has
a<00:01:57.810> few<00:01:58.290> different<00:01:58.770> labels<00:01:59.490> here<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.000> click

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
a few different labels here so we click

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850 
a few different labels here so we click
on<00:02:00.299> name<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.869> all<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.320> sudden<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.590> will<00:02:01.710> see

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
on name and all the sudden we will see

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.920 
on name and all the sudden we will see
its<00:02:01.979> name<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.340> top<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:03.450> as<00:02:03.600> modular

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
its name on top of it it's as modular

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.870 
its name on top of it it's as modular
card<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.469> if<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:04.979> named<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> an

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
card but if we have named it in the an

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.359 
card but if we have named it in the an
anvil<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.540> will<00:02:06.750> say<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.740> will<00:02:07.920> tell<00:02:08.099> us<00:02:08.129> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
anvil it will say it will tell us that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.760 
anvil it will say it will tell us that
nap<00:02:08.610> name<00:02:08.940> instead<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:10.229> that's<00:02:10.440> pretty<00:02:10.679> cool

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
nap name instead so that's pretty cool

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.020 
nap name instead so that's pretty cool
if<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.160> want<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> name<00:02:11.520> your<00:02:11.610> card<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.910> can

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
if you want to name your card you can

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.850 
if you want to name your card you can
see<00:02:12.120> what<00:02:12.239> they<00:02:12.390> are<00:02:12.420> called<00:02:12.720> right

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
see what they are called right

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.380 
see what they are called right
then<00:02:14.070> we<00:02:14.130> can<00:02:14.310> shake<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.790> distance<00:02:15.180> from<00:02:15.300> the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
then we can shake the distance from the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.600 
then we can shake the distance from the
player<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.990> current<00:02:16.260> player<00:02:16.440> like<00:02:17.160> like<00:02:17.340> five

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
player the current player like like five

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.180 
player the current player like like five
meters<00:02:17.970> three<00:02:18.390> four<00:02:18.780> five<00:02:19.050> yeah<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.680> then<00:02:20.130> we

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
meters three four five yeah and then we

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.970 
meters three four five yeah and then we
can<00:02:20.310> say<00:02:20.430> strict<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.910> position<00:02:21.420> which<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.500> yeah

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
can say strict a position which is yeah

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.770 
can say strict a position which is yeah
its<00:02:23.160> coordinates<00:02:23.580> we're<00:02:24.120> going<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.390> check<00:02:24.600> the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
its coordinates we're going to check the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.810 
its coordinates we're going to check the
fuel<00:02:25.020> level<00:02:25.140> which<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.650> basically<00:02:26.160> how<00:02:26.610> long

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
fuel level which is basically how long

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.730 
fuel level which is basically how long
it<00:02:27.060> will<00:02:27.270> last<00:02:27.330> with<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.930> current<00:02:28.140> fuel<00:02:28.440> f

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
it will last with the current fuel f

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.460 
it will last with the current fuel f
nothing<00:02:29.070> changes<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.510> can<00:02:30.630> all<00:02:30.750> see<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.350> can

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
nothing changes it we can all see it can

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.680 
nothing changes it we can all see it can
last<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.770> one<00:02:31.920> hour<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.250> 20<00:02:32.670> minutes<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.150> a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
last for one hour and 20 minutes and a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.560 
last for one hour and 20 minutes and a
few<00:02:33.840> seconds<00:02:34.440> yes<00:02:35.280> because<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.730> has<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.180> call

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
few seconds yes because it has a call

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.720 
few seconds yes because it has a call
Cole<00:02:37.020> here<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:38.040> doesn't<00:02:38.460> have<00:02:38.520> anything

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
Cole here and it doesn't have anything

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.670 
Cole here and it doesn't have anything
that<00:02:38.940> drains<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.270> lot<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.510> fuel<00:02:39.840> then<00:02:40.500> we<00:02:40.560> can

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
that drains a lot of fuel then we can

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.400 
that drains a lot of fuel then we can
have<00:02:40.740> also<00:02:41.190> used<00:02:41.400> storage<00:02:42.240> so<00:02:42.690> there<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.930> go<00:02:42.959> 0

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
have also used storage so there you go 0

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.370 
have also used storage so there you go 0
out<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.560> 33<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.880> zero<00:02:45.180> percent<00:02:45.690> if<00:02:46.110> we<00:02:46.290> add

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
out of 33 that is zero percent if we add

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.590 
out of 33 that is zero percent if we add
a<00:02:46.410> few<00:02:46.650> things<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.190> storage<00:02:47.400> then<00:02:48.270> we<00:02:48.450> will

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
a few things to the storage then we will

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.580 
a few things to the storage then we will
have<00:02:48.720> nine<00:02:49.050> out<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.350> 33<00:02:50.120> nice<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.780> can<00:02:51.930> also<00:02:52.080> set

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
have nine out of 33 nice we can also set

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.620 
have nine out of 33 nice we can also set
in<00:02:52.800> any<00:02:53.070> combination<00:02:53.489> one<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.239> there<00:02:54.480> we<00:02:54.600> go

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
in any combination one so there we go

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.890 
in any combination one so there we go
position<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.530> used<00:02:56.190> storage<00:02:56.760> right<00:02:57.420> so

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
position and used storage right so

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.390 
position and used storage right so
here's<00:02:58.080> here<00:02:58.380> we<00:02:58.440> go<00:02:58.560> with<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.920> last<00:02:59.100> thing
