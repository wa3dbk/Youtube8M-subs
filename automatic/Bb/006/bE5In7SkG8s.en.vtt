00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
creative director and watchdogs and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.550 
creative director and watchdogs and
asked<00:00:27.660> them<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:27.869> there's<00:00:28.050> gonna<00:00:28.140> be<00:00:28.230> cheat

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
asked them if there's gonna be cheat

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.380

causes<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.010> watchdogs<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.580> he<00:00:30.029> confirmed

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
causes and watchdogs and he confirmed

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.970 
causes and watchdogs and he confirmed
simply<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:31.080> saying<00:00:31.320> no<00:00:31.500> there<00:00:31.679> will<00:00:31.769> not<00:00:31.949> be

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
simply just saying no there will not be

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.069 
simply just saying no there will not be
and<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:33.059> think<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> reason<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.870> is

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
and I think the reason for this is

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.139 
and I think the reason for this is
because<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.500> watchdogs<00:00:34.710> you're<00:00:35.460> not<00:00:35.700> supposed

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
because in watchdogs you're not supposed

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.119 
because in watchdogs you're not supposed
to<00:00:36.300> be<00:00:36.450> having<00:00:36.660> big<00:00:37.079> shootouts<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.890> then<00:00:37.980> when

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
to be having big shootouts and then when

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.799 
to be having big shootouts and then when
you<00:00:38.219> lose<00:00:38.309> your<00:00:38.460> wanted<00:00:38.730> level<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.719> know

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
you lose your wanted level and you know

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.150 
you lose your wanted level and you know
it<00:00:39.930> all<00:00:40.079> goes<00:00:40.260> back<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> normal<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> whole

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it all goes back to normal the whole

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.760 
it all goes back to normal the whole
point<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.910> watchdogs<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> fact<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.230> you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
point of watchdogs is the fact that you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.110 
point of watchdogs is the fact that you

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
quite a small one now chicag was

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.750 
quite a small one now chicag was
actually<00:02:27.960> well<00:02:28.170> known<00:02:28.200> as<00:02:28.680> well<00:02:28.890> as<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.400> Windy

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
actually well known as well as the Windy

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.670 
actually well known as well as the Windy
City<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.330> I'm<00:02:31.020> not<00:02:31.140> sure<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.320> reason<00:02:31.440> for

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
City and I'm not sure the reason for

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.410 
City and I'm not sure the reason for
this<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.160> didn't<00:02:32.640> think<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.910> was<00:02:33.030> any<00:02:33.210> more

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
this is I didn't think it was any more

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.660 
this is I didn't think it was any more
windy<00:02:33.720> than<00:02:33.870> any<00:02:34.080> other<00:02:34.260> city<00:02:34.650> I'm<00:02:35.340> sure<00:02:35.520> there

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
windy than any other city I'm sure there

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.340 
windy than any other city I'm sure there
is<00:02:35.700> some<00:02:35.940> reason<00:02:36.240> for<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.510> originate<00:02:37.200> with

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
is some reason for it to originate with

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.960 
is some reason for it to originate with
that<00:02:37.470> name<00:02:37.650> but<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.220> game<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.520> going<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.700> kind

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
that name but this game is going to kind

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.510 
that name but this game is going to kind
of<00:02:39.030> play<00:02:39.330> up<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.750> signature<00:02:40.520> origination

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
of play up to that signature origination

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.490 
of play up to that signature origination
and<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:42.450> think<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.750> wind<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.050> this<00:02:43.200> game<00:02:43.350> is

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
and I think the wind in this game is

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.960 
and I think the wind in this game is
gonna<00:02:43.590> be<00:02:43.740> really<00:02:43.920> really<00:02:44.040> impressive<00:02:44.730> the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
gonna be really really impressive the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.790 
gonna be really really impressive the
wind<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.360> actually<00:02:45.510> governed<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.320> only<00:02:46.620> blow

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
wind is actually governed to only blow

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.950 
wind is actually governed to only blow
down<00:02:47.010> specific<00:02:47.520> streets<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.360> just<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.840> way

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
down specific streets and just the way

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.470 
down specific streets and just the way
that<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.230> acts<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.040> way<00:02:50.130> everything

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
that it acts and the way everything

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.580 
that it acts and the way everything
dynamically<00:02:51.480> reacts<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.990> it<00:02:52.020> so<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.320> way<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
dynamically reacts to it so the way the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.200 
dynamically reacts to it so the way the
trash<00:02:52.830> blows<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.400> direction<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.000> moves

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
trash blows the direction that it moves

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.970 
trash blows the direction that it moves
all<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:54.870> sort<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.110> stuff<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.470> all<00:02:55.560> linked<00:02:55.860> in

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
all that sort of stuff is all linked in

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.190 
all that sort of stuff is all linked in
to<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.520> signature<00:02:57.090> Windy<00:02:57.750> City<00:02:57.960> of<00:02:58.050> Chicago

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
to the signature Windy City of Chicago

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.710 
to the signature Windy City of Chicago
so<00:02:58.740> that's<00:02:58.860> really<00:02:59.100> really<00:02:59.250> cool<00:02:59.660> now<00:03:00.660> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
so that's really really cool now the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.210 
so that's really really cool now the
next<00:03:01.050> couple<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.350> facts<00:03:01.530> are<00:03:01.740> all<00:03:01.890> kind<00:03:02.160> of

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
next couple of facts are all kind of

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.220 
next couple of facts are all kind of
tied<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.550> together<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.450> if<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.660> walk<00:03:03.870> slowly

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
tied in together so if you walk slowly

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.620 
tied in together so if you walk slowly
you'll<00:03:04.620> actually<00:03:04.830> conceal<00:03:05.520> your<00:03:05.880> firearm<00:03:06.420> at

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
you'll actually conceal your firearm at

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.570 
you'll actually conceal your firearm at
your<00:03:06.810> hip<00:03:06.990> so<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.620> won't<00:03:07.800> be<00:03:07.950> on<00:03:07.980> show<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
your hip so it won't be on show to the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.360 
your hip so it won't be on show to the
public<00:03:09.080> now<00:03:10.080> if<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.350> go<00:03:10.500> ahead<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.950> aim<00:03:11.190> your

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
public now if you go ahead and aim your

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.240 
public now if you go ahead and aim your
gun<00:03:11.430> or<00:03:11.880> run<00:03:12.750> you'll<00:03:13.380> actually<00:03:13.590> be<00:03:13.860> pulling

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
gun or run you'll actually be pulling

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.280 
gun or run you'll actually be pulling
out<00:03:14.520> your<00:03:14.550> gun<00:03:14.910> from<00:03:15.210> your<00:03:15.390> holster<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.930> assume

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
out your gun from your holster I assume

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.590 
out your gun from your holster I assume
and<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:17.010> will<00:03:17.100> be<00:03:17.220> on<00:03:17.370> publicly<00:03:17.790> on<00:03:17.970> show<00:03:18.270> for

and it will be on publicly on show for

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.810 
and it will be on publicly on show for
everybody<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:19.110> see<00:03:19.320> now<00:03:19.860> it's<00:03:20.040> not<00:03:20.100> like<00:03:20.400> GTA

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
everybody to see now it's not like GTA

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.100 
everybody to see now it's not like GTA
where<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.180> could<00:03:21.300> walk<00:03:21.480> down<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.870> street

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
where you could walk down the street

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.230 
where you could walk down the street
fully<00:03:22.380> loaded<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.490> know<00:03:23.610> pedestrians

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
fully loaded and you know pedestrians

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.690 
fully loaded and you know pedestrians
NPCs<00:03:24.750> don't<00:03:25.020> really<00:03:25.710> look<00:03:25.830> at<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.070> at<00:03:26.250> all<00:03:26.280> in

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
NPCs don't really look at you at all in

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.430 
NPCs don't really look at you at all in
this<00:03:27.210> game<00:03:27.450> when<00:03:27.660> they<00:03:27.750> see<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.080> they<00:03:28.110> are

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
this game when they see you they are

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.430 
this game when they see you they are
going<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.680> react<00:03:29.070> so<00:03:29.720> this<00:03:30.720> reactive<00:03:31.260> nature

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
going to react so this reactive nature

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.650 
going to react so this reactive nature
when<00:03:32.250> people<00:03:32.550> see<00:03:32.760> your<00:03:32.880> gun<00:03:33.090> there's<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:33.390> few

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
when people see your gun there's a few

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.000 
when people see your gun there's a few
different<00:03:33.930> ways<00:03:34.050> they<00:03:34.320> could<00:03:34.470> react<00:03:34.740> and<00:03:34.980> I

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
different ways they could react and I

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.960 
different ways they could react and I
guess<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.190> would<00:03:35.400> depend<00:03:35.580> on<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.760> situation

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
guess that would depend on the situation

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.930 
guess that would depend on the situation
and<00:03:36.570> what<00:03:37.170> kind<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.470> systems<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.370> big<00:03:38.520> governing

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
and what kind of systems a big governing

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.640 
and what kind of systems a big governing
that<00:03:39.060> we<00:03:39.180> really<00:03:39.630> react<00:03:39.960> but<00:03:40.350> there<00:03:40.500> are<00:03:40.560> two

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
that we really react but there are two

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.410 
that we really react but there are two
main<00:03:40.830> ways<00:03:40.860> they<00:03:41.280> can<00:03:41.340> either<00:03:41.550> pull<00:03:42.150> out<00:03:42.300> their

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
main ways they can either pull out their

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.780 
main ways they can either pull out their
own<00:03:42.510> phone<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.990> call<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.470> cops<00:03:43.620> or<00:03:44.130> they

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
own phone and call the cops or they

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.910 
own phone and call the cops or they
could<00:03:44.940> just<00:03:45.090> make<00:03:45.240> a<00:03:45.270> run<00:03:45.480> for<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.860> now<00:03:46.860> the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
could just make a run for it now the

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.470 
could just make a run for it now the
more<00:03:47.190> people<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:47.610> guess<00:03:47.850> witness<00:03:48.330> you

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
more people that I guess witness you

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.850 
more people that I guess witness you
pulling<00:03:48.780> out<00:03:48.840> your<00:03:48.900> gun<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.410> higher

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
pulling out your gun the higher

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.250 
pulling out your gun the higher
probability<00:03:50.100> there<00:03:50.850> is<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.240> somebody<00:03:51.750> calling

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
probability there is of somebody calling

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.770 
probability there is of somebody calling
in<00:03:52.760> now<00:03:53.760> when<00:03:53.910> somebody<00:03:54.240> does<00:03:54.390> pull<00:03:54.600> up<00:03:54.690> the

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
in now when somebody does pull up the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.880 
in now when somebody does pull up the
phone<00:03:54.990> and<00:03:55.140> start<00:03:55.230> calling<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.680> police<00:03:55.800> you

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
phone and start calling the police you

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.040 
phone and start calling the police you
can<00:03:56.100> actually<00:03:56.310> intercept<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.480> stop<00:03:57.780> that

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
can actually intercept it to stop that

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.990 
can actually intercept it to stop that
so<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.920> either<00:03:59.040> go<00:03:59.550> ahead<00:03:59.700> and<00:03:59.820> break

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
so you can either go ahead and break

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.520 
so you can either go ahead and break
this<00:04:00.120> forward<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.600> can<00:04:00.720> attack<00:04:01.020> them<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.320> can

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
this forward you can attack them you can

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.160 
this forward you can attack them you can
shoot<00:04:01.740> them<00:04:01.950> however<00:04:02.850> it<00:04:03.150> does<00:04:03.390> have<00:04:03.660> what<00:04:04.050> is

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
shoot them however it does have what is

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.570 
shoot them however it does have what is
known<00:04:04.320> as<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.500> ripple<00:04:04.800> effect<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.370> this<00:04:05.459> is

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
known as a ripple effect and this is

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.830 
known as a ripple effect and this is
gonna<00:04:05.670> be<00:04:05.790> quite<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:05.940> big<00:04:06.150> thing<00:04:06.180> in<00:04:06.420> watchdog's

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
gonna be quite a big thing in watchdog's

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.740 
gonna be quite a big thing in watchdog's
the<00:04:07.080> ripple<00:04:07.410> effect<00:04:07.709> so<00:04:08.610> with<00:04:08.760> this<00:04:09.030> specific

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
the ripple effect so with this specific

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.140 
the ripple effect so with this specific
example<00:04:10.230> other<00:04:10.830> people<00:04:11.220> may<00:04:11.610> see<00:04:11.670> you

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
example other people may see you

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.270 
example other people may see you
intercepting<00:04:13.080> this<00:04:13.200> one<00:04:13.440> person<00:04:13.890> calling<00:04:14.190> the

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
intercepting this one person calling the

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.520 
intercepting this one person calling the
cops<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.730> then<00:04:15.120> they<00:04:15.360> might<00:04:15.750> react<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.260> that

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
cops and then they might react to that

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.229 
cops and then they might react to that
so<00:04:16.980> that<00:04:17.130> could<00:04:17.280> cause<00:04:17.459> them<00:04:17.730> to<00:04:17.970> pull<00:04:18.120> out

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
so that could cause them to pull out

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.000 
so that could cause them to pull out
their<00:04:18.420> phones<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:18.989> call<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.560> police<00:04:19.680> and

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
their phones and call the police and

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.590 
their phones and call the police and
then<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.670> have<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.910> decision<00:04:21.330> on<00:04:21.450> what

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
then you have the decision on what

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.969 
then you have the decision on what
you're<00:04:21.720> gonna<00:04:21.810> do<00:04:21.989> about<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.380> that's<00:04:22.800> a

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
you're gonna do about that that's a

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.250 
you're gonna do about that that's a
further<00:04:23.190> ripple<00:04:23.580> effect<00:04:23.880> now<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:24.780> do<00:04:24.930> believe

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
further ripple effect now I do believe

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.930 
further ripple effect now I do believe
there<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.530> an<00:04:25.650> ability<00:04:25.890> to<00:04:26.130> hack<00:04:26.580> or

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
there is an ability to hack or

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.150 
there is an ability to hack or
forms<00:04:27.390> at<00:04:27.570> once<00:04:27.780> in<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.110> specific<00:04:28.320> area<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:29.130> that

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
forms at once in a specific area so that

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.730 
forms at once in a specific area so that
may<00:04:29.490> be<00:04:29.550> a<00:04:29.670> really<00:04:29.910> useful<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.630> ability<00:04:31.620> to

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
may be a really useful and ability to

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.610 
may be a really useful and ability to
use<00:04:31.950> in<00:04:32.160> that<00:04:32.310> kind<00:04:32.550> of<00:04:32.610> situation<00:04:33.440> now<00:04:34.440> it's

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
use in that kind of situation now it's

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.650 
use in that kind of situation now it's
worth<00:04:34.740> remembering<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:35.370> simply<00:04:36.120> pointing<00:04:36.600> a

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
worth remembering that simply pointing a

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.540 
worth remembering that simply pointing a
gun<00:04:36.690> in<00:04:36.990> watchdog's<00:04:37.500> can<00:04:37.830> initiate<00:04:38.130> one<00:04:38.460> of

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
gun in watchdog's can initiate one of

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.090 
gun in watchdog's can initiate one of
these<00:04:38.670> ripple<00:04:39.030> effects<00:04:39.470> fad<00:04:40.470> number<00:04:40.740> nine<00:04:40.920> is

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
these ripple effects fad number nine is

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.800 
these ripple effects fad number nine is
to<00:04:41.190> do<00:04:41.310> with<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.520> media<00:04:41.700> now<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.120> media<00:04:42.540> will

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
to do with the media now the media will

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.990 
to do with the media now the media will
pick<00:04:43.050> on<00:04:43.200> every<00:04:43.800> disruption<00:04:44.430> they'll<00:04:44.820> see

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
pick on every disruption they'll see

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.940 
pick on every disruption they'll see
everything<00:04:45.450> so<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.050> way<00:04:46.170> citizens<00:04:46.650> react

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
everything so the way citizens react

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.430 
everything so the way citizens react
will<00:04:47.370> be<00:04:47.490> based<00:04:47.760> upon<00:04:48.030> this<00:04:48.660> media<00:04:48.990> portrayal

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
will be based upon this media portrayal

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.110 
will be based upon this media portrayal
of<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:49.860> when<00:04:50.190> they<00:04:50.280> report<00:04:50.670> on<00:04:50.820> what's

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
happened on each disruption and this

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.030 
happened on each disruption and this
will<00:04:54.450> depend<00:04:54.570> on<00:04:54.960> Europe<00:04:55.320> fearsome<00:04:55.860> or

during<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.360> firefight<00:05:06.600> you'd<00:05:07.260> have<00:05:07.440> two

during a firefight you'd have two

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.290 
during a firefight you'd have two
options<00:05:07.950> you<00:05:08.040> could<00:05:08.190> just<00:05:08.370> flee<00:05:08.760> completely

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
options you could just flee completely

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.020 
options you could just flee completely
to<00:05:09.690> try<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.110> reduce<00:05:10.500> your<00:05:10.680> Ripple<00:05:11.070> or<00:05:11.220> you

to try and reduce your Ripple or you

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.670 
to try and reduce your Ripple or you
