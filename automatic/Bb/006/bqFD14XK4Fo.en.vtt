00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.070
 hu 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.139
 hello to all and unity 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.219
 I hope you wear well and 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.290
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.000
 new video the third episode of 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.290
 rock tutos so I make you a 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.490
 little introduction why everything 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.560
 just because I wanted to come back 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.300
 on some points and on the concept of 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.279
 rock tutor that still a lot 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.259
 some of you have not understood there are some 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.029
 a large majority who appreciated who has 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.620
 found it nice that understood concept 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.329
 but others you did not understand and 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.860
 you have bath but comments 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.800
 rather negative on it so I 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.570
 just explained it in dofus and 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.239
 on my channel at the level of my subscribers 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.469
 there are very experienced people 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.940
 moderately experienced and little 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.859
 experienced 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.140
 the problem is that you have to satisfy 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.399
 everyone must satisfy 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.870
 people who are very experienced little 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.329
 experienced or moderately experienced 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.800
 which is normal I post almost a 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.839
 video every day and I try in 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.969
 my videos to satisfy everyone 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.989
 in general people are quite happy 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.210
 that is, there is everything in my 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.590
 videos so that's okay the worry 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.900
 it's that when I put videos that 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.520
 are for the inexperienced people those 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.470
 who are experienced or moderately 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.030
 experienced do not understand and 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.280
 finds that it is useless the principle of 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.290
 tuto rush is simply giving 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.030
 advice very quickly to start 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.390
 in the game or just for 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.420
 improve let's say the gameplay is 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.460
 how to play that at the level of 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.020
 acceleration as those high level low 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.500
 of the rigged skill finally here are some 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.130
 stuff like that 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.690
 the worry is that when we know 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.610
 necessarily all there is in my video 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.650
 but we are not very interested 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.200
 finds that these means that it's not very 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.790
 interesting and we have to get down to 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 place people who are novice new 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.100
 as you call them all so well 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.110
 world was noble 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.630
 myself I was we you know them 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.160
 friends I made characters where I 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.420
 put points anywhere in the 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.250
 features because I find that 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.570
 nice and it was absolutely necessary that I 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.250
 tap in all george elements a 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.440
 issued on mons frame points too 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.480
 can someone explain to me why I 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.800
 do that I do not know it's just that 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.050
 I thought it was nice to be able to type 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.250
 also never have any sense rode kako 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.989
 stuff like that here I am 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.120
 did not know anything in fact everybody 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.700
 starts in a game so today I 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.010
 play league of legend I will be bad 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.480
 but no one to shit but really I'm going 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.920
 understand nothing about what I do and that 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.239
 is going to be very funny very funny to see I 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.620
 you swear it's going to be very funny what 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.490
 is normal when we start a game we are 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.610
 necessarily our lives 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.690
 not normally all the time 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.400
 because if you do for example 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.230
 a lot of fps you go on a 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.210
 new fps you will know the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.980
 principle but at the level of dofus 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.210
 even if it's a mmo there is still 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.890
 a lot of points that changes relative 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.840
 to others and then when we are young we 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.490
 is not necessarily excellent everywhere 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.930
 so that was just to tell you 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.630
 that I'm trying to satisfy all the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.950
 world and that globally you are 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.630
 happy and you often see me 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.370
 positive feedback but that on some 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.300
 points you do not understand as the 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.760
 tutoring for example and so I try 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.650
 to bring a lot of help 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.030
 the jo the beginners players it's 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.620
 really wallace as I say of 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.200
 help at the level of the game itself 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.760
 two shortcuts etc so here is 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.730
 I hope you will like it I hope 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.260
 that you understand and do not change 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.460
 change nothing you are perfect thank you to 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.480
 you all for your feedback 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.430
 I love you and have a good view in 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.170
 dofus it is possible to marry two 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.430
 characters that are of the same sex 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.910
 or the opposite sex it does not have 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.560
 important 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.780
 just go to the church that is 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.310
 in 6 3 this will allow you to open 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.260
 a new joint window that you 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.280
 can also open using the 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.050
 keyboard shortcut she 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.580
 click on spouse and three choices 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.170
 are available to you invited in my group 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.000
 follow the move and join the 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.190
 more important and join but he has 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.410
 its limits of use you can 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.360
 join a spouse who is 15 15 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.840
 maximum so beyond 15 it's no longer 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.220
 possible 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.570
 and you will see that in some 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.970
 areas it's a little bit of a hassle like 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.990
 for example the island of otomai where I 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.490
 would like to join my character 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.410
 of uncle did 4 who is tending to coke 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.770
 9.6 with my cunning the most zappe 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.590
 close 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.700
 obviously being less 46 18 so he 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.740
 I would have to walk a little power 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.650
 to be able to reach him by whom you are going 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.570
 see here I will try to join him 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.580
 hop and it's not possible your wife 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.240
 is too far away for you to 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.150
 join her 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.860
 by cons using a zap that is 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.120
 closer geographically but even 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.580
 if he's not in the same area it's 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.590
 possible using for example the zap 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.690
 who is in the canopy village 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.000
 you will see now it works 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.840
 however you see that he is not 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.340
 not in the same area 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.440
 it's not displaying directly on 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.910
 the island of otomai is very convenient in 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.530
 certain areas like for example the island 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.540
 of frigost you often have things 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.400
 to do it at the cradle level 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.360
 of alma anywhere at the level of 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.340
 tears of ronnie grid 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.410
 lezat closer and that of the village 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.760
 buried and it's pretty boring because 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.640
 you can not reach these areas 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.260
 then we must use the apt Frigost 3 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.229
 who even if he is not in the same 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.160
 area and at the geographical level close to 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.340
 blow you can use it 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.200
 here it happens from time to time that 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.880
 your character is stuck in grave and 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.290
 that you can not liberate your soul 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.729
 by clicking on it simply because 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.070
 that a decor or something like that 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.620
 blocking it to a command 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.260
 lets unlock this you just have 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.530
 to type directly into the channel you 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.190
 do a slash really is up and you 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.070
 go see 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.660
 tac I'm going to be in ghost and I 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.900
 could go directly to the phoenix 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.240
 here it is possible since a 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.460
 very recent day of mimi bio TV 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.229
 montilliers and familiars 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.150
 the use is the same you use 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.820
 the violent one by double clicking on it 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.570
 you put a pet that will give the 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.150
 statistics 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.030
 so that's it for the pki and you put 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.440
 anything for his appearance so 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.750
 you will see that it will give a 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.390
 country which so with the statistics of the 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:42.350
 pki with the appearance of phosphorus lo 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.970
 it has always been possible to 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.160
 resurrect as a familiar using a 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.350
 resurrection powder as much more than 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.150
 therefore the montilliers is the same 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.130
 thing except that now there is a 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.650
 little trick so that it costs a lot 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.229
 cheaper because often the powders 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.300
 of resurrection are expensive compared to 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:02.900
 a simple resurrection you can 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.820
 go to the kennel which is in 9 21 and 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.940
 talk to auch immo do you do and 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.919
 change you give a ghost of 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.780
 montilliers and children and a powder d 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.120
 can not do it and you will pardon 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.289
 recover your montilliers with his 10 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.770
 points of life you will see 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:20.120
 teacher and he said well life points I 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.360
 go double click on it and you go 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.289
 see 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.090
 tac 10.10 here is however very 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.830
 attention to two cases the 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.390
 first is the familiar does not do it 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.310
 with the familiar ones you see well that 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.560
 my ghost of ben waters is at 80 strength 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.810
 if I give him with an eniripsa powder 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.850
 he will give it to me without statistics 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.580
 so that's a big problem the 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.680
 second is not to do it with a 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.659
 monte healy who is mimi bio t 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.820
 because when you go get your 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:48.530
 montilliers the mini beyond will be removed 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.120
 so pay attention to that does that 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.130
 only with ghosts of 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.580
 montilliers that are not limited 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.349
 from time to time in the fighting 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.310
 the animations are too long and 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:00.800
 blow you can not enjoy 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.840
 full of your turn to avoid that 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.090
 you can do a very simple trick there 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.490
 simply use the 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.860
 creatures mode enable the disable the 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.849
 and here you have all the bombs by 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.409
 example at the level of hate 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:14.240
 robbers who have withdrawn and the 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:15.409
 animations are over could play 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.590
 your turn fully 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:20.300
 that's if you're doing some 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.430
 difficult moguls like for example those 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.560
 of frigost 3 and that you will die often 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.300
 you are tired of running after 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.120
 phoenix what is normal there is a 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.370
 very simple possibility you just have 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.400
 to save the zap in at least 30 of 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.320
 the one of tenais there you go see I 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.370
 I'll start the fight and then give up 

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.710
 will find myself in fall 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.789
 but instead of chasing after the phoenix 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:45.400
 you will see that I will find myself 

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:48.260
 directly on the phoenix map 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.419
 since very recently the maximum number 

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.849
 fast equipment has been multiplied by 

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:53.599
 two indeed before the maximum number 

00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:55.940
 was 8 

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:58.310
 now it has risen to 16 you have 

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.409
 actually other possible slot and 

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.930
 you can put them as before with 

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:06.400
 if you look hop the same number 

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.400
