new 14 242 kit lens it is collapsible

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.510 
new 14 242 kit lens it is collapsible
but<00:00:45.750> instead<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.350> making<00:00:46.649> mechanical<00:00:46.829> zoom

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
but instead of making mechanical zoom

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.479 
but instead of making mechanical zoom
now<00:00:47.879> uses<00:00:48.390> motor<00:00:48.870> DreamZone

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.220 

the<00:00:56.489> lens<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.059> small<00:00:57.570> when<00:00:57.780> powered

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the lens is really small when powered

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.760 
the lens is really small when powered
off<00:00:59.180> but<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> fear<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.870> will<00:01:01.050> use<00:01:01.260> too<00:01:01.620> much

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
off but I fear it will use too much

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.729 
off but I fear it will use too much
battery<00:01:02.579> power<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.840> one<00:01:04.019> sony<00:01:04.470> has

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
battery power just like the one sony has

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.450 
battery power just like the one sony has
for<00:01:05.129> its<00:01:05.309> any<00:01:05.640> existence<00:01:06.560> only<00:01:07.560> cool<00:01:07.979> olympus

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
for its any existence only cool olympus

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.219 
for its any existence only cool olympus
have<00:01:08.670> still<00:01:08.909> kept<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.390> decent<00:01:09.750> range<00:01:09.960> of

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
have still kept a decent range of

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.760 
have still kept a decent range of
external<00:01:10.740> controls<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.700> camera<00:01:12.240> has

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
external controls so this camera has

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.310 
external controls so this camera has

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
quite fast in operation as you can see

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.069 
quite fast in operation as you can see
when<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> turn<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:41.119> is<00:01:42.119> very<00:01:42.450> soon<00:01:42.840> ready

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
when I turn it on it is very soon ready

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.069 
when I turn it on it is very soon ready
for<00:01:43.500> taking<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> first<00:01:44.189> image<00:01:47.540> many<00:01:48.540> system

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
for taking the first image many system

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.160 
for taking the first image many system
is<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.649> same<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.130> found<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.790> other<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.079> M

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
is the same as found on other on the M

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.530 
is the same as found on other on the M
pen<00:01:52.409> cameras<00:01:52.979> which<00:01:53.340> means<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:54.000> might<00:01:54.210> take

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
pen cameras which means it might take

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.780 
pen cameras which means it might take
some<00:01:54.750> time<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.860> used<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.399> if

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
some time for you to get used to it if

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.899 
some time for you to get used to it if
you<00:01:57.479> never<00:01:57.659> used<00:01:58.110> olympus<00:01:59.009> around<00:01:59.399> olympus
