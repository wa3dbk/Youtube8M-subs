00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.219 
heard about this and I'd like to mention
is<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.809> take<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> little<00:01:04.080> bit

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
is that you do have to take a little bit

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.990 
is that you do have to take a little bit
effort<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.650> get<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.860> into<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.309> case<00:01:05.489> itself

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
effort to get it into the case itself

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
effort to get it into the case itself
because<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.659> made<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.049> be<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.170> protective

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
because this is made to be a protective

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.620 
because this is made to be a protective
case<00:01:07.950> should<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:08.909> able<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.210> pop<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.540> in

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
case should be able to just pop it in

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.850 
case should be able to just pop it in
there<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.840> pop<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.380> ease<00:01:10.590> because

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
there and pop it out with ease because

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.950 
there and pop it out with ease because
it's<00:01:11.100> shock<00:01:11.670> resistant<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.330> everything<00:01:12.840> else

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
it's shock resistant and everything else

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.200 
it's shock resistant and everything else
let's<00:01:13.710> take<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.950> look<00:01:14.130> at<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> case<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.850> start

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
I'm seeing it here is interestingly when

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.760 
I'm seeing it here is interestingly when
the<00:02:20.360> iPads<00:02:20.690> in<00:02:20.840> we'll<00:02:20.990> see<00:02:21.170> but<00:02:21.560> there's<00:02:21.710> a

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
the iPads in we'll see but there's a

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.700 
the iPads in we'll see but there's a
little<00:02:21.920> bit<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.160> gap<00:02:22.420> right<00:02:23.420> now<00:02:23.630> on<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.290> edges

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
little bit of gap right now on the edges

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.680 
little bit of gap right now on the edges
when<00:02:25.280> there's<00:02:25.430> no<00:02:25.550> iPad<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.060> there<00:02:26.270> I<00:02:26.330> imagine

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
when there's no iPad in there I imagine

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.730 
when there's no iPad in there I imagine
once<00:02:26.810> we<00:02:26.900> get<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.110> inside<00:02:27.380> you'll<00:02:27.620> actually

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
once we get it inside you'll actually

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.890 
once we get it inside you'll actually
get<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.040> see<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.490> there's<00:02:29.180> no<00:02:29.390> effect<00:02:29.540> at<00:02:29.840> all

have<00:05:54.320> to<00:05:54.410> snap<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:54.950> edges<00:05:55.220> all<00:05:55.400> the<00:05:55.430> way<00:05:55.550> down

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
have to snap the edges all the way down

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.040 
have to snap the edges all the way down
all<00:05:56.120> the<00:05:56.150> way<00:05:56.330> around<00:05:56.570> you'll<00:05:56.780> hear<00:05:56.930> the

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
all the way around you'll hear the

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.170 
all the way around you'll hear the
actual<00:05:57.200> clicks<00:05:57.560> as<00:05:57.770> you<00:05:58.160> do<00:05:58.280> that<00:05:58.430> and<00:05:58.640> take

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
actual clicks as you do that and take

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.250 
actual clicks as you do that and take
them<00:05:59.300> apart<00:05:59.420> as<00:05:59.780> well<00:05:59.900> as<00:05:59.990> put<00:06:00.110> it<00:06:00.170> back

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
them apart as well as put it back

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.480 
them apart as well as put it back
together<00:06:00.380> you'll<00:06:00.620> hear<00:06:00.770> the<00:06:00.890> clicks<00:06:01.100> itself

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
together you'll hear the clicks itself

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.000 
together you'll hear the clicks itself
and<00:06:01.730> otherwise<00:06:02.570> it<00:06:03.140> adds<00:06:03.500> a<00:06:03.590> little<00:06:03.680> bit<00:06:03.830> of

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
and otherwise it adds a little bit of

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.060 
and otherwise it adds a little bit of
depth<00:06:04.700> to<00:06:05.450> the<00:06:05.540> actual<00:06:05.870> device<00:06:06.170> itself<00:06:06.200> so

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
depth to the actual device itself so

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.380 
depth to the actual device itself so
keep<00:06:07.250> that<00:06:07.370> in<00:06:07.520> mind<00:06:07.670> if<00:06:07.730> you<00:06:07.820> carry<00:06:08.060> this<00:06:08.180> in<00:06:08.330> a

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
keep that in mind if you carry this in a

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.050 
keep that in mind if you carry this in a
bag<00:06:08.600> or<00:06:08.810> book<00:06:08.960> bag<00:06:09.170> it's<00:06:09.770> wider<00:06:10.400> because<00:06:10.850> you

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
bag or book bag it's wider because you

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.700 
bag or book bag it's wider because you
know<00:06:11.120> the<00:06:11.420> iPad<00:06:11.720> sits<00:06:11.990> inside<00:06:12.140> of<00:06:12.380> here<00:06:12.620> and

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
know the iPad sits inside of here and

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.140 
know the iPad sits inside of here and
creates<00:06:12.950> this<00:06:13.130> seal<00:06:13.370> basically<00:06:13.820> this<00:06:13.940> little

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
creates this seal basically this little

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.220 
creates this seal basically this little
square<00:06:14.360> in<00:06:14.390> the<00:06:14.540> middle<00:06:14.570> is<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:14.900> size<00:06:15.050> the

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
square in the middle is the size the

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.660 
square in the middle is the size the
iPad<00:06:15.530> so<00:06:15.680> you<00:06:15.710> can<00:06:15.860> see<00:06:15.980> the<00:06:16.100> width<00:06:16.220> difference

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:16.670 
iPad so you can see the width difference

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.550 
iPad so you can see the width difference
the<00:06:17.390> height<00:06:17.570> adds<00:06:17.780> a<00:06:17.900> little<00:06:18.020> bit<00:06:18.110> on<00:06:18.320> there

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
the height adds a little bit on there

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.450 
the height adds a little bit on there
and<00:06:18.740> then<00:06:19.250> on<00:06:19.730> the<00:06:19.850> end<00:06:20.560> another<00:06:21.560> click<00:06:21.920> that

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
and then on the end another click that

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.880 
and then on the end another click that
could<00:06:22.610> make<00:06:22.730> a<00:06:22.760> difference<00:06:23.590> okay<00:06:24.590> so<00:06:24.650> I<00:06:24.800> don't

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
could make a difference okay so I don't

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.080 
could make a difference okay so I don't
like<00:06:25.040> that<00:06:25.220> as<00:06:25.370> much<00:06:25.520> I'm<00:06:25.730> gonna<00:06:25.820> tell<00:06:26.000> you
