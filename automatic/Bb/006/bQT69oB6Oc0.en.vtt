all just dust off the worktop grease or
stones<00:01:04.229> or<00:01:04.500> anything<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:06.090> top<00:01:08.869> you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
stones or anything like that on top you

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.899 
stones or anything like that on top you
can<00:01:09.990> put<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.560> brush<00:01:11.040> or<00:01:11.430> with<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
can put it on with a brush or with a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.200 
can put it on with a brush or with a
roller<00:01:12.409> mini<00:01:13.409> roller<00:01:13.820> doesn't<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:14.970> matter

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
roller mini roller doesn't really matter

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.700 
roller mini roller doesn't really matter
as<00:01:15.570> long<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.840> you've<00:01:15.990> spread<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.530> evenly

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
as long as you've spread it evenly

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.380 
as long as you've spread it evenly
across<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:18.509> surface<00:01:19.670> it's<00:01:20.670> basically<00:01:21.150> going

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
across the surface it's basically going

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.810 
across the surface it's basically going
to<00:01:21.450> stick<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.710> plastic<00:01:23.009> service<00:01:23.640> and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
to stick to that plastic service and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.010 
to stick to that plastic service and
surface<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.720> bond<00:01:25.080> tightly<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> when<00:01:27.840> you

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
surface and bond tightly so when you

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.319 
surface and bond tightly so when you
come<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.439> put<00:01:28.590> your<00:01:28.829> finish<00:01:29.759> paint<00:01:30.000> over<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
come to put your finish paint over the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.530 
come to put your finish paint over the
top<00:01:30.540> that's<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> adhere<00:01:31.950> properly<00:01:32.540> to

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
top that's going to adhere properly to

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.890 
top that's going to adhere properly to
this<00:01:33.689> full<00:01:34.680> microwork<00:01:35.130> top<00:01:35.340> otherwise<00:01:35.900> you're

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
this full microwork top otherwise you're

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.359 
this full microwork top otherwise you're
just<00:01:36.990> going<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.560> peel<00:01:37.890> straight<00:01:38.189> back

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
just going to have it peel straight back

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:49.429 
just going to have it peel straight back
off

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.010 

once<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.399> ELSA<00:01:50.820> prime<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.179> dried<00:01:51.450> onto<00:01:51.719> their

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
once the ELSA prime is dried onto their

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.130 
once the ELSA prime is dried onto their
Formica<00:01:53.009> worktop<00:01:53.520> you're<00:01:54.509> then<00:01:54.630> free<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.899> put

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
Formica worktop you're then free to put

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.580 
Formica worktop you're then free to put
your<00:01:55.170> finished<00:01:55.560> coat<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.920> top<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:57.439> so<00:01:58.439> we'll

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
your finished coat on top and so we'll

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.410 
your finished coat on top and so we'll
let<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.770> dry<00:01:58.920> maybe<00:01:59.579> put<00:01:59.789> a<00:01:59.819> color<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.240> top

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
let that dry maybe put a color on top

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.700 
let that dry maybe put a color on top
after<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.319> see<00:02:01.500> how<00:02:01.649> it

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
after just so you can see how it

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.830 
after just so you can see how it
actually<00:02:01.859> sticks<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> surface<00:02:02.840> and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
actually sticks to the surface and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.300 
actually sticks to the surface and
that's<00:02:03.990> basically<00:02:04.409> how<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.740> paint<00:02:05.039> a<00:02:05.159> full

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
that's basically how you paint a full

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:19.430 
that's basically how you paint a full
microwork<00:02:05.819> top

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.500 

you
