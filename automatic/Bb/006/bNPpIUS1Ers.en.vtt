 If the second wisdom actually exists, what you want to say 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:55.970
 How did you see it in those three cases? 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.720

 The wisdom of those three poems that you want to say if numbers exist 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.310
 Why are you doing so hard ? 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:34.580
 But if you love it and you love it 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.000
 It's also important to say love. 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.000

 Forget the little tiny lines in the game Is the personality after- production 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.599
 So give as much pose as you can express it, 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:12.819
