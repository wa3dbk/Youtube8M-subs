many years or two hundred acres and and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.430 
many years or two hundred acres and and
sometimes<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.329> think<00:01:00.390> there<00:01:00.749> might<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.109> another

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
sometimes I think there might be another

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.040 
sometimes I think there might be another
reason<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.339> because<00:01:02.370> um<00:01:02.999> if<00:01:03.600> someone

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
reason for that is because um if someone

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.900 
reason for that is because um if someone
knew<00:01:04.230> what<00:01:04.440> it<00:01:04.589> all<00:01:04.739> entails<00:01:04.920> they<00:01:05.489> might<00:01:05.700> hey

knew what it all entails they might hey

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.580 
knew what it all entails they might hey
now<00:01:06.240> maybe<00:01:06.480> I'll<00:01:06.630> go<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.079> hard<00:01:07.229> work<00:01:07.290> ah
