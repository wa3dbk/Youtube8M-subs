steaming<00:00:24.900> pile<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.740> one<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.189> quite<00:00:26.640> good

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
steaming pile this one is quite good

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.410 
steaming pile this one is quite good
being<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> 3ds<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.760> course<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.150> does<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
being on the 3ds of course it does to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.659 
being on the 3ds of course it does to
take<00:00:30.630> advantage<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> 3d<00:00:31.590> effects<00:00:31.920> but

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
take advantage of the 3d effects but

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.700 
take advantage of the 3d effects but

shoot out and then you have some
missiles<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.100> lock<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> targets

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
you also have an energy meter which will

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
you also have an energy meter which will
deplete<00:00:55.320> as<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.800> fly<00:00:56.010> through<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> levels

various things like you can increase the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.289 
various things like you can increase the
amount<00:01:28.130> of<00:01:28.189> damage<00:01:28.490> your<00:01:28.640> shields<00:01:28.939> can<00:01:29.119> take

you can also slow down the rate of
energy<00:01:31.970> depletion

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.020 

3d<00:01:43.260> effects<00:01:43.530> looked<00:01:43.800> terrific<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.820> game

everything

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.620 

couple<00:01:59.620> of<00:01:59.710> downsides<00:01:59.860> to<00:02:00.370> this<00:02:00.520> game<00:02:00.760> is<00:02:01.060> the

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
couple of downsides to this game is the

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.360 
couple of downsides to this game is the
occasional<00:02:02.080> bit<00:02:02.260> of<00:02:02.350> pop<00:02:02.560> up<00:02:02.770> which<00:02:02.980> happens

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
occasional bit of pop up which happens

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.790 
occasional bit of pop up which happens
when<00:02:03.550> you're<00:02:03.700> making<00:02:03.970> sharp<00:02:04.210> turns<00:02:04.590> which<00:02:05.590> can

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
when you're making sharp turns which can

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.260 
when you're making sharp turns which can
cause<00:02:05.980> you<00:02:06.010> to<00:02:06.190> crash<00:02:06.460> into<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.850> wall<00:02:07.030> and

other<00:02:10.600> is<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:10.900> the<00:02:11.020> game<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.290> very<00:02:11.350> short

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
other is that the game is very short

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.500 
other is that the game is very short
