00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
motorcycle run smoother and quieter and

you<00:00:06.240> know<00:00:06.330> I've<00:00:06.450> been<00:00:06.600> hearing<00:00:06.870> about

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
you know I've been hearing about

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.530 
you know I've been hearing about
dynabeads<00:00:07.560> for<00:00:07.950> years<00:00:08.340> as<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.910> way<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.240> balance

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540

dynabeads for years as a way to balance
the<00:00:09.750> tires<00:00:10.080> but<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.769> always<00:00:10.860> kind<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.340> wondered

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
the tires but I always kind of wondered

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.999 
the tires but I always kind of wondered
if<00:00:11.759> they<00:00:11.849> really<00:00:12.090> worked<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:12.990> when<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.650> recently

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
if they really worked so when I recently

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.499 
if they really worked so when I recently
had<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.370> new<00:00:14.580> set<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.790> tires<00:00:15.000> put<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.420> my

when your tire is stopped they're kind
of<00:01:17.159> sitting<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.579> bottom<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.030> tire<00:01:18.270> but

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
of sitting at the bottom of the tire but

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
inside of the tire so that they're

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.800 
inside of the tire so that they're
compensating<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:26.250> any<00:01:26.460> heavy<00:01:26.820> spots<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.570> the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
dynabeads and its really pretty simple

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.470 
dynabeads and its really pretty simple
it<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.680> takes<00:02:43.859> a<00:02:43.980> little<00:02:44.130> time<00:02:44.220> now<00:02:45.209> I'm

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
it just takes a little time now I'm

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.809 
it just takes a little time now I'm
going<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.750> be<00:02:45.870> using<00:02:46.019> one<00:02:46.530> ounce<00:02:46.859> of<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.549> beads

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
going to be using one ounce of the beads

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.569 
going to be using one ounce of the beads
in<00:02:48.120> each<00:02:48.569> of<00:02:48.750> these<00:02:48.870> trailer<00:02:49.410> tires<00:02:49.739> now<00:02:50.519> we

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
in each of these trailer tires now we

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.470 
in each of these trailer tires now we
start<00:02:51.180> by<00:02:51.480> removing<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.709> valve<00:02:52.920> core<00:02:53.549> and<00:02:53.850> you

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
start by removing the valve core and you

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.780 
start by removing the valve core and you
use<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.840> tool<00:02:55.079> that's<00:02:55.319> provided<00:02:55.700> unscrew<00:02:56.700> it

use the tool that's provided unscrew it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.180 
use the tool that's provided unscrew it
counterclockwise<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.859> need<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.100> be

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
counterclockwise and you need to be

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.670 
counterclockwise and you need to be
careful<00:02:59.519> not<00:03:00.329> to<00:03:00.569> let<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.900> valve<00:03:01.109> core<00:03:01.440> go

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
careful not to let the valve core go

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.289

method<00:03:47.849> is<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.060> go<00:03:48.299> very<00:03:48.510> slowly<00:03:48.959> just<00:03:49.349> slowly

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
method is to go very slowly just slowly

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.399 
method is to go very slowly just slowly
tap<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.400> few<00:03:50.879> beads<00:03:51.269> at<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.540> time<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.049> you'll<00:03:52.170> see

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
tap a few beads at a time and you'll see

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.289 
tap a few beads at a time and you'll see
they'll<00:03:52.620> go<00:03:52.799> down<00:03:52.980> into<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.700> valve<00:03:53.879> stem

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
they'll go down into the valve stem

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.839 
they'll go down into the valve stem
however<00:03:55.290> if<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:56.159> get<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.370> little<00:03:56.579> too

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
however if you get a little too

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.479 
however if you get a little too
aggressive<00:03:57.049> they'll<00:03:58.049> begin<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.470> clump<00:03:58.980> up<00:03:59.190> and

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
aggressive they'll begin to clump up and

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.670 
aggressive they'll begin to clump up and
they'll<00:03:59.609> start<00:03:59.909> stacking<00:04:00.659> up<00:04:00.810> on<00:04:01.049> top<00:04:01.349> of<00:04:01.590> that

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
they'll start stacking up on top of that

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.490 
they'll start stacking up on top of that
valve<00:04:01.980> stem<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.519> may<00:04:02.670> need<00:04:02.849> to<00:04:03.030> tap<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:04.260> valve

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
valve stem you may need to tap the valve

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.430 
valve stem you may need to tap the valve
stem<00:04:04.799> with<00:04:04.920> your<00:04:05.040> finger<00:04:05.459> or<00:04:05.700> with<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.060> tool<00:04:06.480> to

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
stem with your finger or with a tool to

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.920 
stem with your finger or with a tool to
vibrate<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.129> to<00:04:08.250> get<00:04:08.370> it<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.579> go<00:04:08.700> down<00:04:08.940> now<00:04:09.480> some

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
vibrate it to get it to go down now some

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.830 
vibrate it to get it to go down now some
people<00:04:10.139> actually<00:04:10.500> use<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:11.190> electric<00:04:12.060> engraver

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
people actually use a electric engraver

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.319 
people actually use a electric engraver
tool<00:04:13.590> that<00:04:13.859> vibrates<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.819> you<00:04:14.970> can<00:04:15.150> actually

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
tool that vibrates and you can actually

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.960 
tool that vibrates and you can actually
hold<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:15.989> on<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.919> valve<00:04:17.190> stem<00:04:17.639> and<00:04:17.669> that

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
hold that on the valve stem and that

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.870 
hold that on the valve stem and that
will<00:04:18.180> help<00:04:18.359> those<00:04:18.660> beads<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.739> go<00:04:19.949> down<00:04:20.250> inside

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
will help those beads to go down inside

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.629 
will help those beads to go down inside
the<00:04:21.090> tire<00:04:21.359> as<00:04:21.630> well<00:04:22.100> once<00:04:23.100> you<00:04:23.220> have<00:04:23.400> all<00:04:23.520> the

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
the tire as well once you have all the

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.400 
the tire as well once you have all the
beads<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.419> can<00:04:24.630> reinstall<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.380> valve

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
beads in you can reinstall the valve

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.580 
beads in you can reinstall the valve
core<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:26.160> air<00:04:26.490> up<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.880> tire<00:04:27.120> if<00:04:27.449> you<00:04:28.289> have<00:04:28.500> an

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
core and air up the tire if you have an

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.990 
core and air up the tire if you have an
air<00:04:28.710> compressor<00:04:28.919> there's<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.550> little<00:04:29.760> trick

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
air compressor there's a little trick

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.060 
air compressor there's a little trick
that<00:04:30.030> makes<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.539> bottle<00:04:30.930> method<00:04:31.260> faster<00:04:31.860> and

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
that makes the bottle method faster and

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.500 
that makes the bottle method faster and
it<00:04:32.400> also<00:04:32.520> works<00:04:32.940> better<00:04:33.180> if<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:33.419> have

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
it also works better if you have

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.830 
it also works better if you have
90-degree<00:04:34.260> valve<00:04:34.530> stems<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:35.280> basically<00:04:36.120> you

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
90-degree valve stems and basically you

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.500 
90-degree valve stems and basically you
pour<00:04:37.199> the<00:04:37.349> beads<00:04:37.620> into<00:04:37.949> the<00:04:38.639> tube<00:04:38.880> just<00:04:38.910> as<00:04:39.389> you

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
pour the beads into the tube just as you

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.170 
pour the beads into the tube just as you
do<00:04:39.690> before<00:04:40.080> but<00:04:40.919> now<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.220> want<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.669> insert

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
do before but now you want to insert

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.689 
do before but now you want to insert
your<00:04:42.240> air<00:04:42.750> nozzle<00:04:43.470> into<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.949> other<00:04:44.220> end<00:04:44.550> of

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
your air nozzle into the other end of

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.500 
your air nozzle into the other end of
the<00:04:44.820> tube<00:04:45.090> and<00:04:46.070> carefully<00:04:47.070> just<00:04:47.610> tap<00:04:47.970> lightly

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
the tube and carefully just tap lightly

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.409 
the tube and carefully just tap lightly
add<00:04:49.440> air<00:04:49.830> pressure<00:04:49.860> and<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:50.669> will<00:04:50.820> begin<00:04:51.060> to

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
add air pressure and it will begin to

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.960 
add air pressure and it will begin to
blow<00:04:51.810> those<00:04:52.139> beads<00:04:52.560> down<00:04:53.070> through<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.729> valve

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
blow those beads down through the valve

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.969 
blow those beads down through the valve
stem<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.570> into<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.199> tire<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:55.680> want<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:55.919> be

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
stem and into the tire you want to be

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.100 
stem and into the tire you want to be
very<00:04:56.160> careful<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:56.669> make<00:04:56.729> sure<00:04:56.880> you<00:04:57.780> don't

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
very careful and make sure you don't

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.070 
very careful and make sure you don't
just<00:04:58.410> pull<00:04:58.889> that<00:04:59.639> nozzle<00:05:00.240> out<00:05:00.389> of<00:05:00.599> that<00:05:00.720> tube

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
just pull that nozzle out of that tube

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.750 
just pull that nozzle out of that tube
otherwise<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.919> air<00:05:02.039> pressure<00:05:02.400> is<00:05:02.610> going<00:05:02.699> to

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
otherwise the air pressure is going to

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.540 
otherwise the air pressure is going to
blow<00:05:03.120> those<00:05:03.300> beads<00:05:03.659> back<00:05:04.139> up<00:05:04.440> all<00:05:04.650> over<00:05:05.039> your

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
blow those beads back up all over your

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.879 
blow those beads back up all over your
garage<00:05:05.760> floor<00:05:06.180> don't<00:05:06.960> ask<00:05:07.260> me<00:05:07.530> how<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:07.710> know

will<00:06:00.030> regulate<00:06:00.750> the<00:06:00.960> air<00:06:01.140> pressure<00:06:01.560> so<00:06:02.490> that

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
will regulate the air pressure so that

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.820 
will regulate the air pressure so that
these<00:06:02.940> beads<00:06:03.210> literally<00:06:03.780> just<00:06:03.930> they<00:06:04.260> just<00:06:04.500> fly
