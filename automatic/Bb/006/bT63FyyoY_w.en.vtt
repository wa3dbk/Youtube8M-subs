00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.390
 little video a little bit special in 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.470
 effect you are more and more numerous 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.179

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.860
 caillat and who says more and more 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.460
 many also says a lot more of 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.230
 Questions 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.460
 over the days a lot more of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.350
 private messages that you send from 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.760
 interrogations finally brief I decided to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.340
 bring together in a little top 3 what you 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.990
 can send us the most over 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.699
 days to try to answer it and that's it 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.380
 start right away friends it's 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.539
 in the top three we find a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.340
 question that you were asked vault is 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.720
 come twice that's the request for 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.040
 career path you are good 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.010
 to tell him but what did you do 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.450
 to be streamer cherifia there 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.170
 I want to tell you it does not exist 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.570
 Bac +5 streaming or license the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.800
 bee doo now so we have all 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.500
 two followed different paths in 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.120
 Anyway, I have a ferry and I have 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.520
 also started a license to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.379
 Chinese I did a year in a 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.390
 multimedia school size dollars and then 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.719
 we have sky who does not graduate from engineering 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.550
 so 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.870
 so that's to say that arrested 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.920
 ask ourselves this question these questions 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.210
 everyone but what have you done 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.219
 when studying to be able to stream its 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.140
 crew doing zero study has for streamed 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.750
 China team that's because we seized 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.680
 the opportunities the opportunities we 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.470
 offered the victory 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.720
 this is all top two others have a 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.549
 kind of melting pot of question we 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.500
 I ask myself very often so I tried to 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.299
 make a generality in fact of 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.700
 generalize all of that the issues of 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.470
 subscribers who tell us is what we 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.689
 can you do me some advertising is this 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.100
 that you can accept as a friend is what 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.479
 this war is actually a game with 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.400
 I do it a program I think 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.869
 it's totally awesome genialissime 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.799
 exciting for both no no no 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.030
 no no you have to stop with these 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.170
 issues we suffer the issues 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.270
 we always ask 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.979
 we say here I'm going to start the tough ones 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.619
 but not stupid if I'm going to start a 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.030
 youtube channel i'm leaving project why 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.149
 not to make some gains with your 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.310
 stories we exchange our subscribers and 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.500
 that we exchange our community 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.610
 while I do not have anything against 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.159
 usually if you have not yet 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.140
 launched your youtube channel a year ago 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.880
 either agree or extreme did not want to 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.380
 community you do not have first and 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.180
 so the exchange must be anyway 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.409
 equivalent after a while must we 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.229
 not take us too much for hams 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.580
 premium pork is ok 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.709
 so here we have a lot of questions 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.300
 we are fighting it's not for not wanting 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.160
 to add also people in friend is that 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.019
 on lol you know that his capped at 300 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.180
 after 300 friends ben it's over 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.370
 the game tell you no he was a failure 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.630
 friends and suddenly we can not I 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.340
 am obliged is what she knows how to speak 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.540
 to keep some good places for for 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.430
 keep players for tournaments 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.470
 for events and so stop it's not 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.500
 obvious so that's why you have to 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.489
 stop asking us this kind of questions 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.350
 it's not that we do not want it 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.640
 often we can not and for the 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.170
 partnership requests the requests of the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.510
 changes dozen cows an ex state it 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.640
 should try to see beforehand if 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.380
 it's possible to try to have a 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.670
 minimum coherence because there are 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.859
 moments we ask ourselves questions on 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.989
 doubs out here I'm reading you I'm the one 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.720

 it's incredible I do not understand taking 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.480
 ask me these kinds of questions to friends 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.340
 to forums via google there was a trick 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.020
 it's like it's exactly like 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.670
 you were in this situation and 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.920
 hello lady baker here I am 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.390
 am going to buy this guitar is there 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.160
 the agreement class and so I come to you 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.860
 you can see me all repaired 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:18.290
 just because I was told you 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.880
 were wanting to handle this was 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.070
 perfectly illogical 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.630
 that's if I made this little video 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.850
 it is to avoid being asked 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.290
 the future the same questions you know 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.730
 that we usually try to answer 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.140
 very often as often as possible 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.280
 whether it's me or sky hard but it's 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.540
 especially on social networks when we 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.070
 leads take a look at youtube 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.690
 we do not have much time and then we have 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.740
 still a lot of requests it's not 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.669
 to stop or whatever but 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.570
 it is true that we have still not bad 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.520
 ask after a while 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.960
 put end to end it does not hurt 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.100
 things here I hope this video 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.600
 you will have liked you will have done at least 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.040
 smile I hope if we put in 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.390
 red sprout to you will be used I 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.890
