setting up for the first time when

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.629 
setting up for the first time when
you're<00:04:23.510> going<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:23.720> use<00:04:23.870> cable<00:04:24.440> there's<00:04:25.400> two

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
you're going to use cable there's two

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.379 
you're going to use cable there's two
different<00:04:26.060> types<00:04:26.360> of<00:04:26.860> scans<00:04:27.860> or<00:04:28.699> channels<00:04:29.210> on

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
different types of scans or channels on

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.250 
different types of scans or channels on
this<00:04:30.370> be<00:04:31.370> sure<00:04:31.639> to<00:04:32.060> use<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.600> one<00:04:32.810> that<00:04:32.840> takes

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
this be sure to use the one that takes

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.409 
this be sure to use the one that takes
the<00:04:33.470> longest<00:04:33.949> and<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:34.400> says<00:04:34.699> it<00:04:34.970> takes<00:04:35.210> the

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
the longest and it says it takes the

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.379 
the longest and it says it takes the
longest<00:04:35.840> on<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.520> menu<00:04:37.520> I<00:04:37.550> can't<00:04:37.970> remember<00:04:38.210> the

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
longest on the menu I can't remember the

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:44.080 
longest on the menu I can't remember the
name<00:04:38.539> of<00:04:38.570> it<00:04:38.900> right<00:04:38.960> offhand<00:04:41.199> because<00:04:42.760> if<00:04:43.760> you

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
name of it right offhand because if you

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.450 
name of it right offhand because if you
use<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.330> short<00:04:44.810> scan<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.620> won't<00:04:45.830> detect<00:04:46.190> into

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
use the short scan it won't detect into

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.379 
use the short scan it won't detect into
digital<00:04:46.940> channels<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:51.820> I<00:04:52.820> guess<00:04:53.240> that's

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
digital channels and I guess that's

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.339 
digital channels and I guess that's
about<00:04:53.510> it<00:04:53.720> for<00:04:53.990> right<00:04:54.169> now<00:04:54.200> I<00:04:56.200> hope<00:04:57.200> you

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
about it for right now I hope you

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.970 
about it for right now I hope you
enjoyed<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.800> video<00:04:57.919> thank<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:58.669> for<00:04:58.760> watching
