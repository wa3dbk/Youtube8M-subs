00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
graphic as a collection and needed a

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.300 
graphic as a collection and needed a
uniformity<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.560> was<00:02:26.680> amazing<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.130> work

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
uniformity so it was amazing to work

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.250 
uniformity so it was amazing to work
with<00:02:27.370> San<00:02:27.610> Tropez<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.090> get<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.660> color<00:02:28.930> and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260

with San Tropez and get the color and
the<00:02:29.290> glow<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:30.069> I<00:02:30.430> think<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.700> lot<00:02:30.850> of<00:02:30.880> those

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the glow and I think a lot of those

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.520 
the glow and I think a lot of those
brocades<00:02:31.450> have<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.840> lot<00:02:32.019> of<00:02:32.050> iridescent

qualities<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.459> think<00:02:33.880> it's<00:02:34.360> important<00:02:34.840> to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
qualities that I think it's important to

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.360 
qualities that I think it's important to
