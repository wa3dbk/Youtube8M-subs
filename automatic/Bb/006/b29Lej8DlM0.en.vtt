00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
something that's really a pet peeve of

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.789 
something that's really a pet peeve of
mine<00:00:10.460> not<00:00:11.460> really<00:00:11.700> like<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.200> pet<00:00:13.200> peeve<00:00:13.469> to

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.770 
mine not really like a pet peeve to
where<00:00:14.009> it'd<00:00:14.400> keep<00:00:14.730> me<00:00:14.790> from<00:00:15.059> playing<00:00:15.120> mad<00:00:15.570> no

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
where it'd keep me from playing mad no

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.760 
where it'd keep me from playing mad no
nothing<00:00:16.109> like<00:00:16.139> that

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
could do a better job with emphasizing

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.179 
could do a better job with emphasizing
natural<00:00:24.779> physics<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.470> position<00:00:28.070> for<00:00:29.070> those

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
natural physics and position for those

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.120 
natural physics and position for those
of<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.670> follow<00:00:30.349> YouTube<00:00:31.349> videos<00:00:31.800> you

I've been trying to truck somebody with
Willie<00:01:24.030> Parker<00:01:24.470> for<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.530> last<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:26.340> two<00:01:27.030> days

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
Willie Parker for the last one two days

Willie Parker for the last one two days
I've<00:01:27.630> had<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:28.020> game<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.640> doesn't

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
I've had this game and it really doesn't

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.730 
I've had this game and it really doesn't
happen<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.420> mean<00:01:30.570> he<00:01:30.689> might<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> light<00:01:31.380> truck

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
happen I mean he might do a light truck

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.830 
happen I mean he might do a light truck
but<00:01:32.490> he<00:01:32.579> never<00:01:32.790> really<00:01:33.060> gets<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.329> benefit<00:01:33.720> of

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
but he never really gets to benefit of

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.770 
but he never really gets to benefit of
the<00:01:33.900> doubt<00:01:34.850> now<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:36.180> you're<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.600> see

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the doubt now as you're going to see

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.700 
the doubt now as you're going to see
with<00:01:36.990> Mendenhall<00:01:37.939> he<00:01:38.939> catches<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.280> defender

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
with Mendenhall he catches the defender

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.140 
with Mendenhall he catches the defender
out<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.979> position<00:01:44.549> let<00:01:44.790> me<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:46.880> for<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.939> looks

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
out of position let me see for the looks

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.200 
out of position let me see for the looks
of<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.540> must<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.869> corners<00:01:49.380> number<00:01:49.680> 20<00:01:50.210> and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
of it it must be a corners number 20 and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.960 
of it it must be a corners number 20 and
he<00:01:52.140> lowers<00:01:52.409> his<00:01:52.530> shoulder<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:55.170> he<00:01:55.500> gets

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
he lowers his shoulder and he gets

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.280 
he lowers his shoulder and he gets
leverage<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.149> position<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.720> and<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> physics

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
leverage and position it and the physics

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.960 
leverage and position it and the physics
take<00:01:58.500> over<00:01:59.030> and<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.750> truck<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.080> successful

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
take over and the truck is successful

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.119 
take over and the truck is successful
take<00:02:02.970> a<00:02:03.000> look

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.130 

all<00:02:09.609> right<00:02:09.909> as<00:02:10.060> I'm<00:02:10.239> turning<00:02:10.629> the<00:02:10.689> corner<00:02:10.899> I

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
all right as I'm turning the corner I

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.839 
all right as I'm turning the corner I
realize<00:02:11.499> I'm<00:02:11.739> not<00:02:11.890> going<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.129> get<00:02:12.310> much<00:02:12.579> more

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
realize I'm not going to get much more

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.589 
realize I'm not going to get much more
yardage<00:02:13.409> so<00:02:14.409> I<00:02:14.469> was<00:02:14.739> lower<00:02:14.950> my<00:02:15.189> head<00:02:15.480> see<00:02:16.480> I'm

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
yardage so I was lower my head see I'm

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.270 
yardage so I was lower my head see I'm
already<00:02:16.840> down<00:02:17.260> look<00:02:17.530> at<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.680> defender<00:02:18.129> he's

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
already down look at the defender he's

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.580 
already down look at the defender he's
still<00:02:18.519> standing<00:02:18.939> straight<00:02:19.180> up<00:02:19.230> I'm<00:02:20.230> already

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
still standing straight up I'm already

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.470 
still standing straight up I'm already
in<00:02:20.769> position<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:22.239> what<00:02:22.420> happens<00:02:22.980> bang<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
in position so what happens bang the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.220 
in position so what happens bang the
defender<00:02:26.019> gets<00:02:26.200> ran<00:02:26.590> over<00:02:29.519> now<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:31.750> my<00:02:32.049> opinion

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
defender gets ran over now in my opinion

running back as well as a linebacker and

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
a strong safety in my opinion you know I

a strong safety in my opinion you know I

disagree<00:02:44.250> that's<00:02:45.250> supposed<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.849> happen<00:02:46.980> that

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
disagree that's supposed to happen that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.970 
disagree that's supposed to happen that
cornerback<00:02:48.609> I<00:02:48.939> mean<00:02:49.599> they<00:02:49.750> might<00:02:50.469> be<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.739> same

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
cornerback I mean they might be the same

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.009 
cornerback I mean they might be the same
size<00:02:51.310> but<00:02:51.549> I<00:02:51.639> doubt<00:02:51.909> he's<00:02:52.209> probably<00:02:52.569> a<00:02:52.750> little

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
size but I doubt he's probably a little

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.039 
size but I doubt he's probably a little
smaller<00:02:53.319> than<00:02:53.699> Mendenhall<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.969> the<00:02:55.750> fact

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
smaller than Mendenhall and the fact

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.629 
smaller than Mendenhall and the fact
that<00:02:56.260> I'm<00:02:56.379> in<00:02:56.409> position<00:02:57.069> and<00:02:57.129> he's<00:02:57.400> still

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
that I'm in position and he's still

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.550 
that I'm in position and he's still
standing<00:02:58.030> straight<00:02:58.269> up<00:02:59.010> that<00:03:00.010> is<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.489> outcome

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
standing straight up that is the outcome

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.860 
standing straight up that is the outcome
and<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.859> love<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.310> fact<00:03:03.549> that<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.299> linebacker

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
and I love the fact that the linebacker

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.170 
and I love the fact that the linebacker
was<00:03:05.109> still<00:03:05.349> trailing<00:03:05.709> on<00:03:05.949> the<00:03:06.040> play<00:03:06.250> so<00:03:07.120> of

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
was still trailing on the play so of

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.949 
was still trailing on the play so of
course<00:03:07.389> he<00:03:07.569> catches<00:03:07.959> me<00:03:08.139> from<00:03:08.349> behind<00:03:09.959> takes

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
course he catches me from behind takes

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.789 
course he catches me from behind takes
me<00:03:11.109> down<00:03:11.969> let's<00:03:12.969> look<00:03:13.180> at<00:03:13.299> that<00:03:13.479> and<00:03:14.379> regular

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799
