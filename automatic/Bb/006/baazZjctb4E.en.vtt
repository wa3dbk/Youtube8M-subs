go there I can see with my lines where

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.270 
go there I can see with my lines where
they're<00:03:13.720> going<00:03:14.110> and<00:03:14.320> I'll<00:03:14.800> even<00:03:14.920> though<00:03:15.130> my

out of my peripheral vision I can see

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.990 
out of my peripheral vision I can see
where<00:03:23.650> my<00:03:23.800> lines<00:03:24.070> are<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.580> will<00:03:24.700> tell<00:03:24.880> me

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
where my lines are that will tell me

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.610 
where my lines are that will tell me
right<00:03:25.209> where<00:03:25.360> my<00:03:25.510> kites<00:03:25.780> out<00:03:25.930> if<00:03:26.080> I<00:03:26.200> need<00:03:26.410> to
