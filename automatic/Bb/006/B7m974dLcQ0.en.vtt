00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.590
 barry is not alone 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.610
 airis goes a lot over there irish 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.120
 is 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.120
 yes 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.990
 I do not know what 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.490
 to 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.490
 basic plaza 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.550
 there are 3 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.550
 neighborhood is in a coma already past page 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.140
 these are the private archives of 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.970
 harrison wells who is the director of 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.880
 laboratories be as you see I am 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.290
 unstoppable I found this is the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.510
 prototype of a new project of 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.980
 biotechnology the patent is lieutenant 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.820
 That's why they did not want to tell us what 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.620
 era and what is a bio transmitter can 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.069
 make blood transfusions of a 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.569
 person multiple patients at a time 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.579
 so you need it is law for nothing 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.290
 but the weights that he pulled from jail on 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.690
 another day to create your personal army 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.010
 yes 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.140
 modifying it is law could use it 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.670
 for the kurÃº look avoiding the huge 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.470
 odds of failure and the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.140
 consequential death instead of 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.240
 metabolize what in the person would be made 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.980
 was for that why you will need a lot of 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.480
 blood not even a name with the 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.490
 power of law could support a 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.060
 loss without better what do you mean 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.530
 I will let you use it will be weak and 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.510
 vulnerable that will give me a chance 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.130
 to kill him as we found that gossip 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.830
 that machine needs a quantity 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.380
 huge amount of electricity when the 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.900
 turn it on 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.600
 for now there are those who replace a lot of 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.170
 wait even knows who slate 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.140
 wilson 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.550
 and why does this do I do not care what I have what 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.530
 I deserve what you deserve 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.450
 you think that sleeping with my father gives you 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.250
 right to wrest the company away 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.870
 you have no idea what you're talking about and 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.340
 no radio with a lot of girls and I do not see 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.790
 no other organizing hostile opas 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.849
 in roll 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.329
 that's what your mother told you was 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:45.000
 the average orange of your father he thought 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.329
 let your mother leave the company and 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.560
 we had packed our bags 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.420
 then your sister broke an arm 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.030
 doing some stupidity without a doubt 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.650
 he fell off the horse we were in the 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.360
 airport when they called him 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.560
 I begged that he did not leave I reminded him that 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.560
 It was not even his 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.550
 then my father knew 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.040
 Of course it would be silly but not 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.380
 I was an idiot and I loved her because I was 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.600
 bobo promised that we would go daily 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.280
 next but instead canceled my 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.769
 contract and did not address me again 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.820
 word never why are you doing 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.880
 All this 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.060
 because he chose us I talked to 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:33.310
 felicity someone has called arrow wants 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.310
 see who cries 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:41.600
 you have always been there for me 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.670
 in my family and I do not know why I've never 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.670
 asked the reason do not ask now 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.500
 it is not necessary because I already know the 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.500
 answer
