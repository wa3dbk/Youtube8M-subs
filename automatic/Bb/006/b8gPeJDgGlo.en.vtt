00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
intelliscreenx so let's go ahead and get

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.740 
intelliscreenx so let's go ahead and get
on<00:00:06.720> into<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.109> video

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.720 

so<00:00:14.750> as<00:00:14.900> you<00:00:15.020> can<00:00:15.110> see<00:00:15.290> on<00:00:15.500> my<00:00:15.590> iPhone<00:00:16.190> for<00:00:16.520> that

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
so as you can see on my iPhone for that

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.760 
so as you can see on my iPhone for that
we<00:00:16.820> have<00:00:16.940> intelliscreenx<00:00:17.480> loaded<00:00:18.410> up<00:00:18.590> in

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
we have intelliscreenx loaded up in

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.230 
we have intelliscreenx loaded up in
cydia<00:00:19.430> and<00:00:19.670> this<00:00:20.420> tweak<00:00:20.660> goes<00:00:20.840> for<00:00:21.050> 9<00:00:21.260> 99<00:00:21.560> a

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
cydia and this tweak goes for 9 99 a

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.060 
cydia and this tweak goes for 9 99 a
actually<00:00:23.240> quite<00:00:23.570> a<00:00:23.600> price<00:00:24.050> eval<00:00:24.439> price<00:00:24.770> range

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
actually quite a price eval price range

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.019 
actually quite a price eval price range
and<00:00:25.750> so<00:00:26.750> this<00:00:27.080> tweak<00:00:27.410> does<00:00:27.619> a<00:00:27.770> lot<00:00:28.099> but<00:00:28.700> it<00:00:28.790> is

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
and so this tweak does a lot but it is

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.089 
and so this tweak does a lot but it is
ten<00:00:29.450> dollars<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.110> you're<00:00:30.529> kind<00:00:30.740> of<00:00:30.770> going<00:00:30.860> to

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.790 
more features so once you're at the home
screen<00:00:41.390> you<00:00:41.510> can<00:00:41.600> see<00:00:41.780> that<00:00:42.020> there<00:00:42.410> is<00:00:42.440> a<00:00:42.560> much

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
screen you can see that there is a much

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.110 
screen you can see that there is a much
different<00:00:42.829> but<00:00:43.430> you<00:00:43.550> can<00:00:43.670> see<00:00:43.820> that<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.000> have

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
different but you can see that you have

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.389 
different but you can see that you have
the<00:00:44.270> intelliscreenx<00:00:44.719> icons<00:00:45.440> that<00:00:45.949> allows<00:00:46.160> you

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
the intelliscreenx icons that allows you

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.130 
the intelliscreenx icons that allows you
to<00:00:46.640> configure<00:00:46.879> settings<00:00:47.300> which<00:00:47.629> will<00:00:47.840> look<00:00:48.020> at

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
to configure settings which will look at

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.290 
to configure settings which will look at
later<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.460> we're<00:00:49.579> just<00:00:49.609> going<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:49.969> go
