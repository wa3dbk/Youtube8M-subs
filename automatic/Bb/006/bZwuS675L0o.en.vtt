yeah<00:01:19.890> let's<00:01:20.100> talk<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.549> why<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.119> you

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
yeah let's talk about that why do you

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.300 
yeah let's talk about that why do you
think<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.509> he<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.200> improving<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:23.040> no

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
think that he is not improving on no

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.179 
think that he is not improving on no
child<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.780> fact<00:01:24.810> he<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.500> punishing

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
child and that in fact he is punishing

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.490 
child and that in fact he is punishing
teachers<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.909> basically<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:28.080> down<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
teachers and basically going down the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.319 
teachers and basically going down the
wrong<00:01:28.590> track<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.729> he's<00:01:29.880> going<00:01:30.090> down<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
wrong track I think he's going down the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.999 
wrong track I think he's going down the
wrong<00:01:30.479> track<00:01:30.689> because<00:01:31.079> he's<00:01:31.259> still<00:01:31.470> too<00:01:31.740> tied

they're enrolling very low performing

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800 
they're enrolling very low performing
students<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:51.030> President<00:01:51.390> Obama<00:01:51.450> is

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
students so what President Obama is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.590 
students so what President Obama is
proposing<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.700> have<00:01:53.700> threats<00:01:54.299> and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
proposing is to have threats and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.580 
proposing is to have threats and
punishments<00:01:55.170> towards<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
punishments towards the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.410 
punishments towards the
lowest-performing<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.549> close<00:01:56.790> them<00:01:57.030> down<00:01:57.180> to

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
lowest-performing to close them down to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.899 
lowest-performing to close them down to
fire<00:01:57.630> their<00:01:57.840> staff<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:59.159> think<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.579> it

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
fire their staff and I think that it

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.370 
fire their staff and I think that it
would<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.240> better<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.570> instead<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.990> taking

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
would be better if instead of taking

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.289 
would be better if instead of taking
this<00:02:01.469> punitive<00:02:01.829> approach<00:02:02.189> he<00:02:03.000> would<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
this punitive approach he would have a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.930 
this punitive approach he would have a
program<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:04.079> go<00:02:04.439> to

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
program to go to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.700 
program to go to
have<00:02:05.090> an<00:02:05.240> inspection<00:02:05.630> team<00:02:06.080> go<00:02:06.230> to<00:02:06.290> each<00:02:06.500> one

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
have an inspection team go to each one

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.230 
have an inspection team go to each one
of<00:02:06.740> those<00:02:06.890> schools<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.490> say<00:02:07.640> what<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.119> the

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
of those schools and say what is the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.730 
of those schools and say what is the
problem<00:02:08.510> there's<00:02:09.140> going<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.320> be<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.410> different

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
problem there's going to be a different

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.740 
problem there's going to be a different
problem<00:02:09.920> for<00:02:10.250> every<00:02:10.460> school<00:02:10.760> don't<00:02:11.420> turn<00:02:11.570> it

turn it into a charter school or give it

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.440 
turn it into a charter school or give it

over to private management but instead

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.630 
over to private management but instead
try<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.780> fix<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.260> problems<00:02:18.710> I<00:02:18.890> think<00:02:19.460> that

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
try to fix the problems I think that

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.050 
try to fix the problems I think that
education<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:21.580> profession<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.670> helping

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
education is a profession of helping

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.660 
education is a profession of helping
developing<00:02:23.990> improving<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.070> supporting<00:02:25.550> not

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
developing improving and supporting not

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.400 
developing improving and supporting not
a<00:02:25.700> punishing<00:02:26.270> profession<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:26.960> I<00:02:27.020> think<00:02:27.260> that

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
a punishing profession and I think that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.870 
a punishing profession and I think that
what<00:02:27.560> he<00:02:27.740> should<00:02:27.920> do<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.190> help<00:02:28.400> these<00:02:28.580> schools

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
what he should do is help these schools

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.910 
what he should do is help these schools
not<00:02:29.090> punish<00:02:29.450> them<00:02:29.630> well<00:02:30.500> here<00:02:30.680> is<00:02:30.770> the

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
saying here the problem is that the

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.300 
saying here the problem is that the
proposal<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.320> he's<00:03:12.500> come<00:03:12.680> up<00:03:12.800> with<00:03:12.980> which<00:03:13.160> in

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
proposal that he's come up with which in

many ways improves on no child left

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.449 
many ways improves on no child left
behind<00:03:14.930> because<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.560> removes<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.040> penalties

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
behind because it removes the penalties
