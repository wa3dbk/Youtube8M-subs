00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
case at the same time so that's a good

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.920 
case at the same time so that's a good
thing

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.300 

I<00:01:05.550> don't<00:01:06.550> know<00:01:06.640> why<00:01:06.910> they<00:01:07.270> would<00:01:07.450> give<00:01:07.720> you

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
I don't know why they would give you

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.340 
I don't know why they would give you
another<00:01:11.130> microUSB<00:01:12.130> but<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:13.630> is<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:13.870> separate

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
another microUSB but this is a separate

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.270 
another microUSB but this is a separate
one<00:01:14.470> I<00:01:14.530> guess<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.880> see<00:01:16.120> this<00:01:16.150> part<00:01:16.660> here<00:01:17.280> they

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
one I guess you see this part here they

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.670 
one I guess you see this part here they
make<00:01:18.550> it<00:01:18.760> longer<00:01:19.120> because<00:01:19.750> if<00:01:19.930> you<00:01:20.110> use<00:01:20.350> your

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
make it longer because if you use your

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.710 
make it longer because if you use your
regular<00:01:21.600> samsung<00:01:23.610> charger<00:01:24.610> kit<00:01:24.910> they're

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
regular samsung charger kit they're

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.850 
regular samsung charger kit they're
shorter<00:01:26.500> so<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.970> won't<00:01:28.360> fit<00:01:28.869> into<00:01:29.200> this<00:01:29.560> the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
shorter so it won't fit into this the

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.730 
shorter so it won't fit into this the
right<00:01:30.070> way<00:01:30.310> with<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:31.330> stock<00:01:31.869> charger<00:01:32.500> for<00:01:32.710> the

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
right way with the stock charger for the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.200 
right way with the stock charger for the
samsung<00:01:33.570> s3<00:01:34.570> so<00:01:35.500> that's<00:01:36.400> why<00:01:36.670> they<00:01:36.820> give<00:01:37.060> you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
samsung s3 so that's why they give you

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.389 
samsung s3 so that's why they give you
this<00:01:37.360> because<00:01:38.110> it's<00:01:38.380> long<00:01:38.680> and<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:38.950> fits<00:01:39.220> in

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
this because it's long and it fits in

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.700 
this because it's long and it fits in
perfect<00:01:39.970> because<00:01:40.600> if<00:01:40.810> you<00:01:40.960> use<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.140> regular

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
perfect because if you use the regular

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.030 
perfect because if you use the regular
ones<00:01:41.890> for<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.330> s3<00:01:43.330> it'll<00:01:44.200> keep<00:01:44.380> popping<00:01:44.920> out

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
ones for the s3 it'll keep popping out

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.700 
ones for the s3 it'll keep popping out
and<00:01:45.250> getting<00:01:45.490> loose<00:01:45.700> but<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.960> usual<00:01:47.350> so<00:01:47.560> it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710
