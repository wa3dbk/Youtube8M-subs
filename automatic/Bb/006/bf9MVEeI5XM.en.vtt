hi<00:00:04.720> Sammy<00:00:05.470> I<00:00:05.800> won't<00:00:06.310> show<00:00:06.640> you<00:00:06.700> just<00:00:07.509> how<00:00:07.660> easy

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:07.750 
hi Sammy I won't show you just how easy

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.080 
hi Sammy I won't show you just how easy
it<00:00:08.109> is<00:00:08.230> to<00:00:08.530> use<00:00:08.680> a<00:00:08.710> SodaStream<00:00:09.160> machine<00:00:09.429> and

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.090 
it is to use a SodaStream machine and

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.820 
it is to use a SodaStream machine and
we're<00:00:10.780> going<00:00:10.929> to<00:00:10.960> start<00:00:11.200> by<00:00:11.349> putting<00:00:11.530> in<00:00:11.710> the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
we're going to start by putting in the

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.340 
we're going to start by putting in the
co2<00:00:12.280> cannister<00:00:12.970> you're<00:00:13.660> going<00:00:13.810> to<00:00:13.870> take<00:00:14.110> the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.350 
co2 cannister you're going to take the

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.800 
co2 cannister you're going to take the
back<00:00:14.590> off<00:00:14.950> of<00:00:15.580> the<00:00:15.700> machine<00:00:15.820> just<00:00:16.689> by

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
back off of the machine just by

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.170 
back off of the machine just by
squeezing<00:00:17.050> it<00:00:17.380> on<00:00:17.500> the<00:00:17.619> sides<00:00:17.920> now<00:00:18.880> you<00:00:18.939> bring

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
squeezing it on the sides now you bring

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.470 
squeezing it on the sides now you bring
the<00:00:19.359> co2<00:00:19.659> can<00:00:20.019> scrub<00:00:20.380> through<00:00:20.409> the<00:00:20.949> bottom<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
the co2 can scrub through the bottom and

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.079 
the co2 can scrub through the bottom and
then<00:00:23.199> it's<00:00:23.470> threaded<00:00:24.130> at<00:00:24.310> the<00:00:24.460> top<00:00:24.730> so<00:00:24.970> you

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.089 
then it's threaded at the top so you

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:29.130 
then it's threaded at the top so you
just<00:00:25.329> throw<00:00:27.060> until<00:00:28.060> it's<00:00:28.210> tight

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
just throw until it's tight

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.649 
just throw until it's tight
now<00:00:30.039> I'll<00:00:30.189> replace<00:00:30.489> the<00:00:30.789> back<00:00:31.060> there's<00:00:31.599> a

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:31.659 
now I'll replace the back there's a

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.330 
now I'll replace the back there's a
little<00:00:31.899> notch<00:00:32.140> that<00:00:32.169> you<00:00:32.680> got<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:33.010> bottom

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
little notch that you got the bottom

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.520 
little notch that you got the bottom
into<00:00:33.640> it<00:00:33.820> and<00:00:34.390> then<00:00:34.570> it<00:00:34.690> just<00:00:34.720> snaps<00:00:35.260> into

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
into it and then it just snaps into

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.680 
into it and then it just snaps into
place<00:00:35.710> so<00:00:36.670> now<00:00:36.850> we're<00:00:37.030> ready<00:00:37.149> to<00:00:37.300> actually

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
button on the top of the machine you

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.210 
button on the top of the machine you
want<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:20.890> hear<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.100> buzz<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:23.760> short<00:01:24.760> bursts

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
want to hear a buzz so short bursts

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.050 
want to hear a buzz so short bursts
there's<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.400> buzz<00:01:27.580> we're<00:01:27.760> going<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:27.940> do<00:01:28.000> it

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
there's the buzz we're going to do it

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.800 
there's the buzz we're going to do it
two<00:01:28.150> more<00:01:28.270> times<00:01:29.760> because<00:01:30.760> three<00:01:31.330> buzzes

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
two more times because three buzzes

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.140 
two more times because three buzzes
gives<00:01:32.080> you<00:01:32.290> approximately<00:01:32.670> how<00:01:33.670> much<00:01:33.850> fizz

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
gives you approximately how much fizz

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.490 
gives you approximately how much fizz
you<00:01:34.180> won't<00:01:34.540> of<00:01:34.690> course<00:01:34.720> you<00:01:34.960> can<00:01:35.080> always<00:01:35.320> do

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
you won't of course you can always do

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.540 
you won't of course you can always do
more<00:01:35.530> or<00:01:35.830> less<00:01:36.040> spinning<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:39.070> you<00:01:39.130> unscrew

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
more or less spinning now you unscrew

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.210 
more or less spinning now you unscrew
the<00:01:39.790> bottle<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.500> now<00:01:41.650> it's<00:01:41.800> time<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.040> add<00:01:42.190> the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
the bottle and now it's time to add the

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.700 
the bottle and now it's time to add the
syrup<00:01:42.610> it's<00:01:42.910> super<00:01:43.480> important<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.290> add<00:01:44.470> the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
syrup it's super important to add the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.470 
syrup it's super important to add the
syrup<00:01:44.920> after<00:01:45.490> you've<00:01:45.670> carbonated<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.270> water

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
syrup after you've carbonated the water

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.710 
syrup after you've carbonated the water
if<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:47.470> put<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.770> syrup<00:01:48.100> in<00:01:48.280> first<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:49.030> will

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
if you put the syrup in first it will

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.240 
if you put the syrup in first it will
explode

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
explode

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.400 
explode
and<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:51.700> will<00:01:51.850> make<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.060> huge<00:01:52.390> mess<00:01:52.570> it<00:01:52.840> probably

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
and it will make a huge mess it probably

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.680 
and it will make a huge mess it probably
won't<00:01:53.590> break<00:01:53.770> anything<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.790> she<00:01:55.360> will<00:01:55.510> still

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
won't break anything and she will still

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.880 
won't break anything and she will still
work<00:01:55.780> after<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.260> but<00:01:56.380> you'll<00:01:56.530> have<00:01:56.620> a<00:01:56.680> huge

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
work after that but you'll have a huge

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.750 
work after that but you'll have a huge
