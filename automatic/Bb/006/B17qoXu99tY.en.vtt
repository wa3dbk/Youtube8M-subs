00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello everyone, how are you? 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.779
 super super good I'm tatiana uribe 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.120
 compass dot fashion and I'm 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.639
 super happy to welcome you to a 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.469
 new video where on Thursdays the video of 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.030
 Today I'm going to give you some tips about 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.100
 what can we do so that when we 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.810
 take the afternoon that usually happens to us 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.000
 very much and more to us as women 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.890
 or good I think that to all that we give 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.109
 postpone and postpone and postpone to the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.630
 alarm then let's see how we can 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.429
 to optimize our time in the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.230
 mornings do not forget that you can not continue 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.239
 in my social networks that as always 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.550
 I leave it in the information box 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.500
 from the bottom on facebook twitter 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.390
 and instagram where you find me as 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.329
 compass of fashion and that I wait for you in my 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.329
 blog www.burladero.com 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.570
 the first clip is that it is very important 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.340
 that we always create our look to 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.829
 through a garment then by 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.199
 example I choose a trouser one day 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.300
 green and I know that on that pants I'm going 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.649
 to do all my full look or for 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.449
 example we can also do them 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.190
 around a necklace then we say 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.500
 Well today I want to wear this necklace 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.050
 and then we started looking for all the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.270
 elements then first type always 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.270
 create the look with a fundamental piece 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.990
 the second advice I can give you is 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.700
 that planning is very important in 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.729
 everything we do as we are 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.829
 watching in the video a few days ago is 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.479
 fundamental that we always have written 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.520
 what we have to do or have 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.380
 our organized life so that the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.569
 reach us and we are not like 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.729
 the races without knowing what to do with the 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.679
 clothes is the same then I for example 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.600
 every day at night I plan what 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.179
 I 'm going to put the next day 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.890
 so if he takes me the afternoon to the next day already 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.899
 I know I 'm going to wear it because many 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.939
 Sometimes it happened to me that I did not plan the clothes 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.830
 I had class at six in the morning 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.780
 I woke up super late and then I 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.520
 ended up putting dirty things or that 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.920
 they were happy or things without ironing 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.259
 So the truth is, we do not want to leave 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.060
 to the street and it's very rich that everyone already 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.770
 we have very planned so that the other 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.610
 day is not what we wear and ready 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.610
 we are divine 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.260
 the third type is that we have very clear 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.300
 what are our basic clothes 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.700
 because from that we can also 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.890
 create different looks and very creative 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.380
 for example one day use a shirt 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.330
 white and put a colorful scarf 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.520
 and another day a necklace another day to put 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.260
 a jacket and so we're always going to 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.480
 see different but with basic clothes 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.250
 that we have in our closet and 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.690
 remember that I have a video of 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.240
 what are the essential basics 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.310
 for us and I leave the links here 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.660
 at the bottom to be seen and 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.660
 put it into practice 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.280
 another thing that I find very cool is 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.319
 that we can keep our looks and 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.300
 be our cell phone or on our ipad or 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.980
 in the computer where we want and 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.080
 then when we have a chance 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.940
 special and we are not inspired by how 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.980
 we are going to dress we can search 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.080
 our list of favorite looks and so 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.670
 recreate one that we already did then by 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.010
 example I have a folder in my 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.290
 cellular and every day when I get dressed 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.930
 in a way that I like a lot I take 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.239
 a photo like that kind of celtics and simple sencillita 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.580
 I keep it in my folder and there always 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.200
 later when I do not know what to wear or have 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.690
 very hot then I know I can 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.069
 search there and find options that in 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.540
 that moment as I am like so 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.540
 blocked do not occur to me 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.760
 and finally I also recommend that 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.310
 we organize our bag from the day 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.200
 previous because we know what activities 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.240
 we will have and we will always have 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.770
 our bag organized and that is not 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.560
 as well as the 'Bermuda triangle' 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.510
 of the female bag, but not with 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.760
 organized appointments we know where the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.950
 we have and that if we lack something we have 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.600
 time to think and look that already 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.790
 after the other day we are not going to 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.680
 be without the keys or without the cell phone or 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.300
 the makeup or what they have to wear 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.640
 then super good we have it 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.620
 organized from the previous day to 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.750
 that we have time to look at what we 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.459
 lack that we have and that definitely 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.980
 we do not have to carry in the bag to 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.630
 that we walk more free of good luggage 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.160
 this has been all for today's video 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.260
 I hope you liked it very much 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.300
 that they put it into practice and that 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.310
 tell how they are doing with these tips 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.200
 that are very basic and that since 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.910
 many of you knew and to which 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.620
 no it is a way in which all 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.840
 we can share and if you have 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.760
