so<00:00:03.020> a<00:00:03.050> little<00:00:03.350> bit<00:00:03.500> more<00:00:03.679> detail<00:00:04.040> on<00:00:04.069> cork<00:00:04.490> now

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:04.640 
so a little bit more detail on cork now

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.700 
so a little bit more detail on cork now
cork<00:00:05.090> is<00:00:05.270> actually<00:00:05.660> the<00:00:05.779> bark<00:00:06.109> from<00:00:06.290> a<00:00:06.440> cork

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
cork is actually the bark from a cork

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.090 
cork is actually the bark from a cork
oak<00:00:06.920> tree<00:00:07.250> when<00:00:07.819> a<00:00:07.850> cork<00:00:08.120> oak<00:00:08.270> tree<00:00:08.600> gets<00:00:09.020> to<00:00:09.980> be

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.100 
oak tree when a cork oak tree gets to be

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.010 
oak tree when a cork oak tree gets to be
of<00:00:10.280> a<00:00:10.369> proper<00:00:10.730> age<00:00:10.940> you<00:00:11.389> can<00:00:11.539> actually<00:00:11.660> peel

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.020 
of a proper age you can actually peel

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.379 
of a proper age you can actually peel
50%<00:00:12.799> of<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:12.949> Clarks<00:00:13.430> off<00:00:13.580> of<00:00:13.789> the<00:00:13.879> oak<00:00:14.119> tree

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
50% of the Clarks off of the oak tree

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.810 
50% of the Clarks off of the oak tree
without<00:00:15.350> harming<00:00:15.799> the<00:00:15.920> tree<00:00:16.160> at<00:00:16.279> all<00:00:16.369> in<00:00:16.670> fact

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
without harming the tree at all in fact

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.700 
without harming the tree at all in fact
it's<00:00:17.060> a<00:00:17.090> very<00:00:17.119> highly<00:00:17.449> regulated<00:00:17.840> process<00:00:18.290> in

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
it's a very highly regulated process in

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.920 
it's a very highly regulated process in
Spain<00:00:18.950> and<00:00:19.130> Portugal<00:00:19.280> now<00:00:20.180> once<00:00:20.450> you<00:00:20.540> peel<00:00:20.780> the

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
Spain and Portugal now once you peel the

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.840 
Spain and Portugal now once you peel the
cork<00:00:21.200> off<00:00:21.410> you<00:00:21.950> can<00:00:22.100> actually<00:00:22.370> cut<00:00:22.580> it<00:00:22.670> into

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
cork off you can actually cut it into

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.580 
cork off you can actually cut it into
strips<00:00:23.180> and<00:00:23.510> then<00:00:23.600> you<00:00:23.660> punch<00:00:23.930> the<00:00:24.050> wine<00:00:24.230> corks

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
strips and then you punch the wine corks

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.080 
strips and then you punch the wine corks
out<00:00:24.770> of<00:00:24.890> it<00:00:25.010> then<00:00:25.610> when<00:00:25.789> you're<00:00:25.910> done<00:00:26.030> with

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
out of it then when you're done with

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.730 
out of it then when you're done with
that<00:00:26.240> you<00:00:26.510> take<00:00:26.690> all<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.020> rest<00:00:27.170> of<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:27.470> cork

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
that you take all the rest of the cork

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.990 
that you take all the rest of the cork
and<00:00:27.860> grind<00:00:28.220> it<00:00:28.340> up<00:00:28.430> and<00:00:28.610> you<00:00:28.670> make<00:00:28.820> it<00:00:28.940> into

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
and grind it up and you make it into

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.029 
and grind it up and you make it into
flooring<00:00:29.510> so<00:00:30.110> it's<00:00:30.260> actually<00:00:30.410> a<00:00:30.590> naturally

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
flooring so it's actually a naturally

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.760 
flooring so it's actually a naturally
naturally<00:00:32.000> renewable<00:00:32.599> process<00:00:33.170> and<00:00:33.649> it's

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
naturally renewable process and it's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.960 
naturally renewable process and it's
something<00:00:33.920> that<00:00:34.039> doesn't<00:00:34.370> harm<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:34.670> tree<00:00:34.700> you

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
something that doesn't harm the tree you

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.420 
something that doesn't harm the tree you
can<00:00:35.120> actually<00:00:35.270> get<00:00:35.540> 12<00:00:35.840> to<00:00:35.989> 15<00:00:36.470> different

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
can actually get 12 to 15 different

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.979 
can actually get 12 to 15 different
cycles<00:00:37.940> out<00:00:38.090> of<00:00:38.210> a<00:00:38.270> cork<00:00:38.570> tree<00:00:38.750> in<00:00:38.870> its

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
cycles out of a cork tree in its

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:40.500 
cycles out of a cork tree in its
lifetime<00:00:39.470> which<00:00:39.620> is<00:00:39.770> over<00:00:39.980> a<00:00:40.010> hundred<00:00:40.310> years

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
lifetime which is over a hundred years

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.330 
lifetime which is over a hundred years
cork<00:00:41.510> has<00:00:41.660> been<00:00:41.930> in<00:00:42.230> installations<00:00:43.130> in

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
cork has been in installations in

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.069 
cork has been in installations in
churches<00:00:43.880> and<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.180> Library<00:00:44.510> of<00:00:44.540> Congress

lots<00:00:45.320> of<00:00:45.410> other<00:00:45.590> places<00:00:45.710> for<00:00:46.160> over<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.430> hundred

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
lots of other places for over a hundred

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.340 
lots of other places for over a hundred
years<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.970> same<00:00:47.270> floor<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.140> it's<00:00:48.260> an

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
years the same floor so it's an

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.160 
years the same floor so it's an
extremely<00:00:48.649> durable<00:00:49.070> product<00:00:50.059> as<00:00:50.210> well<00:00:50.420> now

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
extremely durable product as well now

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.020 
extremely durable product as well now
when<00:00:51.500> you<00:00:51.620> get<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:51.950> cork<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:52.460> can<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:52.850> can

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
when you get the cork you can you can

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.270 
when you get the cork you can you can
get<00:00:53.180> in<00:00:53.329> two<00:00:53.540> different<00:00:53.870> methods<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:55.010> can<00:00:55.160> get

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
get in two different methods you can get

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.819 
get in two different methods you can get
it<00:00:55.370> as<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.489> glue<00:00:55.850> down<00:00:56.030> tile<00:00:56.540> which<00:00:57.500> is<00:00:57.649> about

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
it as a glue down tile which is about

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.639 
it as a glue down tile which is about
this<00:00:58.070> thick<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:58.670> can<00:00:58.820> see<00:00:59.090> or<00:00:59.840> you<00:01:00.200> can<00:01:00.379> get<00:01:00.530> it

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
this thick you can see or you can get it

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.639 
this thick you can see or you can get it
in<00:01:00.800> planks<00:01:01.489> or<00:01:01.670> tiles<00:01:02.270> that<00:01:02.780> click<00:01:03.200> together

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
in planks or tiles that click together

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.380 
in planks or tiles that click together
like<00:01:03.950> traditional<00:01:04.430> click<00:01:04.759> flooring<00:01:05.239> or

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
like traditional click flooring or

like traditional click flooring or
Peugeot<00:01:05.750> tape<00:01:05.960> flooring<00:01:06.409> now<00:01:07.509> one<00:01:08.509> of<00:01:08.539> the

Peugeot tape flooring now one of the

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.809 
Peugeot tape flooring now one of the
important<00:01:09.229> things<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:09.469> know<00:01:09.950> about<00:01:09.979> this<00:01:10.579> and

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:10.819 
important things to know about this and

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:13.449 
important things to know about this and
try<00:01:11.329> to<00:01:11.389> decide<00:01:11.840> which<00:01:12.109> to<00:01:12.319> get<00:01:12.499> is<00:01:12.740> what<00:01:13.310> type

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:13.459 
try to decide which to get is what type

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.520 
try to decide which to get is what type
of<00:01:13.579> floor<00:01:13.819> are<00:01:13.939> you<00:01:13.969> putting<00:01:14.299> it<00:01:14.389> onto<00:01:14.719> if<00:01:15.289> it's

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
of floor are you putting it onto if it's

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.099 
of floor are you putting it onto if it's
a<00:01:15.649> very<00:01:15.829> new<00:01:16.280> floor<00:01:16.670> or<00:01:16.909> a<00:01:16.939> perfect<00:01:17.539> floor<00:01:17.869> then

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:18.109 
a very new floor or a perfect floor then

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:19.449 
a very new floor or a perfect floor then
you<00:01:18.229> can<00:01:18.380> get<00:01:18.529> away<00:01:18.619> with<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:18.979> glue<00:01:19.249> down

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:19.459 
you can get away with a glue down

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:21.370 
you can get away with a glue down
without<00:01:19.670> much<00:01:20.209> of<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.420> problem<00:01:20.689> or<00:01:20.899> if<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.259> can

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
without much of a problem or if you can

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.199 
without much of a problem or if you can
float<00:01:21.679> out<00:01:21.829> the<00:01:22.039> floor<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.490> get<00:01:22.579> a<00:01:22.609> very<00:01:22.819> level

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:23.209 
float out the floor and get a very level

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:25.120 
float out the floor and get a very level
surface<00:01:23.689> you<00:01:24.170> can<00:01:24.319> do<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.529> glue<00:01:24.740> down<00:01:24.920> and

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
surface you can do the glue down and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.910 
surface you can do the glue down and
that's<00:01:25.249> a<00:01:25.340> great<00:01:25.609> option<00:01:26.090> but<00:01:27.049> if<00:01:27.289> you're<00:01:27.619> if

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
that's a great option but if you're if

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.410 
that's a great option but if you're if
you're<00:01:27.950> actually<00:01:28.639> have<00:01:28.789> a<00:01:28.819> floor<00:01:29.209> that's

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
you're actually have a floor that's

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.599 
you're actually have a floor that's
maybe<00:01:29.600> not<00:01:29.719> so<00:01:30.200> perfect<00:01:30.529> then<00:01:31.189> you<00:01:31.219> might<00:01:31.429> want

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
maybe not so perfect then you might want

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:32.830 
maybe not so perfect then you might want
to<00:01:31.670> look<00:01:31.789> at<00:01:31.939> the<00:01:32.029> Kliq<00:01:32.299> flooring<00:01:32.719> because

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
to look at the Kliq flooring because

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.179 
to look at the Kliq flooring because
essentially<00:01:33.469> what<00:01:33.619> you're<00:01:33.740> doing<00:01:33.799> is<00:01:34.069> you're

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
essentially what you're doing is you're

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.010 
essentially what you're doing is you're
kind<00:01:34.369> of<00:01:34.399> floating<00:01:34.849> the<00:01:35.179> floor<00:01:35.479> over<00:01:35.749> the

kind of floating the floor over the

kind of floating the floor over the
imperfections<00:01:36.799> now<00:01:37.609> when<00:01:37.819> you<00:01:37.909> get<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.299> which

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
imperfections now when you get to which

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.929 
imperfections now when you get to which
rooms<00:01:39.349> to<00:01:39.590> use<00:01:39.829> it<00:01:39.979> in<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:40.310> can<00:01:40.429> actually<00:01:40.609> use

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
rooms to use it in you can actually use

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.089 
rooms to use it in you can actually use
cork<00:01:41.329> in<00:01:41.450> any<00:01:41.599> room<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.959> the<00:01:42.020> house<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.560> few

cork in any room of the house a few

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:44.980 
cork in any room of the house a few
things<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.459> keep<00:01:43.609> in<00:01:43.759> mind<00:01:43.999> though<00:01:44.209> if<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.810> are

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
things to keep in mind though if you are

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.389 
things to keep in mind though if you are
doing<00:01:45.289> something<00:01:45.529> that's<00:01:45.829> gonna<00:01:45.919> have<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.159> lot

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
doing something that's gonna have a lot

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.569 
doing something that's gonna have a lot
of<00:01:46.429> wet<00:01:47.469> aspects<00:01:48.469> to<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.709> like<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:49.189> bathroom

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
of wet aspects to it like a bathroom

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.149 
of wet aspects to it like a bathroom
floor<00:01:49.819> or<00:01:50.209> a<00:01:50.539> laundry<00:01:50.899> room<00:01:51.169> then<00:01:52.009> you

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
floor or a laundry room then you

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.919 
floor or a laundry room then you
probably<00:01:52.459> want<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:52.909> stick<00:01:53.149> with<00:01:53.179> a<00:01:53.299> glue<00:01:53.689> down

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
probably want to stick with a glue down

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.469 
probably want to stick with a glue down
rather<00:01:54.259> than<00:01:54.469> doing<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.639> click<00:01:55.909> flooring<00:01:56.329> and

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
rather than doing the click flooring and

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.179 
rather than doing the click flooring and
that's<00:01:56.599> mainly<00:01:56.899> because<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.590> click<00:01:57.829> flooring

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
that's mainly because the click flooring

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.449 
that's mainly because the click flooring
has<00:01:58.579> MDF<00:01:59.270> in<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.719> center<00:02:00.079> of<00:02:00.109> it<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.529> if<00:02:01.189> any

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
has MDF in the center of it and if any

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.459 
has MDF in the center of it and if any
water<00:02:01.700> ever<00:02:02.029> gets<00:02:02.389> in<00:02:02.569> the<00:02:02.689> seams<00:02:03.169> they're

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
water ever gets in the seams they're

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.469 
water ever gets in the seams they're
very<00:02:03.649> tight<00:02:03.919> seams<00:02:04.310> but<00:02:04.639> if<00:02:04.849> any<00:02:04.999> water<00:02:05.179> gets

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
very tight seams but if any water gets

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.449 
very tight seams but if any water gets
in<00:02:05.659> there<00:02:05.689> you<00:02:06.229> might<00:02:06.409> get<00:02:06.560> swelling<00:02:06.919> of<00:02:07.279> the

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
in there you might get swelling of the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.620 
in there you might get swelling of the
MDF<00:02:07.999> and<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:08.390> you

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
MDF and so you

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.390 
MDF and so you
want<00:02:09.020> that<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:09.830> want<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.040> stick<00:02:10.220> with<00:02:10.250> a

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
want that so you want to stick with a

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.790 
want that so you want to stick with a
glue<00:02:10.640> down<00:02:10.790> in<00:02:11.030> those<00:02:11.150> types<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.660> areas<00:02:11.990> if<00:02:12.530> you

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
glue down in those types of areas if you

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.040 
glue down in those types of areas if you
can<00:02:13.280> if<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:13.640> can't<00:02:14.000> then<00:02:14.570> you<00:02:14.660> want<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.900> put

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
can if you can't then you want to put

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.930 
can if you can't then you want to put
another<00:02:15.410> additional<00:02:16.010> coat<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.370> sealer<00:02:16.790> over

another additional coat of sealer over

another additional coat of sealer over
the<00:02:17.360> floor<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:17.840> order<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.290> seal<00:02:18.620> all<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:18.980> those

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
the floor in order to seal all of those

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.710 
the floor in order to seal all of those
seams<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.730> make<00:02:19.880> sure<00:02:20.000> their<00:02:20.150> water<00:02:20.330> does<00:02:20.540> not

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720

get<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.350> between<00:02:21.740> there<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.130> when<00:02:23.060> you're

choosing<00:02:23.180> cork

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
choosing cork

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.900

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
put it in in order to make a correct

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.690 
put it in in order to make a correct
decision<00:02:39.260> as<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.560> how<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.890> color<00:02:40.220> looks<00:02:40.520> and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
decision as to how the color looks and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.760 
decision as to how the color looks and
the<00:02:40.760> style<00:02:41.030> looks<00:02:41.360> in<00:02:41.810> different<00:02:42.080> lights<00:02:42.500> and

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
the style looks in different lights and

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.290 
the style looks in different lights and
different<00:02:42.860> times<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.490> day<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:43.700> natural

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
different times of the day and natural

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.970 
different times of the day and natural
light<00:02:44.480> versus<00:02:44.900> incandescent<00:02:45.260> light<00:02:45.740> or

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
light versus incandescent light or

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.550 
light versus incandescent light or
hopefully<00:02:46.820> fluorescent<00:02:47.420> light<00:02:47.600> or<00:02:47.810> LED<00:02:48.020> light

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
hopefully fluorescent light or LED light

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.520 
hopefully fluorescent light or LED light
so<00:02:49.810> take<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.840> look<00:02:51.050> at<00:02:51.110> those<00:02:51.200> different

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
so take a look at those different

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.920 
so take a look at those different
options<00:02:51.710> and<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:53.060> then<00:02:53.270> if<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.570> want<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.750> find

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
options and and then if you want to find

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.690 
options and and then if you want to find
