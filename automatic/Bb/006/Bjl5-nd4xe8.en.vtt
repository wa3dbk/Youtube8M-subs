driver's<00:00:22.410> license<00:00:22.740> because<00:00:22.859> my<00:00:23.130> shipping

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
driver's license because my shipping

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.340 
driver's license because my shipping
address<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.939> my<00:00:24.119> billing<00:00:24.900> address<00:00:25.199> were

different so I'm sure that that has to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.509 
different so I'm sure that that has to
do<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.680> shipping<00:00:28.680> lengths<00:00:28.949> because<00:00:29.279> most
