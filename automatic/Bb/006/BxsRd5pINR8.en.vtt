then<00:03:18.160> we<00:03:18.310> have<00:03:18.520> here<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:20.290> little<00:03:20.590> rubber

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
then we have here this little rubber

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.280 
then we have here this little rubber
flap<00:03:21.280> which<00:03:21.820> doesn't<00:03:22.300> seem<00:03:22.510> too<00:03:22.750> sturdy<00:03:22.810> or

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
flap which doesn't seem too sturdy or

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.140 
flap which doesn't seem too sturdy or
anything<00:03:23.470> like<00:03:23.739> that<00:03:23.800> but<00:03:24.100> you<00:03:24.220> can<00:03:24.370> see<00:03:24.400> for

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
anything like that but you can see for

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.210 
anything like that but you can see for
charging<00:03:25.690> here's<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.200> 3mf<00:03:26.620> millimeter<00:03:27.010> jack

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
charging here's the 3mf millimeter jack

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.820 
charging here's the 3mf millimeter jack
port<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.700> then<00:03:28.180> here<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.570> have<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.840> USB<00:03:28.959> so

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
port and then here you have the USB so

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.350 
port and then here you have the USB so
you<00:03:29.920> guys<00:03:30.040> can<00:03:30.340> charge<00:03:30.580> a<00:03:30.700> smartphone<00:03:30.940> or

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
you guys can charge a smartphone or

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.760 
you guys can charge a smartphone or
tablet<00:03:31.660> or<00:03:31.750> anything<00:03:31.930> like<00:03:32.110> that<00:03:32.170> also<00:03:32.560> but

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
tablet or anything like that also but

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.010 
tablet or anything like that also but
you<00:03:32.860> can<00:03:32.980> see<00:03:33.190> tab<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:33.760> will<00:03:33.790> be<00:03:34.000> quite<00:03:34.270> hard<00:03:34.959> to

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
you can see tab it will be quite hard to

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.979 
you can see tab it will be quite hard to
charge<00:03:35.320> because<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.770> gives<00:03:35.980> off<00:03:36.100> only<00:03:36.370> 500

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
charge because it gives off only 500

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.870 
charge because it gives off only 500
milliamps<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.170> let<00:03:38.830> me<00:03:38.950> close<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.400> up<00:03:39.580> again

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
milliamps so let me close this up again

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.699 
milliamps so let me close this up again
if<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.060> toast<00:03:40.690> is<00:03:40.870> up<00:03:40.989> tightly<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.560> can

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
if you toast is up tightly you can

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.229 
if you toast is up tightly you can
probably<00:03:42.010> also<00:03:42.220> throw<00:03:42.640> it<00:03:42.730> into<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.030> water

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
probably also throw it into the water

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.970 
probably also throw it into the water
but<00:03:43.540> what's<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.140> point<00:03:44.320> because<00:03:44.590> underwater

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
but what's the point because underwater

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.530 
but what's the point because underwater
you<00:03:45.160> won't<00:03:45.370> hear<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.640> music<00:03:45.940> anyway

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
you won't hear the music anyway

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.030 
you won't hear the music anyway
yeah<00:03:46.900> but<00:03:47.110> yeah<00:03:47.290> if<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:47.440> just<00:03:47.590> close<00:03:47.950> this

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
yeah but yeah if you just close this

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.160 
yeah but yeah if you just close this
apps<00:03:48.220> really<00:03:48.430> tight<00:03:48.760> can<00:03:49.360> maybe<00:03:49.720> hang<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.080> up

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
apps really tight can maybe hang it up

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.290 
apps really tight can maybe hang it up
also<00:03:50.380> in<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.800> shower<00:03:51.220> or<00:03:51.400> anything<00:03:51.670> like<00:03:51.910> that

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
also in the shower or anything like that

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.060 
also in the shower or anything like that
that's<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.660> quite<00:03:52.840> interesting<00:03:53.050> touch<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:54.040> it

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
that's a quite interesting touch to it

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.870 
that's a quite interesting touch to it
it's<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.430> little<00:03:54.519> bit<00:03:54.640> rubbish<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:57.700> can

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
it's a little bit rubbish and you can

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.430 
it's a little bit rubbish and you can
see<00:03:58.150> something<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.660> prince<00:03:58.900> on<00:03:59.050> here<00:03:59.290> but<00:03:59.410> I

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
see something a prince on here but I

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.560 
see something a prince on here but I
think<00:03:59.769> once<00:04:00.010> this<00:04:00.220> white<00:04:00.519> powder<00:04:00.970> stuff<00:04:01.420> is

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
think once this white powder stuff is

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.960 
think once this white powder stuff is
gone<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.170> that<00:04:02.230> won't<00:04:02.980> be<00:04:03.100> that<00:04:03.220> much<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:03.790> a

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
gone and that won't be that much of a

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.080 
gone and that won't be that much of a
problem<00:04:04.209> since<00:04:04.480> it's<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.810> matte<00:04:05.380> colour<00:04:06.100> so<00:04:06.430> let

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
problem since it's a matte colour so let

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.270 
problem since it's a matte colour so let
me<00:04:07.180> just<00:04:07.360> turn<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.570> on

connecting<00:05:51.370> connected<00:05:52.370> and<00:05:52.900> all<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:54.020> have<00:05:54.230> to

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
connecting connected and all I have to

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:32.080
