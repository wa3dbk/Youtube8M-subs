 blow could not make a return from the lock 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.600
 out and talk about it a bit 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.030
 later tdf for tour de france 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.230
 today we will talk about estat menu 5 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.250
 there is an update ya not very 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.400
 a long time and this is an opportunity for you 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.400
 speak 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.340
 they know menu what is it 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.110
 for eight years now that I'm doing 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.880
 videos on okano point fr you me 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.320
 ask regularly enough either 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.640
 response to a video where I made a 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.810
 screencast and I showed you a little 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.030
 little how I worked on my mac 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.460
 like that in a natural way on 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.260
 twitter or facebook rather twitter this 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.940
 happens in my menu bar in 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.460
 top right of my computer right 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.640
 left by gives the rage going for 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.170
 know how I monitor activities 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.960
 networks how does the monitor use 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.770
 disc-there use of the CPU the temperature of 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.030
 the computer etc 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.680
 it's something that makes you a little bit 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.270
 who does that and that's normal because I 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.530
 also it makes me serious kiffÃ© this little 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.200
 trick there it's just is managed 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.210
 by django which is the limp that makes 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.250
 different little software for Roman that 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.509
 your iphone including estat they are 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.970
 specialized in the use of 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.350
 statistics on the mac and the one that 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.840
 I use in the bar call minus 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.200
 he statue manu nothing super complicated the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.360
 chip 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.950
 at the time he fucks one existed 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.899
 not at the very beginning and I was using a 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.890
 committee widget in the dashboard 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.450
 Besides, we do not even know if the 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.330
 dashboard will always be there that bone and 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.560
 multi or if he will clear who was called 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.060
 which was called estat prostate I know 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.619
 more what to boil a widget 6 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.490
 stadium that was great and good 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.080
 little ones who would like little 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.280
 information to very broad which you 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.000
 give all the information in 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.009
 your dashboard 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.170
 it was still pretty cool since he 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.490
 came out of the menu and that's still 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.259
 more tip top 3 cuil 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.429
 the fundamental difference obviously 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.840
 is that the six widgets were 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.569
 free they always feel it if they 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.850
 still exist and stories come to him 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.459
 is paying it costs $ 16 for a 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.509
 individual license and $ 24 for a 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.890
 family license 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.300
 I do not hide that I did not dig 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.380
 the side of the family license since 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.880
 I'm not interested I'm the only one 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.720
 use it madam do not use it and 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.920
 do not see the point 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.599
 the version of the personal shot studied me 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.950
 on my retina and sing my mac pro I 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.840
 can use it on both wheels on 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.130
 both computers since lowering the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.860
 even the username that there is 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.300
 above it is not a problem 16 $ 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.370
 so does 12 euros for you 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.780
 to familiarize a little bit with why I 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.440
 paid 12 euros it's a sentence a little 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.040
 long and hot 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.540
 why pay 12 euros for 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.890
 is his bare hands simply because 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.599
 that for the past eight years that I have been making 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.299
 videos for over ten years that I 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.859
 am on mac it is a tool that makes me 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.569
 a service every day at least one 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.219
 times a day to know where I am at 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.420
 network level when you redo 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:37.530
 something on the computer and that you 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.640
 do not have what's going on and that's 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.079
 why the page and not looking 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.510
 what's going on you look so 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.620
 you target siea of network activity this 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.329
 which is low network activity and 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.670
 it is something that is used to 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.560
 if your intershop computer at the time it was 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.689
 been really useful if it is if your 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.430
 computer heats but know a 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.659
 touching on the temperature know if 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.849
 are processes in progress what meaning the 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.889
 process and istac the un 5 arrives with a 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.359
 shit putten too good news 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.919
 option that make me feel good I'll go 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.260
 show it on the computer right away so 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.959
 as I told you well gothamist menu 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.849
 rather it serves this is on the site of 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.980
 big fat here he's holding simple that 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.889
 so you can do a download 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.139
 or blade to the lease so you see it's up to 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.180
 16 dollars for a single license and to 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.989
 $ 24 for a family license 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.329
 so I do not know what it is 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.189
 exactly a family license how much 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.780
 there are five losses not getting started lice 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.980
 but I do not know how many people 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.970
 in a family license I you 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.750
 let me dig and I'm interested 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.150
 not lock this up and so if you 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.530
 come back d on estat minutes here you 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.229
 are going to have in all these little ones 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.750
 settings here so there for example that is 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:41.940
 what is it that all this a1 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.139
 right at least I bema dates all 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.760
 simply so who is totally 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.609
 customizable so I choose the 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.049
 year -day syntax like that it's me 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.519
 let's name but easily my 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.260
 plots this work and articles 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.329
 mangane that I write for the site that 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.829
 always starts with the date and then 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.510
 I look if I click on it but I have 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.560
 obviously a calendar that allows very 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.209
 easily and without having to open 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.949
 the calendar app to know where we 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.520
 is and you also have here in 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:07.210
 below them 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.620
 dates etc from different cities 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.580
 that you will have personalized so how 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.080
 I work twice with people who 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.030
 are in san francisco in new york that's me 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.410
 lets know about whether it does 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.370
 day too finished if people from 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.360
 work rather than I'm going to them 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.520
 send a mail etc 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.540
 tokyo 2 i'm going soon and paris it's 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.959
 when I'm abroad it allows me 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.810
 to know 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.090
 she puts a little bit of it a little bit there 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.770
 the complexion that there is the temperature the 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.780
 it has nothing to do and the temperature I 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.690
 I'm sorry it's the same day 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.430
 cut the processor here pharma files 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.930
 also so nice processor state the 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.940
 last hour last 24 hours 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.970
 access the different lawsuits that put it 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.290
 up to date has not changed much has not 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.790
 not changed much not on a 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.410
 portable you will have for example what 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.630
 will consume energy what you 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.490
 do not have on the mac pro here you go 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.740
 also have the opportunity to 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.900
 change the different the rhythms of the 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.760
 fan of your computer here on 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.410
 the mac pro you're going to have the 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.120
 different temperatures of all 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.400
 sensors from all your computer 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.840
 hard disk sensors speed 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.370
 fans in real time and the 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.350
 consumption here that you see a little 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.410
 little but there is a peck of there is a 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.820
 just a little bit of data 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.500
 computer consumption level you 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.590
 are going to have then consumption 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.770
 memory you are going to have memory by 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.190
 application you are going to have the 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.810
 ssd consumption so on mac pro on 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.440
 the pegasus that I have in two jumps on 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.300
 every little volume of mandate what is 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.100
 here and you will see also what is 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.730
 very good writing speeds 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.410
 reads by application for the disk 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.910
 system in this case that's it 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.580
 really practical it was not there before 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.350
 and even better it's the same thing but 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.810
 for the network here ie that of 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.840
 blow you know what application like 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.100
 are due 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.100
 network here downstairs instead of telling you 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.449
 in beta people see in 100 kg in output 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.280
 it's necessarily a dropbox that 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.380
 synchronizes is well there you know that 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.180
 many missions there is going on there is this 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.220
 service to the con who is in the process 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.449
 to send stuff that I do not know what 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.410
 that I will look after it since 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:00.830
 I still eat any time any time 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.479
 bandwidth 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.070
 and here and there he left and then he 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.960
 come back and that's so it allows you to 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.400
 know that everything is customizable if 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.160
 the graphics like that you like 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.540
 not a virtuous have posed you can them 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.550
 masters of another color and that's 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.600
 in another form you can put them 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.460
 there on their other etc 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.590
 it's really really really great 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.479
 cool here it was dentist is petite 5 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.070
 which is the application I have you 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.570
 never spoken since boufic this time 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.210
 that I say it but it had to be done 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.830
 that was it now if you 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.020
 watch this video on youtube or 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.460
 vimeo or the itunes podcast do not hesitate to
