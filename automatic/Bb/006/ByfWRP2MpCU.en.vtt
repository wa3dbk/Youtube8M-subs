world as we can see this little video

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.509 
world as we can see this little video
here<00:01:04.500> before<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:04.949> play<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> video<00:01:05.369> any

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
here before we play the video any

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.010 
here before we play the video any
further<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.030> see<00:01:06.330> how<00:01:06.479> there's<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> widow

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
further we can see how there's a widow

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.480 
further we can see how there's a widow
I'm<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.740> saying<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.130> because<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.430> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
I'm just saying with it because it's a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.130 
I'm just saying with it because it's a
woman<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.820> black<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
woman in black we can see here in a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.630 
woman in black we can see here in a
little<00:01:10.350> circle<00:01:10.500> part<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.040> manor<00:01:11.369> house

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
little circle part of this manor house

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.859 
little circle part of this manor house
I'm<00:01:11.850> guessing<00:01:12.119> she<00:01:12.150> was<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> mayor<00:01:12.630> or

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
I'm guessing she was the mayor or

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.780 
I'm guessing she was the mayor or
sheriff's<00:01:13.229> wife<00:01:13.350> something<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.070> but

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
sheriff's wife something like that but

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.700 
sheriff's wife something like that but
we<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.150> see<00:01:15.479> how<00:01:15.689> she's<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.259> standing<00:01:16.470> there

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
we can see how she's just standing there

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.429 
we can see how she's just standing there

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
just a little bit right here we can see

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.420 
just a little bit right here we can see
how<00:01:24.750> there<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.619> mystery<00:01:25.830> box<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.250> don't

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
how there is the mystery box so we don't

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.350 
how there is the mystery box so we don't
have<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.610> worry<00:01:26.729> about<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> mystery<00:01:27.240> box

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
have to worry about the mystery box

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.870 
have to worry about the mystery box
being<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:28.080> I'm<00:01:28.320> leaving<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.549> we

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
being back or I'm leaving it all and we

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
being back or I'm leaving it all and we
can<00:01:30.030> see<00:01:30.210> how<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.390> zombies<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.380> fact<00:01:31.590> have

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
can see how the zombies do in fact have

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.649 
can see how the zombies do in fact have
blue<00:01:32.250> eyes<00:01:32.280> not<00:01:32.759> red<00:01:32.939> eyes<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.329> nothing's

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
blue eyes not red eyes so nothing's

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.149 
blue eyes not red eyes so nothing's
changed<00:01:34.020> continuities<00:01:34.530> having<00:01:34.799> kept<00:01:34.979> between

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
changed continuities having kept between

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.160 
changed continuities having kept between
this<00:01:35.430> trailer<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.909> last<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.840> keep

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
this trailer in the last one so keep

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.960 
this trailer in the last one so keep
moving<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:37.979> see<00:01:38.220> how<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.579> woman

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
moving on here we can see how this woman

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.760 
moving on here we can see how this woman
obviously<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> spirit<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.259> some<00:01:40.320> sort

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
obviously is a spirit of some sort

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.190 
obviously is a spirit of some sort
weensy<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.610> because<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.060> know<00:01:42.180> she's<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
weensy is because you know she's not and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.660 
weensy is because you know she's not and
she<00:01:43.409> does<00:01:43.680> not<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.130> she's<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.490> walking

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
she does not have like she's not walking

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.520 
she does not have like she's not walking
she's<00:01:45.479> rather<00:01:45.689> moving<00:01:46.110> around<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
she's rather moving around like a

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.469 
she's rather moving around like a
specter<00:01:46.950> or<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.250> goes<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.460> gliding<00:01:48.390> around

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
specter or it goes just gliding around

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.330 
specter or it goes just gliding around
with<00:01:48.780> her<00:01:48.930> robes<00:01:49.290> behind<00:01:49.680> her<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:50.130> coming

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
with her robes behind her just coming

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.800 
with her robes behind her just coming
right<00:01:50.520> behind<00:01:50.670> her<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.240> then<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.600> see<00:01:51.720> how

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
right behind her and then we can see how

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.749 
right behind her and then we can see how
we<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.049> kill<00:01:52.200> her<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.500> she<00:01:53.070> does<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.280> let<00:01:53.610> out

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
we can kill her and she does not let out

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.249 
we can kill her and she does not let out
the<00:01:53.939> normal<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.390> she<00:01:54.420> doesn't<00:01:54.780> bleed<00:01:55.020> she

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the normal like she doesn't bleed she

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.170 
the normal like she doesn't bleed she
seems<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.560> she<00:01:55.770> has<00:01:55.799> some<00:01:56.159> sort<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.729> i'm<00:01:57.030> not

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
seems like she has some sort of i'm not

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.819 
seems like she has some sort of i'm not

though<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.729> kill<00:02:02.969> her<00:02:03.060> by<00:02:03.689> moving<00:02:03.899> right

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
though you can kill her by moving right

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.600 
though you can kill her by moving right

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360
