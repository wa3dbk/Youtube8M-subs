00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 a luxurious power or a comfortable 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.540
 direction 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.150
 there are those who consider these inscriptions to be 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.870
 some people say until there are no 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.240
 but the west came life to prove 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.850
 that they were wrong 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:23.340
 an unwavering deafening silence or 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.240
 by the ticking of the watch or by the engine 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.810
 v12 luxury with sobriety mixing with 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.630
 hand-sewn and wood with 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.079
 perfect creases a magical automobile 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.739
 capable of turning any dark sky 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.590
 on a beautiful starry night comfort 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.050
 which extends to the rear seats 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.200
 even though only two doors indicate the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.010
 contrary to the interior of the rolls 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.050
 most powerful in history the paradox in 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.070
 car shape 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.850
 the race name that in the Scottish dialect 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.630
 means ghost 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.090
 a comfortable punch in the pit of the stomach 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.159
 When you step on the bottom, you get 100 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.360
 kilometers per hour at just over 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.360
 four seconds 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:22.660
 out the classic glitzy romanticism 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.770
 lines marked by the strong curves of 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.880
 a hooded coupe that seems to never end 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:35.680
 inhabited by a monstrous 12-cylinder 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.650
 two tubes and 624 horses a compound 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.020
 isolated world stable by layers and 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.020
 more layers of acoustic blanket 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.510
 thinking better understandable 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.910
 that the king does not really exist 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.300
 after all such levels of performance 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.850
 comfort technology and tradition 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.820
 rarely seen walking together 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.820
 even more infantasia
