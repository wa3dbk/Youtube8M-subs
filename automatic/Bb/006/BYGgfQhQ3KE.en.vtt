00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.650 
like this is sort of distancing its it's
adding<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.350> layer<00:03:58.560> between<00:03:59.420> you<00:04:00.420> know<00:04:00.480> the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
adding a layer between you know the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.110 
adding a layer between you know the
audience<00:04:01.080> that<00:04:01.560> looks<00:04:01.800> at<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.280> it's<00:04:03.000> like

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
to move so there's a practical problem

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.830 
to move so there's a practical problem
of<00:04:12.210> like<00:04:12.510> if<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:13.350> have<00:04:13.680> all<00:04:13.920> these<00:04:14.190> kind<00:04:14.550> of

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
of like if you have all these kind of

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.379 
of like if you have all these kind of
and<00:04:15.680> interesting<00:04:16.100> like<00:04:16.489> draped<00:04:16.820> pieces

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
and interesting like draped pieces

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.500 
and interesting like draped pieces
they're<00:04:17.690> not<00:04:17.930> going<00:04:18.199> to<00:04:18.260> stay<00:04:18.500> that<00:04:18.739> way<00:04:19.510> and

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
they're not going to stay that way and

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.469 
they're not going to stay that way and
then<00:04:21.139> there's<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.829> problem<00:04:22.040> of<00:04:22.400> just<00:04:22.940> like

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
then there's the problem of just like

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.960 
then there's the problem of just like
making<00:04:23.930> a<00:04:24.199> picture<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:25.190> isn't<00:04:25.400> people

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
making a picture that isn't people

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.939 
making a picture that isn't people
because<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:27.020> really<00:04:27.380> need<00:04:27.530> to<00:04:27.620> be<00:04:27.740> able<00:04:27.800> to

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
because you really need to be able to

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.219 
because you really need to be able to
see<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.250> people<00:04:28.400> underneath<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.900> susan

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.990 
this collage is is the actual collage
that<00:04:35.660> we<00:04:35.750> ended<00:04:35.990> up<00:04:36.080> creating<00:04:36.380> on<00:04:36.860> stage<00:04:37.520> which

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
that we ended up creating on stage which

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.240 
that we ended up creating on stage which
is<00:04:38.270> all<00:04:38.570> of<00:04:38.840> these<00:04:38.990> found<00:04:39.260> objects<00:04:39.800> you<00:04:40.160> know

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.400 
is all of these found objects you know
we<00:04:40.460> used<00:04:41.000> spoons<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:42.310> scales<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:44.410> juicers

instead<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:46.370> starfish<00:04:46.970> I<00:04:47.210> think<00:04:47.510> this<00:04:47.720> show<00:04:47.960> is

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
instead of starfish I think this show is

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.969 
instead of starfish I think this show is
really<00:04:49.180> rewarding<00:04:50.180> in<00:04:50.720> that<00:04:50.750> that<00:04:51.440> the

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
really rewarding in that that the

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.969 
really rewarding in that that the
collage<00:04:52.460> aspect<00:04:53.180> in<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.450> sort<00:04:53.690> of<00:04:53.979> scavenging
