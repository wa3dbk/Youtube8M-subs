00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.240
 good and look what I found 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.750
 around here some really 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.690
 different are called in case and are from the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.710
 mark box that has different before then 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.060
 that are i paper and that are put behind 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.599
 our smartphone 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.429
 to have an additional screen 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.070
 here we have for example the galaxy not 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.289
 cars would be available also for 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.560
 iphone 5 and is also in production 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.560
 for the s 4 what can we do with this 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.330
 second screen then to start reading 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.070
 e- books we can also 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.100
 take pictures here for example what 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.460
 we are seeing is an electronic book 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.650
 this would be the screen line keys and here 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.040
 we have the smartphone screen where 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.640
 had replicated we can have 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.890
 facebook we can have twitter 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.570
 and we can also use it as 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.829
 additional screen to show the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.480
 rest of the people what we are 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.019
 watching on this smartphone 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.970
 here for example we have the iphone 5 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:10.600
 here we have it in white 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.810
 is for example 3.5 inches the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 galaxy nodes are 43 inches with one 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.910
 resolution of 600 x 800 pixels how it 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.910
 connect to our device through 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.370
 bluetooth 2.1 plus there is a series of 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.950
 specific applications with which 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.230
 can manage the screen these 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.980
 applications we can download 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.380
 both in the apple store and in the 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.970
 Android store for example in keys 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.400
 background 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.930
 here we would have a lot of photos that 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.040
 we could go directly to our 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.740
 screen right now we do not have 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.740
 synchronized and if we wanted to choose a 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440
 simply 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.640
 we would move it and we would have here the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.020
 same photograph how do we make 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.329
 work on the sim that is then 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.850
 recharging them by a connection 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.979
 microusb to which this is plugged 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.569
 cable cited and so we could have the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.819
 completely additional battery so 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.319
 we were consuming battery 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.180
 our smartphone in this way 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.500
 we can be reading for example a 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.569
 book consulting our networks 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.910
 social consuming little battery only 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.599
 the connection and exercise the smartphone 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.160
 with the link keys but it is also 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.840
 it would be more comfortable to be 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.910
 reading for example a book that in a 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.120
 traditional lcd screen of any 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.940
 smartphone for now are still in 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.980
 development phase but when they go out to 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.680
 the sale for example this arrival without 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.900
 cars will cost about 51 dollars that I 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.890
 I think it's a pretty acceptable price 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.780
 this is one of the most curious things 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.470
 that you can find by computex but 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.640
 that does not mean we do not keep looking 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.120
 curiosities and novelties of course 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.120
 the pickets 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.140
 ah 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.140
 nothing more 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.680
 how
