00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.889 
expanding or just trying to tack up fast
and<00:00:35.040> we're<00:00:35.820> taking<00:00:35.969> advantage<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.719> we're

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and we're taking advantage of that we're

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:37.819 
and we're taking advantage of that we're
going<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> take<00:00:37.170> advantage<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.770> fact

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
going to take advantage of that fact

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.619 
going to take advantage of that fact
that<00:00:38.370> he's<00:00:38.489> not<00:00:38.610> putting<00:00:38.850> pressure<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.270> us<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
that he's not putting pressure on us and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.880 
that he's not putting pressure on us and
then<00:00:39.719> we<00:00:39.780> kind<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.140> free<00:00:40.379> rein<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.620> do

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
then we kind of have free rein to do

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.860 
then we kind of have free rein to do
what<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.129> want<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:42.059> we're<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.420> use<00:00:42.690> that

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
what we want and we're going to use that

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.060 
what we want and we're going to use that
free<00:00:43.170> rein<00:00:43.379> we're<00:00:43.559> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.739> use<00:00:43.920> that

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
free rein we're going to use that

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.240 
free rein we're going to use that
opportunity<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.940> play<00:00:45.980> aggressively<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.190> I'm

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
opportunity to play aggressively and I'm

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.000 
opportunity to play aggressively and I'm
going<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> put<00:00:47.610> pressure<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.030> him<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> result

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
going to put pressure on him as a result

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.740 
going to put pressure on him as a result
so<00:00:50.010> basically<00:00:50.610> yeah<00:00:50.910> again<00:00:51.180> we're<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.660> to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
so basically yeah again we're going to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.119 
so basically yeah again we're going to
take<00:00:51.870> advantage<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> fact<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.770> he's<00:00:52.949> not

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
take advantage of the fact that he's not

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.700 
take advantage of the fact that he's not
doing<00:00:53.850> much<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.300> us<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.199> that's<00:00:55.500> something

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
doing much to us and that's something

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.529 
doing much to us and that's something

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
going with that out 14 pool followed by

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.780 
going with that out 14 pool followed by
the<00:01:30.390> extractor<00:01:31.009> once<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.130> extractor<00:01:32.610> comes

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
the extractor once that extractor comes

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.980 
the extractor once that extractor comes
up<00:01:32.939> we're<00:01:33.030> going<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.210> go<00:01:33.299> ahead<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.570> saturate

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
up we're going to go ahead and saturate

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.780 
up we're going to go ahead and saturate
that<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.439> getting<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.009> speed<00:01:35.340> upgrade<00:01:35.670> as

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
that I'm getting that speed upgrade as

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.490 
that I'm getting that speed upgrade as
quickly<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.270> possible<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:37.049> trying<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.380> get

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
quickly as possible I'm trying to get

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.719 
quickly as possible I'm trying to get
those<00:01:37.619> speedlings<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.159> very<00:01:38.369> quickly<00:01:38.490> that

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
those speedlings out very quickly that

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.609 
those speedlings out very quickly that
allows<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> lot<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.689> map<00:01:39.990> control<00:01:40.409> all

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
allows for a lot of map control all

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.789 
allows for a lot of map control all
Menelaos<00:01:41.549> allows<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.079> well<00:01:43.560> it

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
Menelaos allows you to you know well it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.080 
Menelaos allows you to you know well it
allows<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.369> map<00:01:44.579> control<00:01:44.939> it's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
allows you to have map control it's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.090 
allows you to have map control it's
basically<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.689> does<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.649> provides<00:01:46.950> you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
basically what it does it provides you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
basically what it does it provides you
with<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.729> threat<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.329> your<00:01:48.450> opponent<00:01:48.899> of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
with the threat to your opponent of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.899 
with the threat to your opponent of
running<00:01:49.350> into<00:01:49.560> their<00:01:49.710> base<00:01:49.890> if<00:01:50.490> they<00:01:50.700> don't

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
running into their base if they don't

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.960 
running into their base if they don't
play<00:01:51.390> defensively<00:01:51.960> basically<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.460> extractors

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
play defensively basically so extractors

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.370 
play defensively basically so extractors
up<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.299> we're<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.570> be<00:01:54.659> saturating<00:01:55.229> that

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
up now we're going to be saturating that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.230 
up now we're going to be saturating that
once<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.040> spawning<00:01:56.369> pool<00:01:56.610> comes<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.149> we

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
once that spawning pool comes up and we

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.459 
once that spawning pool comes up and we
get<00:01:57.360> our<00:01:57.450> first<00:01:57.479> under<00:01:57.899> recipe<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.320> that's

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
get our first under recipe and that's

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.380 
get our first under recipe and that's
when<00:01:58.619> we're<00:01:58.799> going<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.360> for<00:02:00.360> that

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
when we're going to be going for that

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.010 
when we're going to be going for that
speed<00:02:00.869> upgrade<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.439> get<00:02:01.590> our<00:02:01.710> speed<00:02:01.950> links<00:02:02.250> out

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
speed upgrade to get our speed links out

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.630 
speed upgrade to get our speed links out
so<00:02:04.020> yeah<00:02:04.290> taking<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.979> look<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.250> Protoss

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
so yeah taking a look at the Protoss

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.760 
so yeah taking a look at the Protoss
player<00:02:05.939> here<00:02:06.270> again<00:02:06.840> he's<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.229> playing<00:02:07.500> very

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
player here again he's not playing very

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.740 
player here again he's not playing very
aggressively<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.489> game<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.970> think<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:09.599> a

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
aggressively in this game I think it's a

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.420 
aggressively in this game I think it's a
little<00:02:09.959> strange<00:02:10.379> pile<00:02:10.739> on<00:02:10.890> placement<00:02:11.370> up

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
little strange pile on placement up

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.589 
little strange pile on placement up
there<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> was<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.239> putting<00:02:12.420> some

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
there I was going to be putting some

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.040 
there I was going to be putting some
tech<00:02:12.810> up

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
tech up

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.350 
tech up
its<00:02:13.350> purpose<00:02:13.620> behind<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.190> though<00:02:14.430> and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
its purpose behind that though and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.170 
its purpose behind that though and
looking<00:02:15.750> at<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> very<00:02:16.320> popular<00:02:17.180> building

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
looking at a very popular building

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.750 
looking at a very popular building
placement<00:02:18.750> for<00:02:19.110> our<00:02:19.260> Protoss<00:02:19.650> player<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.280> lot

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
placement for our Protoss player a lot

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.830 
placement for our Protoss player a lot
of<00:02:20.850> Protoss<00:02:21.150> players<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.630> particular

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
of Protoss players on this particular

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.750 
of Protoss players on this particular
map<00:02:22.320> are<00:02:22.500> going<00:02:22.710> for<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:22.980> choke<00:02:23.220> off<00:02:23.430> here

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
map are going for that choke off here

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.550 
map are going for that choke off here
I'm<00:02:23.940> effectively<00:02:24.570> turning<00:02:25.320> these

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
I'm effectively turning these

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.260 
I'm effectively turning these
destructible<00:02:26.160> rocks<00:02:26.220> back<00:02:26.610> here<00:02:26.880> into<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
destructible rocks back here into the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.360 
destructible rocks back here into the
new<00:02:27.420> entrance<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.110> base<00:02:28.290> they<00:02:29.160> usually

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
new entrance to the base they usually

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.920 
new entrance to the base they usually
what<00:02:29.670> they<00:02:29.790> do<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:30.060> they<00:02:30.210> eventually<00:02:30.510> break

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
what they do is they eventually break

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.510 
what they do is they eventually break
down<00:02:31.110> these<00:02:31.290> destructible<00:02:31.830> rocks<00:02:31.890> make<00:02:32.340> this

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
down these destructible rocks make this

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.100 
down these destructible rocks make this
their<00:02:32.730> new<00:02:32.880> entrance<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.510> use<00:02:33.870> these

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
their new entrance and use these

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.130 
their new entrance and use these
buildings<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.770> block<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.220> off<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:36.870> allows

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
buildings to block this off this allows

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.360 
buildings to block this off this allows
you<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.410> lot<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.740> times<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.100> get<00:02:38.250> up<00:02:38.340> that

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
you a lot of times to get up that

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.180

you with that to gate it's usually be
seen<00:02:56.490> as<00:02:56.610> elves<00:02:56.880> by<00:02:57.030> now<00:02:57.210> so<00:02:58.080> we're<00:02:58.500> taking

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
seen as elves by now so we're taking

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.620 
seen as elves by now so we're taking
advantage<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.460> opportunity<00:02:59.520> once<00:03:00.330> more

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
advantage of that opportunity once more

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.090 
advantage of that opportunity once more
we're<00:03:00.930> pushing<00:03:01.200> out<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.620> we're<00:03:01.710> seeing<00:03:01.980> what

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
we're pushing out and we're seeing what

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.500 
we're pushing out and we're seeing what
we<00:03:02.190> can<00:03:02.280> do<00:03:02.400> them<00:03:02.640> were<00:03:02.730> kind<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.030> testing<00:03:03.420> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
we can do them were kind of testing the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.900 
we can do them were kind of testing the
waters<00:03:03.840> really<00:03:04.830> good<00:03:05.040> opportunity<00:03:05.280> at<00:03:05.700> first

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
waters really good opportunity at first

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.700 
waters really good opportunity at first
here<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.330> fact<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:07.200> know<00:03:07.320> he's<00:03:07.530> got

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
here and the fact that you know he's got

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.110 
here and the fact that you know he's got
this<00:03:07.890> for<00:03:08.130> job<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.520> he's<00:03:08.610> warping<00:03:08.970> this

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
this for job and he's warping this

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.390 
this for job and he's warping this
photon<00:03:09.480> cannons<00:03:09.900> but<00:03:10.050> it's<00:03:10.200> not<00:03:10.380> up<00:03:10.530> yet<00:03:10.560> so

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
photon cannons but it's not up yet so

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.590 
photon cannons but it's not up yet so
we're<00:03:11.520> going<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:11.820> what<00:03:11.940> we<00:03:12.060> can<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.300> take

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
we're going to do what we can to take

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.930 
we're going to do what we can to take
out<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:12.960> gateway<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:14.130> take<00:03:14.460> it<00:03:14.550> down<00:03:14.670> as<00:03:14.820> low

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
out this gateway and take it down as low

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.700 
out this gateway and take it down as low
as<00:03:15.090> possible<00:03:15.150> before<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:15.990> photon<00:03:16.350> cannon

as possible before this photon cannon
warps<00:03:16.920> in<00:03:17.070> now<00:03:18.030> once<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.360> once<00:03:18.750> it's<00:03:18.930> in

warps in now once it once it's in

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.690 
warps in now once it once it's in
obviously<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:19.680> want<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.920> pull<00:03:20.070> back<00:03:20.190> our<00:03:20.400> units

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
obviously we want to pull back our units

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.030 
obviously we want to pull back our units
it's<00:03:21.360> senseless<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:22.020> use<00:03:22.170> your<00:03:22.320> lose<00:03:22.830> your

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
it's senseless to use your lose your

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.560 
it's senseless to use your lose your
zerglings<00:03:23.489> for<00:03:23.700> pretty<00:03:23.880> much<00:03:23.940> nothing<00:03:24.270> you're

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
zerglings for pretty much nothing you're

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
not gonna be able to take this down in

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.650 
not gonna be able to take this down in
time<00:03:26.070> so<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.730> do<00:03:26.940> want<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.209> pull<00:03:27.360> them<00:03:27.510> away

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
time so you do want to pull them away

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.020 
time so you do want to pull them away
now<00:03:28.560> as<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.739> saw<00:03:29.100> as<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.610> was<00:03:29.730> over<00:03:30.000> here

now as you saw as I was over here
earlier<00:03:30.540> we<00:03:30.780> did<00:03:30.959> warp<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.350> our<00:03:31.560> Roche<00:03:32.040> Warren

earlier we did warp in our Roche Warren
I'm<00:03:32.520> sorry<00:03:32.760> we<00:03:32.850> built<00:03:33.090> our<00:03:33.270> Roche<00:03:33.780> Warren<00:03:34.050> we

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
I'm sorry we built our Roche Warren we

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.530 
I'm sorry we built our Roche Warren we
didn't<00:03:34.410> warp<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.739> in<00:03:34.860> sir<00:03:35.459> does<00:03:35.940> not<00:03:36.120> warp<00:03:36.390> in

upgrade<00:03:39.390> is<00:03:39.540> just<00:03:39.840> about<00:03:40.020> researched<00:03:40.500> here<00:03:40.860> so

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
upgrade is just about researched here so

to add to this aggression here these
zerglings<00:03:47.070> clearly<00:03:47.430> aren't<00:03:47.580> going<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.820> be

zerglings clearly aren't going to be
enough<00:03:47.970> because<00:03:48.300> of<00:03:48.570> that<00:03:48.690> photon<00:03:49.140> cannon<00:03:49.620> so

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
enough because of that photon cannon so

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.120

we are one we are wanting to add roaches

we are one we are wanting to add roaches
into<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.489> mix<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:54.140> know<00:03:55.140> I<00:03:55.290> didn't<00:03:55.590> mention

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
into the mix I know I didn't mention

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.440 
into the mix I know I didn't mention
that<00:03:56.010> we<00:03:56.130> dropped<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.520> roaches<00:03:56.880> I'm<00:03:57.120> just

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
that we dropped the roaches I'm just

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.540 
that we dropped the roaches I'm just
kind<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.959> kind<00:03:58.770> of<00:03:58.830> course<00:03:59.130> I<00:03:59.280> kind<00:03:59.520> of

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
kind of a kind of course I kind of

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.699 
kind of a kind of course I kind of
missed<00:03:59.790> that<00:04:00.000> chance<00:04:00.480> though<00:04:00.780> basically<00:04:01.560> what

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
missed that chance though basically what

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:02.840 
missed that chance though basically what
it<00:04:01.739> was<00:04:01.980> since<00:04:02.160> we<00:04:02.280> weren't<00:04:02.400> again<00:04:02.670> with<00:04:02.820> that

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
it was since we weren't again with that

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.380 
it was since we weren't again with that
14<00:04:03.300> pool<00:04:03.510> in<00:04:03.630> that<00:04:03.780> 13<00:04:04.140> extractor<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:05.640> that's

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
14 pool in that 13 extractor and that's

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.090 
14 pool in that 13 extractor and that's
basically<00:04:06.720> what<00:04:07.110> we<00:04:07.200> did<00:04:07.320> this<00:04:07.470> as<00:04:07.680> soon<00:04:07.800> as<00:04:07.950> we

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
basically what we did this as soon as we

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.949 
basically what we did this as soon as we
had<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.400> minerals<00:04:08.790> we<00:04:09.090> went<00:04:09.390> ahead<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.660> got<00:04:09.900> a

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
strong force gateway units once you get

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.930 
strong force gateway units once you get
that<00:04:26.430> speed<00:04:26.729> up

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
that speed up

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.610 
that speed up
to<00:04:27.210> they<00:04:27.390> do<00:04:27.450> pretty<00:04:27.720> well<00:04:27.900> against<00:04:28.140> stalkers

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
to they do pretty well against stalkers

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.470 
to they do pretty well against stalkers
there<00:04:28.830> again<00:04:29.280> more<00:04:29.520> much<00:04:29.790> more<00:04:30.000> effective

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
there again more much more effective

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.320 
there again more much more effective
perversities<00:04:31.260> zealots<00:04:32.220> but<00:04:32.790> I<00:04:32.820> with<00:04:33.180> that

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
perversities zealots but I with that

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.790 
perversities zealots but I with that
speed<00:04:33.750> upgrade<00:04:34.080> they<00:04:34.230> can<00:04:34.410> do<00:04:34.530> pretty<00:04:34.650> good

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
speed upgrade they can do pretty good

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.250 
speed upgrade they can do pretty good
rear<00:04:35.100> stalkers<00:04:35.610> so<00:04:36.570> as<00:04:36.690> you<00:04:36.780> can<00:04:36.900> see<00:04:37.080> here

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
rear stalkers so as you can see here

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.720 
rear stalkers so as you can see here
we're<00:04:37.380> pushing<00:04:37.590> up<00:04:37.830> even<00:04:38.100> with<00:04:38.160> these<00:04:38.310> photon

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
we're pushing up even with these photon

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.250 
we're pushing up even with these photon
cannons<00:04:39.120> there<00:04:39.270> because<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.780> damage<00:04:39.990> we

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
cannons there because the damage we

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.680 
cannons there because the damage we
dealt<00:04:40.440> earlier<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.920> that<00:04:41.040> gateway<00:04:41.390> we<00:04:42.390> are

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
dealt earlier to that gateway we are

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.120 
dealt earlier to that gateway we are
going<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:42.990> be<00:04:43.080> able<00:04:43.170> to<00:04:43.380> break<00:04:43.590> through<00:04:43.830> and

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
going to be able to break through and

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.200 
going to be able to break through and
then<00:04:44.310> we're<00:04:44.460> going<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.610> be<00:04:44.670> taking<00:04:44.850> on<00:04:45.090> these

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
then we're going to be taking on these

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.420 
then we're going to be taking on these
photon<00:04:45.630> cannons<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.710> mean<00:04:47.100> at<00:04:47.190> this<00:04:47.340> point

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
photon cannons and I mean at this point

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.370 
photon cannons and I mean at this point
that's<00:04:47.730> pretty<00:04:48.000> much<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.180> for<00:04:48.600> those<00:04:49.170> are<00:04:49.290> you

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
that's pretty much it for those are you

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.530 
that's pretty much it for those are you
wondering<00:04:49.770> was<00:04:50.220> Protoss<00:04:50.880> player<00:04:51.120> terrible

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
wondering was Protoss player terrible

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.000 
wondering was Protoss player terrible
has<00:04:51.660> even<00:04:51.900> been<00:04:52.020> doing<00:04:52.290> anything<00:04:52.500> yet<00:04:52.860> you've

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
has even been doing anything yet you've

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.800 
has even been doing anything yet you've
been<00:04:53.100> doing<00:04:53.280> a<00:04:53.340> lot<00:04:53.520> actually<00:04:53.820> is<00:04:54.060> putting<00:04:54.690> his

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
been doing a lot actually is putting his

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.210 
been doing a lot actually is putting his
tech<00:04:55.020> up<00:04:55.200> here<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.470> hiding<00:04:55.770> his<00:04:55.860> check<00:04:56.070> up

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
tech up here and hiding his check up

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
tech up here and hiding his check up
here<00:04:57.260> essentially<00:04:58.260> he<00:04:58.560> didn't<00:04:58.950> expect<00:04:59.670> to<00:04:59.970> get

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
here essentially he didn't expect to get

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.110 
here essentially he didn't expect to get
that<00:05:00.420> much<00:05:00.630> pressure<00:05:00.840> from<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.890> Zerg<00:05:02.790> player

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
that much pressure from the Zerg player

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.060 
that much pressure from the Zerg player
and<00:05:03.450> because<00:05:04.020> of<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:04.230> you<00:05:04.560> know<00:05:04.590> that<00:05:04.950> we

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
and because of that you know that we

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.620 
and because of that you know that we
were<00:05:05.190> able<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.460> bust<00:05:05.700> through<00:05:05.850> that<00:05:06.000> wall<00:05:06.270> and

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
were able to bust through that wall and

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.410 
were able to bust through that wall and
it<00:05:06.930> was<00:05:07.170> too<00:05:07.410> much<00:05:07.560> for<00:05:07.860> him<00:05:08.180> breaking<00:05:09.180> into

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
it was too much for him breaking into

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.420 
it was too much for him breaking into
his<00:05:09.660> base<00:05:09.870> here<00:05:10.260> moving<00:05:10.920> right<00:05:11.130> up<00:05:11.190> to<00:05:11.370> the

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
his base here moving right up to the

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.100 
his base here moving right up to the
mineral<00:05:11.730> line<00:05:11.910> all<00:05:12.180> he<00:05:12.390> has<00:05:12.600> to<00:05:12.630> these<00:05:12.930> two

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
mineral line all he has to these two

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.630 
mineral line all he has to these two
stalkers<00:05:13.560> still<00:05:13.890> waiting<00:05:14.130> on<00:05:14.220> that<00:05:14.280> warped

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
stalkers still waiting on that warped

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.100 
stalkers still waiting on that warped
cake<00:05:14.850> cool<00:05:15.120> down<00:05:15.150> so<00:05:15.600> it's<00:05:15.750> not<00:05:15.870> going<00:05:15.990> to

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
cake cool down so it's not going to

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.290 
cake cool down so it's not going to
little<00:05:16.230> more<00:05:16.410> pin<00:05:16.560> anything<00:05:16.800> quite<00:05:17.160> yet<00:05:17.300> and

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
little more pin anything quite yet and

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.020 
little more pin anything quite yet and
that's<00:05:18.480> game<00:05:18.720> over<00:05:19.040> so<00:05:20.040> it's<00:05:20.400> again<00:05:20.850> this

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
that's game over so it's again this

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.330 
that's game over so it's again this

the races not just this particular match
I<00:05:35.040> was<00:05:35.160> showing<00:05:35.340> you<00:05:35.430> that<00:05:35.580> speedling<00:05:36.060> Roche

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
I was showing you that speedling Roche

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.720 
I was showing you that speedling Roche
aggression<00:05:36.810> though<00:05:37.100> but<00:05:38.100> you<00:05:38.220> know<00:05:38.340> if<00:05:38.550> you're

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
aggression though but you know if you're

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.159 
aggression though but you know if you're
again<00:05:39.000> if<00:05:39.150> your<00:05:39.270> opponent's<00:05:39.690> leaving<00:05:39.960> you<00:05:40.050> in

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
again if your opponent's leaving you in

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.260 
again if your opponent's leaving you in
your<00:05:40.290> base<00:05:40.470> if<00:05:40.740> they're<00:05:40.860> letting<00:05:41.160> you<00:05:41.310> letting

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
your base if they're letting you letting

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.030 
your base if they're letting you letting
you<00:05:42.360> work<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:43.080> your<00:05:43.169> own<00:05:43.290> devices<00:05:43.440> take

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
you work to your own devices take

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.650 
you work to your own devices take
advantage<00:05:44.430> of<00:05:44.520> that<00:05:44.580> push<00:05:45.000> out<00:05:45.180> against<00:05:45.450> and

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
advantage of that push out against and

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.850 
advantage of that push out against and
put<00:05:45.810> some<00:05:45.930> pressure<00:05:46.110> against<00:05:46.590> them<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:46.800> this

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
put some pressure against them and this

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.010 
put some pressure against them and this
is<00:05:46.980> exactly<00:05:47.340> what<00:05:47.640> can<00:05:47.760> happen<00:05:47.940> if<00:05:48.870> they're

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
is exactly what can happen if they're

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.270 
is exactly what can happen if they're
not<00:05:49.169> prepared<00:05:49.350> for<00:05:49.590> you're<00:05:49.950> just<00:05:50.100> going<00:05:50.220> to

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
not prepared for you're just going to

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.070 
not prepared for you're just going to
wipe<00:05:50.460> them<00:05:50.669> out<00:05:50.730> right<00:05:50.910> away<00:05:51.060> so<00:05:51.780> yeah<00:05:51.930> guys

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
wipe them out right away so yeah guys
