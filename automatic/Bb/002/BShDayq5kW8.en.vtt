player<00:00:08.670> alive<00:00:08.910> wins<00:00:09.650> so<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.679> just<00:00:11.040> quickly<00:00:11.219> run

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
player alive wins so I just quickly run

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.490 
player alive wins so I just quickly run

lobby sets the lobby and if I walk into
this<00:00:19.770> little<00:00:19.980> bit<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.340> set<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> teleport<00:00:21.240> so

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
this little bit I can set a teleport so

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.240 
this little bit I can set a teleport so
SW<00:00:23.720> set<00:00:24.720> portal<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.529> sets<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> portal

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
SW set portal and this sets the portal

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.820 
SW set portal and this sets the portal
for<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.460> game<00:00:26.900> when<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:27.990> install<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.500> just

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
for the game when you install this just

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.320 
for the game when you install this just
make<00:00:28.980> sure<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.220> reload<00:00:29.550> your<00:00:29.580> server<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.240> it

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
make sure you reload your server so it

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.630 
make sure you reload your server so it
generates<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.900> worlds<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.489> see

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
generates the worlds so as you can see

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.120 
generates the worlds so as you can see

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
if I do SW status i'm going to just see

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.040 
if I do SW status i'm going to just see
who's<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> game<00:00:35.760> quickly<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.780> everyone

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
who's in the game quickly get everyone

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.450 
who's in the game quickly get everyone
to<00:00:37.200> walk<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:38.040> see<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> game

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
to walk in and you can see the game

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.240 
to walk in and you can see the game
start<00:00:38.820> straight<00:00:39.210> away<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.739> takes<00:00:40.920> four

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
start straight away so it takes four

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.040 
start straight away so it takes four
players<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.820> game<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.210> start<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.809> take

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
players for the game to start you take

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.500 
players for the game to start you take
the<00:00:43.140> items<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.559> your<00:00:43.710> chest<00:00:44.239> then<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.329> just

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the items at your chest then you just

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.819 
the items at your chest then you just
have<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> try<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.079> build<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
have to try and build to get to the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.770 
have to try and build to get to the
chests<00:00:47.309> because<00:00:48.149> basically<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> middle

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
chests because basically in the middle

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.360 
chests because basically in the middle
chest<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.500> string<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.309> make<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> bow

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
chest the string so you can make a bow

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.860 
chest the string so you can make a bow
so<00:00:53.370> what<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.850> want<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.329> start<00:00:54.570> off<00:00:54.690> by

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
so what you want to do is start off by

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.139 
so what you want to do is start off by
making<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.230> cobblestone<00:00:55.590> generator<00:00:56.149> I'm

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
making a cobblestone generator I'm

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.119 
making a cobblestone generator I'm
probably<00:00:57.660> going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> epically<00:00:58.379> fail<00:00:58.770> at<00:00:58.949> this

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
probably going to epically fail at this

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.360 
probably going to epically fail at this
it<00:00:59.430> doesn't<00:00:59.670> really<00:00:59.760> matter<00:01:00.500> but<00:01:01.500> you'd<00:01:02.340> make

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
it doesn't really matter but you'd make

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.160 
it doesn't really matter but you'd make
a<00:01:02.640> cobble<00:01:03.059> generator<00:01:03.090> you'd<00:01:03.780> cut<00:01:03.960> down<00:01:04.140> your

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
a cobble generator you'd cut down your

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.590 
a cobble generator you'd cut down your
tree<00:01:04.559> you'd<00:01:05.309> basically<00:01:05.549> play<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.240> same

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
tree you'd basically play you with same

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
tree you'd basically play you with same
same<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.170> would<00:01:07.260> Skyblock<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.250> try<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
same as you would Skyblock just try and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.640 
same as you would Skyblock just try and
survive<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.810> got<00:01:09.990> remember<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.500> other

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
survive you got remember that other

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.380 
survive you got remember that other
players<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.220> hit<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.610> there<00:01:11.880> are<00:01:12.000> fishing

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
players can hit you there are fishing

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.789 
players can hit you there are fishing
rods<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.110> actually<00:01:13.409> hit<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> other

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
rods so you can actually hit the other

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.740 
rods so you can actually hit the other
players<00:01:14.070> at<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.340> start<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.970> but

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
players at the start with that but

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.359 
players at the start with that but
obviously<00:01:15.840> they<00:01:16.229> don't<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:16.530> much<00:01:16.770> damage<00:01:17.009> but

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
obviously they don't do much damage but

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.660 
obviously they don't do much damage but
there's<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.610> chance<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.119> knock<00:01:18.270> them<00:01:18.360> off

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
there's a chance you can knock them off

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.190 
there's a chance you can knock them off
but<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.820> program<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.270> really<00:01:21.390> fun<00:01:21.720> we've<00:01:22.049> had

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
but this program is really fun we've had

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.359 
but this program is really fun we've had
a<00:01:22.229> quick<00:01:22.439> game<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.189> does<00:01:23.340> work

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
a quick game on it and it does work

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.030 
a quick game on it and it does work
amazingly<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.450> another<00:01:25.350> group<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.830> players

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
amazingly if another group of players

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.010 
amazingly if another group of players
join<00:01:26.490> basically<00:01:27.150> what<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.299> does<00:01:27.390> he<00:01:27.689> spawns

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
join basically what it does he spawns

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.380 
join basically what it does he spawns
another<00:01:28.350> one<00:01:28.560> somewhere<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.460> world<00:01:29.640> it's

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
another one somewhere in the world it's

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.660 
another one somewhere in the world it's
a<00:01:30.420> massive<00:01:30.810> world<00:01:31.020> file<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.680> empty<00:01:31.860> as

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
a massive world file and it's empty as

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.920 
a massive world file and it's empty as
soon<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.060> game<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.329> finished<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.900> will

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
soon as this game is finished it will

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
soon as this game is finished it will
just<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.170> wiped<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:34.829> other<00:01:34.979> players<00:01:35.280> can

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
just be wiped and then other players can

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280 
just be wiped and then other players can
play<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:35.970> as<00:01:36.119> well<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.200> as

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
play here as well so you can have as

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.950 
play here as well so you can have as
many<00:01:37.409> games<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.950> one<00:01:38.100> time<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.640> want<00:01:38.960> so

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
many games at one time as you want so

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.300 
many games at one time as you want so
I'll<00:01:40.049> quickly<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.470> turn<00:01:40.710> all<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:40.979> into

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
I'll quickly just turn all this into

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.850 
I'll quickly just turn all this into
blocks<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.850> try<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.090> get<00:01:42.210> across<00:01:42.649> dig<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.770> out

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
blocks and try and get across dig it out

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.590 
blocks and try and get across dig it out
and<00:01:44.100> try<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.369> get<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.670> middle<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:48.450> what

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and try and get to the middle so what

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.819 
and try and get to the middle so what
I'm<00:01:48.659> trying<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.049> at<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.229> moment<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
I'm trying to do at the moment is be the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.260 
I'm trying to do at the moment is be the
first<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.549> middle<00:01:50.759> chest<00:01:51.000> because

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
first one to the middle chest because

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.249 
first one to the middle chest because
that's<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> chest<00:01:51.869> that's<00:01:52.049> full<00:01:52.229> of

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
that's the chest that's full of

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.020 
that's the chest that's full of
everything<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.890> need<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.820> I'm<00:01:53.880> just

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
everything that you need so I'm just

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.249 
everything that you need so I'm just
digging<00:01:54.210> out<00:01:54.390> these<00:01:54.540> blocks<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.079> i'm<00:01:55.170> going

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
digging out these blocks and i'm going

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.719 
digging out these blocks and i'm going
to<00:01:55.350> start<00:01:55.740> trying<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.009> build<00:01:56.189> across<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
to start trying to build across to the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.810 
to start trying to build across to the
middle<00:01:57.000> at<00:01:57.390> least<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> head<00:01:57.960> start<00:01:58.820> ideally

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
middle at least get a head start ideally

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.429 
middle at least get a head start ideally
you'd<00:01:59.969> turn<00:02:00.210> these<00:02:00.390> into<00:02:00.630> slabs<00:02:00.960> because<00:02:01.290> then

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
you'd turn these into slabs because then

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.050 
you'd turn these into slabs because then
you<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.590> extra<00:02:01.860> blocks<00:02:02.189> that's<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.579> tip<00:02:02.820> i

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
you get extra blocks that's a tip i

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.690 
you get extra blocks that's a tip i
didn't<00:02:03.570> realize<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.290> start<00:02:04.560> with<00:02:04.710> but

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
didn't realize this to start with but

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.219 
didn't realize this to start with but
basically<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.149> start<00:02:06.210> building<00:02:06.719> across<00:02:06.899> like

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
basically you start building across like

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.139 
basically you start building across like
this<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.009> hope<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.369> no<00:02:08.640> one<00:02:08.759> else<00:02:08.879> hits

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
this and just hope that no one else hits

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.869 
this and just hope that no one else hits
you<00:02:09.300> off<00:02:09.800> so<00:02:10.800> i<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.129> keep<00:02:11.250> moving<00:02:11.400> towards

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
you off so i just keep moving towards

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.730 
you off so i just keep moving towards
the<00:02:11.940> middle

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
the middle

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.720 
the middle
come<00:02:13.460> on<00:02:13.640> for<00:02:14.510> God's<00:02:15.200> Islands<00:02:15.470> hit<00:02:15.620> me<00:02:15.770> as<00:02:16.610> you

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
come on for God's Islands hit me as you

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.040 
come on for God's Islands hit me as you
can<00:02:16.790> see<00:02:16.940> he's<00:02:17.120> fishing<00:02:17.360> me<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.630> he's<00:02:17.870> going

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
can see he's fishing me and he's going

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.470 
can see he's fishing me and he's going
to<00:02:18.110> knock<00:02:18.200> me<00:02:18.350> off<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.730> he's<00:02:19.910> not<00:02:20.060> me<00:02:20.180> off<00:02:20.270> with

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
to knock me off so he's not me off with

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.850 
to knock me off so he's not me off with
the<00:02:20.540> fishing<00:02:20.870> rod<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.230> that's<00:02:21.410> basically<00:02:21.560> the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
the fishing rod so that's basically the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.450 
the fishing rod so that's basically the
game<00:02:22.250> he's<00:02:22.910> going<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.150> kill<00:02:23.360> me<00:02:23.390> anyway<00:02:24.460> what

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
game he's going to kill me anyway what

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.070 
game he's going to kill me anyway what
I'll<00:02:25.580> do<00:02:25.700> now<00:02:25.850> is<00:02:25.880> I'll<00:02:26.150> just<00:02:26.330> teleport<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:26.960> and

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
I'll do now is I'll just teleport in and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.290 
I'll do now is I'll just teleport in and
vanish<00:02:27.440> myself<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.670> then<00:02:28.820> I'll<00:02:28.940> be<00:02:29.030> able<00:02:29.150> to

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
vanish myself so then I'll be able to

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.010 
vanish myself so then I'll be able to
spectate<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.900> game<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:31.100> TP<00:02:31.640> arc<00:02:31.850> for<00:02:32.810> some

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
spectate the game so TP arc for some

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.480 
spectate the game so TP arc for some
reason<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.380> kills<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.710> if<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:33.890> teleport<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.400> I

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
reason it kills you if you teleport in I

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.280 
reason it kills you if you teleport in I
don't<00:02:34.670> really<00:02:34.820> understand<00:02:35.210> that<00:02:35.270> but<00:02:36.200> the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
don't really understand that but the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.140 
don't really understand that but the
next<00:02:36.560> time<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.860> doesn't<00:02:37.010> so<00:02:37.430> anyway<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:37.910> mean

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
next time it doesn't so anyway I mean

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.520 
next time it doesn't so anyway I mean
vanish<00:02:38.420> mode<00:02:38.630> so<00:02:38.840> i'll<00:02:38.930> quickly<00:02:39.110> fly<00:02:39.440> around

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
vanish mode so i'll quickly fly around

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.140 
vanish mode so i'll quickly fly around
and<00:02:39.830> just<00:02:40.010> show<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.220> what's<00:02:40.490> in<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.730> chests

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
and just show you what's in the chests

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.330 
and just show you what's in the chests
and<00:02:41.300> bits<00:02:41.450> like<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.950> so<00:02:42.950> I'll<00:02:43.040> quickly<00:02:43.220> show

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
and bits like that so I'll quickly show

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.990 
and bits like that so I'll quickly show
you<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.640> middle<00:02:43.880> chest<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:45.340> am<00:02:46.340> finest<00:02:46.700> anyway

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
you the middle chest I am finest anyway

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000 
you the middle chest I am finest anyway
I'll<00:02:47.570> show<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.930> middle<00:02:48.170> chest<00:02:48.410> as<00:02:48.770> you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
I'll show you the middle chest as you

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.590 
I'll show you the middle chest as you
can<00:02:49.220> see<00:02:49.310> he's<00:02:49.520> jumped<00:02:49.880> into<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.210> void<00:02:50.330> as

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
can see he's jumped into the void as

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.760 
can see he's jumped into the void as
well<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:50.930> there's<00:02:51.080> only<00:02:51.170> two<00:02:51.380> players<00:02:51.620> left

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
well so there's only two players left

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.990 
well so there's only two players left
now<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:53.720> just<00:02:53.750> see<00:02:54.200> what<00:02:54.350> they're<00:02:54.500> up<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:55.000> but

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
now so just see what they're up to but

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.170 
now so just see what they're up to but
in<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.210> outside<00:02:56.330> Chester<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.940> few

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
in the outside Chester this is a few

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.270 
in the outside Chester this is a few
bits<00:02:59.360> so<00:02:59.630> there's<00:02:59.810> arrows<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.470> his<00:03:00.590> web<00:03:00.830> so

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
bits so there's arrows and his web so

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.850 
bits so there's arrows and his web so
you<00:03:01.370> can<00:03:01.520> turn<00:03:01.670> that<00:03:01.730> into<00:03:02.000> string<00:03:02.680> then<00:03:03.680> in

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
you can turn that into string then in

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.410 
you can turn that into string then in
the<00:03:03.920> middle<00:03:04.100> one<00:03:04.340> there's<00:03:04.610> string<00:03:04.970> the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
the middle one there's string the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.240 
the middle one there's string the
snowballs<00:03:05.990> and<00:03:06.620> there's<00:03:06.770> a<00:03:06.830> few<00:03:07.010> other<00:03:07.130> bits

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
snowballs and there's a few other bits

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.570
