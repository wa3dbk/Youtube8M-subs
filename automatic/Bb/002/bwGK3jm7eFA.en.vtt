 Character is an actress who wants 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:35.449
 but to fulfill his wishes he is capable of 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.550
 corrupt when you face the 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.420
 person who sees her as a person not like 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.239
 a trophy you can find 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 true love can capable of the 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.989
 loneliness and this departure from 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.000
 surrender to a more virtuous offer 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.800
 as a human being who is the character that 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.370
 embodies paulina gaitán because my 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.289
 character likes girls 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.140
 So that's what it's about 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.510
 movie about the wishes your wish to 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.090
 surpass your desires be better even 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.909
 your desire to be someone else maybe you 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.670
 I want to change your past and mine 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:16.630
 basically it is the desire to find a 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.140
 soulmate no then can be very 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.030
 It lasts very cruel but it is found 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.899
 soon with a key person as is 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:29.610
 she and that sword and how do you feel about 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:32.320
 make such erotic scenes 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.600
 I 'm going to tell you something when I 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.940
 I made the movie the erotic scenes 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.179
 who asks me if six and nine then 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:45.369
 there come to see her and you judge 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:48.420
 but the scenes with Pauline that is in 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:52.179
 that moment was 16 years old paulina gaitán 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.119
 and I said well if she kisses me 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.360
 I suddenly leave that I see myself directing 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.959
 true that's not me or the scooter 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.200
 16 years old was more daring than me 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:07.390
 Come and see him come and see her 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.940
 then no and what do you think it reflects 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.940
 more than anything the movie I want the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.330
 wishes is an original script by artur si 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.550
 I accept chrysler actor sweetzer is the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.440
 opera first tony zavala killer and of 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.750
 ana roth item and as a producer then 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.880
 what we try to say what it is about 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.710
 we are supported by this premium film 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.570
 which is very solid and very beautiful with 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.570
 a spectacular photograph of esteban 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.310
 of llaca that I think in Mexico if the 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.180
 academy is taken seriously where it has 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.879
 than give your ariel for this photographer 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.459
 but it's a solid movie it 's a 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:50.450
 Cute movie is a talking movie 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.879
 of the wishes as a as never when 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.150
 you want to be is very little corresponded 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.430
 Sometimes I have not wished for my neighbor 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.439
 they really want is to stretch 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.530
 stretch is towards the doctor on the corner 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.180
 and the doctor in the corner likes this 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.579
 student next door not to either 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.829
 desirable that you want I know you want from and 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.569
 we are like a kind of wheel of the 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:17.329
 fortune that we rarely coincide not 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.739
 because being desire does not connect with the 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:23.269
 spirits does not connect with souls until 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.000
 that in my character that is the most 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.370
 controversial of all finds 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.270
 someone who sees it for itself not as 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.030
 a trophy 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.480
 and that's where we see the question is , 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.530
 what the loneliness told you could open 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.170
 love can be delivered today is so much the 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.180
 loneliness suppressed so much pain there that 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.120
 not then I think the approach 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.100
 of the film of how we isolate ourselves or of 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.590
 how we wish we even want 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.590
 We will sometimes wish to erase our past 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.330
 I think it's very well posited as 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.730
 excellent and there's something else you want 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.890
 add about the movie is that 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.810
 come and see her is a beautiful movie is 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.650
 has a very nice picture is 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.650
 exquisite 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.450
 has comedy parts but we're 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.320
 betting more than a comedy we are 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.630
 betting on who we are as people 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.190
 we are not talking to the juncture 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.410
 we are not talking to issues of 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.130
 borders we are not talking to issues 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.020
 of comedy that people come and laugh 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.190
 We are betting with media for 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.320
 a comedy 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.110
 that talks about the human being about 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.480
 our soul a subject that I can understand 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.630
 an Austrian a Hispanic who can 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.360
 understand this one thing with anybody not 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.730
 we all want and we all want to love 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.900
 and being loved in the end is perfect 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.730
 thank you very much for giving us the 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.230
 opportunity to interview you and then 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.940
 we are definitely going to see the 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.870
 movie from today my name 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.870
 is lorena according to what
