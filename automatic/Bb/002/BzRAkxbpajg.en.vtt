00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
basically you wet the disc and you add a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.530 
basically you wet the disc and you add a
drop<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.740> shower<00:01:34.040> gel<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.580> shower<00:01:35.450> gel

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
will foam after turning on the epilator

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.640 
will foam after turning on the epilator
and<00:01:37.730> i<00:01:38.390> have<00:01:38.630> notice<00:01:38.990> if<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.260> lose<00:01:39.410> a<00:01:39.440> little

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
and i have notice if you lose a little

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.010 
and i have notice if you lose a little
bit<00:01:39.800> more<00:01:39.890> gel<00:01:40.700> than<00:01:40.940> just<00:01:41.150> a<00:01:41.240> drop<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:41.750> does

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
bit more gel than just a drop it does

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.460 
bit more gel than just a drop it does
make<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.410> little<00:01:42.650> bit<00:01:42.890> softer<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:45.290> bit

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
make it a little bit softer and the bit

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.810 
make it a little bit softer and the bit
you<00:01:45.590> will<00:01:45.680> really<00:01:46.010> want<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.250> know<00:01:46.400> how<00:01:46.640> much

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
you will really want to know how much

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.060 
you will really want to know how much
does<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:47.120> really<00:01:47.480> hurt<00:01:47.900> well<00:01:48.530> there's<00:01:48.950> no

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
does it really hurt well there's no

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.440 
does it really hurt well there's no
getting<00:01:49.400> away<00:01:49.490> from<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.850> fact<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:50.150> it<00:01:50.300> does

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
getting away from the fact that it does

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.190 
getting away from the fact that it does
sting<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.810> bit

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
sting a bit

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.050 
sting a bit
but<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.740> think<00:01:51.830> it's<00:01:52.160> something<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.520> would<00:01:52.820> get

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
but I think it's something you would get

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.660 
but I think it's something you would get
used<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.480> and<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:54.500> definitely<00:01:54.740> makes<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.220> huge

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
used to and it definitely makes a huge

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.820 
used to and it definitely makes a huge
difference<00:01:55.880> using<00:01:56.720> it<00:01:57.020> when<00:01:57.200> wet<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.710> with

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
difference using it when wet and with

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.580 
difference using it when wet and with
the<00:01:57.950> shower<00:01:58.100> gel<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:59.260> definitely<00:02:00.260> something

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
the shower gel and definitely something

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.680 
the shower gel and definitely something
I'd<00:02:00.710> try<00:02:00.920> again<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.460> possibly<00:02:02.240> buy<00:02:02.480> for
