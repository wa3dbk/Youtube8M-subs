00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
time during 2012 now I see extremely sad

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.690 
time during 2012 now I see extremely sad
I<00:06:44.980> know<00:06:46.260> it<00:06:47.260> is<00:06:47.470> a<00:06:47.500> possibility<00:06:47.800> that<00:06:48.490> if<00:06:48.580> you

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
I know it is a possibility that if you

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.400 
I know it is a possibility that if you
resigned<00:06:49.150> he<00:06:49.300> could<00:06:49.450> still<00:06:49.630> do<00:06:49.870> these<00:06:50.140> days

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
resigned he could still do these days

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.250 
resigned he could still do these days
because<00:06:51.400> Nash<00:06:52.120> when<00:06:52.450> he<00:06:52.600> returned<00:06:52.930> he<00:06:53.020> still

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
because Nash when he returned he still

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.990 
because Nash when he returned he still
did<00:06:53.440> some<00:06:53.620> indie<00:06:53.830> dates<00:06:54.040> that<00:06:54.250> he<00:06:54.400> was<00:06:54.640> you

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
did some indie dates that he was you

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.090 
did some indie dates that he was you
know<00:06:55.030> already<00:06:55.330> going<00:06:55.750> to<00:06:55.840> do<00:06:55.990> but<00:06:56.800> the

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 
know already going to do but the

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.880 
know already going to do but the
likelihood<00:06:57.310> of<00:06:57.670> that<00:06:57.790> is<00:06:58.140> slim<00:06:59.140> to<00:06:59.170> none<00:06:59.470> so

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
likelihood of that is slim to none so

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.770 
likelihood of that is slim to none so
sadly<00:07:00.340> it<00:07:00.730> doesn't<00:07:00.880> look<00:07:01.090> like<00:07:01.150> Morse<00:07:01.600> and

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
sadly it doesn't look like Morse and

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.390 
sadly it doesn't look like Morse and
we'll<00:07:01.960> be<00:07:02.080> coming<00:07:02.260> back<00:07:02.380> where<00:07:02.740> you<00:07:03.250> have<00:07:03.370> no

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 
we'll be coming back where you have no

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.450
