00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.080
 Yes 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.910
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.580
 Another video of me is my name 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.669
 bond buy back to the keyboard and one 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.380
 another episode of reporters this video 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.579
 Unfortunately it is not about time travel that 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.740
 from next week i promise it 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.579
 really but i would like to city only 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.259
 turn things differently 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.590
 Although four people have mine 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.090
 videos especially under the video with the 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.420
 theme of infinity and post if I am 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.719
 I think because now we are talking 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.160
 about that 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.710
 many people have but what if 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.500
 so why write it first 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.200
 I have to think twice about talking 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.180
 we talk about the concept of extraterrestrials 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.660
 of life forms that are not here 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.120
 or let's talk about the concept of the 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.680
 We visited once if we could 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.920
 concept of the visited 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.660
 really have to think about it 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.790
 visited and really this whole people 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.290
 made experiments and they changed 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.140
 you just become the culture 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.869
 visited in the sense of just times 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.329
 looked at what is and not 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.479
 happy our life changes first 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.820
 what people are watching as ufo 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.700
 For example, the location refers to Enke 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.000
 in front of a mountain and see that are colorful 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.810
 rings are less orange red purple 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.909
 yellow blablabla otherwise is dark everywhere 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.650
 only over the mountain are rings 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:43.070
 the first thing you see the ufo for what 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:45.770
 is the word ufo and known for 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.680
 this object was every one of the hinterland 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.420
 say there was an ufo I'm saying with that 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.770
 the entertainment is over for you have 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.580
 no self admitted that you no 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.320
 have a clue what was unknown at the time 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.330
 flying object as soon as you say it 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.240
 ufo you have already lost none at that time 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.590
 idea because it is unknown one knows 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.310
 I do not say so you should 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.090
 see further 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.399
 you do not know you can 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.200
 however many things explain themselves 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.220
 for example also that with the mountain and 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.680
 with the spiral colored ring at the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.800
 then the craft can stand the sun 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.630
 for oneself 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.760
 that means for yourself below 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.200
 everything dark for the mountain has become the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.750
 Sun, however, has not seen that 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.640
 It is called here to accept the earth 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.880
 here is the mountain then the sun is 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.530
 Here you are, you do not see her waving 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.160
 Police on a mountain can be seen 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.560
 still and on a mountain they form 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.180
 quite often also wanted in his ring 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.450
 Patterns that can be done by geologists 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.010
 explain why and the sun is shining 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.890
 during the sun in the sunset 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.530
 the color is formed for the clouds 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.150
 sun on the way out and how are the 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.200
 yellow orange red violet bÃ¶rdner 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.700
 scientific mystery revealed 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.430
 not really many people or the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.140
 Most people are really planning from 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.420
 what happens up there or just 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.880
 only a good understanding have the very 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.010
 surprisingly less ufos why 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.050
 the word comes 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.210
 it seems to me that ufo just that 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.390
 concept of those are here now 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.360
 Help a placeholder argument is a lot 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.010
 to say i can not explain that 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.690
 must be god otherwise says i can do it 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.820
 I do not have to explain miserable be it 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.540
 exactly what arguments with I have god 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.760
 seen or I have my miserable if you 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.380
 no idea then wants the man 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.020
 always like to have an explanation 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.180
 if he is not as fast a 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.459
 Partner said either good or e-mails 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.080
 or maybe something else 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.820
 channel and the super and what do I know 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.890
 is a placeholder argument that is 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.270
 no real explanation because many 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.650
 not they want to think people had 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.320
 just a spectacular story 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.620
 what we have second rear wall 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.320
 think about what the trading concepts are 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.850
 that would mean the implications 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.890
 from one of those including that 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.540
 that was already here but nothing 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.320
 have changed us have visited 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.959
 have seen 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.980
 oh my god the primitive vollidioten 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.470
 and flown again 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.620
 nobody can climb that one can 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.989
 do not refuse or you can 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.390
 not prove that he is actually 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.480
 The prosthesis is very nice 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.180
 as one would say at some point there was 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.360
 here one 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.610
 The sand storm took ten days 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.410
 and the whole time one night 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.960
 one can not have meant any more 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.190
 prove if two percent is where 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.630
 it even with the sandstorm 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.199
 probably ready for it there for it 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.180
 the 10th 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.180
 but that's just something we do not 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.600
 we can prove what we can do now 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.180
 go 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.930
 why do we each have aliens else 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.780
 seen somewhere 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.360
 he just has to think about how we do that 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.000
 So, actually, how do you measure how? 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.800
 even as they live the method is 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.919
 we have right now is we have 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.630
 Aligned throughout southern bowls 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.430
 and we measure or adopt comes from 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.370
 somewhere youtube because as well as 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.960
 bump or doctor ellenbeck three times 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.820
 not lost 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.289
 i know that cat is live from the extreme 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:13.120
 Russian in German therefore need 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.729
 We measure it by electromagnetic waves 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.810
 and see if they come to us in 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.550
 a certain et al 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.110
 that would mean a civilization 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.780
 has is the bar has progressed 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.910
 that they are comfortable with it's me 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.289
 However, three problems first problem 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.970
 we are not really ourselves yet 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.750
 as far as I think we really did 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.880
 Radiowaves for how many 80 90 years 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.659
 So his de we can just turn around 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.190
 to recognize who second option 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:41.199
 like no radio waves from the 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.900
 Receiving is a civilization 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.060
 which does not happen often 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.919
 maybe it's all under water 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.720
 live with four the super ex regent 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.550
 You can communicate with him on 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.840
 philosophy has everything 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.180
 but they have no use for 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.300
 macbook I mean if I'm not a normal one 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.300
 human 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.570
 they just did not connect 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.520
 Moved the lives just so perfect 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.509
 symbiosis again environment intelligent 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.770
 life is not that necessarily in the 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:10.750
 let space fly or is that 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.699
 otherwise you can have electricity on a whole 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.320
 other kind of us supplemented genc is yes 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.800
 even that my legs can be hard 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.520
 you need 20 points for that 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.030
 intelligent is relative 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.710
 it may have made its civilization 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.849
 the other idea would be and that is a lot 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:29.860
 more interesting that they are already on 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.460
 this already so far that on one 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.669
 answer 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.740
 therefore switched from 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.509
 electromagnetism and of the storm and 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.550
 so on, it can either be perfect 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:41.050
 distract that nothing in the five 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.520
 stitches waste or who have a 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.650
 completely different technology laughed at itself 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.139
 it can not time out we had my 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.440
 here 600 years an epoch that was called 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.819
 dark age this is not so because 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.580
 the sun that has happened but because 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:56.080
 The said has no science demolition 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.419
 scientist on the swiss up 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.389
 She understands there was a small one with her 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:04.030
 problem is that it can be that 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:05.620
 nobody knows what the white flowers are 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.949
 but you really know for sure 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.530
 each is a modest vollidiot 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:14.169
 for eyewitness reports though they are at 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.849
 us in the courtroom the most 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.740
 have value what I am professional 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:19.750
 only have to say in science 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.810
 I did it now was exciting semester has 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.849
 I have to come capture and storage 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.340
 it always means interesting to explain that 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:27.520
 actually in the video no 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.310
 Comments 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.340
 but what I'm saying there I have somewhere 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.080
 seen that works if 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.259
 I get a six, I have to go with it 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.599
 sound arguments work and exactly 

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:43.419
 socially that has everyone who seems there 

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:45.849
 an ufo that gives primarily to that 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:47.469
 he has no idea what it is and time 

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:49.120
 for him results in that he is too lazy 

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:52.320
 and actually still looking for 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:55.719
 because just like to have a spectacle 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.880
 while his boys until the next 

00:07:55.719 --> 00:08:00.150
 times to next week and time 

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.150
 creates
