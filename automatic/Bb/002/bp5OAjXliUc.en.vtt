hello<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.150> welcome<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:07.020> FM<00:00:07.560> B's<00:00:07.740> channel

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
hello and welcome to FM B's channel

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.940 
hello and welcome to FM B's channel
today<00:00:08.610> we<00:00:08.639> are<00:00:08.970> making<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.599> podracer<00:00:10.320> so<00:00:10.860> I'm

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
today we are making a podracer so I'm

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.890 
today we are making a podracer so I'm
just<00:00:11.160> putting<00:00:11.429> together<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.969> basic<00:00:12.450> design

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
just putting together a basic design

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.470 
just putting together a basic design
here<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.889> we<00:00:14.009> need<00:00:14.160> two<00:00:14.429> engines<00:00:14.580> at<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.089> front

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
here so we need two engines at the front

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.620 
here so we need two engines at the front
and<00:00:16.490> something<00:00:17.490> for<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> pilot<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.150> go<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.510> in

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
and something for the pilot to go in in

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.779 
and something for the pilot to go in in
the<00:00:18.720> back<00:00:18.930> okay<00:00:19.890> he's<00:00:20.070> ready<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.430> go<00:00:20.550> here

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the back okay he's ready to go here

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.689 
the back okay he's ready to go here
firing<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> engines<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.930> he's<00:00:22.380> up<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.220> he's

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
firing the engines and he's up and he's

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.700 
firing the engines and he's up and he's
back<00:00:24.000> down<00:00:24.240> okay<00:00:25.019> we'll<00:00:25.170> try<00:00:25.289> again<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.560> put

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
back down okay we'll try again we put

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.140 
back down okay we'll try again we put
some<00:00:25.800> strengthening<00:00:26.220> babes<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.880> time

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
some strengthening babes in this time

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.029 
some strengthening babes in this time
and<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.660> seems<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.170> little<00:00:28.500> bit<00:00:28.830> better

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
and it seems to be a little bit better

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.490 
and it seems to be a little bit better
but<00:00:29.400> still<00:00:29.660> gravity<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.689> getting<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.140> best<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
but still gravity is getting the best of

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.819 
but still gravity is getting the best of
it<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.460> up<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.820> go<00:00:32.910> again<00:00:33.210> oh<00:00:33.420> no<00:00:33.989> not<00:00:34.500> even<00:00:34.620> up

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
it so up and go again oh no not even up

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.590 
it so up and go again oh no not even up
that<00:00:35.040> time<00:00:35.280> but<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> mind<00:00:35.820> us<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.329> got<00:00:36.480> some

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
that time but the mind us we got some

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.650 
that time but the mind us we got some
control<00:00:37.020> services<00:00:37.620> next<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.100> wig<00:00:38.309> no<00:00:39.210> that's

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
control services next to wig no that's

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.020 
control services next to wig no that's
not<00:00:39.870> worked<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:41.070> completely<00:00:41.550> different

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
not worked so completely different

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.209 
not worked so completely different
design<00:00:42.300> now<00:00:42.570> lots<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.200> different<00:00:43.590> engines<00:00:43.980> for

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
design now lots of different engines for

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.000 
design now lots of different engines for
extra<00:00:44.579> wings<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:46.710> seems<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:48.059> flyable

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
extra wings and it seems to be flyable

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.040 
extra wings and it seems to be flyable
seems<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.309> be<00:00:50.399> kind<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.270> got<00:00:51.449> control<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.930> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
seems to be kind of got control of it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.939 
seems to be kind of got control of it
it's<00:00:53.539> no<00:00:54.539> looks<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.770> wet

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
it's no looks like it's going to be wet

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.889 
it's no looks like it's going to be wet
so<00:00:56.219> I've<00:00:56.460> added<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.789> new<00:00:56.940> safety<00:00:57.239> system<00:00:57.780> with

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
so I've added a new safety system with

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.810 
so I've added a new safety system with
this<00:00:58.020> model<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.469> help<00:00:58.770> keep<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> kerbals<00:00:59.550> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
this model to help keep the kerbals a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.670 
this model to help keep the kerbals a
little<00:01:00.390> bit<00:01:00.510> safer<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
little bit safer as you can see it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.039 
little bit safer as you can see it
checks<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> engines<00:01:02.579> clear<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.180> parachutes

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
checks the engines clear and parachutes

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.320 
checks the engines clear and parachutes
the<00:01:04.199> pot<00:01:04.379> down<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:05.309> experiment<00:01:05.939> operator

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the pot down so for experiment operator

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.969 
the pot down so for experiment operator
needs<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> user's<00:01:07.409> engines

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
needs to be on a user's engines

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.710 
needs to be on a user's engines
independently<00:01:08.880> that's<00:01:09.240> what<00:01:09.390> we're<00:01:09.540> going<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
independently that's what we're going to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.719 
independently that's what we're going to
try<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:10.290> by<00:01:10.470> turning<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:11.070> off<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.400> keeping

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
try here by turning one off and keeping

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
try here by turning one off and keeping
one<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> turns<00:01:13.110> hard<00:01:13.500> when<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.979> do

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
one on and it turns hard when you do

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.030 
one on and it turns hard when you do
that<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:15.200> entirely<00:01:16.200> sure<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.799> under

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that but entirely sure it's under

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.560 
that but entirely sure it's under
control<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.729> there<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
control in there and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.500 
control in there and
so<00:01:20.500> we've<00:01:20.860> made<00:01:20.890> a<00:01:21.370> new<00:01:21.729> version<00:01:22.030> this<00:01:22.360> is

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
so we've made a new version this is

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.170 
so we've made a new version this is
using<00:01:22.840> jet<00:01:23.170> engines<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:23.979> I'm<00:01:24.700> hoping<00:01:25.120> that

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
using jet engines and I'm hoping that

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.320 
using jet engines and I'm hoping that
this<00:01:25.390> will<00:01:25.479> be<00:01:25.570> slightly<00:01:25.960> more<00:01:26.200> controllable

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
this will be slightly more controllable

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.480 
this will be slightly more controllable
something<00:01:28.330> happens<00:01:29.140> boom<00:01:29.530> is<00:01:29.800> looking<00:01:30.190> pretty

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
something happens boom is looking pretty

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.540 
something happens boom is looking pretty
good<00:01:30.729> and<00:01:31.410> see<00:01:32.410> you<00:01:32.470> sleep<00:01:32.740> since<00:01:33.160> returning

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
good and see you sleep since returning

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.460 
good and see you sleep since returning
well<00:01:33.880> actually<00:01:34.090> it's<00:01:34.510> all<00:01:34.630> spitting<00:01:34.990> out<00:01:35.229> the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
well actually it's all spitting out the

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.469 
well actually it's all spitting out the
direction<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.670> travel<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:37.030> very<00:01:37.210> close<00:01:37.450> to

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
direction of travel is very close to

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.030 
direction of travel is very close to
where<00:01:37.720> it's<00:01:37.900> pointing<00:01:38.080> which<00:01:38.650> is<00:01:38.800> good

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
where it's pointing which is good

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.749 
where it's pointing which is good
spitting<00:01:40.000> about<00:01:40.210> there<00:01:40.450> Oh<00:01:41.460> little<00:01:42.460> bit<00:01:42.580> low

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
spitting about there Oh little bit low

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.460 
spitting about there Oh little bit low
lost<00:01:43.030> control<00:01:43.360> surface<00:01:43.869> but<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.110> doesn't<00:01:44.350> seem

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
lost control surface but it doesn't seem

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.550 
lost control surface but it doesn't seem
to<00:01:44.530> affect<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:45.520> punch<00:01:46.300> for<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.750> strange<00:01:47.290> role

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
to affect to punch for the strange role

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.400 
to affect to punch for the strange role
and<00:01:47.770> going<00:01:48.040> on<00:01:48.160> but<00:01:48.850> no<00:01:49.300> it's<00:01:49.450> pretty<00:01:49.840> good<00:01:50.170> I'm

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
and going on but no it's pretty good I'm

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.350 
and going on but no it's pretty good I'm
pretty<00:01:51.009> happy<00:01:51.280> with<00:01:51.400> this<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:51.789> think<00:01:51.850> we'll<00:01:52.330> be

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
pretty happy with this I think we'll be

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.670 
pretty happy with this I think we'll be
able<00:01:52.509> to<00:01:52.660> work<00:01:52.780> use<00:01:53.140> this<00:01:53.440> one<00:01:55.410> so<00:01:56.410> we'll<00:01:56.500> just

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
able to work use this one so we'll just

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.040 
able to work use this one so we'll just
test<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.160> safety<00:01:57.789> features<00:01:58.479> that<00:01:58.630> we<00:01:58.750> put<00:01:58.930> it

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
test the safety features that we put it

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.150 
test the safety features that we put it
on<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.289> other<00:01:59.410> version<00:01:59.619> make<00:01:59.950> sure<00:02:00.039> they

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
on the other version make sure they

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.609 
on the other version make sure they
still<00:02:00.399> work<00:02:00.610> so<00:02:01.390> actions<00:02:01.780> are<00:02:01.869> rejected<00:02:02.320> clear

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
still work so actions are rejected clear

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.859

easier<00:03:01.230> by<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.770> fact<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.220> flexes<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:02.910> the

easier by the fact that it flexes in the

easier by the fact that it flexes in the
middle<00:03:03.330> every<00:03:03.660> time<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.930> pull<00:03:04.170> up<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.560> into

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
it on the front wheels but that's pretty

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.940 
it on the front wheels but that's pretty
