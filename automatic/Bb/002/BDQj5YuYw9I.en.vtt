00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.529
 I have already learned 7 notes 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.430
 with the cut-outs I was playing with 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.430
 my parents 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.660
 It's very fun to see all of us 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:23.660
 like to show us your game 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.660
 I will show you how we have done it 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.520
 the first of all my dads are 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.080
 printing to the cards in this chapter 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.560
 this page we have prepared the 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.880
 cut out the glue the cardboard and 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.220
 scissors 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.310
 If cut-outs are easy, you can 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.040
 cut me but if they are difficult my 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.730
 dads help me because if you can not 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.730
 hurt 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.640
 once we have done everything we have two 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.970
 keyboards one with three black two black 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.420
 and three blacks and another one that is also 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:07.170
 stuck in the cardboard that has two black 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.320
 three blacks and blacks are similar 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.980
 but not the same build it has been very 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.380
 funny 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:21.090
 we have all trimmed the king the sun in 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.399
 the same missive 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.770
 and with the characters cut out and the 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:30.420
 piano cards we have put to 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.880
 play the king first as we already know 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.880
 is between the two blacks 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.500
 then there is the beaver my fa is colored 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.450
 violet and has the two blacks in the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.539
 tail to your left 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.130
 the beaver me'phaa is to the right of the 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.270
 king 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.210
 the crooked cast is the orange beaver and 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.930
 has the black keys to your right in 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.189
 the tail the beaver been is at 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:08.509
 left of the king first this has been 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:11.330
 then king and then not even fa is very easy 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.710
 and very funny 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.130
 I will put more notes aede children 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.340
 they learn watching you play 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.670
 and a blue tie is yellow 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.200
 and it's in between the three keys 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.680
 black and it's the sun 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.250
 It is also yellow but has a collar and 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.819
 is next to the sun and is in the two 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.519
 bells are always together but 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.599
 there are also bells on the other side and those 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:49.590
 bells are more serious and vision than 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:54.030
 has the blue and blue tie to is not 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.780
 where you have the necklace 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.160
 in this keyboard we have two in the acute 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:06.050
 to the right and the grave to the left 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.050
 I already have all the notes 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.730
 and I can play with my friends and my parents 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.610
 now we are going to do it with the other 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.060
 keyboard that we had built in this 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.629
 first there are two blacks after three and 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.300
 then again two blacks is the same 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:28.650
 that before 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.630
 this is the sun wearing the blue tie and 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.670
 is between the three keys 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.730
 black 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.730
 here is what slips away 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.020
 to the right of the sun is in the piece 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.510
 yellow and carries with it the bells 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.300
 They are among average of the three keys 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.710
 black 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:56.260
 the orange beaver is the beaver been me 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.560
 I have to fix where it has the tail for 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.280
 put it well the keys you have to 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.280
 your right 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.290
 the violet beaver is the beaver my fan 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.920
 as it has the tail on your left I know 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.000
 where do i have to put it 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.579
 here 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.660
 I have placed the bells in the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:24.340
 half my daughter I have been 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.750
 I just need to place the jester and the king 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.010
 I know he's in between the two 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.630
 black keys here there are two black keys 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.620
 but there are also two other black keys 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:40.970
 on the left therefore there is another king 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:44.180
 more serious and re acute and this is the rule 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.360
 that is also in between the 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.740
 two black 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.460
 see what a beautiful game 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.670
 and its so funny 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:59.260
 and you can play also on the piano 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.260
 but look how I do it 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.729
 like the pieces and look for the keyboard 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.629
 this is the silo 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.629
 and it's directed 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:16.460
 but you can also go here 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.759
 the follow can go here that is the serious one of 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.570
 here that is the acute one has to pay attention to 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.570
 the black keys 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.290
 I like to play with my parents and 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.200
 dads also like to play with you 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.890
 because they also learn with the 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.890
 cutouts
