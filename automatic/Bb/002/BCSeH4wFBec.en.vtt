now if you don't have a bait trade or
garden<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:05.970> highly<00:00:06.540> recommend<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.020> get

garden I highly recommend that you get
one<00:00:07.410> that's<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.980> fantastic<00:00:08.370> tree<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.000> the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
one that's a fantastic tree and the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.049 
one that's a fantastic tree and the
leaves<00:00:09.360> have<00:00:09.540> many<00:00:09.809> uses<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.530> cooking<00:00:11.130> believe

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
leaves have many uses in cooking believe

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.600 
leaves have many uses in cooking believe
is<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.300> very<00:00:12.389> well<00:00:13.200> center<00:00:13.620> herb<00:00:13.830> they<00:00:14.370> can<00:00:14.519> be

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
is a very well center herb they can be

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.790 
is a very well center herb they can be
used<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.269> many<00:00:15.540> dishes<00:00:15.780> but<00:00:16.440> believe<00:00:16.680> or

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
used in so many dishes but believe or

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800 
used in so many dishes but believe or
not<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:17.130> actually<00:00:17.250> expensive<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.570> buy<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
not it's actually expensive to buy the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.990 
not it's actually expensive to buy the
leaves<00:00:19.230> individually<00:00:19.800> but<00:00:20.400> it's<00:00:20.670> cheaper

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
leaves individually but it's cheaper

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.040 
leaves individually but it's cheaper
just<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.210> buy<00:00:21.270> her<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.600> tree

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
just to buy her in tree

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.779 
just to buy her in tree
I<00:00:22.080> think<00:00:22.560> what<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.710> bay<00:00:22.859> tree<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.640> she

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
I think what the bay tree is it can she

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.359 
I think what the bay tree is it can she
graft<00:00:24.029> about<00:00:24.269> 12<00:00:24.779> meters<00:00:25.170> high<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.740> as<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> herb

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
graft about 12 meters high so as a herb

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.980 
graft about 12 meters high so as a herb
plant<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.820> don't<00:00:27.000> want<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.180> grow<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.510> high<00:00:27.689> cuz

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
plant I don't want to grow that high cuz

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.240 
plant I don't want to grow that high cuz
I'll<00:00:28.380> never<00:00:28.590> use<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.800> when<00:00:29.039> he<00:00:29.099> leaves

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
I'll never use that when he leaves

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.859 
I'll never use that when he leaves
anyway<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.420> gonna<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.779> we're

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
anyway so what we gonna do is we're

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.900 
anyway so what we gonna do is we're
going<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.019> plant<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.380> into<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> pot<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.369> pot<00:00:32.730> is

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
going to plant it into a pot a pot is

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.670 
going to plant it into a pot a pot is
the<00:00:33.030> best<00:00:33.210> place<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.450> put<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> bay<00:00:33.930> tree<00:00:34.170> if<00:00:34.469> you

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the best place to put a bay tree if you

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.110 
the best place to put a bay tree if you
want<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> restrict<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.219> height<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.520> course<00:00:35.700> so

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
want to restrict the height of course so

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.340 
want to restrict the height of course so
I'm<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.329> start<00:00:36.510> by<00:00:36.660> putting<00:00:36.809> some<00:00:37.050> soil

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
I'm going to start by putting some soil

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.290 
I'm going to start by putting some soil
into<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> pot<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.610> we're<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.000> use<00:00:39.120> some

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
into the pot so we're going to use some

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.500 
into the pot so we're going to use some
good<00:00:39.450> quality<00:00:39.989> potting<00:00:40.320> mix<00:00:41.149> you<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.270> pick<00:00:42.420> up

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
good quality potting mix you can pick up

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.209 
good quality potting mix you can pick up
from<00:00:42.690> any<00:00:42.870> good<00:00:43.079> nursery<00:00:43.410> now<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.100> need

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
from any good nursery now you don't need

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.770 
from any good nursery now you don't need
to<00:00:44.280> add<00:00:44.430> any<00:00:44.670> fertilizer<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.360> cow<00:00:45.570> manure

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to add any fertilizer like cow manure

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.930 
to add any fertilizer like cow manure
because<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.320> bay<00:00:46.440> tree<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> very<00:00:47.399> resilient

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
because the bay tree is a very resilient

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.290 
because the bay tree is a very resilient
tree<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.309> make<00:00:50.670> sure<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.850> size<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.239> up

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
tree so just make sure you size it up

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.529 
tree so just make sure you size it up
right<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.620> we're<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> loosen<00:00:53.539> just

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
right so we're just going to loosen just

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.560 
right so we're just going to loosen just
draw<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> pot<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.050> by<00:00:55.199> pushing<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:56.570> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
draw the pot just by pushing it in and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.330 
draw the pot just by pushing it in and
just<00:00:57.600> give<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> quick<00:00:58.350> push<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:59.010> from<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
just give a quick push just from the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.150 
just give a quick push just from the
bottom<00:00:59.460> sounds<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:01.260> you'll<00:01:01.350> find<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
bottom sounds up and you'll find that it

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.530 
bottom sounds up and you'll find that it
should<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.609> pop<00:01:03.290> right<00:01:04.290> out<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.390> we'll<00:01:06.390> just

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
should just pop right out and we'll just

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.870 
should just pop right out and we'll just
stick<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.689> right<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.250> into<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.460> pot<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
stick that right in into the pot and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.289 
stick that right in into the pot and
it's<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.540> simple<00:01:09.780> matter<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.049> filling<00:01:10.770> in

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
it's just a simple matter of filling in

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.789 
it's just a simple matter of filling in
with<00:01:12.299> some<00:01:12.479> more<00:01:12.570> potting<00:01:12.869> mix<00:01:13.020> well<00:01:13.710> it's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
with some more potting mix well it's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.460 
with some more potting mix well it's
that<00:01:13.920> simple

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
that simple

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
that simple
now<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.650> try<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.799> keep<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> soil<00:01:17.220> at<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
now just try and keep the soil at the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.440 
now just try and keep the soil at the
same<00:01:17.700> level<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.270> what<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.810> was<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.049> pot<00:01:20.450> so

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
same level as what it was in the pot so

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.820 
same level as what it was in the pot so
all<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.869> left<00:01:22.020> now<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> give<00:01:22.770> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
all that is left now is just to give it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.410 
all that is left now is just to give it
a<00:01:22.860> very<00:01:23.070> good<00:01:23.100> water<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> help

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
a very good water and in just to help

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.240 
a very good water and in just to help
out<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.540> soil<00:01:24.930> settle<00:01:25.590> around<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.009> plant

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
out that soil settle around the plant

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.539 
out that soil settle around the plant
and<00:01:27.530> that's<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.740> need<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.130> now<00:01:29.490> the

and that's all you need to do now the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.800 
and that's all you need to do now the
only<00:01:29.729> fertilizer<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.450> you'll<00:01:30.689> probably

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
only fertilizer that you'll probably

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.690 
only fertilizer that you'll probably
need<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.500> slow-release<00:01:31.979> pallet<00:01:32.579> type

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
need is just a slow-release pallet type

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.280 
need is just a slow-release pallet type
fertilizer<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.869> sprinkle<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
soil and when it comes to watering less

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.510 
soil and when it comes to watering less
is<00:01:36.630> better<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> bay<00:01:37.770> tree<00:01:38.040> now<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
is better with the bay tree now the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.219 
is better with the bay tree now the
roots<00:01:38.729> are<00:01:38.880> very<00:01:38.909> susceptible<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.689> rot<00:01:39.990> so

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
roots are very susceptible to rot so

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.050 
roots are very susceptible to rot so
it's<00:01:40.500> actually<00:01:40.740> better<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.009> under<00:01:41.430> water<00:01:41.670> than

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
it's actually better to under water than

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.910 
it's actually better to under water than
over<00:01:42.450> water<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> bay<00:01:42.899> tree<00:01:43.140> which<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.799> also

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
over water the bay tree which is also

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.440 
over water the bay tree which is also
another<00:01:44.310> reason<00:01:44.579> why<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.939> perfect<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.390> our

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
another reason why it's perfect in our

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
another reason why it's perfect in our
pots<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:46.020> even<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.470> dries<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:46.860> it's

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
pots because even if it dries out it's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.770 
pots because even if it dries out it's
still<00:01:47.729> gonna<00:01:47.850> be<00:01:47.939> fine<00:01:48.180> obviously<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.720> it

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
still gonna be fine obviously if it

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.600 
still gonna be fine obviously if it
dries<00:01:48.960> out<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.290> give<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> quick<00:01:49.590> water<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.430> as

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
dries out just give a quick water but as

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.429 
dries out just give a quick water but as
I<00:01:50.820> said<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.060> don't<00:01:51.479> overdo<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.049> your<00:01:52.290> bay

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439
