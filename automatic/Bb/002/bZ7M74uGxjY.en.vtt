a<00:01:38.100> replay<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:38.880> actually<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.570> think<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
a replay but actually I think this is

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.569 
a replay but actually I think this is
set<00:01:40.200> when<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:40.590> they<00:01:40.680> jumped<00:01:40.950> right<00:01:41.280> into

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
set when I think they jumped right into

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.819 
set when I think they jumped right into
this<00:01:41.850> I'm<00:01:42.299> July<00:01:42.810> surg<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> course<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.619> zerg

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
this I'm July surg is of course the zerg

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.219 
this I'm July surg is of course the zerg
and<00:01:44.009> i<00:01:44.159> love<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:45.030> cheater<00:01:45.360> turned<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> big

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.270 
and i love the cheater turned the big
dog<00:01:46.920> he<00:01:47.640> was<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.180> good<00:01:48.659> he<00:01:48.689> had<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.259> best<00:01:49.680> tvz

win<00:01:50.460> streak<00:01:50.759> everything<00:01:51.210> was<00:01:51.299> 27<00:01:51.869> games<00:01:52.020> I

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
win streak everything was 27 games I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.899 
win streak everything was 27 games I
think<00:01:52.380> some<00:01:52.619> people<00:01:52.979> contestant<00:01:53.700> might<00:01:53.790> have

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
think some people contestant might have

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.389 
think some people contestant might have
an<00:01:53.970> 18<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.450> something<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.920> all<00:01:56.040> depends

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
an 18 or something and it all depends

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.190 
an 18 or something and it all depends
upon<00:01:56.549> whether<00:01:56.850> or<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.240> count<00:01:57.570> certain

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
upon whether or not you count certain

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.929 
upon whether or not you count certain
leagues<00:01:58.710> or<00:01:59.070> not<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.490> don't<00:01:59.729> count

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
leagues or not if you don't count

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.990 
leagues or not if you don't count
certain<00:02:00.450> leagues<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.560> jumps<00:02:01.950> up<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.250> 27

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
certain leagues and it jumps up like 27

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.819 
certain leagues and it jumps up like 27
or<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.780> do<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.259> drops<00:02:04.439> down<00:02:04.560> like

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
or so if you do that it drops down like

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.280 
or so if you do that it drops down like
18<00:02:05.250> but<00:02:05.490> either<00:02:05.729> way<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.750> absolutely

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
18 but either way it's just absolutely

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.979 
18 but either way it's just absolutely
insane<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.729> these<00:02:09.209> two<00:02:09.360> players<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.810> met<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
insane and these two players have met a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.500 
insane and these two players have met a
lot<00:02:10.379> before<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.800> just<00:02:11.129> looks<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:12.000> I'm<00:02:12.300> just

GG wow that was pretty awesome I
honestly<00:05:51.569> thought<00:05:51.900> that<00:05:51.960> was<00:05:52.319> some<00:05:52.500> sort<00:05:52.620> of

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
honestly thought that was some sort of

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.279 
honestly thought that was some sort of
like<00:05:52.979> a<00:05:53.190> game<00:05:54.060> from<00:05:54.330> the<00:05:54.509> past<00:05:54.870> if<00:05:55.110> they<00:05:55.229> were

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
like a game from the past if they were

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.860 
like a game from the past if they were
that<00:05:55.409> they<00:05:55.830> were<00:05:56.120> showing<00:05:57.120> it<00:05:57.240> was<00:05:57.360> came<00:05:57.719> out

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
that they were showing it was came out

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.689 
that they were showing it was came out
so<00:05:58.289> quickly<00:05:58.740> I<00:05:58.949> didn't<00:05:59.219> realize<00:05:59.430> that<00:05:59.460> was

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
so quickly I didn't realize that was

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.089 
so quickly I didn't realize that was
actual<00:06:00.240> Gabe<00:06:00.449> but<00:06:00.719> I'm<00:06:00.870> at<00:06:01.319> first<00:06:01.680> there<00:06:01.860> sorry

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.559 
about that but yeah July's are taking a
game<00:06:05.039> 1<00:06:05.250> and<00:06:05.279> I<00:06:05.550> find<00:06:05.789> her<00:06:05.909> some<00:06:06.090> curry<00:06:06.360> and<00:06:06.509> I

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 
game 1 and I find her some curry and I

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.629 
game 1 and I find her some curry and I
would<00:06:06.840> translate<00:06:07.289> for<00:06:07.620> you<00:06:07.710> what<00:06:07.889> he's<00:06:08.279> saying

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
would translate for you what he's saying

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.670 
would translate for you what he's saying
in<00:06:08.880> terms<00:06:08.909> of<00:06:09.300> the<00:06:09.449> game<00:06:09.599> but<00:06:09.779> I<00:06:09.930> can't<00:06:10.229> so<00:06:10.500> I'm

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
in terms of the game but I can't so I'm

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.350 
in terms of the game but I can't so I'm
not<00:06:10.860> but<00:06:11.430> it<00:06:11.520> looks<00:06:11.669> like<00:06:11.849> these<00:06:11.969> two<00:06:12.090> are<00:06:12.300> just

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
not but it looks like these two are just

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.029 
not but it looks like these two are just
gonna<00:06:12.509> play<00:06:12.750> normal<00:06:13.289> games<00:06:13.440> I<00:06:13.590> guess<00:06:13.919> they

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
gonna play normal games I guess they

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.430 
gonna play normal games I guess they
don't<00:06:14.159> really<00:06:14.340> have<00:06:14.639> anything<00:06:14.909> um<00:06:15.380> on<00:06:16.380> the

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
don't really have anything um on the

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.559 
don't really have anything um on the
line<00:06:17.370> would<00:06:17.580> be<00:06:17.639> my<00:06:17.909> guess<00:06:18.120> I<00:06:18.330> don't<00:06:18.509> know

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:18.569 
line would be my guess I don't know

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:19.879 
line would be my guess I don't know
can't<00:06:18.900> really<00:06:19.020> tell<00:06:19.289> I<00:06:19.349> think<00:06:19.590> I<00:06:19.650> just<00:06:19.800> play

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
can't really tell I think I just play

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:20.809 
can't really tell I think I just play
for<00:06:20.069> pride<00:06:20.159> because<00:06:20.430> they're<00:06:20.520> playing<00:06:20.759> very

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
for pride because they're playing very

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.339 
for pride because they're playing very
very<00:06:21.150> seriously<00:06:21.509> july's<00:06:21.779> I<00:06:21.870> just<00:06:22.080> went<00:06:22.289> for

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349 
very seriously july's I just went for

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.709 
very seriously july's I just went for
the<00:06:22.620> win<00:06:23.009> and<00:06:23.039> I<00:06:23.250> love<00:06:23.430> just<00:06:23.759> GG<00:06:24.120> normally<00:06:24.569> so

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:24.719 
the win and I love just GG normally so

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:27.170 
the win and I love just GG normally so
I'm<00:06:25.380> feeling<00:06:25.620> that<00:06:25.889> they're<00:06:26.009> not<00:06:26.190> dumb<00:06:26.460> doing

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
I'm feeling that they're not dumb doing

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.700 
I'm feeling that they're not dumb doing
anything<00:06:27.360> too<00:06:27.599> special<00:06:27.810> and<00:06:28.289> by<00:06:28.409> the<00:06:28.440> way<00:06:28.590> this

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
anything too special and by the way this

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.540 
anything too special and by the way this
is<00:06:28.860> all<00:06:29.069> in<00:06:29.310> one<00:06:29.550> video<00:06:29.969> so<00:06:30.740> hopefully<00:06:31.740> I<00:06:32.159> guess

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
is all in one video so hopefully I guess

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.800 
is all in one video so hopefully I guess
I<00:06:32.639> could<00:06:32.789> just<00:06:32.909> stop<00:06:33.120> this<00:06:33.270> here<00:06:33.449> and<00:06:33.569> sit<00:06:33.690> at

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
I could just stop this here and sit at

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.079 
I could just stop this here and sit at
the<00:06:33.870> next<00:06:34.080> video<00:06:34.289> once<00:06:34.409> the<00:06:34.529> next<00:06:34.680> game<00:06:35.089> starts

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:36.089 
the next video once the next game starts

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:38.120 
the next video once the next game starts
I've<00:06:36.779> no<00:06:37.110> idea<00:06:37.199> how<00:06:37.409> long<00:06:37.560> it<00:06:37.740> is<00:06:37.800> until<00:06:37.889> the

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
I've no idea how long it is until the

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.170 
I've no idea how long it is until the
next<00:06:38.310> one<00:06:38.430> goes<00:06:38.550> so<00:06:38.639> we're<00:06:38.759> just<00:06:38.789> gonna<00:06:38.940> cut

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
next one goes so we're just gonna cut

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.730 
next one goes so we're just gonna cut
off<00:06:39.270> here<00:06:39.449> we're<00:06:39.570> gonna<00:06:39.659> go<00:06:39.839> on<00:06:39.930> to

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
off here we're gonna go on to

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.999 
off here we're gonna go on to
set<00:06:41.610> two<00:06:41.910> of<00:06:42.120> this<00:06:42.210> best<00:06:42.449> of<00:06:42.690> three<00:06:43.259> series<00:06:43.289> and

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009 
set two of this best of three series and

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:45.499 
set two of this best of three series and
I<00:06:44.460> mean<00:06:44.639> I<00:06:44.699> guess<00:06:44.729> I'll<00:06:45.030> see<00:06:45.240> you<00:06:45.300> guys<00:06:45.389> all

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
there hopefully there's not too much in

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.090 
there hopefully there's not too much in
between<00:06:47.550> stuff
