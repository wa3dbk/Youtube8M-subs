that what does this what is this record
-<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.380> uses<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> new<00:02:02.070> xqd<00:02:02.640> media<00:02:03.060> we're<00:02:03.990> also

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
- this uses the new xqd media we're also

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.440 
- this uses the new xqd media we're also
at<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.560> same<00:02:04.740> time<00:02:04.799> going<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.340> launch<00:02:05.490> xqd<00:02:06.210> s

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
at the same time going to launch xqd s

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.570 
at the same time going to launch xqd s
so<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.380> will<00:02:07.469> be<00:02:07.590> available<00:02:07.680> around

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
people might say why should I gonna buy

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.950 
people might say why should I gonna buy
a<00:02:13.170> 4k<00:02:13.680> camera<00:02:14.070> now<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.550> all<00:02:15.180> my<00:02:15.360> outputs<00:02:15.780> gonna

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
a 4k camera now but all my outputs gonna

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.700 
a 4k camera now but all my outputs gonna
be<00:02:16.170> in<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.590> know<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.800> 1010<00:02:17.460> 1080<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:19.440> there

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
be in you know in 1010 1080 so is there

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.770 
be in you know in 1010 1080 so is there
a<00:02:19.740> workflow<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.640> they<00:02:20.820> can<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.390> know<00:02:21.420> still

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
a workflow that they can you know still

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.600 
a workflow that they can you know still
output<00:02:22.680> internet<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.070> can<00:02:23.100> they<00:02:23.250> plug<00:02:23.490> this

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
output internet it can they plug this

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.130 
output internet it can they plug this
into<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.880> 1080<00:02:24.270> monitor<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.780> not<00:02:24.870> have<00:02:24.990> to<00:02:25.080> have

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
into a 1080 monitor and not have to have

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.900 
into a 1080 monitor and not have to have
a<00:02:25.200> 4k<00:02:25.620> monitor<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.100> how<00:02:26.160> does<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.310> work<00:02:26.520> yeah

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
a 4k monitor and how does that work yeah

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.700 
a 4k monitor and how does that work yeah
that's<00:02:27.150> right<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.450> can<00:02:27.630> monitor<00:02:27.990> in<00:02:28.110> HD<00:02:28.500> but

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
that's right you can monitor in HD but

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.620 
that's right you can monitor in HD but
you<00:02:28.800> can<00:02:28.920> also<00:02:29.070> shoot<00:02:29.460> in<00:02:29.670> HD<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.210> want<00:02:30.420> so

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
you can also shoot in HD if you want so

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.810 
you can also shoot in HD if you want so
it<00:02:30.720> has<00:02:30.870> X<00:02:31.110> AVC<00:02:31.560> HD<00:02:31.740> but<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:32.550> couldn't

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
it has X AVC HD but you couldn't

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.640 
it has X AVC HD but you couldn't
obviously<00:02:32.940> we<00:02:33.300> suspect<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.230> people<00:02:34.380> would

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
obviously we suspect that people would

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.090 
obviously we suspect that people would
want<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.040> shoot<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.520> 4k<00:02:36.740> 500<00:02:37.740> megabits<00:02:38.010> per

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
want to shoot in 4k 500 megabits per

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.830 
want to shoot in 4k 500 megabits per
second<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.670> then<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.150> once<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.570> get<00:02:39.750> it

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
second and then you once you get it

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.270 
second and then you once you get it
inside<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.350> editor<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.800> can<00:02:40.950> do<00:02:41.100> whatever

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
inside the editor you can do whatever

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.140 
inside the editor you can do whatever
you<00:02:41.490> like<00:02:41.520> with<00:02:41.700> it

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
you like with it

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.270 
you like with it

prosumer market yeah very much so so
with<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.240> prefer<00:02:57.510> consumer<00:02:58.440> unit<00:02:58.740> which<00:02:58.860> I've

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
with the prefer consumer unit which I've

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.250 
with the prefer consumer unit which I've
got<00:02:59.190> here<00:02:59.250> very<00:02:59.820> much<00:03:00.360> it's<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.660> similar<00:03:00.959> camera

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
got here very much it's a similar camera

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.150 
got here very much it's a similar camera
as<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.350> can<00:03:01.560> see<00:03:01.650> there's<00:03:01.830> very<00:03:01.860> little

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
as you can see there's very little

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.610 
as you can see there's very little
difference<00:03:02.670> but<00:03:03.270> here<00:03:03.570> what<00:03:03.840> we're<00:03:04.020> using<00:03:04.260> is

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
difference but here what we're using is

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.680 
difference but here what we're using is
the<00:03:05.430> X<00:03:05.580> ABC<00:03:06.060> s<00:03:06.270> codec<00:03:06.810> which<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.290> long<00:03:07.620> got<00:03:07.920> 4k

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
the X ABC s codec which is a long got 4k

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.990 
the X ABC s codec which is a long got 4k
codec<00:03:09.690> 4<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.110> 0<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.740> lower<00:03:11.220> bit<00:03:11.459> rate<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.670> about

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
codec 4 to 0 a lower bit rate of about

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.090 
codec 4 to 0 a lower bit rate of about
50<00:03:12.390> megabits<00:03:12.750> per<00:03:12.810> second<00:03:13.260> obviously<00:03:13.980> the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
50 megabits per second obviously the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.160 
50 megabits per second obviously the
consumer<00:03:14.430> 500<00:03:15.209> megabits<00:03:15.480> per<00:03:15.600> second<00:03:15.989> is<00:03:16.050> an

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
consumer 500 megabits per second is an

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.350 
consumer 500 megabits per second is an
awful<00:03:16.530> lot<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.650> data<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.550> this<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:17.850> aiming<00:03:18.209> at

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
awful lot of data so this is aiming at

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.590 
awful lot of data so this is aiming at
the<00:03:18.480> high-end<00:03:18.739> consumer<00:03:19.739> market<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.940> but<00:03:21.450> you

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
the high-end consumer market and but you

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.030 
the high-end consumer market and but you
know<00:03:21.720> it's<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.930> 4k<00:03:22.260> camcorder<00:03:22.800> for<00:03:22.980> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
know it's a 4k camcorder for the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.310 
know it's a 4k camcorder for the
consumer<00:03:23.550> so<00:03:24.269> they<00:03:24.390> can<00:03:24.540> plug<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.870> in<00:03:25.019> using

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
consumer so they can plug it in using

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.100 
consumer so they can plug it in using
HDMI<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.070> directly<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.180> their<00:03:27.360> 4k<00:03:27.720> previa
