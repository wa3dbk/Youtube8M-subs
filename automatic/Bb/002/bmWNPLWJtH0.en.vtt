00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.779
 let's go with the dream to take care of the case 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:05.070
 by ariel ortega adrián as we are very 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.960
 good morning 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.240
 but they knew it good day good I'll tell you 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.580
 what moments of a lot of tension and 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.190
 Anguish lived Ariel 'Burrito' Ortega 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.250
 he was the victim of an express kidnapping 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.170
 next to his counter this was Sunday 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.410
 At dawn, he was driving with his vehicle 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.509
 a bmw down the street guaira to where 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.920
 we are located at the height of 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.170
 the avenue of the liberator was 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.300
 intercepted fabian attention with this 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.180
 by five people who got out of a 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.340
 audi with machine guns with different 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.890
 good weapons forced him to the hat 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.320
 Ortega and that counter to move to 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.450
 back seat or circulated several 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.329
 blocks are said that the time of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.070
 kidnapping express was fabian 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.600
 about an hour the truth is 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.879
 that the criminals took away 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.039
 of your vehicle the cell phones of 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.199
 counter I scream ortega and also the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.210
 money that he was carrying 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.820
 but there was another version that came up 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.710
 last hours apparently fabian this what 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.719
 let's check when we talk to the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.090
 of ortega apparently the burrito ortega 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.770
 he says good look alive three blocks 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.479
 the criminals are told because they do not 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.340
 we go to my house and he gave them the money 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.979
 what do I have like this 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.280
 the criminals accept the proposal of 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.039
 Ortega go to the house of the bonito 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.840
 ortega ariel goes down I entered his house 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.659
 but as good criminals who do not 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.549
 He left because he was afraid the police would arrive 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.950
 directly abandons criminals 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.350
 they force the accountant to get off the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.479
 vehicle and they already escape with the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.759
 ariel ortega vehicle I reiterate 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.829
 then there are two versions version 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.929
 that directly intercept him in this 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.939
 corner they take them to pick up 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.610
 different ATMs to 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.069
 go through different ATMs surely 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.259
 to extract money from there but they never go 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.119
 at home but tensions we observe 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.280
 ask fabian to see if it is like that if 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.170
 after spinning so many nettles 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.750
 they tell them we go to my house to look for the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.299
 Missing money and how it does not come out 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.819
 of your home and for fear that it arrives 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.789
 the police is that the criminals are 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.519
 they scare they abandon the accountant and they 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.229
 they carry the bm w this we're going to 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.290
 corroborate in a few minutes if 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.550
 we have access to talk to him with 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.460
 the former player 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.870
 but already this is so extremely 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.210
 investigated at least is trying 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.280
 the police to investigate what it was that 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:29.700
 happened there 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.770
 the vertigo lives here some 4 supports a 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.400
 block from this place in mountaineers to 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.430
 3000 lives the burrito ortega here was the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.800
 moment of the contra and they intercept it 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.870
 these five heavily armed people 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.880
 but you have to see what happened if 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.550
 really he invites them to 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.440
 delinquents to go to their house that was going 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.350
 delivering the money or was it 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.600
 directly an hour circulating by 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.970
 this area the criminals and the burrito 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.880
 Ortega the counter above this one 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.489
 wv that in parentheses I comment is a 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.470
 auto an exclusive model they told me there 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.530
 very few people who have it in the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.769
 country would be costing about 500 thousand 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.600
 weights this vehicle and mentally a 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.510
 data that added to me that there was 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.950
 bought on Saturday this vehicle and 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.630
 it was here then where are we seeing 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.420
 we are seeing a very nice picture on 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.360
 nacho car good day 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.819
 good morning that you drill good day good 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.769
 Very cute day auto Ortega can only 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.360
 buy if you want and not what you are 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.250
 pleasure 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.170
 this is the car is a striking car there 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.000
 that to say also which does not enable 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.510
 to be robbed of course of course there is a 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.320
 striking thing they just delivered it 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.210
 to the car on Saturday , Saturday 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.400
 they delivered it and this happened on Sunday 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.680
 am 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.660
 that's why we're also investigating 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.090
 well what happened was really 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.920
 because you also have to think if ariel 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.920
 Ortega invites the criminals of the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.080
 good house also no one has to 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.459
 really think what you are doing and 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.380
 if it is really the criminals 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.270
 they accepted and why they accepted and the 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.520
 delinquents at the door of the house of 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.830
 ávila ortega is an area I was 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.720
 itching there are many cameras is us 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.430
 to see the production of the channel I talk to 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.090
 Ortega in private order said 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.090
 I did not want to talk 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.940
 I tell you 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:27.990
 in 2007 if I remember correctly he 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.539
 had a feature fact also 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.009
 tradition road these characteristics what 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.590
 who told us what the experts say 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.860
 adriano is that this type of incident 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.400
 let's say you get up on the street that 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.870
 the famous classic takes you one hour 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.410
 'express' kidnapping insecurity in your 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.490
 more classic way is very common now you 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.349
 they will say good I knew it was very 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.150
 common but it seems to be the most 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.190
 repeated 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.590
 it would seem that you are there is a listing 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.800
 It seems crime is among the 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.870
 three most common you go in your car 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.000
 you get on two or three criminals 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.640
 they force you at an ATM to your 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.470
 you get the money sometimes you get 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.470
 they steal the car other times not according to the 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.030
 car in question or in the case of 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.700
 woman they steal her wallet and they continue in 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.190
 motorbikes are alternatives all made 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.700
 criminals who link links to a 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.700
 auto no 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.080
 with what you comment 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.689
 I had been circulating for 15 days 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.789
 well just like that coming to 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:33.639
 to the life of holy faith and live that 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:36.249
 moment when I am on a motorcycle 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.559
 it's enough of the bike obviously 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:41.169
 accompanied by another to break the glass 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:42.549
 now to the woman who was driving the 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.229
 extra in the wallet and escape 

00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:46.389
 quickly that is a modality that 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:50.619
 is also being seen and quite by the 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:52.949
 good zone adrián we already come thanks to 

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:52.949
 late
