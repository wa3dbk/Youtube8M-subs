seconds that is a pretty big increase if

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.260 
seconds that is a pretty big increase if
you<00:01:06.960> play<00:01:07.260> ghost<00:01:07.590> mode<00:01:07.799> because<00:01:07.979> often<00:01:08.909> you'll

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
you play ghost mode because often you'll

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.670 
you play ghost mode because often you'll
get<00:01:09.570> killed<00:01:09.750> while<00:01:09.990> you're<00:01:10.110> reloading<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
get killed while you're reloading and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.010 
get killed while you're reloading and
the<00:01:11.549> m4<00:01:11.880> spring<00:01:12.210> also<00:01:12.420> does<00:01:12.659> one<00:01:12.780> hundred

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the m4 spring also does one hundred

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.780 
the m4 spring also does one hundred
percent<00:01:13.049> wallbang<00:01:13.740> damage<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.430> you'll<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
percent wallbang damage so you'll get a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.020 
percent wallbang damage so you'll get a
hundred<00:01:14.970> percent<00:01:15.119> damage<00:01:15.600> through<00:01:16.080> boxes<00:01:17.030> so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
hundred percent damage through boxes so

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.210 
hundred percent damage through boxes so
the<00:01:18.420> same<00:01:18.659> damage<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.590> would<00:01:19.680> do<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.070> if

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the same damage that you would do is if

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.160 
the same damage that you would do is if
you<00:01:20.310> aren't<00:01:20.520> shooting<00:01:20.640> through<00:01:20.939> boxes<00:01:21.299> this

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you aren't shooting through boxes this

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.609 
you aren't shooting through boxes this
can<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.500> very<00:01:23.100> useful<00:01:24.259> basically<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.409> can

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
can be very useful basically you can

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.550 
can be very useful basically you can
kill<00:01:26.119> enemies<00:01:27.119> without<00:01:27.570> them<00:01:27.900> being<00:01:28.140> able<00:01:28.470> to

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
kill enemies without them being able to

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.609 
kill enemies without them being able to
kill<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.950> which<00:01:29.820> helps<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.420> lot<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.439> is

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
kill you which helps a lot and this is

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.140 
kill you which helps a lot and this is
the<00:01:31.770> only<00:01:31.979> m4a1<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.450> has<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.110> capability

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
the only m4a1 that has that capability

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.340 
the only m4a1 that has that capability
for<00:01:36.150> search<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.479> destroy<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.140> probably

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
for search and destroy this is probably

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.289 
for search and destroy this is probably
the<00:01:37.560> best<00:01:37.740> m4a1<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.759> get<00:01:38.939> because

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the best m4a1 that you can get because

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.990 
the best m4a1 that you can get because
of<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> shorter<00:01:39.900> reload<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> lobby

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.730 
of the shorter reload in the lobby
personally<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.299> next<00:01:42.659> time<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.229> comes<00:01:43.500> out

which<00:01:58.829> helps<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.140> faster<00:02:01.140> reload

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460

which helps in the faster reload
the<00:02:03.330> only<00:02:03.479> problem<00:02:03.720> is<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.650> run<00:02:05.640> out<00:02:05.760> of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the only problem is you run out of

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.779 
the only problem is you run out of
bullets<00:02:05.970> faster<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.009> just<00:02:08.009> don't<00:02:08.160> constantly

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
bullets faster so just don't constantly

no surprises this is the best m4a1 you
can<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:15.690> as<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.380> basically<00:02:16.770> said<00:02:17.100> already<00:02:18.920> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
can get as I basically said already the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.670 
can get as I basically said already the
shorter<00:02:20.730> reload<00:02:21.120> helps<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.750> lot<00:02:22.050> in<00:02:22.110> ghost<00:02:22.470> mode

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
shorter reload helps a lot in ghost mode

shorter reload helps a lot in ghost mode
as<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.980> said<00:02:23.630> Oh<00:02:24.630> up<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.470> think<00:02:25.709> even<00:02:26.459> more<00:02:26.580> than

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
as I said Oh up I think even more than

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.620 
as I said Oh up I think even more than
the<00:02:26.790> other<00:02:26.940> modes<00:02:27.180> personally<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:29.630> for

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
the other modes personally and for

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.570 
the other modes personally and for
mutation<00:02:31.200> mode<00:02:31.350> or<00:02:31.530> he<00:02:31.709> remote<00:02:32.010> or<00:02:32.220> whatever

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580

you<00:02:32.760> want<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.030> play<00:02:33.239> um<00:02:34.250> I'd<00:02:35.250> say<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:35.550> is<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
you want to play um I'd say this is the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.009 
you want to play um I'd say this is the
best<00:02:35.880> time<00:02:36.090> before<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.360> won<00:02:36.570> because<00:02:36.780> once

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
best time before I won because once

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.190 
best time before I won because once
again<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.440> reload<00:02:37.739> time<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:39.540> pretty<00:02:39.989> much

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
again the reload time and pretty much

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.050 
again the reload time and pretty much
basically<00:02:40.709> just<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:43.290> can<00:02:43.550> reload<00:02:44.550> and

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
basically just that you can reload and

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.040 
basically just that you can reload and
keep<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.989> meeting<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.380> wait<00:02:46.530> longer<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.920> guess

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
keep the meeting so wait longer I guess

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.900 
keep the meeting so wait longer I guess
it<00:02:49.050> does<00:02:49.230> run<00:02:49.410> out<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.560> ammo<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.190> bit<00:02:50.430> faster<00:02:50.850> I

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
it does run out of ammo a bit faster I

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.790 
it does run out of ammo a bit faster I
guess<00:02:51.150> because<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.720> reload<00:02:51.989> time<00:02:52.019> but<00:02:52.590> I

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
guess because of the reload time but I

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.400 
guess because of the reload time but I
think<00:02:53.100> overall<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.640> good<00:02:54.209> thing<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:57.410> would

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
think overall it's a good thing I would

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.150 
think overall it's a good thing I would
rather<00:02:58.830> use<00:02:59.220> any<00:02:59.790> AK<00:03:00.390> over<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:00.900> though<00:03:01.170> maybe

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
rather use any AK over this though maybe

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.979 
rather use any AK over this though maybe
not<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.550> regular<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:03.150> came<00:03:03.450> at<00:03:03.600> any<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.900> the

not the regular I came at any of the

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.690 
not the regular I came at any of the
other<00:03:04.110> one<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:06.690> I'd<00:03:07.079> rather<00:03:07.680> use<00:03:07.950> machine

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
other one and I'd rather use machine

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.630 
other one and I'd rather use machine

Gatling gun or whatever and that brings

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.560 
Gatling gun or whatever and that brings

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
for the regular one just like mutation

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.640 
for the regular one just like mutation
