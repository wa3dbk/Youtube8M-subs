00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello 600 don't make a pen 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:18.359
 do and prepare do do chopped 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:23.779
 cleaned her stabbed with squares tortured 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.779
 hot water a little glue pva and politics 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:38.640
 instructions and this top tighten but 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:47.270
 while doing this trial work turned out 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:47.270
 strong window it will be still how we do 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.350
 We look on fibers one should go so 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.390
 2 she parallel tasuta 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.390
 it will go like this 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.710
 we set down 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.970
 coming again also making a hole 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:42.030
 do not to tear because it is a lie 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:48.590
 thomas when punch so immediately she 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:53.729
 and cleaner less here remains all sorts 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:57.800
 gaps here are the remnants of the punishment of these yet 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.800
 remains when you punch a hole 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.180
 So 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.290
 served 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.329
 Well, in general, so the process goes all this 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.500
 long 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:44.040
 Boarding will then have to insert and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.810
 boil probably boil tighten in 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.870
 In general, everything and so dried my bark 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.810
 On the battery, well , I did not fail long there 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.930
 probably 15 minutes 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:02.269
 Well maybe a little more and were spent to 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.470
 the battery threw dried what I want to say 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.040
 It turned out like this 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.889
 pyramid that he goes under the cone 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.049
 narrowing why because I didn't mark 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.989
 her 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:18.299
 squares on the eye cut a little more 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.549
 a little less by itself and it turned out 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.920
 so but still there on the handle she's all 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.940
 the same goes for the cone that is ok 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:32.549
 nothing terrible and still layers turned out 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:34.940
 not very even nude especially here 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.930
 lower in arc 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.440
 why did they come out now show 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.560
 tightened clamps here such kai 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.900
 homemade and when cooked but this 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.379
 the panel also opens naturally 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:56.250
 swells and when after boiling began 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:59.940
 tighten this bottom sheet 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:03.180
 he was led by a wave 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.000
 well, respectively, it also happened 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.919
 he was standing like that and thatâ€™s the wave 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.489
 it turned out that he wants to say therefore 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:19.019
 so you need to put some pieces of iron 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:22.729
 iron plates thicker than millimeters 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:27.210
 probably again 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:31.530
 45 millimeter plates think so into 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:34.139
 will not be but this is a test version here 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.130
 I did it before I did it too 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.930
 this one in clamp 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.949
 it's a smaller piece and he doesn't 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:45.130
 led and they even layers relatively 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:48.820
 Although, too, curves slightly and he himself 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.310
 imagine that you are going so well 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.740
 on the handle will still be processed I will look there 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.740
 there is a workpiece forged 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:03.250
 I'll add suvel there too 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:07.620
 birch add here forward add 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:13.419
 the blade of u will go so well the whole 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:16.750
 so here we turned composing stick 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:21.490
 not yet handle the workpiece under the studs here 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.500
 This convenient pass-through the way it is 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.560
 it turns out not necessary then 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.620
 drill to cut that detailed immediately 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:35.380
 exactly and it turns out 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:39.690
 hole advise put huskies if 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:43.030
 I liked it if I did not like it 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:47.639
 wait for the continuation by clicking like this with this 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.639
 handle with this bark all all bye
