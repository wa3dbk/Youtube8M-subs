the<00:00:44.199> tuning<00:00:44.589> is<00:00:45.010> strange<00:00:45.370> it's<00:00:45.640> C<00:00:46.739> G<00:00:48.390> C<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.649> to

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
the tuning is strange it's C G C so to

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:59.680 
the tuning is strange it's C G C so to
drop<00:00:51.039> C<00:00:51.249> concepts

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.939 

and<00:01:00.690> D<00:01:01.010> those<00:01:02.010> last<00:01:02.250> three<00:01:02.519> strings<00:01:02.850> are<00:01:03.949> tuned

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
and D those last three strings are tuned

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.370 
and D those last three strings are tuned
to<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.129> chord<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:06.270> that's<00:01:06.479> one<00:01:06.869> reason<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.290> would

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
to a chord so that's one reason it would

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.749 
to a chord so that's one reason it would
be<00:01:07.470> tricky<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.920> figure<00:01:08.040> out<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.460> gotta<00:01:08.610> know

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
be tricky to figure out you gotta know

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.330 
be tricky to figure out you gotta know
the<00:01:08.880> tuning<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.780> forth<00:01:10.320> fret<00:01:10.530> bar<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.159> on
