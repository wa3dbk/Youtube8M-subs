and this is a line that it makes but I

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.459 
and this is a line that it makes but I
made<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> very<00:00:35.760> crooked<00:00:36.090> line<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.780> turns

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
made a very crooked line with it turns

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.350 
made a very crooked line with it turns
out<00:00:37.620> pretty<00:00:37.829> nice<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.730> you're<00:00:38.910> looking<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.180> a

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
out pretty nice if you're looking for a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.650 
out pretty nice if you're looking for a
drugstore<00:00:39.829> alternative<00:00:41.120> they<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.180> make<00:00:42.480> one

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
drugstore alternative they do make one

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.790 
drugstore alternative they do make one
from<00:00:42.960> l'oreal<00:00:43.469> which<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.660> lore'l<00:00:45.660> intense<00:00:46.350> I

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
from l'oreal which is lore'l intense I

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.540 
from l'oreal which is lore'l intense I
believe<00:00:47.539> it's<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.629> good<00:00:48.750> liner<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.350> can't<00:00:50.070> use<00:00:50.280> it

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
believe it's a good liner I can't use it

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.400 
believe it's a good liner I can't use it
because<00:00:50.760> I've<00:00:51.329> really<00:00:51.570> sensitive<00:00:51.930> eyes<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
because I've really sensitive eyes and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.010 
because I've really sensitive eyes and
for<00:00:52.530> some<00:00:52.680> reason<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:53.070> makes<00:00:53.190> my<00:00:53.399> eyes<00:00:53.430> burn

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
for some reason it makes my eyes burn

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.630 
for some reason it makes my eyes burn
but<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.170> don't<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.379> sensitive<00:00:55.860> eyes<00:00:56.010> uh

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
but if you don't have sensitive eyes uh

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.209 
but if you don't have sensitive eyes uh
it<00:00:57.629> could<00:00:57.840> could<00:00:58.350> work<00:00:58.559> really<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:58.890> nicely

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
it could could work really really nicely

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.060 
it could could work really really nicely

that looks similar the only thing that i
am<00:01:27.540> concerned<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.049> what<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:28.890> at

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
am concerned with what this one is at

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.160 
am concerned with what this one is at
least<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> lancome<00:01:30.000> once<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
least the lancome once it's in the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.649 
least the lancome once it's in the
liquid<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.400> comes<00:01:32.610> out<00:01:32.790> black<00:01:33.150> until

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
liquid and so it comes out black until

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.069 
liquid and so it comes out black until
the<00:01:33.869> end<00:01:34.070> this<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.759> guess<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:36.840> gonna

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the end this one I guess it's just gonna

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.710 
the end this one I guess it's just gonna
come<00:01:37.409> dipping<00:01:37.860> through<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.460> don't<00:01:38.640> know<00:01:38.729> we'll

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
