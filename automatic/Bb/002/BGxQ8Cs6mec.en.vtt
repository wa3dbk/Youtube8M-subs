the<00:01:19.950> pedal<00:01:20.249> you<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> speed<00:01:21.210> control<00:01:21.530> which

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the pedal you have a speed control which

the pedal you have a speed control which
controls<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:24.259> warble<00:01:25.259> speed<00:01:25.530> if<00:01:25.679> you<00:01:25.799> will<00:01:25.950> of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
controls the warble speed if you will of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.279 
controls the warble speed if you will of
the<00:01:26.189> phaser<00:01:26.429> so<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.819> you<00:01:26.909> turn<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> down<00:01:27.390> you

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
the phaser so if you turn it down you

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:36.500 
the phaser so if you turn it down you
get<00:01:28.920> something<00:01:29.249> like<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:31.069> turn<00:01:32.069> it<00:01:32.189> up

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
the depth is the wet control turn it

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.110 
the depth is the wet control turn it
down<00:01:41.620> you're<00:01:42.040> going<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.220> get<00:01:42.340> less<00:01:42.520> phaser

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
down you're going to get less phaser

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:53.300 
down you're going to get less phaser
sound<00:01:43.960> on<00:01:44.320> your<00:01:44.470> signal
