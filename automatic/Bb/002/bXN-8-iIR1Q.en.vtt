00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.670
 welcome to another new video and how 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:10.270
 they saw in the title rockstargames has 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:13.629
 planned a monumental dlc for mode 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.949
 history of big auto 5 online ok this 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.270
 it was something that I recently read in a 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.279
 forum and the truth seemed pretty 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.439
 interesting and remember that if any of 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.509
 you want to read the forum is from game 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.249
 center online I will leave them in the 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.660
 description the original article comes 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.279
 in English but I tell them a 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.140
 little bit in Spanish what of all 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.210
 forms I leave in the description by 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.030
 If any of you wants to read everything 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.730
 that's the same way we're going to start the 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.829
 article says a little bit like that in addition to 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.960
 the bank robbery line a source 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.870
 close to rockstar games has revealed that 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.239
 the development study has been a 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.090
 monumental piece of great cars 5 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.010
 history of downloadable content and says 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.899
 just like that we have spent a good 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.519
 amount of time working in the 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.340
 robberies to banks and the remastering 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.809
 for the new generation consoles 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.170
 however we have not forgotten about 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.629
 michael franklin and trevor said the source 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.700
 that this is going to be totally monumental 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.039
 when asked about 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.500
 the launch the source revealed that no 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.509
 they could say exactly but that's what 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.429
 who are waiting for rockstar to make a 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.960
 announcement very soon indicating that 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.170
 rockstar did not release a version 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.329
 updated if you do not plan to add more to 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.950
 the global experience if you wish 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.020
 see more can simply the 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.490
 description I leave the forum so that 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.450
 you can read a little bit of that the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.369
 truth that is something that I think 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.670
 pretty good since I would not be surprised 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.469
 that they would take out a DLCI in a story mode and 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.479
 that also included a new mode of 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.369
 Big online game FAUTO as 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.890
 it was the case of big product 4 with 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.659
 great auto episodes from liberty city 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.819
 that the truth that he was a player since 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.459
 we saw totally different stories 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.409
 like the one of johnny klebitz and the game of 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.909
 the ballad of the gay tony that no 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.459
 I remember very well what it was called this 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.110
 character that was Mexican Latino if not 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:57.429
 I remember very bad but the truth was that 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.200
 a great game in addition to the mode 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.780
 multiplayer was totally different from 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.610
 gt4 although it was developed inside the 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.619
 same city not to me the truth 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.049
 I would love for you to take this out I do not know if it 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.090
 come to draw would also be free or 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.370
 would be for payment I suppose if they took it out 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.000
 they would take them out as another separate disc as 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.000
 they did it 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.250
 in car 4 that was totally separated 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.810
 which included the modes of history and then 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.630
 practically in the world of grand theft 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.810
 auto 4 we started with all this from 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.540
 have two or three characters that was not 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.500
 only war nor with leeds and good no no 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.470
 I do not remember this one 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.610
 jon and kate leads and the other latin not that 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.200
 the truth is something that is super good 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.720
 because I love it because another one will fall 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.160
 dlc and know a little bit about history as 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.290
 what happened after the refreshments 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.290
 banks and they kept doing other things 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.540
 more what life was like before franklin 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.820
 if it was for money as life was 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.200
 before with maikel and all this or I know 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.320
 that was a robber but we never knew 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.480
 nothing of franklin before or how it started 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.790
 in that gang world and many things 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.440
 more that it developed with the sea ​​not or 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.870
 even what happened after the story 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.880
 they followed national these things know 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.590
 other characters appears follows and knows 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.120
 something in the jetpack or me that I know that 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.830
 invent something that would really be left 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.330
 pretty good if this were done 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.459
 I would like them to give me another kind of 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.860
 city ​​like what really happened with 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.320
 the true state of san andreas that 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.640
 happened with sanz land and the adventures and 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.750
 the truth that would be pretty good as well 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.640
 I hope you guys 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.500
 this video you follow my opinion on 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.060
 comments and how do you think it 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.400
 I would develop, I think if you are 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.080
 convenience would be something soon because if 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.320
 we take into account when a grand 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.220
 theft auto 4 and when episodes came out 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.230
 delivery although the truth is that 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.880
 it took a lot not so I hope they 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.650
 have liked also take into account that 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.360
 rockstar games is not a company that 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.910
 nothing else is dedicated to developing the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.980
 game that generates more money but that 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.080
 they seek to please their clients 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.820
 so how do you see a pretty video 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.140
