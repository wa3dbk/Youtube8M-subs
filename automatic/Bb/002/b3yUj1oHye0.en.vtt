00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
now we would like to show you what kind

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.130 
now we would like to show you what kind
of<00:01:10.380> weapons<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:11.070> aps<00:01:11.520> actually<00:01:12.090> deflects<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
of weapons the aps actually deflects and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.650 
of weapons the aps actually deflects and
which<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.130> not<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.610> here<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.910> can<00:01:15.119> see<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
which are not so here you can see the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.350 
which are not so here you can see the
attack<00:01:16.440> jet<00:01:16.710> coming<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.340> firing<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.970> full<00:01:18.149> pass

of the 30 millimeter gun and as you can

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.850 
of the 30 millimeter gun and as you can
see<00:01:20.369> nothing<00:01:21.300> is<00:01:21.420> getting<00:01:21.600> through<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.200> since

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
see nothing is getting through and since

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.380 
see nothing is getting through and since
that<00:01:23.009> was<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.399> beautiful<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:24.000> are<00:01:24.090> going<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that was so beautiful we are going to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.680 
that was so beautiful we are going to
show<00:01:24.569> it<00:01:24.660> again<00:01:24.720> from<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.080> outside

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
show it again from the outside

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.410 
show it again from the outside
