00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello dear friends today we are 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:10.019
 consider one of the devices which 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.340
 allows you to save on payment 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.780
 utilities 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.670
 own apartment these devices 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.140
 water meters they are installed on 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.740
 hot and cold water 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.189
 those users who are really 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.260
 want to pay a little bit happy to put 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.219
 These counters in their apartment 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.640
 thinking about the fact that finally they will 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.030
 pay only as much as wrap 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.890
 their counter but in fact it is not 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.300
 according to the latest a legislative 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.770
 acts all missing payment which 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.829
 after comparing the readings inside 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.510
 house counter and summation 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.980
 indicators 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.559
 Opponent counters in each apartment 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.970
 the difference is always because every 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.909
 the device has its own error and in 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.280
 As a result, this error may be 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.990
 both positive and negative 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.950
 although the manufacturer immediately lays 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:23.159
 error that will always be in the black 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.630
 let's add here also our Russians 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.950
 craftsmen there are always people who 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.080
 find a way around any metering device 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.360
 so as to 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.620
 for not to pay at all or to pay well 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.960
 little bit 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.340
 do not pay at all 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.920
 happens so here subtracting the readings inside 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.630
 house counter coming down the house entrance 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.490
 and the amount of individual testimony 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.800
 water meters for each apartment at the end 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.040
 quarter and either at the end of the year is divided into 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.930
 all consumers 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.410
 in proportion to the number of subscribers by 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.800
 the number prescribed in each apartment 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.400
 care for services you donâ€™t 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 consumed but they were reflected in the difference 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.730
 I still have these testimonies 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.880
 pay metering devices 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.660
 liquids produced wide enough 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.010
 ruler they all work on the same 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.490
 same algorithm 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.910
 counts the amount of fluid flowing 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.030
 through metering device and quantity 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.519
 we pierce oh liquid 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:48.500
 using consumers displayed 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:52.540
 On the digital display, our craftsmen are always 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.660
 find and a loophole to the entrance 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.300
 any device consume 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.489
 unaccounted number of services with each 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.370
 year 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.670
 creatively minded consumers find 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.030
 more and more new loopholes to 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:16.010
 to reduce readings 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:19.070
 devices and as a result get services 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.120
 more than reflected on the scoreboard 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:26.200
 accounting inside 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.950
 This device is a camera through 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.780
 which the fluid flows inside is worth 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.910
 impeller which is under the action 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.960
 flowing fluid rotates it 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:45.130
 rotation is transmitted to the read 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.520
 the device is displayed after all 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.620
 a row on a board from which then from 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:57.750
 read to minimize loss and 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:01.270
 more accurate display of information about 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.200
 consumed services manufacturers 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.910
 try to provide 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.470
 security devices various 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.830
 in ways one way is 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.900
 sealing both the device itself and 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.380
 inlet pipes let's consider 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.700
 device device in this case this 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.310
 the device is called 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:30.910
 and its 15 g this device is designed for 90 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.100
 degrees flowing fluid and 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.040
 flow rate and a half kilo 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.110
 cubic meters per hour and how does this 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.870
 a device to watch it 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.880
 the device we need to disassemble it 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.590
 lower and upper part connected between 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:51.280
 themselves fastened like this ring 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:54.490
 plastics which after bonding 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.860
 Here at the factory and calibrations are sealed 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.530
 factory seal to 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.820
 disassemble the device we need to remove 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.190
 here is the ring and after that this device 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.560
 means divided into the upper part and 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.120
 bottom in order to separate it 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:17.100
 necessary here 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:20.850
 here's a neat tuck 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.850
 she is 1 unit
