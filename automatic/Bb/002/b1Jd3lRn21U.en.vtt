00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 the rain of hail that hit the city 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.899
 in the late afternoon yesterday caused a 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.870
 curious phenomenon layers of ice take 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.309
 account of streets in the neighborhood of acclimatization 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.590
 after the storm trucks 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.059
 prefecture work on the withdrawal of 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.550
 material 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.160
 daniele william came from another neighborhood 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.350
 just to see the ice that has accumulated in the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.720
 acclimatization park entrance air 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.029
 wonderful very different you never 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.810
 saw here in Sao Paulo I know 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.309
 bariloche but up to 40 degrees almost and here 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.100
 the ice was not snow but 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.800
 hail that fell in the afternoon of yesterday and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.590
 nearly ten hours later they had not yet 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.260
 melted until the cars were still 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.210
 stranded in the middle of so much ice 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.059
 hail disrupted the region's traffic 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.180
 Park and attracted many curious 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.460
 there brought me to the baby of three months the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.309
 Nice weather here coldest granddaughter 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.160
 street and how is kant is what it likes 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.739
 It's cold in here to enjoy the kids if 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.960
 amused with ice war the binge 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.710
 it was so much that I could not even record 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.710
 interview 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.270
 As the day dawned cold and cloudy and the sun 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.700
 took time to appear the city 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.039
 do the cleaning before the ice 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.500
 melted and brought excavators and 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.799
 several trucks to help in this 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.740
 work until noon were withdrawn 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.689
 hence fifteen trucks with eight 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.880
 tons of ice each 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.890
 The rain lasted for about 20 minutes. 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.030
 time left the entire city in a state of 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.789
 of attention 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.600
 many people have registered and posted 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.600
 images on the internet 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.000
 according to climatempo hail is not a 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.580
 rare phenomenon of sÃ£o paulo 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.600
 but the amount that fell yesterday is well 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.020
 common 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.820
 is something new had already occurred in 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.160
 94 but in proportion to this 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.380
 quantity is the first time 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.230
 the phenomenon happens when clouds are 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.270
 so large that it reaches a height where 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.880
 temperature is below zero 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.890
 so the drops freeze 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.070
 you can not predict far ahead 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.530
 when the hail will fall so it had 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.680
 people who were saddened by the 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.680
 town hall 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:39.650
 The tendency is that what you did not even 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:43.070
 although I did not want to not because what is 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:48.220
 cool to play on ice had not seen 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.220
 so much ice that's not why it's cool 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.160
 according to the sub-prefecture of the 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.030
 late afternoon were taken away 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.450
 more than 300 tonnes of ice 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.450
 of lipstick
