00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.420
 so I will try to make a 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.560
 embedding directly around the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.509
 boilie starting on a boil 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:16.740
 is up damon of 14 mm so that when we 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.630
 fishing as the boost and the stick 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.100
 mix gets loose all around the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.970
 boilie to attract precisely the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:30.179
 fish on my boil so is we going 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:37.820
 deceive once let drain in 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.820
 the boost to fool in the powder formed 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.400
 first time so when there was a 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.640
 first soaking so we'll leave 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:53.270
 to dry a second soaking it gives 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.600
 that like that so we can already see the 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.980
 difference that can be diet 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.089
 with soaking so there is not bad 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:07.390
 aromas and mix wrong turn 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.190
 so you can listen for no 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.520
 put too much crap in the stic 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.520
 mix 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:30.360
 3 soaking their results so we'll see 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:35.170
 more could read that should keep 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.310
 the difference while knowing that the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.870
 boiled was bigger scandal 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.060
 french choice bigger this melo value 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.610
 diluted and give back go on the biÃ¨tre 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.240
 will become nurtured gince to say that 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.590
 about 14 mm that will free me from the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.540
 road or tower that sees 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.290
 dissolve in the water and hoping 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.720
 make the cards come easier 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.979
 will do a test in the water when the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.979
 dumplings have dried a little bit
