00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:13.120
 Well, what kind of human being is it when going to school and thinking about things in the future 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:16.779
 In particular, people are especially 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:22.620
 Or rather shine to live and live in what world 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:26.700
 Well , if I can see what I am good at doing such things, the distance will be 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:29.630
 It 's also time to think that you can lead the web 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.960
 I have important things 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.140
 I think be honest good properly yourself 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.340
 In short, there is order me things 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:44.930
 For example , compare something 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.010
 Well that's right I wonder if I'm cool or my thinking is in the world 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.220
 Say which side you are in as a position 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.460
 It says very anxious also so 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:59.540
 I think it's a generation 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:04.790
 You regret from do you think if a person after an absolute from thinking of yourself 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.560
 That's why I 'm going to spend the next time depending on the choice I choose 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.250
 What do you think 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.400
 In the eyes to compare with the person in the end, it is a business and it is a game 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:19.590
 That's what capitalism is said 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.150
 So this is also honest you can not only how much to be very able to contribute person can not be obtained money than people 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:27.420
 It has become 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.680
 The origin is how you think about it and how much you love it The amount of love is compared with people 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.390
 Not anything 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.350
 Shinjuku or yourself that there is not going to lose to a person if the effort does not meet the pre Once you feel like compared 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.840
 I have no choice but to paste 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.320
 That's absolutely important, so I 'm going to be able to compare the time ahead more 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.040
 Compare 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.680
 I wonder if I think I have my own way of life I googled in restlessly or Toka net 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:53.649
 Standing hard time Fukaura position a lifetime to be like a 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.159
 After all, it is clear to the person that how much one's position is what you think 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.340
 do it 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.460
 Well then I myself 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.210
 If you were dancing then why would you throw away your game 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.080
 I think I can't throw it away, so I'll be there if I can help 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:10.729
 If you can't throw it away , you can only ask it red 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.210
 I'm not buried or so bright dark and go at the beginning of me cause industry 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.900
 is 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:20.880
 And it will be fun to play with the situation of my work sister 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:27.570
 But I will say my job but I am not at all fun 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.300
 People who have a business to make clear tough people smile I think set on edge Russie in the back 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.330
 The 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:36.430
 It's true that everyone is really hula music and movies 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:40.750
 So as pose guy ... it has become such a to a TV with people that are told artists 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:45.790
 It has become, but whether it can be sold at your back nervously 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.230
 And because everyone has a key expression that can contribute to society by touching it, it's a fly 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.650
 Good luck with bread 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.650
 There'd at least today that you want back home to remember about one
