just showing us the information we can

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.600 
just showing us the information we can
take<00:02:19.040> our<00:02:19.160> finger<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:20.950> explore<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.190> see

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
take our finger and explore and see

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.640 
take our finger and explore and see
state-by-state<00:02:23.140> exactly<00:02:24.140> how<00:02:24.260> much<00:02:24.380> wind

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
state-by-state exactly how much wind

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.500 
state-by-state exactly how much wind
potential<00:02:24.980> there<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.310> we<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.210> do<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.360> same

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
potential there is we can do the same

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:38.490 
potential there is we can do the same
for<00:02:26.570> geothermal<00:02:27.260> energy<00:02:30.460> in<00:02:31.460> solar<00:02:31.760> power

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:54.390 
this is one of my favorites so this
shows<00:02:51.660> when<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.780> wind<00:02:52.990> is<00:02:53.140> blowing<00:02:53.400> any

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
shows when the wind is blowing any

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.520 
shows when the wind is blowing any
excess<00:02:54.910> energy<00:02:55.360> coming<00:02:55.900> from<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.200> windmill

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
excess energy coming from the windmill

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.620 
excess energy coming from the windmill
is<00:02:56.560> diverted<00:02:57.070> into<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.370> battery<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.910> as<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
is diverted into the battery and as the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.410 
is diverted into the battery and as the
wind<00:02:58.930> starts<00:02:59.080> dying<00:02:59.560> down<00:02:59.770> any<00:03:00.209> excess<00:03:01.209> energy

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
wind starts dying down any excess energy

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.570 
wind starts dying down any excess energy
will<00:03:01.780> be<00:03:01.900> diverted<00:03:02.230> back<00:03:02.770> into<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.100> house<00:03:03.250> the

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
will be diverted back into the house the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.080 
will be diverted back into the house the
lights<00:03:03.790> never<00:03:04.060> got<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:09.400> whole<00:03:09.640> book<00:03:09.910> it

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
lights never got and this whole book it

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.449 
lights never got and this whole book it
doesn't<00:03:10.420> just<00:03:10.690> run<00:03:10.870> on<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.080> iPad<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:12.220> also

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
doesn't just run on the iPad it also

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.240 
doesn't just run on the iPad it also
runs<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.000> iPhone<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.709> you<00:03:14.800> can<00:03:14.980> start

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
runs on the iPhone and so you can start

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.830 
runs on the iPhone and so you can start
reading<00:03:15.790> on<00:03:15.910> your<00:03:16.000> iPad<00:03:16.330> in<00:03:16.450> your<00:03:16.540> living<00:03:16.810> room
