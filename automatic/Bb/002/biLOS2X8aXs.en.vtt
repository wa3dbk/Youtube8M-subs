00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.560
 eat tasty 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.170
 and healthy I think it's an aspect that we do not all exist 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.220
 but also eat adequate 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.139
 and agree to keep the weight at our height 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:52.480

 nothing bad or anything out of the ordinary 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.869
 you just have to measure them 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.840
 because that is part of our diet and organizes us if 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.289

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.469

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.099
 in the end

 the doctor of food 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:28.889

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:46.199

 what he has had in himself 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.049
 I think he has a consensus on sources 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.419
 I hope this book 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.729

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:18.039
 i the everton 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:20.149
 the portal 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.879
 that if they wanted to grow 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.679
 of them I had to eat 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.969
 but brady 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:28.879
 clinton argued 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.649
 at first the group that a semester 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.649
 I have never eaten 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.599
 to 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:17.249
 really see what these images were shocking 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:20.500
 how many times today at home your child or your girl 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.479
 you will see a food of expression 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.360
 how many times on those children who do not have anything to eat 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.610
 they wanted what we despise that soup that broth that mom so much we 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.289
 our aunt prepares our ways or is not good sometimes we try 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.539
 change our eating habits but it is very difficult 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.539
 really areces we eat too much i really do not even burn what 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:48.009
 we eat and little by little we leave without realizing in the world that surrounds us 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.789
 we really spent hours and hours 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.479
 I have sat down we do not do exercises and we eat a lot we are going to see that really 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:00.669
 is very important tacit kellen let's do at least one routine to decrease 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.110
 a little bit of food and doing a little more sport 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.129
 let's see that you should not fight with the scale either 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.779
 you must accept teddy that portrays which you are 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:14.460
 that there is a logic that the tito cache does not matter is to make the monster index 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.889
 but we're really going to see a situation to zp and love just as you are 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.430
 that's my suggestion because if we really look at the feelings of 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.340
 people not in the physical we are going to know something spiritual I want to send you 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.229
