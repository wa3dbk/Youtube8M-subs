00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.249 
can use this i'm not sure if this works
is<00:06:02.789> this<00:06:02.910> for<00:06:03.410> okay<00:06:04.410> that<00:06:04.620> doesn't<00:06:04.860> work<00:06:06.259> so

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
is this for okay that doesn't work so

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.360 
is this for okay that doesn't work so
let's<00:06:07.710> see<00:06:08.720> b<00:06:09.720> button<00:06:09.960> so<00:06:10.380> yeah<00:06:10.500> you<00:06:11.070> can<00:06:11.250> use

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
let's see b button so yeah you can use

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.750 
let's see b button so yeah you can use
this<00:06:11.729> I<00:06:12.060> think<00:06:13.400> maybe<00:06:14.400> not<00:06:14.639> hold<00:06:14.880> on<00:06:14.970> now<00:06:16.520> i<00:06:17.520> can

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
this I think maybe not hold on now i can

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.399 
this I think maybe not hold on now i can
use<00:06:17.909> it<00:06:18.120> oh<00:06:18.270> yeah<00:06:18.539> that's<00:06:18.900> because<00:06:19.080> this<00:06:19.260> is

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 
use it oh yeah that's because this is

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:21.870 
use it oh yeah that's because this is
connected

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.550 

I'm<00:06:22.880> but<00:06:23.360> I'm<00:06:23.479> pretty<00:06:23.630> sure<00:06:23.780> you<00:06:24.080> can<00:06:24.260> use<00:06:24.410> it

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
I'm but I'm pretty sure you can use it

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.480 
I'm but I'm pretty sure you can use it
as<00:06:24.740> well<00:06:26.080> you<00:06:27.080> can<00:06:27.229> also<00:06:27.440> connect<00:06:27.979> a<00:06:28.160> ps3

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
as well you can also connect a ps3

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.580 
as well you can also connect a ps3
controller<00:06:29.150> and<00:06:30.639> I<00:06:31.639> believe<00:06:32.330> actually<00:06:33.020> I

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
controller and I believe actually I

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.340 
controller and I believe actually I
don't<00:06:34.250> know<00:06:34.490> I<00:06:36.220> may<00:06:37.220> have<00:06:37.280> done<00:06:37.460> that<00:06:37.610> before

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
don't know I may have done that before

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.400 
don't know I may have done that before
but<00:06:39.350> yeah<00:06:39.470> just<00:06:40.330> I'm<00:06:41.330> pretty<00:06:41.479> sure<00:06:41.810> the<00:06:41.990> ps3

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.410 
but yeah just I'm pretty sure the ps3

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.000 
but yeah just I'm pretty sure the ps3
controller<00:06:42.740> work<00:06:44.260> if<00:06:45.260> not<00:06:45.320> I'll<00:06:45.740> put<00:06:45.889> an

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
controller work if not I'll put an

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:52.810 
controller work if not I'll put an
annotation<00:06:47.050> right<00:06:48.130> here<00:06:49.130> I<00:06:49.310> guess<00:06:51.610> but<00:06:52.610> yeah

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
annotation right here I guess but yeah

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.340 
annotation right here I guess but yeah
that's<00:06:53.330> just<00:06:53.449> some<00:06:53.720> of<00:06:53.750> the<00:06:53.900> cool<00:06:54.110> little

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
that's just some of the cool little

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.950 
that's just some of the cool little
things<00:06:54.830> that<00:06:55.010> you<00:06:55.100> can<00:06:55.280> do<00:06:55.479> with<00:06:56.479> the<00:06:56.600> new<00:06:56.720> year

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
things that you can do with the new year

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.219 
things that you can do with the new year
um<00:06:57.699> it's<00:06:58.699> not<00:06:58.880> perfect<00:06:59.360> emulation<00:06:59.720> as<00:06:59.960> you<00:07:00.110> can

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:00.229 
um it's not perfect emulation as you can

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.469 
um it's not perfect emulation as you can
see<00:07:00.410> i<00:07:00.440> have<00:07:00.590> a<00:07:00.770> snus<00:07:01.130> down<00:07:01.340> there<00:07:01.580> you<00:07:02.449> know

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 
see i have a snus down there you know

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:08.230 
see i have a snus down there you know
and<00:07:02.600> we'll<00:07:03.560> ts2<00:07:04.010> and<00:07:05.229> and<00:07:06.229> all<00:07:06.380> that<00:07:07.210> like<00:07:08.210> a

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 
and we'll ts2 and and all that like a

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.180 
and we'll ts2 and and all that like a
gamecube<00:07:09.050> with<00:07:09.169> a<00:07:09.229> gameboy<00:07:09.500> advance<00:07:09.800> thing<00:07:10.070> on

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.190 
gamecube with a gameboy advance thing on

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.500 
gamecube with a gameboy advance thing on
there<00:07:10.340> even<00:07:10.610> though<00:07:10.699> i<00:07:10.729> have<00:07:10.940> an<00:07:11.060> actual<00:07:11.210> game

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.510 
there even though i have an actual game

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:16.980 
there even though i have an actual game
boy<00:07:11.630> advance<00:07:11.900> and<00:07:12.169> an<00:07:12.289> SP<00:07:13.000> and<00:07:14.000> a<00:07:14.180> color<00:07:15.550> but

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.909 
you know like if this is your only way
to<00:07:20.419> do<00:07:20.630> it<00:07:21.250> ye<00:07:22.250> might<00:07:22.610> as<00:07:22.729> well<00:07:23.139> use<00:07:24.139> a<00:07:24.169> one<00:07:24.830> of

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919 
to do it ye might as well use a one of

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:31.180 
to do it ye might as well use a one of
these<00:07:25.630> or<00:07:26.630> if<00:07:26.990> not<00:07:27.580> this<00:07:28.580> actually<00:07:29.479> i<00:07:30.349> would

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.190 
these or if not this actually i would

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.040 
these or if not this actually i would
have<00:07:31.639> to<00:07:31.669> say<00:07:31.849> almost<00:07:32.300> makes<00:07:32.810> for<00:07:33.680> a<00:07:34.010> better

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.050 
have to say almost makes for a better

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.839 
have to say almost makes for a better
controller<00:07:36.050> like<00:07:36.680> the<00:07:36.830> buttons<00:07:37.130> are<00:07:37.250> really

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:37.849 
controller like the buttons are really

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:41.740 
controller like the buttons are really
nice<00:07:38.710> than<00:07:39.710> an<00:07:39.830> actual<00:07:40.039> smashed<00:07:41.030> controller<00:07:41.479> i

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:41.750 
nice than an actual smashed controller i

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.110 
nice than an actual smashed controller i
hate<00:07:42.020> to<00:07:42.050> say<00:07:42.200> it<00:07:42.410> this<00:07:43.400> makes<00:07:43.639> for<00:07:43.700> a<00:07:43.820> really

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.120 
hate to say it this makes for a really

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.390 
hate to say it this makes for a really
nice<00:07:44.419> controller<00:07:44.930> I'm<00:07:45.349> very<00:07:47.650> the<00:07:48.650> button<00:07:49.099> the

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:49.400 
nice controller I'm very the button the

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.370 
nice controller I'm very the button the
L&amp;R<00:07:49.910> buttons<00:07:50.240> i<00:07:50.300> guess<00:07:50.449> are<00:07:50.599> the<00:07:50.780> worst<00:07:51.169> thing

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:51.380 
L&amp;R buttons i guess are the worst thing

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.469 
L&amp;R buttons i guess are the worst thing
you<00:07:51.500> can<00:07:51.590> say<00:07:51.650> about<00:07:51.830> it<00:07:53.949> so<00:07:54.949> there<00:07:55.099> you<00:07:55.250> go
