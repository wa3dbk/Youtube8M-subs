hope this is the last video in a little
series<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.809> I'm<00:00:10.679> just<00:00:10.920> doing<00:00:11.280> because<00:00:11.670> I'm

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
series that I'm just doing because I'm

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.450 
series that I'm just doing because I'm
in<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.170> process<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.799> creating<00:00:14.190> an

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
in the process of creating an

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.570 
in the process of creating an
illustrated<00:00:15.089> how<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.080> art<00:00:16.590> book<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.100> I

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
illustrated how to art book and I

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.769 
illustrated how to art book and I
thought<00:00:17.760> there<00:00:17.940> might<00:00:18.119> be<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.300> few<00:00:18.539> other

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
thought there might be a few other

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.240 
thought there might be a few other
people<00:00:19.050> out<00:00:19.230> there<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.650> world<00:00:19.800> who<00:00:19.980> wanted

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250

people out there in the world who wanted
to<00:00:20.430> do<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> same<00:00:20.910> thing<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:22.109> not<00:00:22.260> easy<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
to do the same thing it's not easy to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.560 
to do the same thing it's not easy to
figure<00:00:22.980> out<00:00:23.130> what<00:00:23.519> kind<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.789> software<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.390> use

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
figure out what kind of software to use

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.870 
figure out what kind of software to use
and<00:00:24.960> which<00:00:25.320> services<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.130> use<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.519> order<00:00:26.670> to

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
and which services to use in order to

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.060

showcase and sell the book of your art a

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.699 
showcase and sell the book of your art a
lot<00:03:13.940> of<00:03:14.060> people<00:03:14.390> are<00:03:14.510> doing<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.290> using

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
lot of people are doing that and using

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.979 
lot of people are doing that and using
create<00:03:16.040> space<00:03:16.370> because<00:03:16.910> if<00:03:17.360> you<00:03:17.540> only<00:03:17.720> have

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
create space because if you only have

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.210 
create space because if you only have
one<00:03:19.330> one<00:03:20.330> photograph<00:03:20.600> every<00:03:21.530> other<00:03:21.650> page<00:03:21.980> or

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
one one photograph every other page or

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.310 
one one photograph every other page or
so<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:22.850> can<00:03:23.030> get<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.299> file<00:03:23.510> size<00:03:23.750> down<00:03:24.049> low

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
so you can get the file size down low

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.710 
so you can get the file size down low
enough<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.860> can<00:03:25.010> also<00:03:25.190> reduce<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.360> number<00:03:26.690> of

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
enough you can also reduce the number of

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.170 
enough you can also reduce the number of
pages<00:03:27.140> if<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:28.190> not<00:03:28.370> having<00:03:28.610> if<00:03:28.940> you<00:03:29.030> don't

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
pages if you not having if you don't

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.330 
pages if you not having if you don't
have<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.390> tell<00:03:29.570> people<00:03:29.600> how<00:03:30.049> to<00:03:30.470> make<00:03:31.190> your

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
have to tell people how to make your

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.390 
have to tell people how to make your
artwork<00:03:31.790> then<00:03:32.269> you<00:03:32.480> don't<00:03:32.630> have<00:03:33.220> you<00:03:34.220> can

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
artwork then you don't have you can

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.960 
artwork then you don't have you can
control<00:03:34.930> entirely<00:03:35.930> how<00:03:36.110> many<00:03:36.350> pages<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:36.970> have

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
control entirely how many pages you have

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.150 
control entirely how many pages you have
in<00:03:38.570> your<00:03:38.690> book<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:39.470> can<00:03:39.680> reduce<00:03:39.830> the

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
in your book and that can reduce the

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.680 
in your book and that can reduce the
file<00:03:40.340> size<00:03:40.370> too<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.630> if<00:03:41.930> you're<00:03:42.170> able<00:03:42.380> to<00:03:43.420> get<00:03:44.420> a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
file size too so if you're able to get a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.460 
file size too so if you're able to get a
PDF<00:03:45.650> of<00:03:45.970> your<00:03:46.970> manuscript<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:47.840> again<00:03:48.440> I

PDF of your manuscript and again I
showed<00:03:48.739> you<00:03:48.890> how<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:49.010> do<00:03:49.250> that<00:03:49.430> never<00:03:49.910> have<00:03:50.090> the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
showed you how to do that never have the

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.180 
showed you how to do that never have the
software<00:03:50.750> that<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.049> can<00:03:51.080> use<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:51.410> do<00:03:51.709> that<00:03:51.920> in

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
software that you can use to do that in

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.560 
software that you can use to do that in

the last video then create space is the

the last video then create space is the
