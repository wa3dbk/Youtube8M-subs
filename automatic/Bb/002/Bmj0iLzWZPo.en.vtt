00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.820
 It is everyone Hello Pagny 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.470
 Fps Oh think 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.530
 This time 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.900
 Is recoil control necessary? 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.900
 I think that I want to work on the theme of 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.040
 Recoil control 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.000
 Recoil gun 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.000
 It is to control by oneself 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:40.550
 Games that deal with such heavy equipment 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:42.250
 Most recoil of the gun recently 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.110
 Incorporating Tei 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.110
 There are many things that I am doing 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:56.710
 It is important to keep the characteristics of the weapon firmly in your head and defeat the enemy 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.880
 It is quite difficult because it is a technique to suppress the reaction reaction at the time of shooting 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.340
 I try to do it but I am not good at it 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.340
 I hate you 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.240
 So what is the reaction of that gun 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.150
 What 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.420
 At first I would like to try a little 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.290
 The weapon I have now is a merger 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.330
 Lmg of support 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:39.770
 It is mg 4 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.980
 Sometimes 100 shots there rate I Did was about 800 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.100
 Hmm 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.090
 Yeah 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.090
 First of all, what is the recoil reaction in this ? 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:02:00.049
 Leave the all the time button in full auto in accordance with the root of the tree of Konomasho eyes of the coconut 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.049
 Let's try it for now 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.209
 Yes I 'm 100 out right way 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.209
 I do let a little doing 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.520
 Yes i feel like this 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:32.440
 I think there is no rudeness on the left and right of Toma 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.180
 Recoil is first went in the upward direction 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.530
 Then to the right 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.130
 We are Kozu 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:45.660
 It feels like 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.660
 That means recoil control when using this weapon is 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.400
 Diagonal lower left 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.680
 Stick right in this direction 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.270
 The 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.140
 I will beat while defeating 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.140
 It's like that 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.060
 I will try it for a moment 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.500
 It's quite difficult, isn't it? 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.819
 Yeah 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:37.250
 As we are doing with controller ps 4 controller 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:38.640
 Absolutely generally but it is the thumb to operate the right stick 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.230
 eh 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:51.390
 I have to do this recall control with my thumb 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:53.290
 Since the pc version can do this with mouse operations , it is possible to perform finer and delicate operations 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.950
 think 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.689
 ps 4th and so on xbox 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.689
 Stick operation this 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.180
 dog 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:11.650
 To carry out recoil control 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.650
 I think a more subtle sense is needed 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:26.470
 Maybe 1 It is not a millimeter day 0.1mm or that about the sense of rice and look-lowering 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.470
 If not 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.280
 It is difficult now for another little way 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.560
 Left and right 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.560
 Upper and lower cats while being 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:47.580
 I felt like the meaning was off, so more 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.580
 I have to accurately capture my location 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.740
 So if this tool recoil control is control of really need 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.979
 I'm not good at myself anymore 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:10.270
 Absolutely to the port of a lie because the fine operation is weak 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:15.689
 To concentrate on operations that use the key 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:21.480
 Because it is difficult, I do not use it a lot 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:24.380
 I feel like I can fight enough without using it 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:28.870
 And say why 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.430
 Well my strategy for going around 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:35.640
 I mean 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.640
 Because we are thinking about that one as a priority 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.550
 I wonder if I do not need it 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:47.770
 There is no such thing to be able to do recall control 0 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:59.520
 Priority and low Once you have better kana 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:59.520
 The postal administration 10th to remember thinks that this recoil control intends to withdraw 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:09.910
 I am not good at recoil control, so always dmr 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:13.290
 A single shot gun 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.290
 Well it is io 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.030
 If in a single shot 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:28.950
 Once the fire button 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:34.910
 It is only that the soul comes out just by doing 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.910
 In the case of a fully automatic weapon, hold down the button 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:43.379
 Let Teru all the way to abort the have ball magazine all of them 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.379
 It feels like 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.270
 Shooting of the pinky if in this one-off 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.279
 You may go like this 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:04.160
 As long as you press the button, the accuracy rate of the gun will increase 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.160
 I think it will come true 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.100
 Even a bursting weapon 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:21.669
 Kana and his son is still hit rate is better to pinky is I feel so 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:33.700
 So a 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:38.640
 Who want to try to use a weapon of these full-Auto 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.640
 I think you should be able to recoil control to some extent 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:49.380
 Especially intense of the left and right upper and lower horizontal blur 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.729
 weapon 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:56.639
 Such a weapon 

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:56.639
 I think this recall control is essential 

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:08.510
 Well by all means everyone in this video to the reference arms of his favorite 

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:11.020
 Please find your favorite weapon 

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.020
