every<00:01:34.079> item<00:01:34.350> usage<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.829> every<00:01:35.009> step<00:01:35.280> counts

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
every item usage and every step counts

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.270 
every item usage and every step counts

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
just traveling across the map is smooth

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.310 
just traveling across the map is smooth
and<00:01:38.520> doesn't<00:01:38.670> take<00:01:38.850> much<00:01:39.090> thought<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:40.049> every

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
and doesn't take much thought but every

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.780 
and doesn't take much thought but every
time<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.680> encounter<00:01:40.799> an<00:01:41.159> enemy<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:41.579> every

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
building or dungeon it becomes extremely

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.450 
building or dungeon it becomes extremely
strategic<00:01:46.200> because<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.280> able<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
strategic because you have to be able to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.039 
strategic because you have to be able to
escape<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.030> building<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:48.479> dungeon<00:01:48.689> and

getting caught by the darkness the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.969 
getting caught by the darkness the
system<00:01:54.299> itself<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.810> pretty<00:01:55.049> simple<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
system itself is pretty simple but the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.469 
system itself is pretty simple but the
game<00:01:56.130> actually<00:01:56.340> fooled<00:01:56.820> me<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.119> its<00:01:57.240> smooth

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
game actually fooled me with its smooth

game actually fooled me with its smooth
motion<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.439> took<00:01:58.649> conscious<00:01:59.070> effort<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.460> stop

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
take my hands off the keyboard and think

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.130 
take my hands off the keyboard and think
for<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.189> minute<00:02:02.280> about<00:02:02.490> my<00:02:02.759> strategy<00:02:03.140> remember

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
for a minute about my strategy remember

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.389 
for a minute about my strategy remember
the<00:02:04.229> game<00:02:04.409> doesn't<00:02:04.710> actually<00:02:04.860> progress

unless you take moves and it allows you
to<00:02:07.590> really<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:08.069> about<00:02:08.129> what<00:02:08.429> you're<00:02:08.550> gonna

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
to really think about what you're gonna

I<00:02:09.550> was<00:02:10.510> frustrated<00:02:10.720> by<00:02:11.140> this<00:02:11.200> in<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
I was frustrated by this in the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.320 
I was frustrated by this in the
beginning<00:02:11.800> but<00:02:12.040> once<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:12.700> got<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:12.940> hang<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.210> it

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
beginning but once I got the hang of it

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.670 
beginning but once I got the hang of it
I<00:02:13.480> really<00:02:13.750> started<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.080> have<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.260> lot<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.470> fun

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
I really started to have a lot of fun

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.980 
I really started to have a lot of fun
with<00:02:14.830> one<00:02:15.040> way<00:02:15.160> heroics<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.870> it's<00:02:16.870> that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
with one way heroics and it's that

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.600 
with one way heroics and it's that
unique<00:02:17.140> sort<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.650> strategic<00:02:18.160> gameplay<00:02:18.580> that

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
unique sort of strategic gameplay that

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.700 
unique sort of strategic gameplay that
makes<00:02:18.910> things<00:02:19.150> fun<00:02:19.450> in<00:02:19.720> terms<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.560> art

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
makes things fun in terms of the art

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.590 
makes things fun in terms of the art
style<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.250> direction<00:02:21.730> it's<00:02:22.150> nothing<00:02:22.510> to

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
style and direction it's nothing to

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.480 
style and direction it's nothing to
write<00:02:22.660> home<00:02:22.780> about<00:02:22.990> we've<00:02:23.710> seen<00:02:23.980> games<00:02:24.250> that

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
write home about we've seen games that

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.830 
write home about we've seen games that
look<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.850> feel<00:02:24.880> like<00:02:25.210> this<00:02:25.420> before

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
look and feel like this before

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.680 
look and feel like this before
and<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.470> biomes<00:02:26.830> are<00:02:26.980> all<00:02:27.100> fairly<00:02:27.340> typical

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
and the biomes are all fairly typical

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.210 
and the biomes are all fairly typical
but<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.810> real<00:02:28.960> value<00:02:29.320> in<00:02:29.470> one<00:02:29.620> way<00:02:29.740> heroics

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
but the real value in one way heroics

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.740 
but the real value in one way heroics
comes<00:02:30.670> from<00:02:30.850> its<00:02:30.970> low<00:02:31.150> price<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.630> its

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
comes from its low price and its

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.170 
comes from its low price and its
replayability<00:02:32.460> from<00:02:33.460> start<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.790> finish<00:02:33.820> the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
replayability from start to finish the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.000 
replayability from start to finish the
game<00:02:34.360> takes<00:02:34.660> half<00:02:35.140> an<00:02:35.290> hour<00:02:35.380> or<00:02:35.650> less<00:02:35.800> to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
game takes half an hour or less to

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.070 
game takes half an hour or less to
complete<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.030> replayability<00:02:37.390> comes

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
complete but the replayability comes

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.540 
complete but the replayability comes
from<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.380> fact<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.710> all<00:02:38.800> of<00:02:39.040> your<00:02:39.130> character

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
from the fact that all of your character

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.370 
from the fact that all of your character
stats<00:02:39.910> are<00:02:40.150> maintained<00:02:40.930> through<00:02:41.230> each
