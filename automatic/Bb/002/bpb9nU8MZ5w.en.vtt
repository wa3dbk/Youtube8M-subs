gold shield and it looks like there's an
imperfection<00:03:13.150> on<00:03:13.450> mine<00:03:14.490> almost<00:03:15.490> like<00:03:15.760> there

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
imperfection on mine almost like there

was a seam or something right there so I

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.720 
was a seam or something right there so I
think<00:03:18.970> like<00:03:19.330> that's<00:03:19.630> not<00:03:19.780> cool<00:03:20.020> but<00:03:20.920> the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
think like that's not cool but the

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.660 
think like that's not cool but the
weapon<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:23.680> Chi<00:03:24.070> sword<00:03:24.490> I<00:03:25.950> really<00:03:26.950> do<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.490> of

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
let's see I think we've done three of

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.740 
let's see I think we've done three of
these<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:53.920> far<00:03:54.250> so<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.030> could<00:03:55.150> check<00:03:55.360> out<00:03:55.510> our

these so far so you could check out our
other<00:03:55.960> ultra<00:03:56.950> builds<00:03:57.280> I<00:03:57.400> will<00:03:57.520> put<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:57.730> link<00:03:58.090> in

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
other ultra builds I will put a link in

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.660 
other ultra builds I will put a link in
the<00:03:58.570> description<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.290> those<00:03:59.590> so<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.490> can

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
follow along as we continue along we've

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.760 
follow along as we continue along we've
got<00:04:03.300> cragger<00:04:04.300> I'll<00:04:04.720> do<00:04:04.870> cragger<00:04:05.350> I've<00:04:05.590> got

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
got cragger I'll do cragger I've got

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.440 
got cragger I'll do cragger I've got
warez<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:07.170> another<00:04:08.170> one<00:04:08.380> razor<00:04:08.980> I<00:04:09.390> think<00:04:10.390> I've

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
warez and another one razor I think I've

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.940 
warez and another one razor I think I've
got<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.630> razor<00:04:10.870> also<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.530> think<00:04:11.560> that<00:04:11.830> would

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
got a razor also and I think that would

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.760 
got a razor also and I think that would
do<00:04:12.100> it<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.310> think<00:04:12.490> there's<00:04:12.640> just<00:04:12.790> six<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:14.590> then

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
do it I think there's just six and then

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.620 
do it I think there's just six and then
maybe<00:04:14.950> if<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:15.550> guys<00:04:15.640> like<00:04:15.910> these<00:04:16.060> videos<00:04:16.450> we

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
maybe if you guys like these videos we

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.949 
maybe if you guys like these videos we
could<00:04:16.720> start<00:04:16.989> doing<00:04:17.350> the

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
could start doing the

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.229 
could start doing the
we<00:04:18.109> can<00:04:18.229> kind<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.500> combine<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:19.579> pieces<00:04:20.000> and

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
we can kind of combine the pieces and

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.990 
we can kind of combine the pieces and
that<00:04:20.900> just<00:04:21.139> adds<00:04:21.319> another<00:04:21.590> another<00:04:22.460> element

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
that just adds another another element

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.189 
that just adds another another element
