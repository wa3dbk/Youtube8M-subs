00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.810
 hello girls I took my life from 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.649
 find you today for a 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.960
 new video 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.390
 when you could see it in the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:20.400
 title today we will talk new 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:22.199
 new product purchases my goal is 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.320
 to manufacture more and more these 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.910
 products for that they follow me 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.710
 regularly on the channel you know 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.560
 I already started last year 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:39.320
 by the manufacture of poles anti lotion 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:42.210
 fall then you are so in fact I 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.739
 made a few small purchases for 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.590
 to be able to manufacture my so without you 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.660
 to wait we will pass 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:58.130
 review all the products that I have 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.360
 bought so my order she is there without 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:12.350
 surprise actually I placed the order 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:15.740
 on the amazon site so I'm going 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.770
 start with the two flasks that I have 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.130
 ordered so necessarily if you want 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.010
 do repairs of the areas he is 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.780
 important to have containers for 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:33.700
 keep them or if I bought myself 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.229
 two bottles like that it feels nothing of 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.100
 250 thousand and a fall and also some 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.470
 pumps his banks if it will 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.410
 certainly for shampoos after 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.119
 shampoos and this time up and will be 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.800
 not bad on my t-shirt remember the 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.850
 last time i had no faith bddp 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.200
 I really bought it 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.080
 then I ordered aloe vera gel 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:06.689
 because that will be the main basis of 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:09.390
 I ordered the e3 purity winds 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.979
 violent I will also put this 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.750
 shoulder to the tooth 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.180
 in my living room because I needed 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.920
 also from a base the kills for fact 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.069
 then I bought myself oil from 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.560
 ricin that by cons it will not enter 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.140
 in the composition of the world lives yes in 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.560
 did I have no 1200 and I estimate 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.610
 that both licenses and a mule 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.500
 must to absolutely not have this 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.930
 including his little mustache and a piece 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.160
 i'm sick lacombe for letting abuse 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.379
 Anti fall 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.319
 we grow hair is perfect 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.840
 so little maintenance maybe all the 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:52.340
 world does not know it's on the part of a 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.340
 gift or others here is the asset 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.720
 plant hair as you activate 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.720
 the microcirculation obviously I 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.900
 taken by the conservatives of which 106 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.720
 do not forget about house repair at 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.510
 absolutely part in its products plan 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.950
 Tory 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.830
 we will look at what counts 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.160
 bontemps the pants is the best 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.900
 because i know i took a duo nick 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.400
 watsa too i do not think that much 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.170
 people do not actually know that's it 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.410
 walk exactly like the bts 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.099
 it's just that their right is more 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.780
 easy to manipulate i will say 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.160
 because the small and masisi I had 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.420
 took the little Hermes who could not have 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.410
 I had to play with them all that 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.840
 do not erase 2 gatherer bain marie and 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.239
 I did not want in clothes the 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.569
 bothering with all this is my first 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:53.829
 attempt to make a ding 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:56.099
 so I took this thing earlier if that 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.480
 is a derivative of honey actually and that 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.790
 precisely it is a fact emollient 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.269
 so that's what will soften the hair 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.810
 and that will allow disentangling 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.579
 fascinating here is to listen to m in 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.079
 this repair and there is nothing to 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.010
 heat so I know it's easy 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.510
 of use 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.880
 then I got the 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.800
 protein 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.860
 basically for his side 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.870
 thickener for the fus so its senses 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.280
 and a strong hair loss and if the 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.710
 hair so for the one who misses 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.170
 volume that is rare to have more 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.540
 maybe test his judge had tested I 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.820
 see if it works but here is a 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.060
 Proteinuria apparently it works 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.320
 well for and pc the bag of blood in 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:44.440
 it's a neutral shampoo base 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:48.160
 and I took them to make my 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.870
 shampoo but for now I want 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.980
 not to get into the shampoo 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.510
 now i will start with the 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.220
 living and we will see later 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.470
 so at the end my shampoo still 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.860
 I anticipated I took this base the 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.680
 request here is also always what will 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.930
 go into the composition of mouchan 3 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.140
 this is the opinion of chic with heels and 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:12.400
 acquires to have enough years 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:14.560
 of offers and as I said so for 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.930
 the moment I 'm not going to focus on 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.000
 the field because I do not know yet 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.790
 what wording I want for my 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.380
 dhr shampoo by cons for my book 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.020
 I already know exactly what I want 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.120
 and I already there you're in the lead that's it 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.250
 that you started doing so that's it 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.900
 that's pretty much I wanted china whose 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.500
 rotten capitulate so much in the cities one 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:39.160
 will have jelle van damme eberhard de lytro 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.260
 laden sells rice protein from 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.470
 the share of abb 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.900
 jbouri what do you of course ducos because as 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.100
 conservative and also I would put in 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.420
 the essential 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.420
 I do not think I do but a 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.100
 video on how to make this book there 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.530
 because I do not think it's 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.400
 super interesting and anyway I 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.750
 do not want it going to give 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.460
 as expected so I would not know 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.100
 dino family to tell me that here is 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.800
 he manufactures and this one I do not know that 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.330
 does not work but you will be 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.550
 made is what I'm going to turn 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.460
 to this test video a video test 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:16.330
 my gym or definitely I dream hairstyle 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.070
 based on loops to give my opinion 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.920
 precisely level of the definition of 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.260
 banks or at the level of the texture of the 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.000
 the soup of his hair from the port area 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.070
 will be more interesting to make a video 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.810
 like that so that's what I would do 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:36.430
 challenge and that's it for the video 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.140
 I hope it will give envy to 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.810
 some of them also to embark on their 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.580
 own pub preparation because 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.250
 finally there is nothing better than 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.200
 know exactly what we put on the 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.350
 game and finally it's to be proud of 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.830
 to say that we made it 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:56.050
 these products that even if it does not work 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.510
 it's not too bad because a member has 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.440
 tried and it is by forging that 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.530
 becomes a blacksmith 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.540
 so on this I'll leave you i'm going 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.640
 no techno long I tell you to 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.570
 very soon for the next video that 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:13.060
 will definitely be the test of my book 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:16.060
 I think I'm staying 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.060
 before
