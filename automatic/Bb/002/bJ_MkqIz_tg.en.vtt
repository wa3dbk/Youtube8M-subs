00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.649 
used to that material and I really like
that<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.189> screen<00:01:44.610> looks<00:01:44.880> beautiful<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that the screen looks beautiful the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.359 
that the screen looks beautiful the
colors<00:01:45.990> are<00:01:46.170> really<00:01:46.350> vibrant<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.280> a

really<00:01:47.549> bright<00:01:47.880> screen<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.659> couldn't<00:01:48.930> make

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
really bright screen and I couldn't make

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.109 
really bright screen and I couldn't make
out<00:01:49.320> any<00:01:49.590> pixels<00:01:50.070> at<00:01:50.220> all<00:01:50.340> unless<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.880> looked

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
out any pixels at all unless I looked

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.179 
out any pixels at all unless I looked
really<00:01:51.479> closely<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:52.290> far<00:01:52.740> as<00:01:52.829> my<00:01:52.979> first

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
really closely as far as my first

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
impressions when I turned it on I

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.480 
impressions when I turned it on I
started<00:01:55.110> opening<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:55.799> all<00:01:56.040> different<00:01:56.189> kinds

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
started opening up all different kinds

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.789 
started opening up all different kinds
of<00:01:56.700> apps<00:01:57.020> multitasking<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.320> back<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.680> my

anything<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.710> do<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.430> wasn't<00:02:02.670> getting

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
anything I can do and I wasn't getting

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.300 
anything I can do and I wasn't getting
any<00:02:03.270> lag<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:03.719> all<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.079> phone<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.560> very<00:02:04.920> snappy

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
any lag at all the phone is very snappy

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.100 
any lag at all the phone is very snappy
which<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.939> really<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.390> see<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.960> it's

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
which I really like to see and it's

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.080 
which I really like to see and it's
really<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.439> pleasure<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.979> use<00:02:08.160> now<00:02:08.789> for<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
really a pleasure to use now for the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.850 
really a pleasure to use now for the
benchmarking<00:02:09.690> tests<00:02:10.050> i'm<00:02:10.140> using<00:02:10.440> these<00:02:10.560> same

that<00:02:17.630> video<00:02:17.840> yet<00:02:18.230> i<00:02:18.260> definitely<00:02:18.830> recommend

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
that video yet i definitely recommend

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.890 
that video yet i definitely recommend
doing<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:19.730> it's<00:02:19.940> very<00:02:20.150> cool<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.569> it's

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
doing so it's very cool and it's

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.229 
doing so it's very cool and it's

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
compare them all together and see how

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.640 
compare them all together and see how
they<00:02:35.330> hold<00:02:35.480> up<00:02:35.660> i'm<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.170> start<00:02:36.410> up<00:02:36.560> the

they hold up i'm going to start up the

they hold up i'm going to start up the

Geekbench test and fast forward to the

Geekbench test and fast forward to the
end<00:02:38.450> when<00:02:38.900> we<00:02:39.019> get<00:02:39.170> all<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.380> scores<00:02:39.709> in<00:02:39.950> case

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
end when we get all the scores in case

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.860 
end when we get all the scores in case
you've<00:02:40.550> never<00:02:40.580> seen<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.150> geek<00:02:41.390> bench<00:02:41.600> test

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
you've never seen a geek bench test

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.360 
you've never seen a geek bench test
before<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.290> basically<00:02:42.620> it'll<00:02:42.860> give<00:02:43.099> us<00:02:43.130> a

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
before it basically it'll give us a

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.949 
before it basically it'll give us a
score<00:02:43.730> at<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:43.940> end<00:02:44.090> relating<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.870> the

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
score at the end relating to the

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.960 
score at the end relating to the
processing<00:02:45.470> power<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:45.980> phone<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.760> right

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
processing power of the phone so right

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.540 
processing power of the phone so right
now<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.450> test<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:48.140> testing<00:02:48.709> how<00:02:48.890> fast<00:02:49.220> each

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
now this test is testing how fast each

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.280 
now this test is testing how fast each
of<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.760> processors<00:02:50.330> are<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:50.959> that<00:02:51.049> we<00:02:51.140> can

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
of the processors are and that we can

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.809 
of the processors are and that we can
take<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.650> scores<00:02:51.950> compared<00:02:52.430> them<00:02:52.519> together

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
take the scores compared them together

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.699 
take the scores compared them together
and<00:02:53.090> figure<00:02:53.330> out<00:02:53.390> which<00:02:53.660> one<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.200> fastest

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
and figure out which one is the fastest

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.800 
and figure out which one is the fastest
as<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.310> can<00:02:55.430> see<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.790> Nexus<00:02:56.150> 5<00:02:56.390> had<00:02:56.690> the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
as you can see the Nexus 5 had the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.680 
as you can see the Nexus 5 had the
highest<00:02:57.049> score<00:02:57.319> with<00:02:58.269> 2701<00:02:59.269> for<00:02:59.630> the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
highest score with 2701 for the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.449 
highest score with 2701 for the
multi-core<00:03:00.230> score<00:03:00.470> which<00:03:00.950> is<00:03:01.100> on<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.310> bottom

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
multi-core score which is on the bottom

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.830 
multi-core score which is on the bottom
that's<00:03:01.790> one<00:03:02.030> we're<00:03:02.150> going<00:03:02.269> to<00:03:02.330> be<00:03:02.420> taking<00:03:02.569> a

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
that's one we're going to be taking a

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.350 
that's one we're going to be taking a
