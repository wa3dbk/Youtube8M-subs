bid so we've proven beyond a shadow of a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.860 
bid so we've proven beyond a shadow of a
doubt<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> whole<00:02:11.370> process<00:02:11.819> was<00:02:12.450> corrupt

and<00:02:13.900> that's<00:02:14.140> why<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.379> only<00:02:14.470> answer<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.370> to

and that's why the only answer is to

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.729 
and that's why the only answer is to

due<00:02:50.440> course<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:51.159> think<00:02:51.450> personally<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.659> is<00:02:52.690> very

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
due course I think personally it is very

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.839 
due course I think personally it is very
very<00:02:53.620> unlikely<00:02:54.069> that<00:02:54.310> there<00:02:54.609> will<00:02:54.639> be<00:02:54.730> a

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
very unlikely that there will be a

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.119 
very unlikely that there will be a
revote<00:02:55.389> and<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:56.139> reason<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.799> is<00:02:56.829> that

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
revote and the reason to that is that

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.360 
revote and the reason to that is that
the<00:02:57.609> 28<00:02:58.209> 2002<00:02:58.900> bidding<00:02:59.590> was<00:02:59.769> run<00:02:59.950> at<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.159> same
