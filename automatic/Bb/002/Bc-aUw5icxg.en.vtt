00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.050
 More and more farmers have become Energy 4 in recent years 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.780
 Some build biogas plants but biogas does not have too much meanwhile 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.210
 good reputation more many plants stink around arise corn monocultures 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.640
 and often only the gas is used 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.249
 the net profit 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:25.549
 the others cultivated oilseed rape as fuel since trillion 

00:00:25.549 --> 00:00:29.060
 Taxes on fuel are no longer worthwhile 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.469
 we have an energy there in Franconian Switzerland 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.469
 here now relies on wood gas 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.120
 It is quiet in Gelsenkirchen of Franconian Switzerland 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.780
 and especially quiet in the oil mill Werner hardly anyone comes yet 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.620
 to the plant NÃ¶th instead 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.809
 Farmer Bernhard Werner has invested five million euros 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.960
 has put on flop on biofuels from domestic fields 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.180
 his op silos are empty 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.610
 his flower mill stands most of the time 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.610
 the basic idea was, of course, from farmer to energy producer 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.090
 Of course it is sad how the politicians broke our back 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.550
 initially priemer the freight forwarders normal every corner solution put them 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.850
 driven with apple 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.870
 and third will soon be the 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.100
 Reorganization had been announced not only introduced 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.720
 that the traffic gave 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.500
 Of course we have invested millions 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.260
 when the opinion is absolute more 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.890
 who in renewable resources and in processing renewable 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.670
 Investing in raw materials that we can not lie wrong in any case 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.190
 Politics has taught us something else 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.190
 around the now course percent to 13 interpretation 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.180
 actually it takes fight for survival 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.450
 if I can not survive with rapeseed oil it showed up 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.720
 then I'm just sitting on another renewable resource 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.720
 on wood 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.170
 Bernhard Werner also owns a warehouse with grain 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.290
 So far, he has supplied electricity with electricity and heat from the smallest oil 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.730
 but if that works with wood then cook one big one 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.149
 wood gasification 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.559
 However, reliably functioning wood gasifiers do not exist on the market 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:13.109
 Rod to buy 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.469
 so Bernhard Werner developed and built his own model 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:26.079
 and really the Daniel Gyroscope from the country finally made it 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.079
 his own wood gas power 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.029
 Imholz carburetor he does not burn the wood with an open flame 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.559
 into the boiler furnace of the inventors to get wood and to bloom 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.719
 This creates combustible wood guest 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.069
 the first few minutes he starts burning the gas 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.209
 until the cheese has the necessary operating temperature then gas is generated 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.209
 with which a motor can be driven 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.620
 in the reservoir of his wood gasifier is shaking the energy 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:03.149
 will dry if wood chips 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.549
 then the wood automatically falls in small portions through several 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.320
 smuggle 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.209
 in the wood carburetor boiler unlocked 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.469
 Lock too 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.389
 so it does not uncontrollably air in the boiler 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.429
 after all, in the wood gasifier the wood should only bloom 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.539
 so that wood gas 2 is produced but not immediately burn 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:32.889
 After a few minutes, the quality of the wood gas is so good that it is not 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.569
 more must be flared 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.299
 now the glass is suitable 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.299
 drive a huge ship engine 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.279
 Bernhard Werner bought this courage watch info Germany 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:48.569
 started with vegetable oil 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.339
 Ship engine powers a generator 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.709
 and he shows both electricity and waste heat 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.889
 the monster is a deficit 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.889
 and ecologically sensible combined heat and power plant 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:10.879
 The marine engines are started with vegetable oil 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.190
 there Werner has him run haberdashery and then switches promptly on wood 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.150
 gas operation 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.609
 the extremely slow-running Toker marine engine reliably around the clock 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.210
 This is only possible because Bernhard Werner generates very clean gas 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.849
 Engine damage Cercone starts washing out 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.530
 the power of the wood gas power plant is considerable 200 kilowatts of electricity + the 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.530
 throw the same amount 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.819
 but he wanted to be run very well without Tor 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.819
 also the foothills largely vacated if he is a traitor 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.219
 People still wanted people 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.219
 200 euros 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:58.219
 Rome is paid between 21 and 23 cents 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.089
 a phenomenon 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:05.339
 The inventor uses wood to generate as much electricity and heat as other farmers 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:07.469
 a large biogas plant 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.810
 Even without liquid manure and maize, electricity can be put into the public grid 

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:12.089
 Selling 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:13.940
 Klose heat to heat 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.940
 or dry 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.169
 The Knights gas production works only with wood chips separated into peaks 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:23.930
 from 8 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.110
 the Hauck becomes the energy and arranges it on a self-constructed 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.870
 Wait for drying 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.219
 cheap waste heat traffic in power generation abundant 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.529
 So it is also used 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:38.059
 Bernhard Lange has little own forest 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:41.459
 He buys the wood from the surrounding forest farmers in Franconian Switzerland 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.589
 They are happy about the new wood gasifier from Bernhard Perner 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.770
 he consumes about three tons of weak wood a good customer daily 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.300
 By the way, the energy splits becomes for the forest owners beech wood 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.850
 and turn it into firewood for stoves Red Bulls with the waste heat 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.050
 his wood gasifier he dries the logs to less than 20 percent 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.919
 residual moisture 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.280
 so the forest owners benefit for their wood 70 to 75 euros each 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:13.219
 Piece of room meter depending on weight 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.039
 but the demands of the consumer are high here 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.129
 But it should also generate this higher price, because of why 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:23.639
 Consumers with a tiled stove leads with that makes you a year round 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.229
 Under clearly audible is because its housing, the higher energy yield 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.860
 the higher quality that better handling that speak again 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.059
 Of course material is delivered that this is worth in the higher price 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:41.559
 Electricity and heat from wood instead of vegetable oil or biogas 

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:46.149
 The Maggie will Bernhard Werner proves that it works with wood heated 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:49.360
 the fullness of his plant his invention 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.110
 also build for other people 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.289
 which does not just burn the renewable raw material wood but the 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.550
 want to use more fictitious
