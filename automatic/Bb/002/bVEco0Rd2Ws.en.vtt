00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.430
 Hello dear friends with you about 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.340
 joker and literally yesterday after small 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.160
 technical work throughout the region came out 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.170
 new game update patch 085 released 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.570
 This patch brought us a new line 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.210
 wonderful medium German tanks with 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.550
 the best guns in the game and a couple of little ones 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.530
 planned Soviet fireflies for me 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.570
 the most interesting is the new map 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.970
 pearl river in which many 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.309
 bugs and loopholes this video is like 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.590
 previous will also be associated with this 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.940
 Asian card and so let's not 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.940
 go weary 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.439
 so today our tank will be connected to 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.240
 a house that is in the square f6 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.460
 and to be more precise here with this house 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.210
 the house is very interesting and you can 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.270
 get there 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.520
 there are two ways the first is more difficult 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.750
 second easier and so let's see 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.390
 on the first way 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.640
 take overclocking on the Christmas tree and here it is 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.759
 way we drive under the locking wall 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.119
 at home we have not had time to hit the house but 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.490
 Our camera is already in it means a house 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.990
 hiding myself a few secrets gas 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.679
 knit gas we start shaking and here 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.990
 so we get into there 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:01.210
 another case with exactly this one 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.520
 moment happens you shakes decides will come 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.670
 and you fly out but to be honest with me 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.100
 this is not yet the second way 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.489
 less painful for your crew like 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.670
 first and the translation will be so shake also 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:19.090
 the second way a lot of fan is 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.730
 can almost repeat any Christmas tree almost 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.459
 90 percent of cases you will always get 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.760
 to the house and it goes very smoothly and 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.700
 painlessly 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.099
 and so let's see we take again 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.799
 overclocking note feast we eat with 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:37.250
 the other side in relation to the house or 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.819
 down call in this part but this where 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.659
 located 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.010
 Christmas trees which of course is great for us 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.280
 take a very small acceleration is not here 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.750
 thus falls 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.629
 the house is very interesting and if you 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.120
 try you can and outliers 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.079
 in the same way as drove in 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.359
 second way 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.950
