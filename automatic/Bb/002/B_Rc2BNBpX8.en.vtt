00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.809
 on the occasion of the world day 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.910
 of metrology was presented a 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.560
 system that promises to make the internet 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.720
 super secure thanks to encryption 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.980
 quantum explains us what is the 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.989
 principle if the basic principle is 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.460
 the use of cryptography 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.250
 quantum the need for 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.440
 supersicure communications is one 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.540
 necessity that was already known by the ancients 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.000
 we speak of systems developed by i 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.289
 spartans from giulio cesare to systems 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.600
 more recent as the puzzle machine 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.340
 used by the Germans in the second war 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.309
 world-wide even today 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.670
 we use a lot of encryption 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.170
 however, just think of it all 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.179
 exchange of emails we have at 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.179
 online purchase banking transactions 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.760
 all this system however at the time of 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.729
 Classic cryptography is based on a 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.979
 simple mathematical concept namely 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.250
 on the difficulty of factoring a 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:10.070
 extremely large integer in 94 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.229
 however peter shore has shown that with 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.600
 a quantum computer is possible to do 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.100
 this operation very easily 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.240
 fortunately quantum computer does not 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.010
 it is still available to us though 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.320
 virtually this is possible and this 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.510
 has pushed a lot in the development of a 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.420
 new completely different protocol 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.630
 security that is based on 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.970
 quantum mechanics to guarantee the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.030
 inviolability of the code 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.640
 the basic concept is that instead of 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.730
 communicate via light pulses in 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.910
 which there are so many photons e 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.760
 which therefore can be easily 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.010
 halved and extracted as information 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.870
 it communicates with a single photon a 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.480
 this point the single photon not only 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.610
 it cannot be broken but neither is it 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.040
 possible to make a measurement on the individual 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.140
 photon without leaving a trace and this 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.380
 quantum mechanics says so 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.019
 so if some third party wants 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.190
 try to intercept a message 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.200
 necessarily change the message 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.489
 same and therefore the two parts that are 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.950
 communicating can easily 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.989
 realizing that the message comes 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.720
 which are the prospects intercepted 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.489
 of quantum cryptography and the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.200
 prospects are numerous 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.060
 divide above all into 22 categories one 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.799
 first a free space communication 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.489
 therefore being able to achieve 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.950
 secure communications with satellites and 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.349
 therefore with a propagation in the air one 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.239
 second application instead is that of 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.769
 exploit fiber optics as it comes 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.190
 commonly done in communications 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.470
 optical 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.580
 the main problem in this is 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.519
 being able to use fiber networks 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.590
 optics already available as it is 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.360
 evident that if we mix a signal 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.489
 quantum based on the single photon 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.739
 with a classic signal instead where there is 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.440
 they are a lot of photons just a minimum 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.019
 classical signal dispersion for 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.370
 go cover and make 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.500
 unusable quantum signals e 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.260
 This is precisely the challenge that we 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.120
 we are therefore faced with being able 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.160
 use networks already available to do 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.290
 this type of communication in 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.170
 perspective this can allow you to 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.090
 have a protocol-based internet 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.680
 quantum security then 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.549
 certainly much more secure than that 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.549
 we can have it now
