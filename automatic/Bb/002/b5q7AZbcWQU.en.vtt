00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.129
 I arranged to enter the game of you 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.570
 walker in material mode from 2 to 13 and 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.820
 I found the unpleasant surprise 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.580
 that I was getting a file 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.920
 corrupt in the xbox related to the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.869
 league mode and what I had to do was 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.810
 erase that is what I did in 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.410
 internet delete the damaged file 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.220
 of security there was nothing to do 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.180
