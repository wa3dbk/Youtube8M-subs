00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
them back and forth and see if there's

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.250 
them back and forth and see if there's
any<00:00:39.059> play<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.510> wheel<00:00:39.690> you'll<00:00:40.020> feel

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
any play in the wheel you'll feel

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.990 
any play in the wheel you'll feel
clicking<00:00:40.739> or<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> giving<00:00:41.280> movement<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.820> that

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
clicking or a giving movement and that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.670 
clicking or a giving movement and that
movement<00:00:42.239> could<00:00:42.600> indicate<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.050> bad<00:00:43.260> tire<00:00:43.500> rod

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
movement could indicate a bad tire rod

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.229 
movement could indicate a bad tire rod
if<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.040> think<00:00:44.280> there's<00:00:44.430> some<00:00:44.579> play<00:00:44.820> or<00:00:45.120> you

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
just want to check further you could

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.410 
just want to check further you could
take<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> tire<00:00:47.010> off<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.370> inspect<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.090> tie<00:00:48.239> rod

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
take the tire off and inspect a tie rod

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.000 
take the tire off and inspect a tie rod
itself<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.260> there<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.440> two<00:00:49.590> parts<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.980> your

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
itself so there are two parts to your

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.189 
itself so there are two parts to your
tie<00:00:50.219> rods<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.969> inner<00:00:51.149> tie<00:00:51.420> rod<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.870> your

tie rods your inner tie rod and your
outer<00:00:52.379> tie<00:00:52.620> rod<00:00:52.680> inspect<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> inner<00:00:53.910> tire<00:00:54.149> out

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
outer tie rod inspect the inner tire out

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.939 
outer tie rod inspect the inner tire out
visually<00:00:54.510> by<00:00:54.870> looking<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> boot<00:00:55.559> seeing

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
visually by looking at the boot seeing

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.860 
visually by looking at the boot seeing
if<00:00:56.039> there's<00:00:56.190> any<00:00:56.250> leaks<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.090> don't<00:00:57.570> see<00:00:57.690> any

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
if there's any leaks I don't see any

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.630 
if there's any leaks I don't see any
leaks<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.680> boot<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.070> still<00:00:59.309> intact

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
leaks here the boot is still intact

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.520 
leaks here the boot is still intact
there<00:00:59.969> are<00:01:00.059> no<00:01:00.210> holes<00:01:00.539> there's<00:01:00.899> no<00:01:01.050> rips<00:01:01.379> or

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
there are no holes there's no rips or

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.399 
there are no holes there's no rips or
anything<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.850> visually<00:01:03.359> looks<00:01:03.600> good<00:01:03.870> now

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
anything so that visually looks good now

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.990 
anything so that visually looks good now
for<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.680> outer<00:01:04.830> tie<00:01:05.129> rod<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.460> could<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.760> here

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
for the outer tie rod you could see here

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.789 
for the outer tie rod you could see here
already<00:01:06.090> there's<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.750> nice<00:01:06.900> big<00:01:07.170> gash<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.619> my

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
already there's a nice big gash on my

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.830 
already there's a nice big gash on my
tie<00:01:07.950> rod<00:01:08.159> boot<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.270> happens<00:01:09.600> over

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
tie rod boot and this just happens over

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.990 
tie rod boot and this just happens over
time<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.590> boot<00:01:10.799> cracks<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.400> goes<00:01:11.520> bad<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
time the boot cracks and goes bad and

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.940 
time the boot cracks and goes bad and
then<00:01:12.360> inside<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.869> could<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.560> grittiness

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
then inside you could see the grittiness

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.130 
then inside you could see the grittiness
and<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:15.090> greediness<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.630> not<00:01:15.810> good<00:01:15.990> that's

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
and that greediness is not good that's

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.990 
and that greediness is not good that's
like<00:01:16.350> sand<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.920> stuff<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.430> gets<00:01:17.610> kicked<00:01:17.850> up

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
like sand and stuff that gets kicked up

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.450 
like sand and stuff that gets kicked up
and<00:01:18.240> goes<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.770> shot<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.280> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
and goes in here so this is shot if you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.249 
and goes in here so this is shot if you
catch<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.939> boot<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.150> was<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.630> recently<00:01:21.780> torn

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
catch a boot that was just recently torn

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.560 
catch a boot that was just recently torn
sometimes<00:01:22.950> these<00:01:23.280> boots<00:01:23.549> are<00:01:23.729> replaceable<00:01:24.210> so

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
time we do an oil change it'll force the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.270 
time we do an oil change it'll force the
old<00:02:03.960> grease<00:02:04.290> out<00:02:04.469> which<00:02:04.680> carries<00:02:05.070> all<00:02:05.159> the

old grease out which carries all the
grit<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.640> stuff<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.210> will<00:02:06.360> last<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.719> lot

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
grit and stuff so this will last a lot

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.900 
grit and stuff so this will last a lot
longer<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.740> upon<00:02:08.009> visual<00:02:08.369> inspection<00:02:08.819> you

out and it's allowing movement which
isn't<00:03:00.300> good<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.480> don't<00:03:00.660> want<00:03:00.870> any<00:03:01.019> movement

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
isn't good you don't want any movement

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
do is move it around like this make sure

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.600 
do is move it around like this make sure
you<00:03:07.200> don't<00:03:07.290> feel<00:03:07.500> any<00:03:07.650> grittiness<00:03:08.070> no

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
you don't feel any grittiness no

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.030 
you don't feel any grittiness no
grinding<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.480> it's<00:03:10.350> ok<00:03:10.620> if<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.890> little

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
grinding and it's ok if it's a little

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.280 
grinding and it's ok if it's a little
bit<00:03:11.160> movable<00:03:11.640> but<00:03:12.120> if<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.360> moves<00:03:12.630> like<00:03:12.989> way<00:03:13.230> too

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
bit movable but if it moves like way too

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.650 
bit movable but if it moves like way too
easy<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.890> just<00:03:13.980> feels<00:03:14.220> way<00:03:14.550> too<00:03:14.580> loose<00:03:15.060> then

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
easy and just feels way too loose then

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.940 
easy and just feels way too loose then
you<00:03:15.810> might<00:03:15.930> want<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.140> consider<00:03:16.410> changing<00:03:16.890> the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
you might want to consider changing the

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.220 
you might want to consider changing the
inner<00:03:17.040> tie<00:03:17.280> rod<00:03:17.340> this<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:17.810> relatively<00:03:18.810> easy<00:03:18.930> to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
inner tie rod this is relatively easy to

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.750 
inner tie rod this is relatively easy to
move<00:03:19.380> but<00:03:19.620> still<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.340> feel<00:03:20.519> some

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
move but still I can feel some

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.310 
move but still I can feel some
resistance<00:03:20.940> which<00:03:21.510> means<00:03:21.750> it's<00:03:21.900> still<00:03:22.110> good

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
resistance which means it's still good

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.020 
resistance which means it's still good
so<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.829> outer<00:03:22.980> tie<00:03:23.280> rod<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.610> bad<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
so the outer tie rod is bad but the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.880 
so the outer tie rod is bad but the
inner<00:03:24.269> tie<00:03:24.480> rod<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.780> good<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.470> that's<00:03:25.590> ok

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
inner tie rod is good but that's ok

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.590 
inner tie rod is good but that's ok
because<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.280> outer<00:03:26.400> tie<00:03:26.640> rod<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.910> an<00:03:27.030> easy<00:03:27.239> fix

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
because the outer tie rod is an easy fix

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.870 
because the outer tie rod is an easy fix
and<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:28.290> can<00:03:28.410> replace<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:28.860> in<00:03:29.070> 10<00:03:29.459> minutes

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
and you can replace this in 10 minutes

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.690 
and you can replace this in 10 minutes
