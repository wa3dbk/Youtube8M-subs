it's<00:01:29.130> not<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.610> bad<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.689> local

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
it's not so bad it is just a local

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
look at those regular look at the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.910 
look at those regular look at the
options<00:01:36.840> really<00:01:37.229> quick<00:01:37.380> there's<00:01:37.590> sound

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
options really quick there's sound

that<00:01:43.259> let's<00:01:43.920> go<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.189> jump<00:01:44.310> into<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> gameplay

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
that let's go and jump into the gameplay

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.310 
that let's go and jump into the gameplay
there<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> couple<00:01:45.509> different<00:01:45.750> modes<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
there are a couple different modes and

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.410 
there are a couple different modes and
by<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> couple<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:46.920> meet<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> lot<00:01:47.340> there's<00:01:48.000> normal

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
by a couple we meet a lot there's normal

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.910 
by a couple we meet a lot there's normal
timed<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.930> then<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> four<00:01:49.350> kids<00:01:49.500> mode<00:01:49.770> which

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
timed and then the four kids mode which

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.590 
timed and then the four kids mode which
is<00:01:50.009> basically<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.579> game<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.000> crack<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
is basically this game on crack with the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.230 
is basically this game on crack with the
rails<00:01:51.840> taken<00:01:52.290> off<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:53.340> normal<00:01:53.520> mode<00:01:53.880> comes

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
rails taken off the normal mode comes

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.090 
rails taken off the normal mode comes
with<00:01:54.509> three<00:01:54.990> different<00:01:55.170> difficulties<00:01:55.860> as

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
with three different difficulties as

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.980 
with three different difficulties as
does<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> timed<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.210> both<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.719> these<00:01:57.810> are

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
does the timed in both of these are

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.600 
does the timed in both of these are
pretty<00:01:58.140> self-explanatory<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:59.280> one's<00:01:59.430> more

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
pretty self-explanatory this one's more

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.249 
pretty self-explanatory this one's more
of<00:01:59.700> an<00:01:59.759> arcade<00:02:00.119> game<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.630> then<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.200> one

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
of an arcade game and then this one

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.289 
of an arcade game and then this one
gives<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.710> time<00:02:01.950> set<00:02:02.399> frame<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:03.060> score

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
gives you a time set frame to score

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.090 
gives you a time set frame to score
points<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.380> said<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> four<00:02:04.829> kids<00:02:05.009> and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
points in like I said the four kids and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.560 
points in like I said the four kids and
one<00:02:05.159> basically<00:02:05.520> takes<00:02:05.790> off<00:02:05.969> all<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> rules

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
one basically takes off all the rules

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.350 
one basically takes off all the rules
which<00:02:07.110> will<00:02:07.259> show<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.920> second<00:02:08.360> so

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
which will show you in just a second so

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.790 
which will show you in just a second so
get<00:02:09.509> through<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> nice<00:02:09.899> loading<00:02:10.289> screen<00:02:10.560> here

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
get through the nice loading screen here

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.309 
get through the nice loading screen here
as<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.640> see<00:02:11.849> I've<00:02:12.000> got<00:02:12.180> my<00:02:12.390> farm<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.200> then

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
as you can see I've got my farm and then

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.730 
as you can see I've got my farm and then
as

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
as

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.580 
as
so<00:02:13.830> if<00:02:14.040> I'm<00:02:14.250> ready<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:15.570> hear<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.050> birds<00:02:16.260> come

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
and essentially what you're supposed to

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.930 
and essentially what you're supposed to
do<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.110> slap<00:02:19.410> these<00:02:19.590> guys<00:02:19.860> with<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.670> garbage

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
do is slap these guys with the garbage

do is slap these guys with the garbage
that<00:02:21.210> I'm<00:02:21.330> Hawking<00:02:21.660> out<00:02:21.780> from<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.020> bottom

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
that I'm Hawking out from the bottom

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.230 
that I'm Hawking out from the bottom
here<00:02:22.500> using<00:02:22.800> my<00:02:22.920> thumb<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.850> in<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.060> sense

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
here using my thumb so in this sense

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.000 
here using my thumb so in this sense
it's<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.570> physics<00:02:24.960> game<00:02:25.170> because<00:02:25.470> I'm<00:02:25.620> flinging

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
it's a physics game because I'm flinging

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.290 
it's a physics game because I'm flinging
these<00:02:26.160> things<00:02:26.370> actually<00:02:26.640> do<00:02:26.850> have<00:02:26.940> 2<00:02:27.000> n<00:02:27.150> even

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
these things actually do have 2 n even

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.510 
these things actually do have 2 n even
if<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.450> go<00:02:27.570> slightly<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.800> thing<00:02:29.010> doesn't<00:02:29.400> go

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
if I go slightly the thing doesn't go

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.250 
if I go slightly the thing doesn't go
very<00:02:29.550> far<00:02:30.090> there's<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.840> bunch<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.110> other

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
very far there's a bunch of other

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.650 
very far there's a bunch of other
methods<00:02:31.680> as<00:02:31.830> far<00:02:32.070> as<00:02:32.300> eliminating<00:02:33.300> these

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
methods as far as eliminating these

touch this adds a lot to the gameplay
and<00:02:46.890> makes<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.490> more<00:02:48.000> varied<00:02:48.180> than<00:02:48.300> before

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
and makes it a more varied than before

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.000 
and makes it a more varied than before
an<00:02:48.930> extra<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.350> lot<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.500> keep<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.860> ball
