the<00:02:33.950> world<00:02:34.280> cup<00:02:34.459> in<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.760> back<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:35.000> their<00:02:35.120> minds

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
the world cup in the back of their minds

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.570 
the world cup in the back of their minds
is<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.660> biggest<00:02:36.069> you<00:02:37.069> know<00:02:37.160> tournament<00:02:37.519> to

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
win this season that red which M chips

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.050 
win this season that red which M chips
in<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.590> shortened<00:02:39.950> version<00:02:40.069> only<00:02:40.489> playing<00:02:40.910> each

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
in a shortened version only playing each

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.210 
in a shortened version only playing each
other<00:02:41.209> once<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:42.349> think<00:02:42.530> actually<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.769> really

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
other once so I think actually a really

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.770 
other once so I think actually a really
good<00:02:43.340> drawer<00:02:43.700> if<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:43.970> consider<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.540> we're

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
good drawer if you consider that we're

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.240 
good drawer if you consider that we're
player<00:02:45.019> Australia<00:02:45.650> way<00:02:45.799> then<00:02:46.010> we<00:02:46.069> play

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
player Australia way then we play

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.580 
player Australia way then we play
argentina<00:02:46.730> New<00:02:47.269> Zealand<00:02:47.569> at<00:02:47.720> home<00:02:48.230> whereas

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
argentina New Zealand at home whereas

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.990 
argentina New Zealand at home whereas
New<00:02:48.769> Zealand<00:02:49.099> for<00:02:49.160> example<00:02:49.670> only<00:02:49.760> play

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
New Zealand for example only play

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.360 
New Zealand for example only play
argentino<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.720> think<00:02:51.650> we<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.890> work<00:02:52.099> the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
argentino you think we the work the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.039 
argentino you think we the work the
weakest<00:02:52.670> team<00:02:52.910> at<00:02:53.299> Herman<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.780> they<00:02:53.840> have<00:02:53.959> to

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
weakest team at Herman and they have to

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.569 
weakest team at Herman and they have to
travel<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.440> Australia<00:02:54.829> and<00:02:54.980> travel<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.310> South

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
travel to Australia and travel to South

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.000 
travel to Australia and travel to South
Africa<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.209> no<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:57.019> know<00:02:57.140> we've<00:02:57.470> got<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.709> few

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
Africa so no you know we've got a few

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.030 
Africa so no you know we've got a few
positives<00:02:58.910> in<00:02:59.000> our<00:02:59.780> favor<00:03:00.019> this<00:03:00.260> season<00:03:00.680> so

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
positives in our favor this season so

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.069 
positives in our favor this season so
we'll<00:03:01.910> see<00:03:02.090> how<00:03:02.120> it<00:03:02.239> all<00:03:02.420> pans<00:03:02.630> out<00:03:02.840> but<00:03:03.019> you
