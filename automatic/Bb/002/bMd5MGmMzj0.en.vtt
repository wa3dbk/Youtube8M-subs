the camera image your head get three
tools<00:01:32.549> these<00:01:33.509> basically<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.200> clip<00:01:34.380> onto<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
tools these basically just clip onto the

tools these basically just clip onto the
end<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.090> little<00:01:36.630> mirror<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.560> clips<00:01:37.799> on

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
end you have a little mirror it clips on

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.770 
end you have a little mirror it clips on
the<00:01:38.040> end<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> head<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.659> if

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the end of the head like that so if

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.569 
the end of the head like that so if
