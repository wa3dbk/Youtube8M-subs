in one spot and where there's a
well-defined<00:02:10.229> grain<00:02:10.709> so

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
well-defined grain so

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.250 
well-defined grain so
is<00:02:11.550> going<00:02:11.820> to<00:02:11.910> pick<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.330> up<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.750> takes<00:02:13.110> about

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
is going to pick this up and takes about

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.610 
is going to pick this up and takes about
five<00:02:13.590> minutes<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.300> set<00:02:15.300> up<00:02:15.330> completely<00:02:16.080> right

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
five minutes to set up completely right

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.290 
five minutes to set up completely right
now<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.800> check<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.370> make<00:02:17.490> sure<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.940> area<00:02:18.240> is

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300

just a little bit larger than the hole

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.620 
just a little bit larger than the hole
because<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.100> need<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.520> place<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.970> work<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.420> to

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
color into the accra saw now our granny

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.440 
color into the accra saw now our granny
mold<00:03:19.770> looks<00:03:20.040> like<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:20.370> almost<00:03:20.640> set<00:03:21.090> up<00:03:21.209> here

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
mold looks like it's almost set up here

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.810 
mold looks like it's almost set up here
so<00:03:21.600> let's<00:03:21.780> just<00:03:21.959> peel<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.290> off<00:03:22.560> here<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.070> look

so let's just peel it off here and look

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.699 
so let's just peel it off here and look
at<00:03:23.940> our<00:03:24.060> grain<00:03:24.330> okay<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:24.930> there's<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.440> good

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
at our grain okay so there's a good

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.510 
at our grain okay so there's a good
grain<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.160> there

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
grain in there

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.090 
grain in there
alright<00:03:27.120> now<00:03:27.330> we<00:03:27.720> take<00:03:27.930> our<00:03:28.170> chem<00:03:28.530> screen<00:03:28.890> and

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
alright now we take our chem screen and

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.590 
alright now we take our chem screen and
we're<00:03:29.220> going<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.459> cut<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.300> little

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
we're going to cut this just a little

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.560 
we're going to cut this just a little
bit<00:03:30.720> larger<00:03:30.959> than<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.620> hole<00:03:32.400> alright<00:03:33.330> and

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
bit larger than the hole alright and

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
chem screen we make the area as smooth

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.680 
chem screen we make the area as smooth
as<00:04:04.530> possible<00:04:05.040> put<00:04:05.340> my<00:04:05.550> piece<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.240> Teflon<00:04:06.660> on

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
as possible put my piece of Teflon on

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.990 
as possible put my piece of Teflon on
and<00:04:07.110> now<00:04:07.200> iron<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.920> there<00:04:08.190> okay<00:04:08.489> no<00:04:08.700> pressure

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
and now iron it there okay no pressure

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000 
and now iron it there okay no pressure
whatsoever<00:04:09.390> with<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.050> iron<00:04:10.230> put<00:04:10.590> my<00:04:10.739> coal

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
whatsoever with the iron put my coal

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.560 
whatsoever with the iron put my coal
block<00:04:11.340> on<00:04:11.580> put<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:11.940> little<00:04:12.180> bit<00:04:12.270> of<00:04:12.390> pressure

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
block on put a little bit of pressure

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.360 
block on put a little bit of pressure
there<00:04:12.870> because<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.380> will<00:04:13.470> keep<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.830> nice<00:04:14.340> and

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
there because that will keep it nice and

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.760 
there because that will keep it nice and
level<00:04:14.940> then<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.420> we<00:04:15.900> peel<00:04:16.140> it<00:04:16.169> off<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.680> if

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
level then and we peel it off and if

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.680 
level then and we peel it off and if
there's<00:04:16.950> any<00:04:17.220> that's<00:04:17.520> not<00:04:17.940> completely<00:04:18.359> cured

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
there's any that's not completely cured

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.110 
there's any that's not completely cured
it'll<00:04:18.930> stick<00:04:19.169> on<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.470> Teflon<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.160> oh<00:04:20.669> there's

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
it'll stick on the Teflon and oh there's

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.900 
it'll stick on the Teflon and oh there's
a<00:04:21.210> little<00:04:21.479> bit<00:04:21.570> there

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
a little bit there

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.640 
a little bit there
so<00:04:21.970> I<00:04:22.030> let<00:04:22.210> it<00:04:22.330> just<00:04:22.480> go<00:04:22.600> right<00:04:22.870> back<00:04:23.110> down<00:04:23.620> I

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
so I let it just go right back down I

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.340 
so I let it just go right back down I
earned<00:04:24.190> it<00:04:24.280> some<00:04:24.490> more<00:04:24.730> use<00:04:25.450> my<00:04:25.660> cold<00:04:26.020> block

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
earned it some more use my cold block

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.710 
earned it some more use my cold block
again<00:04:26.860> and<00:04:27.370> when<00:04:27.640> I<00:04:27.670> take<00:04:27.970> off<00:04:28.180> this<00:04:28.330> piece<00:04:28.570> of

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
again and when I take off this piece of

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.390 
again and when I take off this piece of
Teflon<00:04:29.140> it<00:04:29.260> should<00:04:29.440> be<00:04:29.530> perfectly<00:04:30.010> clean

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
Teflon it should be perfectly clean

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.460 
Teflon it should be perfectly clean
there<00:04:30.670> nothing<00:04:31.150> at<00:04:31.300> all<00:04:31.420> so<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.840> compound<00:04:32.260> is

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
there nothing at all so the compound is

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.380 
there nothing at all so the compound is
completely<00:04:33.280> cured<00:04:33.610> up<00:04:33.760> this<00:04:34.000> is<00:04:34.180> really

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
completely cured up this is really

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.300 
completely cured up this is really
strong<00:04:34.780> now<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.440> put<00:04:35.710> another<00:04:35.980> layer<00:04:36.250> of

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
strong now I put another layer of

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.240 
strong now I put another layer of
compound<00:04:36.970> on<00:04:37.150> top<00:04:37.630> and<00:04:37.960> we're<00:04:38.560> trying<00:04:38.920> to<00:04:39.100> make

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
compound on top and we're trying to make

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.250 
compound on top and we're trying to make
this<00:04:39.460> we're<00:04:39.670> going<00:04:39.880> to<00:04:39.970> cover<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.570> color<00:04:41.050> you

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
this we're going to cover the color you

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.440 
this we're going to cover the color you
see<00:04:41.440> is<00:04:41.560> strong<00:04:42.010> enough<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.430> cover<00:04:42.670> a<00:04:42.820> lot<00:04:43.330> of

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
see is strong enough to cover a lot of

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.730 
see is strong enough to cover a lot of
the<00:04:43.570> chem<00:04:43.780> screen<00:04:44.080> so<00:04:44.260> it's<00:04:44.380> not<00:04:44.500> going<00:04:44.650> to

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
the chem screen so it's not going to

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.950 
the chem screen so it's not going to
shine<00:04:44.950> through<00:04:45.220> either<00:04:45.610> okay<00:04:46.330> with<00:04:46.750> my

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
shine through either okay with my

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.840 
shine through either okay with my
palette<00:04:47.440> knife<00:04:47.470> arched<00:04:48.070> I<00:04:48.250> hope<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:48.520> saw<00:04:48.700> how

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
palette knife arched I hope you saw how

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.660 
palette knife arched I hope you saw how
I<00:04:48.880> did<00:04:49.180> that<00:04:49.360> I<00:04:49.570> now<00:04:50.560> I'm<00:04:50.710> completely<00:04:50.950> cure<00:04:51.520> out

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
I did that I now I'm completely cure out

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.760 
I did that I now I'm completely cure out
the<00:04:51.850> compound<00:04:52.360> going<00:04:52.690> over<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.080> entire<00:04:53.380> area

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
the compound going over the entire area

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.680 
the compound going over the entire area
and<00:04:53.980> then<00:04:54.250> I'm<00:04:54.400> going<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.670> put<00:04:54.880> my<00:04:55.030> code<00:04:55.360> block

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
and then I'm going to put my code block

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.530 
and then I'm going to put my code block
on<00:04:55.990> there<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:56.470> again<00:04:57.130> with<00:04:57.310> pressure<00:04:57.670> so<00:04:58.330> that

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
on there and again with pressure so that

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.290 
on there and again with pressure so that
it<00:04:58.630> stays<00:04:58.900> nice<00:04:59.200> and<00:04:59.260> flat<00:04:59.890> okay<00:05:00.580> now<00:05:00.910> more

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
it stays nice and flat okay now more

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.540 
it stays nice and flat okay now more
compound<00:05:01.840> one<00:05:02.110> more<00:05:02.320> layer<00:05:02.650> so<00:05:02.980> we<00:05:03.010> put<00:05:03.310> two

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
compound one more layer so we put two

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.130 
compound one more layer so we put two
layers<00:05:03.730> on<00:05:04.060> top<00:05:04.270> of<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.540> acrosome

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
layers on top of the acrosome

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.020 
layers on top of the acrosome
come<00:05:05.410> with<00:05:05.530> my<00:05:05.650> arched<00:05:06.160> palate<00:05:06.580> I<00:05:06.670> see<00:05:06.910> how<00:05:07.000> I

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
come with my arched palate I see how I

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.180 
come with my arched palate I see how I
do<00:05:07.180> that<00:05:07.450> with<00:05:07.600> the<00:05:07.690> knife<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:08.020> bend<00:05:08.350> it<00:05:08.470> so<00:05:09.010> that

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
do that with the knife I bend it so that

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.890 
do that with the knife I bend it so that
the<00:05:09.310> compound<00:05:09.790> isn't<00:05:09.970> being<00:05:10.360> dragged<00:05:10.720> out

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
the compound isn't being dragged out

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.140 
the compound isn't being dragged out
from<00:05:11.140> the<00:05:11.290> center<00:05:11.680> but<00:05:12.040> my<00:05:12.220> edges<00:05:12.670> are<00:05:12.820> getting

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
from the center but my edges are getting

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.060 
from the center but my edges are getting
really<00:05:13.510> smooth<00:05:14.050> and<00:05:14.260> this<00:05:14.410> is<00:05:14.590> getting<00:05:14.920> to

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
really smooth and this is getting to

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
really smooth and this is getting to
what<00:05:15.250> we're<00:05:15.400> talking<00:05:15.640> about<00:05:15.700> being<00:05:16.060> a
