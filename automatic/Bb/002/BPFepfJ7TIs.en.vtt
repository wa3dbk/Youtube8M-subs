00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.280 
because so that makes it exciting
obviously<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.700> when<00:01:48.329> you're<00:01:48.509> traveling<00:01:49.170> at

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
obviously and when you're traveling at

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.679 
obviously and when you're traveling at
those<00:01:49.470> speeds<00:01:49.939> anything<00:01:50.939> can<00:01:51.090> happen<00:01:51.210> at<00:01:51.509> any

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
those speeds anything can happen at any

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.359 
those speeds anything can happen at any
point<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.170> tracks<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.590> really<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
point in the tracks you really have to

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.819 
point in the tracks you really have to
be<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.670> your<00:01:53.790> game<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.329> me<00:01:54.540> personally<00:01:55.500> that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
be on your game for me personally that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.060 
be on your game for me personally that
track<00:01:56.219> has<00:01:56.460> been

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
track has been

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.000 
track has been
a<00:01:57.130> bit<00:01:57.820> of<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:58.060> challenge<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.900> say<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.470> least<00:01:59.680> I

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
a bit of a challenge to say the least I

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.520 
a bit of a challenge to say the least I
guess<00:02:00.220> because<00:02:00.550> before<00:02:01.330> I<00:02:01.780> slid<00:02:02.320> on<00:02:02.409> that

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
guess because before I slid on that

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.590 
guess because before I slid on that
track<00:02:02.770> in<00:02:02.950> 14<00:02:03.340> years<00:02:03.550> I<00:02:03.640> had<00:02:03.760> two<00:02:03.940> crashes<00:02:04.210> and

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
track in 14 years I had two crashes and

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.230 
track in 14 years I had two crashes and
now<00:02:04.960> I<00:02:05.020> can't<00:02:05.410> count<00:02:05.650> on<00:02:05.890> all<00:02:06.220> my<00:02:06.550> fingers<00:02:06.790> into

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
now I can't count on all my fingers into

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.639 
now I can't count on all my fingers into
it<00:02:07.270> was<00:02:07.390> probably<00:02:07.690> of<00:02:07.840> how<00:02:07.930> many<00:02:08.140> crashes<00:02:08.500> I've

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
it was probably of how many crashes I've

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.560 
it was probably of how many crashes I've
had<00:02:08.830> I've<00:02:09.459> walked<00:02:09.610> away<00:02:09.789> as<00:02:10.000> concussion

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570

training has been cut short I would say

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.830
