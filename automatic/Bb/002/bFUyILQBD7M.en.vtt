00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
say is true then how do we break this

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.580

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
we are very separate characters in this

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.590 
we are very separate characters in this
but<00:01:03.500> our<00:01:03.590> characters<00:01:04.129> are<00:01:04.430> melded<00:01:05.239> at<00:01:05.360> times

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
but our characters are melded at times

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.060 
but our characters are melded at times
the<00:01:06.080> interesting<00:01:06.410> part<00:01:06.619> was<00:01:06.649> when<00:01:06.890> we're

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
the interesting part was when we're

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.830 
the interesting part was when we're
separate<00:01:07.369> we're<00:01:07.550> actually<00:01:07.700> in<00:01:08.119> either<00:01:08.600> in

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
separate we're actually in either in

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.350 
separate we're actually in either in
conflict<00:01:09.380> or<00:01:09.680> trying<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:10.640> make<00:01:10.759> a<00:01:10.789> plan<00:01:11.030> or

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
conflict or trying to make a plan or

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.910 
conflict or trying to make a plan or
moving<00:01:11.990> forward<00:01:12.259> through<00:01:12.380> something<00:01:12.710> or

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
moving forward through something or

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.950 
moving forward through something or
discovering<00:01:13.640> things<00:01:13.850> about<00:01:14.060> ourselves<00:01:14.360> I

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
discovering things about ourselves I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.480 
discovering things about ourselves I
think<00:01:15.350> there<00:01:15.530> were<00:01:15.619> challenges<00:01:15.950> with

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
think there were challenges with

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.010 
think there were challenges with
developing<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.090> characters<00:01:17.479> individually

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
developing the characters individually

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.749 
developing the characters individually
and<00:01:18.110> also<00:01:18.380> how<00:01:18.590> those<00:01:18.920> two<00:01:19.190> will<00:01:19.429> work<00:01:19.459> in

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
and also how those two will work in

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.219 
and also how those two will work in
concert<00:01:19.940> with<00:01:20.209> each<00:01:20.330> other<00:01:20.569> because<00:01:21.020> not<00:01:21.200> only

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
concert with each other because not only

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.260 
concert with each other because not only
narrative<00:01:21.920> lee<00:01:22.039> but<00:01:22.220> also<00:01:22.340> systemically<00:01:23.000> we

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
narrative lee but also systemically we

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.120 
narrative lee but also systemically we
have<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.599> establish<00:01:23.720> that<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:24.979> never

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
have to establish that and you never

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.680 
have to establish that and you never
want<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.369> do<00:01:25.490> anything<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:26.149> from<00:01:26.599> a

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
want to do anything that from a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.880 
want to do anything that from a
narrative<00:01:26.899> aspect<00:01:27.349> doesn't<00:01:27.649> support

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
narrative aspect doesn't support

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.620 
narrative aspect doesn't support
gameplay<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.610> then<00:01:28.819> in<00:01:29.060> turn<00:01:29.240> i<00:01:29.270> also<00:01:29.450> want<00:01:29.599> to

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
gameplay and then in turn i also want to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.480 
gameplay and then in turn i also want to
make<00:01:29.720> sure<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.110> gameplay<00:01:30.500> is<00:01:30.830> in<00:01:31.009> stark

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
make sure the gameplay is in stark

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.219 
make sure the gameplay is in stark
contrast<00:01:31.550> to<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.149> story<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.140> was

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
contrast to the story so it was

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.809 
contrast to the story so it was
something<00:01:33.470> that<00:01:33.500> very<00:01:33.800> early<00:01:33.860> on<00:01:34.160> this

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
something that very early on this

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.850 
something that very early on this
relationship<00:01:35.599> is<00:01:35.810> really<00:01:36.050> kind<00:01:36.259> of<00:01:36.349> the<00:01:36.500> core

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
relationship is really kind of the core

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.260 
relationship is really kind of the core
of<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.130> story<00:01:37.459> these<00:01:37.670> are<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:37.849> two<00:01:38.000> people

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
of the story these are the two people

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.120 
of the story these are the two people
that<00:01:38.360> take<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:38.660> through<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:38.929> journey<00:01:39.140> it

that take you through this journey it
will<00:01:40.280> be<00:01:40.429> more<00:01:40.610> battles<00:01:41.060> Charlie

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
will be more battles Charlie

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.460 
will be more battles Charlie
but<00:01:42.820> we<00:01:43.000> will<00:01:43.240> find<00:01:43.600> our<00:01:43.750> piece<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:47.260> one<00:01:47.290> other

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
but we will find our piece the one other

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.870 
but we will find our piece the one other
thing<00:01:47.620> is<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:47.920> voice<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.610> pair

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
thing is that the voice that the pair

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.820
