young<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.920> guy<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.309> remote<00:00:35.640> control

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
young and this guy is a remote control

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.510 
young and this guy is a remote control
guy<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.050> I'm<00:00:37.829> gonna<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.190> if<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.370> can

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
guy here and I'm gonna see if I can

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
guy here and I'm gonna see if I can
focus<00:00:38.730> because<00:00:39.090> I'm<00:00:39.180> doing<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.390> all

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
focus because I'm doing this all

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.450 
focus because I'm doing this all
manually<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.290> can<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.160> this

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
manually but you can see that this

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.430 
manually but you can see that this
definitely<00:00:42.329> looks<00:00:42.510> different<00:00:43.110> than<00:00:43.260> your

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
definitely looks different than your

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.319 
definitely looks different than your
typical<00:00:43.590> hex<00:00:44.100> bug<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.579> definitely<00:00:44.969> looks<00:00:45.120> more

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
typical hex bug it definitely looks more

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.959 
typical hex bug it definitely looks more
battle<00:00:45.809> ish<00:00:45.960> okay<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.550> front<00:00:47.820> you've

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
battle ish okay so in the front you've

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.900 
battle ish okay so in the front you've
got<00:00:48.120> these<00:00:48.239> little<00:00:48.420> lab<00:00:48.750> these<00:00:49.110> shooters<00:00:49.530> here

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
got these little lab these shooters here

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.510 
got these little lab these shooters here
you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.180> see<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> front<00:00:52.460> there's<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
you can see in the front there's a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.830 
you can see in the front there's a
button<00:00:53.820> listening<00:00:56.420> so<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.660> actually

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
button listening so you can actually

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.779 
button listening so you can actually
change<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.350> channels<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> bug<00:00:59.250> itself<00:00:59.640> as

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
change the channels on the bug itself as

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.929 
change the channels on the bug itself as
well<00:01:00.149> as<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:00.870> remote<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:07.939> let's

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
well as on the little remote and let's

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.390 
well as on the little remote and let's
see<00:01:12.710> alright<00:01:13.710> there<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:14.040> go

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
see alright there we go

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.210 
see alright there we go
well<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.729> see<00:01:14.880> his<00:01:15.030> light<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.390> working

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
well you can see his light is working

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.679 
well you can see his light is working
alright<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.520> remote<00:01:17.759> control<00:01:18.180> that's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
alright so the remote control that's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.020 
alright so the remote control that's
pretty<00:01:18.960> simple<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> use<00:01:19.520> my<00:01:20.520> kids<00:01:20.729> were<00:01:20.820> able

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
pretty simple to use my kids were able

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.640 
pretty simple to use my kids were able
to<00:01:21.060> use<00:01:21.240> these<00:01:21.659> little<00:01:21.810> remote<00:01:22.140> controls<00:01:22.500> when

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
to use these little remote controls when

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.030 
to use these little remote controls when
they<00:01:22.740> were<00:01:22.799> just<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.130> few<00:01:23.159> years<00:01:23.340> old<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:25.040> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
they were just a few years old and the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.940 
they were just a few years old and the
idea<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.750> battle<00:01:28.350> spiders

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
idea is that you have to battle spiders

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.969 
idea is that you have to battle spiders
and<00:01:29.659> that<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.780> try<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> point<00:01:31.380> them<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:31.829> each

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
and that you try to point them at each

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.810 
and that you try to point them at each
other<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:33.409> suit<00:01:34.409> them<00:01:34.710> there's<00:01:35.340> nothing<00:01:35.430> that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
other and suit them there's nothing that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
other and suit them there's nothing that
really<00:01:35.939> comes<00:01:36.299> out<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.780> shoot<00:01:36.960> them<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
really comes out but you shoot them and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.660 
really comes out but you shoot them and
you<00:01:38.009> can<00:01:38.189> stun<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> other<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.090> after<00:01:39.450> 10<00:01:40.350> hits

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
you can stun the other one after 10 hits

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.910 
you can stun the other one after 10 hits
will<00:01:41.670> deactivate<00:01:42.079> you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.259> reset<00:01:43.619> them<00:01:43.740> it's

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
will deactivate you can reset them it's

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.249 
will deactivate you can reset them it's
really<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> lot<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.399> fun<00:01:44.990> these<00:01:45.990> are<00:01:46.140> pretty

interested<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:54.240> robotics<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.200> really

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
interested in robotics and just really

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.499 
interested in robotics and just really
cool<00:01:55.920> engineering<00:01:56.310> things<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:57.329> they're

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
cool engineering things but they're

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.569 
cool engineering things but they're
really<00:01:57.719> durable<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.439> mean<00:01:58.649> these<00:01:59.159> are<00:01:59.369> geared
