let's go ahead and go up and like
actually<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.530> what<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.950> means

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
actually see what this means

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.670 
actually see what this means
you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.360> everyone<00:01:12.960> friends<00:01:13.200> only<00:01:13.470> are

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
blocked for most of these and I think it

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.830 
blocked for most of these and I think it
goes<00:01:15.810> down<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.890> about<00:01:17.040> all<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.310> them

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
goes down for just about all of them

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.830 
goes down for just about all of them
anyway<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.320> privacy<00:01:19.650> part<00:01:20.040> goes<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.840> like

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
online somewhere I think yeah because

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.039 
online somewhere I think yeah because
it's<00:01:51.689> being<00:01:51.869> shared<00:01:52.049> outside<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.500> Xbox<00:01:52.920> Live
