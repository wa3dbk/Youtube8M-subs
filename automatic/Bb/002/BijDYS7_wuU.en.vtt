00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.299
 Hello everyone, I am from ayew review 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.140
 today I would like you to see a review 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.510
 about the first exclusive game 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.029
 rally for iphone and ipad 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.099
 so far they have never done anything 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.960
 extraordinary 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.929
 and here is where the milestone is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.360
 give this beautiful lorino cape then 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.649
 load and slightly slow 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.660
 I'm now using an iphone 4s 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:43.290
 fast enough here is that 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.059
 loaded the game features of 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.120
 game then we do not have available 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.340
 nor a career in the possibility of 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 make a complete rally but we will have the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.430
 possibility to do simply 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.699
 delegate quick so as to gain in 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.440
 so as to earn some money than with 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.040
 these credits we can go 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.030
 buy new tracks and new readings 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.000
 then the game includes 14 cars e 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.070
 eight routes of four locations 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.070
 different 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.070
 let's look a bit like the game environment 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.049
 we have the citroen ds3 r 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.009
 c with the various unlockable liveries 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:36.720
 earning credits by winning games 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:39.150
 we have the fi rs weak c then 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.990
 we have with all the various liveries then 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:49.729
 we have the legendary mini coupe and the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.689
 fantastic volkswagen polo r v rcd 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.689
 then let's start with the citroen 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.690
 as far as I'm concerned the gameplay is 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.890
 very fluid that is despite being 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.520
 talking about the game very fast though 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.920
 holds the iPhone 4s 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.220
 I have seen that with other tp devices the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.070
 type iphone 3gs crashes this same 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.960
 game ok but it was to be expected 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.310
 and really fast as a game we find 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.310
 let's see a game 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.060
 the game is very fast 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:49.180
 excellent gameplay however we succeed in 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:52.440
 make some good part we have a 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.180
 even the nos is not really available 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.820
 in rally style however we have the 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.250
 possibility after making a beautiful one 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.870
 of the Pope a great leap we have a 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.820
 disposition ours that loads 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.820
 right up here as you see 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.050
 here is now about to load when 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:17.920
 it is ready that we have filled the first one 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:26.220
 tank this is why there appears a 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:26.220
 exaggerated acceleration here 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.720
 we are to see the settings menu 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.530
 then in the settings menu we find 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.099
 in addition to the various mode settings of 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.250
 game type option the controls here are the 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.110
 controls we have both i 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.629
 classes the classic directional arrows 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.730
 what about me 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.980
 I prefer because they are much faster 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.239
 according to me for a rally game 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.030
 we have the possibility to use 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.519
 the accelerometer the auto acceleration in 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:03.569
 this case or otherwise we have the 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:06.180
 possibility of using an analogue or 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.769
 even the accelerometer that there 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.530
 we can decide to put the car 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.970
 acceleration and braking will suffice 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.480
 apply anywhere on the 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.190
 screen 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.070
 then put back on the arrows 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:23.580
 directional sensitivity we can 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.789
 also decide and among the various options 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.370
 we also have the language in English 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:31.320
 Spanish and Italian French of course 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.910
 for the voice of our navigator e 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.910
 also of the perfect settings menu 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.480
 as far as I'm concerned, he saw that 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.590
 however also the only rally that for a 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.080
 rally enthusiast 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.370
 I would say this is the only game for 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.800
 iphone and ipad 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.700
 I say that milestone has made its own 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.080
 a great job 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.080
 at least this is for the beginning 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.890
 thanks thanks for your attention and 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.890
 to the next
