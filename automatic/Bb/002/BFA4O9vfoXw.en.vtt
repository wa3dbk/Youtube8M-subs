mind at the start of the video I start

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.390 
mind at the start of the video I start
off<00:00:09.870> with<00:00:09.990> 18<00:00:10.380> kills<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> Detroit

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400

uplink<00:00:11.849> post<00:00:12.240> patch<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.019> with<00:00:13.170> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
uplink post patch so this is with the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.919 
uplink post patch so this is with the
new<00:00:13.620> ASM<00:00:14.549> one<00:00:14.700> with<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.969> reduced<00:00:15.269> fire<00:00:15.480> rate<00:00:15.719> I

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
new ASM one with the reduced fire rate I

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.140 
new ASM one with the reduced fire rate I
actually<00:00:16.529> like<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> lot<00:00:17.430> more<00:00:17.609> than<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> old

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
actually like it a lot more than the old

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.760 
actually like it a lot more than the old
one<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.510> don't<00:00:18.660> know<00:00:18.750> why<00:00:18.960> but<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:19.560> seems

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
one I don't know why but it just seems

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.380 
one I don't know why but it just seems
like<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.039> game<00:00:20.189> requires<00:00:20.580> more<00:00:20.880> skill<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.240> use

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
like the game requires more skill to use

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.179 
like the game requires more skill to use
an<00:00:21.630> ASM<00:00:22.020> one<00:00:22.230> now<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.710> doesn't<00:00:23.010> feel<00:00:23.130> like

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
an ASM one now and it doesn't feel like

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.220 
an ASM one now and it doesn't feel like
the<00:00:23.400> ballast<00:00:23.760> too<00:00:23.970> overpowered<00:00:24.630> there<00:00:25.140> are

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the ballast too overpowered there are

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.810 
the ballast too overpowered there are
certain<00:00:25.470> situations<00:00:26.130> where<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> bow<00:00:26.519> got<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
certain situations where the bow got a

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.040 
certain situations where the bow got a
little<00:00:27.060> bit<00:00:27.180> better<00:00:27.330> but<00:00:27.599> overall<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.990> think

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
little bit better but overall I think

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.689 
little bit better but overall I think
the<00:00:28.260> ASM<00:00:28.619> one<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.920> still<00:00:29.130> pretty<00:00:29.460> gosh-darn

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the ASM one is still pretty gosh-darn

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.490 
the ASM one is still pretty gosh-darn
good<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:30.990> gonna<00:00:31.080> be<00:00:31.260> sticking

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
good and I think it's gonna be sticking

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.080 
good and I think it's gonna be sticking
around<00:00:31.619> for<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.980> while<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.759> definitely

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
around for a while so that is definitely

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.209 
around for a while so that is definitely
good<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:34.140> hope<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.590> guys<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:34.890> enjoy<00:00:34.980> this

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
good but hope you guys do enjoy this

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.860 
good but hope you guys do enjoy this
