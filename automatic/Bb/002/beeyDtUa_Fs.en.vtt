00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 i 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.730
 no no 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.730
 do not 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.980
 hello everyone I'm by here and in this video 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.900
 I'll summarize how it works a bit 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.689
 the new competitive system of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.520
 qualifiers in all the tails both 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.400
 3 against 35 of only duo and 5 of prema of 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.380
 the system is the same we put ourselves in my 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.870
 profile now in the case that we're 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.390
 seeing right now as we can see 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.940
 I am editing 3 platinum this what 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.310
 it means to see there are five divisions per 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.800
 each for each league to rise from 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.530
 division you must have 100 points you start 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.600
 I have zero good one because the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.840
 player as you can see here three 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.090
 games then losing two and winning 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.190
 one the scoring system is the same 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.630
 than the previous what is called the elo 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.980
 you are earning points for each game and 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.710
 you're losing too but once 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.229
 you reach 100 points you will fight for the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.439
 next division which in my case would be 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.020
 division 2 and what needs to be done to 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.320
 move to division 2 well you have 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.270
 than winning two of three matches 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.280
 if you never pass them to the division 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.460
 next if not then until you do not win 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.479
 2 do not pass that implies that you have to 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.750
 win them yes or yes and the points stay 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.490
 that is, you are not going to start from scratch 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.590
 once release the points will always be 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.960
 100 until you move on to the next 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.720
 division as we can see here a 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.600
 example there are two people who have already 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.619
 had 100 points and they are after 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.619
 fighting for the next division 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.780
 once you get to division one will return 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.180
 to reach 100 points and then to spend 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.560
 of promotion that is from platinum to 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.840
 diamond you have to win 3 out of 5 and a 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.910
 once you have won those 3 and you will be the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.720
 next promotion and again to start 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.899
 of zero in this case would be diamond of 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.780
 Division 5 you earn up to 100 points 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.570
 win the other two games next 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.170
 division division 4 and so on until division 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.550
 1 then to go up to 100 points and win 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.800
 3 out of 5 that's it 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.440
 in my opinion I think that this system 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.780
 new part is fine and partly not 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.610
 that is, I like it as it is done 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.340
 it seems as more competitive as if 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.280
 you had to play better and such for 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.470
 get to 100 points but what does 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.570
 what I find as the negative side is 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.000
 you have to play many too many 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.750
 too much too many 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.520
 departures is to say in the bad case that is 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.190
 you take to a point no and 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.210
 and you have to go through the division promotion phase 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.880
 whatever it is to spend 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.220
 what happens if you lose two then come another 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.100
 time to start and so of course you can enter 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.310
 in a loop and if it costs much more 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.070
 move from platinum to diamond or bronze to 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.770
 I pray whatever you need 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.900
 too much and it's a little bit the downside 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.020
 the positive side is that it looks to 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.350
 innovate and maybe it's a bit 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.420
 copied from the starcraft but it 's is 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.660
 well and so good this has been all 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.390
 regarding the system of rankings 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.100
 new new qualifiers I hope that 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.860
 It has been all very clear any 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.680
 if you leave a comment and we respond 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.660
 as quickly as we can and I hope 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.430
 that you liked the video I say goodbye 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.430
 yes mike to a greeting chao
