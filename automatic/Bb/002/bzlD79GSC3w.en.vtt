these<00:03:14.810> outlines<00:03:15.320> are<00:03:15.620> old<00:03:15.800> buildings<00:03:16.220> but<00:03:16.370> the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
these outlines are old buildings but the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.000 
these outlines are old buildings but the
one<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:16.910> we're<00:03:17.060> looking<00:03:17.270> at<00:03:17.600> is<00:03:18.320> actually

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
one that we're looking at is actually

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.740 
one that we're looking at is actually
this<00:03:19.220> building<00:03:19.700> marked<00:03:20.000> up<00:03:20.150> here<00:03:20.450> in<00:03:20.600> the
