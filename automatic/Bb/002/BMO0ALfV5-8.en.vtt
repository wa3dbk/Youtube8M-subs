 Campsite was only last week 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.320

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.730
 trixi park zittauer mountains ours 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.820

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.519
 leisure offer has convinced 21 out of 25 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.289
 points are the result after five 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.670
 categories 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.670
 it is now to beat 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.680
 Our camping expert will also be in 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.309
 his second mission again exactly 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.370
 look 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.600
 he knows what a good campsite 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.360
 distinguished and valued in his 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.090
 internet portal camping gate.de places 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.440
 in the whole republic about 80 had 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.589
 alone in the last three months 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.589
 Visited now made the check for us 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.219
 Markus does it all the way 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.719
 Germany we have four completely 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.460
 different places for our test 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.280
 picked and choose at the end 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.509
 Germany's most beautiful campsite 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.520
 Today we are on the Lower Rhine 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.170
 here lies Germany 's largest 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.170
 campsite the grav island 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.240
 a maximum of five points will markus in five 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.850
 award categories 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.500
 and he may once have a three-point 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.280
 joker for extraordinary services 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.110
 pull 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.880
 you have a bit of a feeling here 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.429
 you would drive along the dike 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.810
 So everything has a North Sea atmosphere 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:35.590
 which of course is nice category 1 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:39.069
 pitch 600 tourist pitches 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.869
 there is a good on the grav island 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.349
 Platzwart in the orientation and the 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.149
 Simple is 26 euros per night 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:49.299
 that's for a family of three 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.979
 offer also rather not cheap 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.180
 Markus is enthusiastic about the big one 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.310
 Distance to the electricity coffers 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:01.760
 Turns without additional cable drums 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:04.100
 nothing here but otherwise markus is very 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.050
 done off the pitch and made 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.090
 once comfortable so the 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.860
 Pitch here is very nice to me 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.360
 the best is the lawn of the has 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.890
 despite the summer a nice green 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.430
 and we have 90 square meters to 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.400
 disposal 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.600
 the way there is no highway bad 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.940
 for children because they are not in countries 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.430
 but can from a feeling 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.930
 actually very good wlan I have too 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.820
 they can be checked again 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.250
 whole space received accordingly well 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:34.360
 So altogether nice four points here 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.360
 for the parking space category 2 ambiente 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.890
 markus wants a bike 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.640
 Overview of the huge square 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.890
 provide 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.060
 because the 600 places for tourists 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.310
 are just the beginning 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.310
 although she is also busy 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.470
 70 with the square are Dauercampern 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.560
 Of course this is a whole 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.720
 Amount for the tourists kemper mostly 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.880
 not so nice because the culture is whole 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.500
 but is different in that the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.160
 is is the space so well separated here 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.620
 that in my view no problem 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.090
 the permanent campers dominate the place and 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.970
 many have become one over decades 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.890
 second home created with 2000 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.709
 Plots the areal acts like a 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.660
 small town on an area of ​​40 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.299
 football fields stretch 40 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.580
 kilometers of road network and 300 kilometers 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.170
 Hedges on the aerial photo is the 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.170
 tourists area downright tiny 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.170
 even from height can markus only 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.340
 see a small section 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.560
 while the permanent campers are inside 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.210
 to enjoy the place 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.420
 The tourists especially close to the 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.420
 water 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.190
 The place is huge what you have to like 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.140
 but it is very nice that is called 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.090
 has a lot of green nice glass of age 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.860
 trees and it is right on 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.930
 water which of course is great i have 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.390
 sometimes the feeling that the place 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.770
 a bit chubby is therefore held 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.020
 I give five points at this point 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.440
 many points for ambiente category 3 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.600
 leisure 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.460
 If you do not want to splash you can do it too 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.280
 rent a motorboat and feel like that 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.170
 feel the king of the seas 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.650
 even if it's just a poor old one 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.650
 rheins is 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.209
 yes, if you enter from the campsite 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.139
 a little further direction water goes 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.910
 then you have a lot 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.300
 possibilities for example also in the 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.540
 to lie shadow the whole river long 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.540
 nice thing 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.110
 while markus enjoys the sun seeks 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.320
 the animals the shady trees 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.320
 on the shore 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.140
 and also in the petting zoo on the 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.740
 campsite flee the animals in front of the 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:49.310
 heat but a little can happen too 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:54.150
 In summer, the animal tent does not hurt 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:59.700
 but for kids great for big boys 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:01.860
 even off the permanent camper has become 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.380
 the grav island on young families with 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.760
 set to children 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.140
 In total, there are about two and a half 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.140
 million overnight stays per year 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.249
 So you have leisure options here 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.649
 in the square enough 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.669
 That started with the pedalboat we drive 

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:20.379
 drove well 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.269
 here is an adventure playground and 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.789
 Of course, still the super petting zoo 

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:27.089
 So there's room in front of me five 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.089
 Points 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:37.449
 category 4 sanitary hygiene 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:39.939
 include a well-equipped laundry room 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:43.899
 and a remarkably large offer 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:47.979
 Toilets and free showers 

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:50.169
 a lot of space fits very well 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:54.209
 are pleasant as many big ones 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.209
 separate cabins for parents with children 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:07.509
 the whole thing is clean so everyone 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.269
 It's a bit super in barracks 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:12.099
 Character because so many people 

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:15.539
 to be cared for means to me 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:20.789
 it scores four out of five points overall 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:22.749
 category 5 meals at 90% 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.879
 self-catering in the square is the 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:27.699
 supermarket velvet own bakery the 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:31.349
 central point of contact and one 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:31.349
 There is also special service 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.380
 now really buy everything the 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.449
 prices are the same as at home and the 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.990
 Drinks here are all felt now 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:45.280
 but I will not cook who is cold 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.759
 I would like to go to the centrally located 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:51.630
 restaurant but markus is not 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.630
 100% happy 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.580
 The meat is not medium that is 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.550
 not quite by otherwise it tastes 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.560
 good but the meat is not optimal 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.300
 a small beauty defect with 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.930
 the offer and the prizes is ours 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:09.060
 Overall, the expert is satisfied 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.590
 on the subject supply on the place it 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.849
 is a really great supermarket 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.440
 with chilled drinks 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:16.349
 then we have one over there 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.449
 ice cream shop and this restaurant the food 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:19.470
 Altogether was okay gave with small 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:21.240
 handicraft mistakes 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.250
 that you can for other places yet 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.669
 a little better on this case is 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.139
 give a total of 44 points that's us 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:30.300
 together again and look at that 

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:34.400
 result of our second test candidate 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:36.110
 the grav island at read 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.590
 There are four points for the pitch 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.940
 for the ambience also here 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.620
 full five points for that 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.330
 varied leisure offers 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.310
 There are four points for the big one 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.140
 sanitary applications 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.360
 and for the food also four 

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:53.960
 Points 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.090
 makes 21 points out of 25 possible and 

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.270
 with it as many as past ones 

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.830
 weekly during the first test circuit to partie 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.169
 This place has a big one 

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.819
 free time offer here and also in the area 

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:06.199
 supply the supermarket say that 

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:08.509
 restaurant is the place good 

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:10.969
 I personally did not like that 

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:14.560
 I like this size 

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:14.560
 smaller places personally better
