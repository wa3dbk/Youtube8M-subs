00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 the incredible child mangialibri enrico 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.240
 he loved books but not like all of us 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.490
 we love books 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:18.779
 no not exactly enrico loved to eat 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.830
 the books all happened almost by mistake 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.199
 one afternoon while it was rather 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.680
 distracted immediately did not feel much 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.550
 safe and taste 1 word a lot 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.390
 to taste two whole sentences e 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.030
 then a whole page yes definitely i 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.059
 he liked books for the day 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.910
 next he had already swallowed a whole 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.059
 book and by the end of the month he was able 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.200
 to swallow a whole book all in one 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.100
 blow 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.090
 enrico loved to eat any kind of book 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.039
 story books atlases dictionaries 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.030
 joke book files 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.450
 information and even mathematics books 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.869
 but the red books were his favorites 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:13.439
 and Syrians Pope goes without a break but the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:19.049
 best thing was that he ate more 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:22.710
 the more he became intelligent he eats a 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.189
 book on goldfish and immediately as sepe 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.470
 it fed ginger soon to be able to do the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.650
 crossword in the newspaper 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.869
 of his dad and became even more 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.710
 intelligent of his teacher of 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.330
 enrico school 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.970
 loved being smart he thought that 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.830
 continuing this way it would become the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.200
 smartest person on earth 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.780
 so he continued to eat books and to 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.729
 become intelligent and intelligent e 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.190
 intelligent 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.420
 by dint of eating whole books I arrive 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.790
 to eat three or four at a time 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.429
 books on anything 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:15.050
 enrico was not fussy and wanted to know 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:18.620
 all but then things started to not 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:24.730
 things go so well actually 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.730
 they went very very badly 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.230
 enrico ate too many books and too much 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:35.239
 quickly 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:39.410
 began to feel really bad but there 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:42.100
 worse was another 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.880
 everything he learned if he went to 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:51.799
 mix with the rest had not had 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:55.150
 time to digest everything properly 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:03:00.079
 for him talking became so rather 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:04.459
 embarrassing suddenly enrico non 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.510
 feels more than intelligent at all 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.069
 a person 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.849
 told him to stop eating books 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:17.409
 so enrico stopped eating books e 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.629
 he sat unhappy for a long time 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.150
 he should have done 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:24.040
 after a while almost by chance enrico 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.310
 picked up a book gnawed by 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.450
 floor but instead of putting it on 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.939
 mouth 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:38.739
 henry i opened it and began to read was 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:41.409
 so wonderful enrico discovered that 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.650
 loved to read and I think if he had 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:47.079
 enough bed could still be 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.900
 become the smartest person 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:53.799
 on earth 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.969
 now enrico reads continuously too 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.969
 if sometimes
