00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
quickly I had a few hundred words and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.050 
quickly I had a few hundred words and
that's<00:01:40.530> enough<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.860> kick<00:01:41.040> around<00:01:41.159> oh<00:01:41.640> actually

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
right here I'm trying to find a synonym

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.679 
right here I'm trying to find a synonym

find actually some words there's just no
good<00:01:48.600> replacements<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.700> anyway<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.880> take<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
good replacements for anyway I take that

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.719 
good replacements for anyway I take that
list<00:01:51.920> when<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> when<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.430> enough<00:01:53.610> material

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
list when I when I have enough material

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.789 
list when I when I have enough material
if<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.600> list<00:01:54.750> has<00:01:54.899> fallen<00:01:55.110> off<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> page<00:01:55.590> I'll

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
if the list has fallen off the page I'll

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.289 
if the list has fallen off the page I'll
put<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.009> back<00:01:56.130> at<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> top<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.820> remind<00:01:57.149> myself

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
put it back at the top to remind myself

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.480 
put it back at the top to remind myself
that<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.719> need<00:01:57.899> some<00:01:58.049> structure<00:01:58.560> what<00:01:59.310> makes

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
that I need some structure what makes

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.010 
that I need some structure what makes
good<00:01:59.670> writing<00:01:59.729> good<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.509> flow<00:02:00.750> between

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
good writing good is the flow between

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.770 
good writing good is the flow between
sentences<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.860> flow<00:02:02.070> between<00:02:02.570> points<00:02:03.570> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
sentences the flow between points and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.590 
sentences the flow between points and
ideas<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.130> want<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> remind<00:02:05.579> myself<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.210> I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
ideas so I want to remind myself that I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.710 
ideas so I want to remind myself that I
should<00:02:06.869> be<00:02:07.140> thinking<00:02:07.500> about<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:08.569> now<00:02:09.569> here

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
should be thinking about that now here

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.809 
should be thinking about that now here
I'm<00:02:09.810> doing<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.110> little<00:02:10.259> trick<00:02:10.610> it's<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
I'm doing a little trick it's a

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.970 
I'm doing a little trick it's a
common<00:02:12.239> style<00:02:12.510> these<00:02:12.749> days<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.319> blog<00:02:13.950> posts

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
common style these days on blog posts

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.699 
common style these days on blog posts
and<00:02:14.579> in<00:02:14.730> books<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.870> put<00:02:16.049> everything<00:02:16.349> with<00:02:16.680> a

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
and in books to put everything with a

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.270 
and in books to put everything with a
heading<00:02:17.069> on<00:02:17.189> it<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.659> think<00:02:18.659> that's<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.200> crutch<00:02:19.469> so

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
heading on it I think that's a crutch so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.920 
heading on it I think that's a crutch so
I<00:02:20.340> don't<00:02:20.549> like<00:02:20.639> to<00:02:20.819> do<00:02:20.969> it<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:21.689> sometimes

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
I don't like to do it but sometimes

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.479 
I don't like to do it but sometimes
while<00:02:22.319> I'm<00:02:22.499> working<00:02:22.889> I'll<00:02:23.040> put<00:02:23.340> those

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
while I'm working I'll put those

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.699 
while I'm working I'll put those
headings<00:02:23.939> in<00:02:24.090> place<00:02:24.409> same<00:02:25.409> thing<00:02:25.590> with

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
headings in place same thing with

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.589 
headings in place same thing with
bulleted<00:02:26.040> lists<00:02:26.280> too<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.609> kind<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.969> kind

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
bulleted lists too it's kind of a kind

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.599 
bulleted lists too it's kind of a kind
of<00:02:27.689> a<00:02:27.749> trick<00:02:27.989> but<00:02:28.950> I'll<00:02:29.040> put<00:02:29.159> those<00:02:29.340> headings

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
of a trick but I'll put those headings

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.149 
of a trick but I'll put those headings
in<00:02:29.730> place<00:02:30.170> until<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.319> get<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.530> structure<00:02:31.889> that<00:02:32.129> I

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
in place until I get a structure that I

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.190 
in place until I get a structure that I
like<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.969> flow<00:02:33.180> between<00:02:33.359> ideas<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.930> seems

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
like and the flow between ideas it seems

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.220 
like and the flow between ideas it seems
good<00:02:34.409> and<00:02:34.590> then<00:02:35.549> I'll<00:02:35.670> rip<00:02:35.790> them<00:02:35.969> out<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.989> goal

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
good and then I'll rip them out the goal

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.039 
good and then I'll rip them out the goal
being<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.650> have<00:02:38.419> segways<00:02:39.419> in<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.750> writing

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
being to have segways in the writing

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.679 
being to have segways in the writing
itself<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:41.459> make<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:41.999> comfortable<00:02:42.329> or

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
itself that make it comfortable or

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.479 
itself that make it comfortable or
natural<00:02:43.139> for<00:02:43.290> people<00:02:43.409> to<00:02:43.590> move<00:02:43.739> between<00:02:43.980> ideas

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
natural for people to move between ideas

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.099 
natural for people to move between ideas
so<00:02:44.669> I<00:02:44.700> don't<00:02:44.909> need<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.060> scaffolding<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.959> these

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
so I don't need the scaffolding of these

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.369 
so I don't need the scaffolding of these
these<00:02:46.889> headings<00:02:47.310> for<00:02:47.489> everything<00:02:48.379> now

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
these headings for everything now

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.420 
these headings for everything now
something<00:02:49.680> that's<00:02:49.709> hard<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.099> see<00:02:50.219> in<00:02:50.310> this

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
something that's hard to see in this

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.189 
something that's hard to see in this
video<00:02:50.669> is<00:02:51.060> how<00:02:51.120> much<00:02:51.449> time<00:02:51.659> is<00:02:51.870> spent<00:02:52.139> just

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:52.199 
video is how much time is spent just

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.830 
video is how much time is spent just
sitting<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.739> thinking<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.689> what's<00:02:54.689> gonna

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
sitting and thinking and what's gonna

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.390 
sitting and thinking and what's gonna
happen<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.349> second<00:02:55.769> is<00:02:55.859> it's<00:02:55.980> gonna<00:02:56.069> switch

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
happen in a second is it's gonna switch

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.720 
happen in a second is it's gonna switch
to<00:02:56.579> real<00:02:56.819> time<00:02:56.849> it's<00:02:57.540> gonna<00:02:57.659> go<00:02:57.900> from<00:02:58.709> 30<00:02:59.489> times

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
to real time it's gonna go from 30 times

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.800 
to real time it's gonna go from 30 times
normal<00:03:00.090> speed<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.750> normal<00:03:01.219> speed<00:03:02.219> and<00:03:02.810> normal

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
normal speed to normal speed and normal

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.439 
normal speed to normal speed and normal
speed<00:03:04.049> is<00:03:04.199> reveals<00:03:05.189> how<00:03:05.549> much<00:03:05.730> time<00:03:05.939> is<00:03:06.150> spent

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:06.449 
speed is reveals how much time is spent

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.020 
speed is reveals how much time is spent
just<00:03:06.569> sitting<00:03:07.109> and<00:03:07.230> thinking<00:03:07.639> which<00:03:08.639> is<00:03:08.669> a<00:03:08.819> lot

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
just sitting and thinking which is a lot

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.149 
just sitting and thinking which is a lot
of<00:03:09.150> what<00:03:09.269> writing<00:03:09.449> actually<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.139> that<00:03:10.919> some

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
of what writing actually is that some

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.179 
of what writing actually is that some
people<00:03:11.189> are<00:03:11.489> terrified<00:03:11.819> of<00:03:13.159> writer's<00:03:14.159> block

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
people are terrified of writer's block

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.749 
people are terrified of writer's block
or<00:03:14.760> being<00:03:15.120> stuck<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.780> I've<00:03:16.530> learned<00:03:16.859> that<00:03:17.159> the

or being stuck and I've learned that the

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:19.219 
or being stuck and I've learned that the
moments<00:03:18.150> when<00:03:18.299> I'm<00:03:18.449> stuck<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.930> which<00:03:19.049> there

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
moments when I'm stuck of which there

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.530 
moments when I'm stuck of which there
are<00:03:19.379> many<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:20.459> video<00:03:20.699> doesn't<00:03:20.909> show<00:03:21.060> them<00:03:21.389> but

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
are many the video doesn't show them but

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.089 
are many the video doesn't show them but
there<00:03:21.659> are<00:03:21.689> lots<00:03:22.079> and<00:03:22.290> lots<00:03:22.439> of<00:03:22.590> moments<00:03:22.799> here

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
there are lots and lots of moments here

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.309 
there are lots and lots of moments here
I'm<00:03:23.370> stopped<00:03:23.639> where<00:03:23.939> I<00:03:23.970> stop<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.599> I'm

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
I'm stopped where I stop and I'm

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.679 
I'm stopped where I stop and I'm
thinking<00:03:25.739> that's<00:03:26.370> what<00:03:26.519> makes<00:03:26.729> writing<00:03:27.120> good

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
thinking that's what makes writing good

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.559 
thinking that's what makes writing good
or<00:03:27.959> bad<00:03:28.139> those<00:03:29.009> moments<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:30.090> whole<00:03:30.239> idea<00:03:30.509> of

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
or bad those moments the whole idea of

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.780 
or bad those moments the whole idea of
writing<00:03:30.840> is<00:03:31.139> pretty<00:03:31.919> challenging<00:03:32.189> I'm<00:03:32.549> trying

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
writing is pretty challenging I'm trying

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.149 
writing is pretty challenging I'm trying
to<00:03:32.879> take<00:03:32.970> something<00:03:33.359> in<00:03:33.449> my<00:03:33.599> head<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.159> think

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
to take something in my head and think

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.099 
to take something in my head and think
about<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.639> and<00:03:35.790> then<00:03:36.120> express<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.720> through<00:03:36.930> the

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
about it and then express it through the

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.399 
about it and then express it through the
the<00:03:37.319> medium<00:03:37.979> of<00:03:38.099> words<00:03:38.879> and<00:03:39.329> to<00:03:39.870> try<00:03:40.049> to<00:03:40.109> do<00:03:40.259> it

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
the medium of words and to try to do it

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:41.869 
the medium of words and to try to do it
well<00:03:40.560> enough<00:03:40.889> so<00:03:41.099> that<00:03:41.220> when<00:03:41.340> someone<00:03:41.549> comes

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
well enough so that when someone comes

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.059 
well enough so that when someone comes
along<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.299> reads<00:03:42.509> it<00:03:42.720> someone<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.590> don't<00:03:43.859> know

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
along and reads it someone I don't know

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.640 
along and reads it someone I don't know
that<00:03:44.729> I've<00:03:44.849> never<00:03:45.090> met<00:03:45.449> they<00:03:46.229> can<00:03:46.379> get<00:03:46.530> all

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
that I've never met they can get all

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.339 
that I've never met they can get all
that<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:47.400> same<00:03:47.669> thing<00:03:47.879> in<00:03:47.970> my<00:03:48.150> head<00:03:48.419> they<00:03:49.199> can

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
that the same thing in my head they can

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.409 
that the same thing in my head they can
get<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:49.739> theirs<00:03:50.030> maybe<00:03:51.030> even<00:03:51.239> something

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
get it in theirs maybe even something

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.960 
get it in theirs maybe even something
better<00:03:52.009> to<00:03:53.009> do<00:03:53.159> that<00:03:53.340> requires<00:03:53.669> a<00:03:53.759> lot<00:03:53.939> of

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
better to do that requires a lot of

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.289 
better to do that requires a lot of
thought<00:03:54.329> I<00:03:54.629> actually<00:03:54.959> very<00:03:55.169> careful<00:03:55.709> about

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
thought I actually very careful about

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.179 
thought I actually very careful about
the<00:03:57.299> points<00:03:57.689> I<00:03:57.810> make<00:03:58.049> or<00:03:58.290> how<00:03:58.439> I<00:03:58.469> make<00:03:58.799> them<00:03:59.040> and

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
the points I make or how I make them and

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.800 
the points I make or how I make them and
the<00:03:59.250> stories<00:03:59.549> I<00:03:59.699> tell<00:03:59.909> the<00:04:00.209> sequence<00:04:00.689> of

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
the stories I tell the sequence of

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.080 
the stories I tell the sequence of
points<00:04:01.199> and<00:04:01.379> so<00:04:02.099> when<00:04:02.219> I'm<00:04:02.340> stuck<00:04:02.639> it<00:04:02.790> usually

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
points and so when I'm stuck it usually

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.249 
points and so when I'm stuck it usually
means<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.359> there's<00:04:03.569> something<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:04.049> don't

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:04.259 
means that there's something I don't

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.219 
means that there's something I don't
fully<00:04:04.319> believe<00:04:04.819> about<00:04:05.819> what<00:04:05.969> I'm<00:04:06.120> saying<00:04:06.419> or

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
fully believe about what I'm saying or

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:08.719 
fully believe about what I'm saying or
that<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.469> flow<00:04:07.680> of<00:04:07.709> ideas<00:04:08.099> isn't<00:04:08.280> that<00:04:08.519> good

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:08.729 
that the flow of ideas isn't that good

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.119 
that the flow of ideas isn't that good
yet<00:04:08.939> and<00:04:09.120> so<00:04:10.049> when<00:04:10.199> I'm<00:04:10.289> stuck<00:04:10.560> I'm<00:04:10.709> like<00:04:10.859> okay

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
yet and so when I'm stuck I'm like okay

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.860 
yet and so when I'm stuck I'm like okay
now<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.459> writing<00:04:11.909> is<00:04:12.030> beginning<00:04:12.479> because<00:04:12.689> now

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
now the writing is beginning because now

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.140 
now the writing is beginning because now
I<00:04:12.900> have<00:04:13.319> enough<00:04:13.560> material<00:04:14.039> there<00:04:14.069> that<00:04:14.939> I<00:04:15.030> have

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
I have enough material there that I have

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.719 
I have enough material there that I have
something<00:04:15.449> to<00:04:15.539> think<00:04:15.930> about<00:04:16.079> and<00:04:16.729> the

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
something to think about and the

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.120 
something to think about and the
solution<00:04:18.239> usually<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:19.560> habit<00:04:19.979> that<00:04:20.070> I

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
solution usually is the habit that I

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.159 
solution usually is the habit that I
have<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.180> go<00:04:21.419> back<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.810> beginning<00:04:22.139> of

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
have is to go back to the beginning of

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.959 
have is to go back to the beginning of
the<00:04:22.260> document<00:04:22.770> or<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.130> essay<00:04:23.460> or<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.729> story

the document or the essay or the story

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.129

or whatever it's

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.770 
or whatever it's
reading<00:04:25.729> I'll<00:04:26.729> start<00:04:27.030> reading<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.479> I'll<00:04:27.569> edit

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
reading I'll start reading and I'll edit

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.209 
reading I'll start reading and I'll edit
as<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:28.139> go<00:04:28.289> but<00:04:28.499> I'm<00:04:28.590> not<00:04:28.620> worried<00:04:29.099> too<00:04:29.189> much

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:29.219 
as I go but I'm not worried too much

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:31.610 
as I go but I'm not worried too much
about<00:04:29.370> grammar<00:04:29.849> or<00:04:30.479> details<00:04:30.870> but<00:04:31.050> now<00:04:31.110> I'll

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
about grammar or details but now I'll

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.559 
about grammar or details but now I'll
change<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.099> ideas<00:04:32.460> I'll<00:04:32.610> change<00:04:32.879> the

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
change the ideas I'll change the

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:34.969 
change the ideas I'll change the
sequence<00:04:33.779> of<00:04:34.080> things<00:04:34.319> I<00:04:34.499> may<00:04:34.590> come<00:04:34.740> up<00:04:34.800> with<00:04:34.860> a

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
sequence of things I may come up with a

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.129 
sequence of things I may come up with a
better<00:04:35.099> story<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.580> tell<00:04:35.849> and<00:04:36.509> better<00:04:36.689> point<00:04:36.990> to

better story to tell and better point to

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.899 
better story to tell and better point to
make<00:04:37.289> and<00:04:37.319> I'll<00:04:37.590> change<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:38.039> but<00:04:38.430> I'm<00:04:38.550> working

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909

make and I'll change it but I'm working
through<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.569> then<00:04:40.199> by<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.379> time<00:04:40.620> I<00:04:40.680> work

the<00:04:45.900> trajectory<00:04:46.469> are<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.710> ideas<00:04:47.009> have
