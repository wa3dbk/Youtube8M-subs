2006<00:00:05.210> TDI<00:00:05.750> I<00:00:06.370> believe<00:00:07.370> the<00:00:07.490> engine<00:00:07.760> quote<00:00:07.940> is

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
2006 TDI I believe the engine quote is

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.820 
2006 TDI I believe the engine quote is
BRM<00:00:09.820> complained<00:00:10.820> his<00:00:10.940> lack<00:00:11.120> of<00:00:11.299> power

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
BRM complained his lack of power

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.220 
BRM complained his lack of power
black<00:00:12.830> smoke<00:00:13.100> out<00:00:13.490> the<00:00:13.520> tailpipe<00:00:14.230> especially

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
black smoke out the tailpipe especially

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.519 
black smoke out the tailpipe especially
going<00:00:15.410> up<00:00:15.650> a<00:00:15.799> hill<00:00:16.720> so<00:00:17.720> obviously<00:00:18.380> the<00:00:18.500> first

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
going up a hill so obviously the first

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.900 
going up a hill so obviously the first
thing<00:00:18.800> I<00:00:18.859> did<00:00:18.920> was<00:00:19.220> drive<00:00:19.760> it<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:21.910> verified

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
thing I did was drive it and verified

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.210 
thing I did was drive it and verified
the<00:00:23.060> complaint<00:00:23.420> funny<00:00:24.410> enough<00:00:24.710> there<00:00:24.950> were<00:00:25.070> no

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
the complaint funny enough there were no

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.790 
the complaint funny enough there were no
code<00:00:25.490> stored<00:00:25.930> you<00:00:26.930> would<00:00:27.110> think<00:00:27.350> that<00:00:27.410> with<00:00:27.740> a

power loss issue especially when it gets

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.040 
power loss issue especially when it gets
to<00:00:31.760> the<00:00:31.850> point<00:00:31.970> where<00:00:32.090> you<00:00:32.300> notice<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:32.930> power

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
to the point where you notice the power

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.850 
to the point where you notice the power
loss<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:33.590> a<00:00:33.800> coach<00:00:34.340> would<00:00:35.000> be<00:00:35.059> present<00:00:35.860> but

not<00:00:36.920> in<00:00:37.220> this<00:00:37.310> case<00:00:37.690> so<00:00:38.690> as<00:00:38.810> you<00:00:38.900> can<00:00:39.020> see<00:00:39.290> I've

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
not in this case so as you can see I've

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.220 
not in this case so as you can see I've
got<00:00:39.770> the<00:00:39.980> engine<00:00:40.340> rpm<00:00:40.899> boost<00:00:41.899> pressure

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
got the engine rpm boost pressure

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.319 
got the engine rpm boost pressure
desired<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:43.370> what<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.700> computer<00:00:44.300> is

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
desired that what the computer is

millibars snap-on scaling is I've got

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.810 
millibars snap-on scaling is I've got
that<00:00:52.250> auto<00:00:52.600> correcting<00:00:53.600> or<00:00:53.870> auto<00:00:54.110> scaling<00:00:54.820> so

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
that auto correcting or auto scaling so

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.120 
that auto correcting or auto scaling so
these<00:00:56.030> Peaks<00:00:56.480> might<00:00:57.020> look<00:00:57.290> similar<00:00:57.620> in<00:00:57.980> terms

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
these Peaks might look similar in terms

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.580 
these Peaks might look similar in terms
of<00:00:58.309> behaving<00:00:58.760> according<00:00:59.450> to<00:00:59.719> what<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.079> ECM

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
of behaving according to what the ECM

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.970 
of behaving according to what the ECM
says<00:01:00.950> or<00:01:01.579> once<00:01:02.030> but<00:01:02.450> as<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:03.110> can<00:01:03.290> see<00:01:03.530> here<00:01:03.829> the

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
says or once but as you can see here the

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.550 
says or once but as you can see here the
scaling<00:01:04.460> on<00:01:04.579> here<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.969> highest<00:01:05.119> point<00:01:05.689> it<00:01:06.229> hit

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
scaling on here the highest point it hit

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.809 
scaling on here the highest point it hit
with<00:01:06.770> 1600<00:01:07.579> millibars<00:01:08.350> whereas<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.819> computer

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:10.819 
with 1600 millibars whereas the computer

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:13.270 
with 1600 millibars whereas the computer
or<00:01:10.969> ECM<00:01:11.299> is<00:01:11.659> actually<00:01:12.560> commanding<00:01:13.009> up<00:01:13.130> to

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
or ECM is actually commanding up to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.480 
or ECM is actually commanding up to
twenty<00:01:13.670> two<00:01:14.420> thousand<00:01:14.869> forty<00:01:15.350> millibars<00:01:16.719> so

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
twenty two thousand forty millibars so

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.129 
twenty two thousand forty millibars so
let<00:01:19.490> me<00:01:19.579> just<00:01:19.759> see<00:01:20.029> if<00:01:20.149> I<00:01:20.299> can<00:01:20.329> get<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.719> cursors

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139 
let me just see if I can get the cursors

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:24.459 
let me just see if I can get the cursors
going<00:01:21.469> here<00:01:21.709> so<00:01:22.009> let's<00:01:22.369> just<00:01:22.429> pick<00:01:22.729> out<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:23.630> peak

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
going here so let's just pick out a peak

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.529 
going here so let's just pick out a peak
here<00:01:24.499> you<00:01:24.920> can<00:01:25.069> also<00:01:25.249> see<00:01:25.670> that<00:01:27.819> when<00:01:28.819> the<00:01:28.969> ECM

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
here you can also see that when the ECM

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.109 
here you can also see that when the ECM
is<00:01:29.779> commanding<00:01:30.319> or<00:01:30.529> is<00:01:31.039> expecting<00:01:31.609> boost<00:01:31.850> as

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
is commanding or is expecting boost as

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.279 
is commanding or is expecting boost as
I'm<00:01:32.299> accelerating<00:01:33.849> boost<00:01:34.849> you<00:01:35.630> can<00:01:35.659> see<00:01:35.990> here

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
I'm accelerating boost you can see here

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.260 
I'm accelerating boost you can see here
it<00:01:36.560> hasn't<00:01:36.770> even<00:01:36.950> started<00:01:37.249> climbing<00:01:37.639> at<00:01:38.060> and

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
it hasn't even started climbing at and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.379 
it hasn't even started climbing at and
that's<00:01:39.020> pretty<00:01:39.469> much<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:40.069> sensation<00:01:40.700> that

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:41.389 
that's pretty much the sensation that

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:43.239 
that's pretty much the sensation that
you<00:01:41.539> feel<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:42.049> step<00:01:42.349> on<00:01:42.499> the<00:01:42.590> gas<00:01:42.619> pedal<00:01:43.219> and

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
you feel you step on the gas pedal and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.910 
you feel you step on the gas pedal and
nothing's<00:01:43.670> really<00:01:43.880> happening<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:44.869> it's<00:01:45.679> only

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
nothing's really happening and it's only

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.839 
nothing's really happening and it's only
until<00:01:46.219> engine<00:01:46.819> speed<00:01:47.179> increases<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:49.729> the

00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:49.849 
until engine speed increases to the

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:52.959 
until engine speed increases to the
higher<00:01:49.999> rpms<00:01:50.630> when<00:01:51.529> you<00:01:52.159> actually<00:01:52.310> do<00:01:52.639> feel<00:01:52.909> a

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
higher rpms when you actually do feel a

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.959 
higher rpms when you actually do feel a
little<00:01:53.240> pickup<00:01:53.599> or<00:01:54.590> boost<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:55.520> then

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
little pickup or boost and then

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.730 
little pickup or boost and then
obviously<00:01:56.179> you<00:01:56.509> see<00:01:56.689> me<00:01:56.899> here<00:01:57.109> these<00:01:57.560> are

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
obviously you see me here these are

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.919 
obviously you see me here these are
probably<00:01:58.009> going<00:01:58.189> through<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:58.520> shift<00:01:58.929> first

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
probably going through the shift first

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.769 
probably going through the shift first
gear<00:02:00.200> second<00:02:00.560> gear<00:02:00.590> etc<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.630> then

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:02.779 
gear second gear etc and then

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:04.809 
gear second gear etc and then
decelerating<00:02:03.770> in<00:02:03.889> terms<00:02:04.069> of<00:02:04.219> rpm<00:02:04.639> and

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
decelerating in terms of rpm and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.559 
decelerating in terms of rpm and
obviously<00:02:05.179> once<00:02:05.359> you<00:02:05.450> decelerate<00:02:05.959> in<00:02:06.289> rpm<00:02:06.709> the

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
obviously once you decelerate in rpm the

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.740 
obviously once you decelerate in rpm the
boost<00:02:08.569> level<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.890> ECM<00:02:10.489> commands<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.599> go

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
boost level the ECM commands it to go

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.740 
boost level the ECM commands it to go
off<00:02:11.990> or<00:02:12.760> doesn't<00:02:13.760> need<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.000> boost<00:02:14.210> so<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.540> cuts

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
off or doesn't need the boost so it cuts

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.290 
off or doesn't need the boost so it cuts
the<00:02:14.900> boost<00:02:15.110> level

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
the boost level

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.110 
the boost level
so<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.230> main<00:02:17.380> complaint<00:02:17.830> or<00:02:18.010> thought<00:02:18.550> process

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
so the main complaint or thought process

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.690 
so the main complaint or thought process
here<00:02:19.390> basically<00:02:19.720> or<00:02:20.140> already<00:02:20.320> is<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:21.460> fact

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
here basically or already is the fact

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.180 
here basically or already is the fact
that<00:02:21.820> I<00:02:22.270> don't<00:02:22.390> hear<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.050> turbo<00:02:23.290> whistling<00:02:23.890> at

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
that I don't hear the turbo whistling at

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.310 
that I don't hear the turbo whistling at
lower<00:02:24.460> speeds<00:02:24.970> which<00:02:25.300> is<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.750> quick<00:02:25.960> spool

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
lower speeds which is the quick spool

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.580 
lower speeds which is the quick spool
because<00:02:26.740> of<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:28.150> Nottoway<00:02:29.050> escape<00:02:29.440> at

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
because of the the Nottoway escape at

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.500 
because of the the Nottoway escape at
the<00:02:29.620> turbo<00:02:29.980> vanes<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.850> know<00:02:30.970> how<00:02:31.180> there<00:02:31.360> is

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
the turbo vanes you know how there is

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.690 
the turbo vanes you know how there is
supposed<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.960> adjust<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.830> narrow<00:02:33.370> gap

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
supposed to adjust to the narrow gap

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.820 
supposed to adjust to the narrow gap
causing<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.360> turbo<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.780> spin<00:02:35.080> quickly<00:02:35.650> at

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
causing the turbo to spin quickly at

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.660 
causing the turbo to spin quickly at
lower<00:02:36.070> rpm<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.900> don't<00:02:37.900> hear<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.320> so<00:02:38.740> I<00:02:38.770> already

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
lower rpm I don't hear that so I already

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.430 
lower rpm I don't hear that so I already
have<00:02:39.970> my<00:02:40.000> suspicion<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:40.780> something's<00:02:41.200> going

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
have my suspicion that something's going

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.240 
have my suspicion that something's going
on<00:02:41.530> with<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.800> turbo<00:02:42.130> vanes<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:44.250> following

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
on with the turbo vanes and following

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:54.200 
on with the turbo vanes and following
video<00:02:45.550> here's<00:02:45.790> what<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.120> found

running vacuum is applied here and it's
supposed<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.820> force<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.270> rod<00:03:33.480> down<00:03:34.100> that's

supposed to force the rod down that's

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.440 
supposed to force the rod down that's
not<00:03:35.220> happening<00:03:35.760> because<00:03:35.910> I'm<00:03:36.150> just<00:03:36.240> going<00:03:36.420> to

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
not happening because I'm just going to

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
not happening because I'm just going to
check<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.780> for<00:03:36.810> vacuum<00:03:37.350> again

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.920 

but<00:03:54.690> 17<00:03:55.860> 18<00:03:56.860> inches<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.310> vacuum<00:03:57.570> so<00:03:58.570> that<00:03:58.600> tells

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
but 17 18 inches of vacuum so that tells

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.740 
but 17 18 inches of vacuum so that tells
me<00:03:59.110> that<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.620> vacuum<00:04:00.160> solenoid<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.300> good

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
me that the vacuum solenoid is good

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:13.059 
me that the vacuum solenoid is good
the<00:04:02.500> vacuum<00:04:02.890> lines<00:04:03.100> are<00:04:03.310> good

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:19.490 

so<00:04:13.310> we<00:04:13.640> vacuum<00:04:14.450> supply<00:04:14.870> being<00:04:15.110> good

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.340 

the<00:04:19.769> only<00:04:19.890> thing<00:04:20.100> left<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.989> diaphragm

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
the only thing left is the diaphragm

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.650 
the only thing left is the diaphragm
either<00:04:22.890> is<00:04:23.010> broken<00:04:23.310> or<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.210> vein<00:04:24.390> that<00:04:24.570> are

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
either is broken or the vein that are

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.960 
either is broken or the vein that are
stuck<00:04:24.990> so<00:04:25.890> I'm<00:04:26.010> going<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.220> put<00:04:26.670> the<00:04:26.790> vacuum

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
stuck so I'm going to put the vacuum

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.200 
stuck so I'm going to put the vacuum
hose<00:04:27.470> see<00:04:28.470> if<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.590> can<00:04:28.740> pump<00:04:28.920> it<00:04:29.070> up

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:42.050 

and<00:04:34.509> pump<00:04:34.810> up<00:04:34.960> vacuum<00:04:35.889> diaphragm<00:04:36.160> is<00:04:36.430> broken

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:50.140 

you

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.210
