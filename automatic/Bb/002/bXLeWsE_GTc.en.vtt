00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
here which I am going to just make sure

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.799 
here which I am going to just make sure
the<00:00:43.739> sides<00:00:44.010> are<00:00:44.280> cut<00:00:44.520> evenly<00:00:44.940> because<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.570> you

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the sides are cut evenly because as you

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.840 
the sides are cut evenly because as you
know<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.950> fabric<00:00:47.129> store<00:00:47.309> they

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
know when you go to a fabric store they

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.080 
know when you go to a fabric store they
never<00:00:48.300> cut<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.469> fabric<00:00:49.710> straight<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.910> some

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
never cut your fabric straight for some

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.430 
never cut your fabric straight for some
reason<00:00:51.449> they're<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:52.129> whoops<00:00:53.870> so<00:00:54.870> here

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
reason they're just like whoops so here

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.920

I<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.039> wrong<00:00:56.309> side<00:00:56.640> facing<00:00:57.090> out<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
I have the wrong side facing out and the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.990 
I have the wrong side facing out and the
right<00:00:58.410> side<00:00:58.680> inside<00:00:59.640> of<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.750> folded<00:01:01.199> fabric

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
right side inside of the folded fabric

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.479 
right side inside of the folded fabric
over<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.420> side<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> folded<00:01:04.949> side<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
over on this side is the folded side and

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.149 
over on this side is the folded side and
then<00:01:05.729> over<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.510> side<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.290> opening<00:01:07.830> so

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
then over on this side is the opening so

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.840 
then over on this side is the opening so
that's<00:01:08.460> how<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.570> fabric<00:01:10.320> laid<00:01:10.590> out

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
that's how I have my fabric laid out

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.760 
that's how I have my fabric laid out
alright<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> start<00:01:12.360> find<00:01:13.020> your<00:01:13.229> midpoint

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
alright so to start find your midpoint

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.760 
alright so to start find your midpoint
and<00:01:14.040> measure<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.850> downward<00:01:15.720> make<00:01:16.259> sure<00:01:16.500> both

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and measure it downward make sure both

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.550 
and measure it downward make sure both
sides<00:01:17.009> are<00:01:17.520> even<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.540> cut<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.049> straight<00:01:19.500> line

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
sides are even then cut a straight line

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.240 
sides are even then cut a straight line
across<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.590> this<00:01:22.590> way<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.860> will<00:01:23.189> have

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
across like so this way you will have

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.870 
across like so this way you will have
two<00:01:24.180> pieces<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.900> are<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.320> same<00:01:25.979> width<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
two pieces that are the same width and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.399 
two pieces that are the same width and
length<00:01:27.860> all<00:01:28.860> right<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.000> now<00:01:30.329> onto<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> sleeves

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
length all right so now onto the sleeves

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.010 
length all right so now onto the sleeves
and<00:01:31.680> there<00:01:31.890> are<00:01:32.040> two<00:01:32.340> ways<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.880> doing<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
and there are two ways of doing this you

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.190 
and there are two ways of doing this you
can<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.979> leave<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.729> as<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.360> which<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
can one leave this as is which is the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.249 
can one leave this as is which is the
easier<00:01:37.710> option<00:01:38.100> or<00:01:38.610> two<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.720> want<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.079> give

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
easier option or two if you want to give

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.670 
easier option or two if you want to give
this<00:01:40.380> more<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.070> kimono<00:01:41.820> inspired<00:01:42.570> look<00:01:43.170> then

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
this more of a kimono inspired look then

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.270 
this more of a kimono inspired look then
what<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> would<00:01:44.820> suggest<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.450> do

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
what I would suggest for you to do

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.969 
what I would suggest for you to do
is<00:01:46.340> draw<00:01:46.940> an<00:01:47.150> upside<00:01:47.630> down<00:01:47.659> L<00:01:48.110> at<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.619> bottom

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
is draw an upside down L at the bottom

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.460 
is draw an upside down L at the bottom
left<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.460> right<00:01:49.909> corner<00:01:50.420> just<00:01:50.990> like<00:01:51.080> what<00:01:51.350> I'm

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
left and right corner just like what I'm

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.800 
left and right corner just like what I'm
doing<00:01:51.770> here<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:52.420> basically<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:53.750> will

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
doing here and basically this will

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.590 
doing here and basically this will
measure<00:01:54.260> out<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.830> be<00:01:55.009> six<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.729> half<00:01:55.759> inches

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
measure out to be six and a half inches

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.170 
measure out to be six and a half inches
in<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:58.030> 16<00:01:59.030> inches<00:01:59.630> down<00:02:00.640> once<00:02:01.640> you<00:02:01.790> draw<00:02:02.150> out

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
in and 16 inches down once you draw out

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.730 
in and 16 inches down once you draw out
the<00:02:02.540> L<00:02:02.780> shape<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.710> sleeves<00:02:04.100> cut<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.149> out

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
the L shape of the sleeves cut that out

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.070 
the L shape of the sleeves cut that out
all<00:02:06.740> right<00:02:07.670> guys<00:02:07.850> so<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.179> hope<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.479> last<00:02:08.869> step

finish all the raw edges by folding it

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.199 
finish all the raw edges by folding it
in<00:02:14.030> half<00:02:14.060> an<00:02:14.660> inch<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.400> take<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.610> half<00:02:16.850> an<00:02:17.000> inch

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
in half an inch so take a half an inch

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.750 
in half an inch so take a half an inch
of<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.750> raw<00:02:17.900> edges<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.530> fold<00:02:18.860> it<00:02:19.070> in<00:02:19.250> toward

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
of the raw edges and fold it in toward

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.420 
of the raw edges and fold it in toward
the<00:02:20.000> wrong<00:02:20.269> side<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:20.900> can<00:02:21.590> either<00:02:21.830> pin<00:02:22.160> or

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
the wrong side you can either pin or

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.420 
the wrong side you can either pin or
press<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.790> down<00:02:22.910> with<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.180> hot<00:02:23.420> iron<00:02:24.400> here<00:02:25.400> I

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
press it down with a hot iron here I

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.640 
press it down with a hot iron here I
first<00:02:25.790> start<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.480> experiment<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.320> with

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
first start it and experiment it with

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.740 
first start it and experiment it with
the<00:02:27.920> gluing<00:02:28.310> method<00:02:28.760> because<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.150> wanted<00:02:29.690> to

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
the gluing method because I wanted to

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.380 
the gluing method because I wanted to
show<00:02:30.019> you<00:02:30.050> guys<00:02:30.440> how<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.340> would<00:02:31.550> work<00:02:31.580> if<00:02:32.120> you

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
show you guys how this would work if you

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.009 
show you guys how this would work if you
were<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.780> use<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.110> gluing<00:02:33.410> method<00:02:33.769> now<00:02:34.280> for<00:02:34.640> my

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
were to use the gluing method now for my

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.930 
were to use the gluing method now for my
specific<00:02:36.019> type<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.260> fabric<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.190> didn't<00:02:37.760> work

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
specific type of fabric it didn't work

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.809 
specific type of fabric it didn't work
quite<00:02:38.180> effectively<00:02:38.480> or<00:02:39.260> efficiently<00:02:39.290> as<00:02:40.100> it

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
quite effectively or efficiently as it

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.759 
quite effectively or efficiently as it
would<00:02:41.030> with<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.360> sewing<00:02:41.660> machine<00:02:41.810> but<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.440> want

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
would with a sewing machine but I want

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.500 
would with a sewing machine but I want
to<00:02:42.860> just<00:02:43.010> give<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.370> guys<00:02:43.489> an<00:02:43.880> idea<00:02:43.970> how<00:02:44.450> it

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
to just give you guys an idea how it

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.259 
to just give you guys an idea how it
would<00:02:44.720> look<00:02:44.780> here<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.709> am<00:02:46.069> just<00:02:46.130> using<00:02:46.819> a<00:02:47.060> sewing

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
would look here I am just using a sewing

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.180 
would look here I am just using a sewing
machine<00:02:47.390> since<00:02:48.019> it<00:02:48.230> gave<00:02:48.380> me<00:02:48.590> better<00:02:48.769> result

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
machine since it gave me better result

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.930 
machine since it gave me better result
and<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.730> was<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.880> lot<00:02:50.120> quicker

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.370 

after<00:02:55.940> you're<00:02:56.090> done<00:02:56.120> finishing<00:02:56.570> your<00:02:56.810> edges

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
after you're done finishing your edges

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.440 
after you're done finishing your edges
it's<00:02:57.680> now<00:02:57.860> time<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.250> take<00:02:58.640> your<00:02:58.790> two<00:02:59.030> pieces<00:02:59.060> of

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
it's now time to take your two pieces of

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.930 
it's now time to take your two pieces of
fabric<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.410> lay<00:03:00.799> them<00:03:01.010> together<00:03:01.160> just<00:03:01.430> like

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
fabric and lay them together just like

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.150 
fabric and lay them together just like
how<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.180> have<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.630> here<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:05.570> next<00:03:05.989> step<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.410> to

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
how I have it here the next step is to

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.000 
how I have it here the next step is to
pick<00:03:07.700> up<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.060> two<00:03:08.390> top<00:03:08.720> layers<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.500> fold<00:03:09.769> them

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
pick up the two top layers and fold them

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.220 
pick up the two top layers and fold them
to<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.340> sides<00:03:10.640> now<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.360> should<00:03:11.780> have<00:03:11.810> the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
to the sides now you should have the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.220 
to the sides now you should have the
back<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:13.040> kimono<00:03:13.400> shawl<00:03:13.850> facing<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.959> and

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
back of the kimono shawl facing you and

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.830 
back of the kimono shawl facing you and
what<00:03:15.859> you're<00:03:16.010> going<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.310> do<00:03:16.609> next<00:03:16.940> is<00:03:17.209> pin<00:03:17.810> the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
what you're going to do next is pin the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:26.180 
what you're going to do next is pin the
right<00:03:18.290> sides<00:03:18.680> together

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.430 

what<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.310> see<00:03:27.580> here<00:03:27.610> is<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.240> inside<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:28.870> the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
what you see here is the inside of the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.580 
what you see here is the inside of the
shawl<00:03:29.740> and<00:03:30.070> then<00:03:30.460> on<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:31.240> outside<00:03:31.960> it<00:03:32.440> will

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
shawl and then on the outside it will

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.990 
shawl and then on the outside it will
look<00:03:32.800> something<00:03:33.040> like<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:33.490> once<00:03:33.820> it's

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
look something like this once it's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.690 
look something like this once it's
finished

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
finished

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.430 
finished
after<00:03:36.700> you're<00:03:36.880> done<00:03:36.910> pinning<00:03:37.630> go<00:03:37.660> ahead<00:03:38.200> and

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
after you're done pinning go ahead and

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.190 
after you're done pinning go ahead and
sew<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.400> two<00:03:39.610> seams<00:03:40.060> together<00:03:42.600> okay<00:03:43.600> so<00:03:43.660> if

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
sew the two seams together okay so if

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.860 
sew the two seams together okay so if
you<00:03:44.530> are<00:03:44.680> leaving<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.490> shawl<00:03:45.820> top<00:03:46.180> as<00:03:46.420> is

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
you are leaving the shawl top as is

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.040 
you are leaving the shawl top as is
without<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.830> cut<00:03:48.370> out<00:03:48.550> sleeves<00:03:49.120> your<00:03:49.720> next

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
without the cut out sleeves your next

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.170 
without the cut out sleeves your next
step<00:03:50.230> should<00:03:50.440> be<00:03:50.500> measure<00:03:51.130> from<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.940> fold

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
step should be measure from the fold

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.350 
step should be measure from the fold
line<00:03:52.390> down<00:03:52.720> 18<00:03:53.500> inches<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:54.310> then<00:03:54.820> just<00:03:55.120> making

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
line down 18 inches and then just making

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.200 
line down 18 inches and then just making
marking<00:03:55.930> with<00:03:56.110> your<00:03:56.260> PIN<00:03:56.530> from<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.490> 18<00:03:57.910> inch

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
marking with your PIN from the 18 inch

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.300 
marking with your PIN from the 18 inch
mark<00:03:58.720> what<00:03:59.170> you're<00:03:59.320> going<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.650> do<00:03:59.830> is<00:04:00.040> either

mark what you're going to do is either
glue<00:04:00.790> or<00:04:01.060> sew<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:02.080> seam<00:04:02.410> allowance<00:04:02.920> together

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
glue or sew the seam allowance together

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.000 
glue or sew the seam allowance together
down<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.660> hem<00:04:04.900> which<00:04:05.260> is<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.530> bottom<00:04:05.710> of

attempting<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.620> make<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.160> kimono<00:04:12.550> inspired

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
attempting to make the kimono inspired

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.440 
attempting to make the kimono inspired
sleeves<00:04:13.750> then<00:04:14.370> basically<00:04:15.370> do<00:04:15.850> all<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.090> same

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
sleeves then basically do all the same

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.890 
sleeves then basically do all the same
steps<00:04:16.720> by<00:04:17.020> finishing<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.799> raw<00:04:18.070> edges<00:04:18.340> and

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
steps by finishing the raw edges and

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.200 
steps by finishing the raw edges and
right<00:04:19.900> when<00:04:20.080> you're<00:04:20.230> ready<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.680> sew<00:04:21.040> in<00:04:21.609> the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
right when you're ready to sew in the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.060 
right when you're ready to sew in the
sleeves<00:04:22.570> have<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.110> right<00:04:23.290> sides<00:04:23.620> facing

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
sleeves have the right sides facing

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.430 
sleeves have the right sides facing
together<00:04:24.370> just<00:04:25.060> like<00:04:25.180> what<00:04:25.540> I<00:04:25.570> have<00:04:25.840> here<00:04:26.260> and

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
together just like what I have here and

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.760 
together just like what I have here and
then<00:04:27.040> sew<00:04:27.580> along<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.180> upside<00:04:28.810> down<00:04:29.020> L<00:04:29.290> shape

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
then sew along the upside down L shape
