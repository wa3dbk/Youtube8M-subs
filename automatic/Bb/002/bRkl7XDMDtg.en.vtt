00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
figure but I don't see as much of an

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.850 
figure but I don't see as much of an
issue<00:01:48.740> also<00:01:50.689> this<00:01:51.689> cave<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.049> again<00:01:52.470> draped

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
issue also this cave is again draped

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.069 
issue also this cave is again draped
over<00:01:53.009> his<00:01:53.310> shoulders<00:01:53.759> which<00:01:53.970> makes<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.360> harder

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
over his shoulders which makes it harder

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.030 
over his shoulders which makes it harder
for<00:01:55.110> him<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.950> much<00:01:56.329> articulation<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
for him to have much articulation and

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.160 
for him to have much articulation and
which<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.340> understand<00:01:59.790> I've<00:02:00.600> seeing<00:02:00.930> some

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
which I can understand I've seeing some

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.609 
which I can understand I've seeing some
people<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:01.770> again<00:02:01.890> with<00:02:02.219> DC<00:02:02.490> Direct<00:02:02.850> we

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
people but then again with DC Direct we

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.020 
people but then again with DC Direct we
think<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.710> buy<00:02:04.890> these<00:02:05.070> figures<00:02:05.399> more<00:02:05.640> for<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
think we buy these figures more for the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.789 
think we buy these figures more for the
sculpting<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> intercalation<00:02:07.140> side<00:02:07.649> of

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
sculpting and the intercalation side of

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.550 
sculpting and the intercalation side of
things<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.660> again<00:02:09.929> because<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.289> says<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.530> my

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
things so again because it says on my

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.850 
things so again because it says on my
shelf<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.879> not<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.060> huge<00:02:12.390> issue<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.780> me

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
shelf it's not a huge issue for me

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.150 
shelf it's not a huge issue for me
in<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.190> regards<00:02:17.150> classify<00:02:18.150> his<00:02:18.270> face<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:20.040> we
