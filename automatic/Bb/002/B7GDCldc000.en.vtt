want<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.500> fall<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:39.180> soon<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.629> goes

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
want to fall in and as soon as it goes

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.369 
want to fall in and as soon as it goes
in<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.140> glide<00:00:41.100> right<00:00:41.129> down<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> bottom

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
in just glide right down to the bottom

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.600 
in just glide right down to the bottom
but<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.469> don't<00:00:43.649> want<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.860> overpower<00:00:44.100> it

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
but you don't want to overpower it

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.020 
but you don't want to overpower it
so<00:00:44.879> basically<00:00:45.780> say<00:00:45.960> if<00:00:46.079> you're<00:00:46.200> fishing<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.590> mat

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
so basically say if you're fishing a mat

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.430 
so basically say if you're fishing a mat
what<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.360> do<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.629> use<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.079> lightest

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
what I like to do is use the lightest

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.760 
what I like to do is use the lightest
weight<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.640> still<00:00:50.940> carries<00:00:51.420> it

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
weight that I can that still carries it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.770 
weight that I can that still carries it
through<00:00:52.770> by<00:00:53.520> itself<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.239> when<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.360> say<00:00:54.600> by

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
through by itself and when I say by

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.319 
through by itself and when I say by
itself<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.770> don't<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.059> flip

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
itself is I don't like to have to flip

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.510 
itself is I don't like to have to flip
the<00:00:57.480> bait<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> mat<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:58.710> shake<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the bait up on the mat and then shake it

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
the bait up on the mat and then shake it
around<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.600> fall<00:01:00.840> down<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> little

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
around and get it to fall down a little

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.990 
around and get it to fall down a little
bit<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.829> then<00:01:01.949> shake<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:02.460> more<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.699> get

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
bit and then shake it some more and get

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.210 
bit and then shake it some more and get
it<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.210> fall<00:01:03.420> down<00:01:03.629> some<00:01:03.899> more<00:01:04.110> that's<00:01:05.010> not

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
it to fall down some more that's not

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.880 
it to fall down some more that's not
being<00:01:05.400> very<00:01:05.610> efficient<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:07.140> lot<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.680> times

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
being very efficient and a lot of times

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.200 
being very efficient and a lot of times
there's<00:01:08.130> fish<00:01:08.310> under<00:01:08.549> those<00:01:08.700> mats<00:01:08.970> you're

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
there's fish under those mats you're

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.140 
there's fish under those mats you're
getting<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.479> reaction<00:01:09.659> bite<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.830> want<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.340> -

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
getting a reaction bite so you want to -

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.789 
getting a reaction bite so you want to -
when<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.510> goes<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.840> there<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.229> fall<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
when it goes in there just fall in and

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.460 
when it goes in there just fall in and
fall<00:01:14.010> right<00:01:14.189> down<00:01:14.250> through<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.259> same

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
fall right down through but in the same

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.050 
fall right down through but in the same
breath<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.830> don't<00:01:16.979> want<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.280> overpower<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
breath you don't want to overpower it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.200 
breath you don't want to overpower it
where<00:01:18.439> if<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.220> get<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.580> fall<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.030> there

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
where if I can get it to fall in there

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.789 
where if I can get it to fall in there
with<00:01:21.420> an<00:01:21.540> ounce<00:01:21.720> or<00:01:22.110> maybe<00:01:22.290> an<00:01:22.439> ounce<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
with an ounce or maybe an ounce and a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.590 
with an ounce or maybe an ounce and a
half<00:01:22.830> weight<00:01:23.280> I'm<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> go<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
half weight I'm not going to go with the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.660 
half weight I'm not going to go with the
two<00:01:24.780> ounce<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:26.009> then<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.520> just

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
two ounce because it just then it's just

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.200 
two ounce because it just then it's just
falling<00:01:27.150> too<00:01:27.330> fast<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> basically<00:01:29.250> whatever

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
falling too fast so basically whatever

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.630 
falling too fast so basically whatever
weight<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.350> flipping<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.829> mat<00:01:32.040> whatever<00:01:32.400> weight

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
weight on flipping a mat whatever weight

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.670 
weight on flipping a mat whatever weight
you<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.970> get<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.600> fall<00:01:34.200> down<00:01:34.229> in

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
you can get it to just fall down in

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.109 
you can get it to just fall down in
through<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.280> glide<00:01:35.579> down<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
through there and glide down to the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.690 
through there and glide down to the
bottom<00:01:36.450> by<00:01:36.600> itself<00:01:37.250> whether<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.549> get

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
bottom by itself whether you can get

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.300 
bottom by itself whether you can get
away<00:01:38.790> with<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> 1<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.570> 1<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> half<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.130> there's

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
away with a 1 a 1 and a half but there's

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
away with a 1 a 1 and a half but there's
times<00:01:41.610> where<00:01:42.299> I'll<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:42.570> rearrange<00:01:43.020> -

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
times where I'll go rearrange -

you have to have a selection of them and
of<00:02:18.459> course<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.819> have<00:02:18.940> all<00:02:19.629> kinds<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.140> different

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
of course I have all kinds of different

of course I have all kinds of different
sizes<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.310> know<00:02:21.400> traveling<00:02:21.790> throughout

sizes and you know traveling throughout

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.670 
sizes and you know traveling throughout
the<00:02:22.180> country<00:02:22.540> run<00:02:22.930> into<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.170> lot<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.410> different

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
the country run into a lot of different

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.410 
the country run into a lot of different
situations<00:02:23.890> but<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.519> good<00:02:24.730> general<00:02:25.180> rule<00:02:25.209> of

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
situations but a good general rule of

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.020 
situations but a good general rule of
thumb<00:02:25.560> it's<00:02:26.560> just<00:02:26.799> use<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.459> lightest<00:02:27.849> weight

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
thumb it's just use the lightest weight

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.089 
thumb it's just use the lightest weight
that<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:28.390> feel<00:02:28.629> you<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:29.019> still<00:02:29.530> get<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.860> job

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
that you feel you can still get the job

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.190 
that you feel you can still get the job
done<00:02:30.310> with<00:02:30.519> it<00:02:30.700> still<00:02:30.910> be<00:02:31.060> efficient<00:02:31.569> and<00:02:31.989> make

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
done with it still be efficient and make

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.180 
done with it still be efficient and make
as<00:02:32.319> many<00:02:32.470> clean<00:02:32.920> presentations<00:02:33.730> as<00:02:33.849> you<00:02:33.970> can
