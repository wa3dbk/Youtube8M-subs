not finding anything wrong I have to
admit<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.049> had<00:01:13.860> faith<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> obd<00:01:14.970> one<00:01:15.210> sensor

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750

our<00:01:16.560> scanner<00:01:17.280> reader<00:01:17.939> whatever<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.479> want<00:01:18.630> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
our scanner reader whatever you want to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.370 
our scanner reader whatever you want to
call<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.909> wasn't<00:01:21.210> showing<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.840> problem

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
call it and it wasn't showing a problem

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.170 
call it and it wasn't showing a problem
and<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.920> mean<00:01:23.070> that's<00:01:23.280> what<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.640> designed<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and I mean that's what it's designed to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.880 
and I mean that's what it's designed to
do<00:01:24.360> that's<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> computer<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.470> designed

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
do that's what the computer is designed

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.120 
do that's what the computer is designed
to<00:01:26.009> do<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> kind<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.970> believed<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:28.590> there

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
to do so I kind of believed that there

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.660 
to do so I kind of believed that there
were<00:01:29.280> no<00:01:29.490> sensor<00:01:29.970> problems<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.670> after

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
were no sensor problems and after

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.399 
were no sensor problems and after
playing<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.270> with<00:01:33.420> more<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.960> more<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.259> more<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
playing it with more and more and more I

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.460 
playing it with more and more and more I
just<00:01:34.710> can't<00:01:34.920> get<00:01:35.070> my<00:01:35.280> head<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.470> fuel

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
just can't get my head out of that fuel

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.249 
just can't get my head out of that fuel
problem<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.250> fuel<00:01:38.939> pump<00:01:39.240> again<00:01:39.570> well<00:01:40.020> guess

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
problem and fuel pump again well guess

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.060 
problem and fuel pump again well guess
what<00:01:41.000> after<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.150> left<00:01:42.479> does<00:01:42.990> their<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.560> got<00:01:44.040> a

again<00:02:06.810> said<00:02:07.200> very<00:02:07.950> confidently<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:09.270> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
again said very confidently it's the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.800 
again said very confidently it's the
fuel<00:02:09.899> pump<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:11.250> apparently<00:02:11.940> we<00:02:12.180> were<00:02:12.300> only

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
fuel pump so apparently we were only

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.309 
fuel pump so apparently we were only
about<00:02:13.940> 44<00:02:14.940> pounds<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:16.260> pressure<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:18.450> when<00:02:18.989> he

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
about 44 pounds of pressure and when he

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.940 
about 44 pounds of pressure and when he
disconnected<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.340> vacuum<00:02:21.150> hose<00:02:21.420> on<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.680> fuel

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
disconnected the vacuum hose on the fuel

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.330 
disconnected the vacuum hose on the fuel
regulator<00:02:23.420> he<00:02:24.420> should<00:02:24.660> have<00:02:24.810> seen<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.200> spike<00:02:25.680> it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
regulator he should have seen a spike it

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.250 
regulator he should have seen a spike it
did<00:02:26.550> not<00:02:26.730> spike<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.390> did<00:02:27.540> not<00:02:27.720> go<00:02:27.900> anywheres

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
did not spike it did not go anywheres

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.460 
did not spike it did not go anywheres
near<00:02:28.349> where<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:28.770> should<00:02:29.099> be<00:02:29.250> which<00:02:29.459> is

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
near where it should be which is

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.960 
near where it should be which is
uncontrolled<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.890> open<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.430> should<00:02:32.640> be<00:02:32.760> about

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
uncontrolled and open it should be about

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.050 
uncontrolled and open it should be about
a<00:02:33.030> hundred<00:02:33.269> psi<00:02:34.370> according<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.459> him<00:02:35.580> which<00:02:35.910> I

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
a hundred psi according to him which I

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.559 
a hundred psi according to him which I
believe<00:02:36.360> he's<00:02:37.080> definitely<00:02:37.709> knows<00:02:38.069> this<00:02:38.250> stuff

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
believe he's definitely knows this stuff

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.440 
believe he's definitely knows this stuff
so<00:02:39.569> guess<00:02:39.930> what<00:02:40.200> now<00:02:40.800> I've<00:02:41.099> got<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.450> fuel

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
so guess what now I've got a fuel

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.080 
so guess what now I've got a fuel
sending<00:02:42.900> unit<00:02:42.959> which<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.220> don't<00:02:44.489> know<00:02:44.730> if<00:02:44.910> is

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
sending unit which I don't know if is

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.380 
sending unit which I don't know if is
the<00:02:45.239> correct<00:02:45.600> one<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:47.220> what<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:47.549> did<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.060> spent

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
the correct one so what I did is I spent

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.440 
the correct one so what I did is I spent
half<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.810> day<00:02:48.989> on<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.319> phone<00:02:49.350> with<00:02:50.450> Ricardo

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
half the day on the phone with Ricardo

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.330 
half the day on the phone with Ricardo

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
as much information as I could get the

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.960 
as much information as I could get the
Ford<00:03:03.540> information<00:03:04.500> very<00:03:04.950> confusing<00:03:05.580> very

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
Ford information very confusing very

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.410 
Ford information very confusing very
confusing<00:03:06.739> jumpers<00:03:07.739> for<00:03:08.420> different

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
about maybe your connections check and

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.870 
about maybe your connections check and
see<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.600> in<00:03:45.870> fact<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.350> right<00:03:46.590> pump<00:03:46.920> if<00:03:47.609> it

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
see is this in fact the right pump if it

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.150 
see is this in fact the right pump if it
is<00:03:48.030> not<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.510> right<00:03:48.690> pump<00:03:49.079> then<00:03:49.470> Rock<00:03:49.769> Auto

I'm<00:04:08.930> up<00:04:09.110> in<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.350> air<00:04:09.440> I<00:04:09.590> don't<00:04:09.650> know<00:04:10.280> for<00:04:10.670> sure

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
I'm up in the air I don't know for sure

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.550 
I'm up in the air I don't know for sure
so<00:04:11.960> as<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:14.030> said<00:04:14.300> I<00:04:14.540> checked<00:04:15.080> out<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.290> whole<00:04:15.530> bunch

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
so as I said I checked out a whole bunch

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.099 
so as I said I checked out a whole bunch
of<00:04:15.950> other<00:04:16.130> sites<00:04:16.430> some<00:04:17.420> of<00:04:17.540> the<00:04:17.630> sites<00:04:17.930> that

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
of other sites some of the sites that

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.510 
of other sites some of the sites that
sold<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:19.160> pump<00:04:20.079> used<00:04:21.079> the<00:04:21.620> VIN<00:04:21.859> number<00:04:22.280> to

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
sold the pump used the VIN number to

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.590 
sold the pump used the VIN number to
look<00:04:22.700> it<00:04:22.880> up<00:04:23.830> came<00:04:24.830> up<00:04:25.040> with<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.370> same<00:04:25.610> fuel

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
look it up came up with the same fuel

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.680 
look it up came up with the same fuel
sending<00:04:26.990> unit<00:04:27.050> so<00:04:27.710> I'm<00:04:28.370> confident<00:04:29.150> it's<00:04:29.450> the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
sending unit so I'm confident it's the
