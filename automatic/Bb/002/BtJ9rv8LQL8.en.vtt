00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 It's the la in this video is making a 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.980
 small review of this device than 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:17.580
 recently where kim is this one 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:19.920
 company and if I do not know what 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.510
 watching this video simply found 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.210
 putting the house down what he does there gives 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.080
 case makes the connection with the adaptation usb 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.559
 the connection suddenly sells a thousand water 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.399
 should stay with you see the usb view of the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.110
 computer goes through it and it converts 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.850
 a video promoter 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.620
 How can you be okay? I'm not. 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.620
 using two external monitors 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.230
 this monitor is connected in the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.910
 laptop watching port and this other is 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.750
 connected by this device that I am 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.809
 doing the review 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.550
 so it has not shown much 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.810
 I'll show you here that he's 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.229
 running in extended mode 4 which is the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:20.939
 What more causes doubt such then beauty 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:24.060
 the 31 pains and also what can also 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.890
 cause one more may also have doubts 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.560
 especially if you have already looked at this 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.450
 device that you purchased in the case I purchased 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.090
 in the free market and if you already have 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.250
 since you may also have doubts that 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:42.090
 are many resolutions of the UN and its 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.860
 advice caught fire here, then you want it 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.750
 there resolutions are touched by this 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.630
 appliance 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.119
 note that it has two versions to 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.649
 I bought the king 17 but also got the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:02:00.240
 river 19 to day 17 in the case until 1920 x 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.369
 1080p 1080 pixels which is full resolution 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.960
 hd so if you have a full hd monitor 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.899
 it will work 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.410
 already on the 19th it goes until the resolution of 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:17.290
 2048 1.152 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:19.690
 to show that the bottom of the carton is 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.099
 According to what he says here it is possible 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:27.519
 you connect up to six devices ten 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.319
 defended three and six usb ports free in 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.650
 six of these devices 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.160
 but it is you show that also that in 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.370
 windows detect this common monitor with the 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:48.280
 monitor is not simply a gambia 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:54.700
 so to speak are a two notebook is a 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:59.910
 everything and 3g coming here or 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:03.400
 function in extended mode and 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.670
 so the other answered the doubts 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.620
 problem arose in the head before 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.489
 buy a device that had not been 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.480
 on the internet and that you are seeing this 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:19.239
 video that you want this device to be 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.650
 f you feel more conscious and more 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.310
 some details 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.650
 good, my job is as long as he 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.329
 works in usb wi fi usb 2.0 mode 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.390
 sure that some kind of law 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:37.630
 type of picture delay 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.989
 Good how I did it to see if it exists 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.340
 this program or not I as manager in the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.950
 youtube can open videos at 1080p 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.100
 60 fps 60 frames 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.100
 I opened a video at 60fps it leaves a 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.730
 monitor on which you are using this 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:01.959
 I left there was so I did not realize 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:05.170
 any delay and fall and fran 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:08.769
 Do not you understand me or anything? 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.859
 worked normally without any kind of 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:15.280
 good problem 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:18.760
 He also spoke a little like that since 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.600
 he uses the USB port to pick up the 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.220
 Image 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.660
 the computer will be that somehow 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.640
 interfere with the transfer of data to 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:33.070
 chains of pen drives something of the type 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.440
 well at least to me it happened're 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.230
 that I did as I was already living 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.330
 open at the same time I put in a 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.030
 folder of my notebook to be busy 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.580
 by an external hd 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.860
 so the video did not freeze the video 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.230
 still running quiet normal 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.090
 like nothing happened 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.150
 only that, however, the transfer of the 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.180
 pro hd notebook was a bit slower 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.000
 without this device here without device 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.100
 usually get rates from 22 to 30 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.550
 megabytes per second 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.650
 in notebook for my external hd and 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.270
 using this device at the same time 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.910
 making the transfer to make a 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.570
 copy 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.180
 the maximum rate was 15 megawatts per 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.800
 second 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.960
 this interferes in some way 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.030
 so it depends on the type of user who 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.590
 You 're I'm talking about this video here. 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.850
 because I did not find the information in the 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.500
 Internet 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.300
 I just went to find out anyway 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.270
 that I bought this device 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.500
 so if you are one of them is the kind of 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.070
 user who is using 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.000
 your external hd your thumb drive to do 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.740
 children 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.160
 It's one more detail that I think is 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.040
 very good you know also if it fits if it is 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.690
 good or not for you to buy in that one 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:55.990
 inconvenience you buy this type of 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:58.810
 that compensates for you that can 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.730
 happen and could happen told 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.330
 that appears in the comments is someone 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:07.330
 Wondering if you can play and with us? 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:11.200
 three of them are given to extend clothes 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:15.790
 we have good it is I believe that this 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:20.410
 He does not have a motorcycle on a motorcycle. 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.300
 by the way I did not test it is that for 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.250
 play on all three of them because I think 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.490
 which sucks because those two 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.169
 engines are the same 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.770
 but this one is a resolution one 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:33.560
 little different and also a notebook not 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.110
 has processing capacity is bad and 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.080
 depending on the game when it was opened and a 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.319
 reader imagines trying to open in 3 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.770
 So understand this, and in 2000 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:47.930
 positioning for you and eventually 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:50.590
 would ask neither in the comments on 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.590
 that 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:56.780
 Too many do not have much to talk about. 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:59.240
 This is it if you have seen this 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.659
 there on the open market or in 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.030
 any other site and was 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:07.819
 looking for more information then you can 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:11.960
 buy that works beauty is not 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:15.259
 cheated if you just found this 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:18.740
 video became interested is looking at the 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:21.110
 free market and not on other websites is 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:27.560
 I have to may need it for example is 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:30.259
 multiplayer the date and do not look there I 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.270
 sbpv road also you will find him 

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:35.210
 comes with two adapters is therefore 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.639
 standard output is of vehicle you can 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.639
 see and have this adapter that converts 

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:42.830
 tvi for short and also has another 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:45.650
 everything is inside the box that converts the 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:49.820
 I took it to hdmi and if you want 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:51.770
 connect on a monitor or tv hd me then 

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.090
 I hope that this 20 tries 

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:57.680
 and informative 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:59.840

 comments your comment where the 

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:10.990
