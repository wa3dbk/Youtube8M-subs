prickly<00:02:01.950> pears<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.490> me<00:02:02.670> are<00:02:04.430> braids<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.579> you

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
prickly pears to me are braids that you

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.580

can<00:02:05.909> see<00:02:06.149> stretch<00:02:06.600> strands<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.350> break

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
can see stretch strands of the break

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.469 
can see stretch strands of the break
coming<00:02:07.829> out<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.129> your<00:02:08.220> hair<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.759> don't<00:02:09.330> like

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.449 
coming out of your hair I don't like
that<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.050> that's<00:02:10.259> why<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> use<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> transition<00:02:11.340> to

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
that so that's why I use a transition to

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.430 
that so that's why I use a transition to
a<00:02:11.489> brain

a brain

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:24.480
