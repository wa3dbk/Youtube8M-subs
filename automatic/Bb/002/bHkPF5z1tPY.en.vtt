00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.860
 welcome to here 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.490
 weather report of the german weather service 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.140
 in Offenbach 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.150
 we have a explosive ice storm and 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.280
 ice before and for the 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.570
 southwest and west of our country and 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.520
 how come to that look now 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.960
 a little closer to behind me you can see 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.449
 the minimum temperatures of the last 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.060
 night so again, although happy 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.170
 with minus 3 to minus 8 degrees and 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.330
 that was also the past nights 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.439
 already so the ground could be very 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.990
 cool down a lot 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.480
 now comes deep into the game draft 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.070
 is currently still over play 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.260
 will be during the night and tomorrow 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.870
 day over france to belgium 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.670
 pull and look on his front 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.950
 it gets very very mild air masses 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.450
 the mediterranean sea to us that happens 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.219
 not on the ground but in 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.010
 higher air layers about as between 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.480
 one and two kilometers and there warm air 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.460
 now easier than the ground level 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.230
 it has this warm air very cold 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.850
 hard to displace this cold air 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.920
 besides, we still have these 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.020
 So it will be 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.620
 Continued supply of cold air 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.659
 brought 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.639
 and that causes us to spread 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.560
 with the occurrence of freezing rain 

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:10.209
 and ice rain have to reckon 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.859
 In the next graph we can 

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:13.659
 take a closer look 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:16.329
 we see the down here worn down the 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.130
 temperature and this red curve is here 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.679
 the temperature curve in the atmosphere 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.020
 To see it on the ground is initially very 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.389
 cold with minus eight degrees then rises 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.849
 the temperature rises rapidly to plus 23 

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:29.529
 degrees to sink then again 

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:31.509
 So we have like a so-called 

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:33.039
 investment and now it is so in 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.409
 this usually always intervenes 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.399
 So it's three and ten kilometers 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.409
 first snow 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.630
 this snow falls into this 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.029
 layer and with this very mild air 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.919
 and goes into rain over liquefied 

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:46.179
 So if you have this liquid 

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:48.249
 have the precipitate back in now 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.630
 This cold air ship falls then begins 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:51.189
 to freeze the whole thing again 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.810
 So ice-grains or 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.239
 Freezing rain on the ground and that 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.849
 this causes that significant smoothness 

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:59.919
 network times to see on the map 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:02.799
 the precipitation forecast are in white 

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:04.270
 snow in the blue colors the rain and 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.859
 if I let it go now 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.409
 At first we are still snowing 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:10.450
 but then go up in blue color 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:12.969
 over as is becoming increasingly fluid and 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.780
 also capture parts of Rhineland Palatinate 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.670
 in the aftermath 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.930
 if you continue now on the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.690
 next card is the whole thing again 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.670
 summarized so here in the southwest 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.620
 the rain spreads the liquid phase 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.569
 and that at temperatures between minus 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.130
 two and minus three degrees each can 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.380
 Imagine how it works there too 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.090
 will be accordingly and tomorrow 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.090
 the whole thing then continues to spread 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.980
 north and west and east out as well 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.980
 everywhere the danger of freezing everywhere 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.170
 rain in hesse in nrw and only here 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.940
 Down in the southwest the theme on the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.410
 next party the rising tomorrow the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.090
 Temperatures something in the positive 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.980
 area so that on the Upper Rhine the 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.380
 situation relaxed during the afternoon 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.340
 otherwise it spreads this considerable 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.989
 smoothing danger 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.730
 and the whole thing again 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.410
 summarized here in the picture so 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.540
 Tomorrow they have to be here in particular 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.970
 southwest with considerable slipperiness 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.940
 freezing rain and ice rain count 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.340
 and they should be the train and the true ones 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.560
 carefully follow the situation and if possible 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.970
 avoid unnecessary rides tomorrow and 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.560
 if you want to go for a walk tomorrow 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.540
 They should be extra careful too 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.519
 be because the walkways are well 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.630
 be considerable space and on the 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.459
 winter is coming 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.640
 further processed and thus I did 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.799
 see me again on 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.090
 german weather service weather and climate 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.090
