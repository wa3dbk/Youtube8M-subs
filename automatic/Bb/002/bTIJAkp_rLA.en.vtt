let's have a look at the interface for

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.370 
let's have a look at the interface for
which<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.549> tutorial<00:01:27.150> describes<00:01:27.330> itself<00:01:28.080> as<00:01:28.290> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
which the tutorial describes itself as a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.770 
which the tutorial describes itself as a
basic<00:01:28.920> explanation<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.850> how<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.329> get<00:01:30.600> around

the football manager interface the first

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.530 
the football manager interface the first
thing<00:01:34.350> you'll<00:01:34.500> notice<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.880> tutorial

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
thing you'll notice is that the tutorial

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.480 
thing you'll notice is that the tutorial
just<00:01:36.840> starts<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> team<00:01:37.770> already<00:01:37.950> loaded

just starts with the team already loaded

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.330 
just starts with the team already loaded
in<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.290> tutorial<00:01:40.920> mode<00:01:41.100> is

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
in this is because the tutorial mode is

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.609 
in this is because the tutorial mode is
separate<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.270> main<00:01:42.450> game<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:43.320> can't

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619
