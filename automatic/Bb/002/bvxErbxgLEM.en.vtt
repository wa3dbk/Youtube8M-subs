them that makes them that valuable other
than<00:01:44.179> people's<00:01:44.479> want<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.800> that<00:01:45.950> changes

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
than people's want and and that changes

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.859 
than people's want and and that changes
quite<00:01:46.580> often<00:01:46.819> so<00:01:47.030> you'd<00:01:47.390> have<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.630> have<00:01:47.720> an

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
quite often so you'd have to have an

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.930 
quite often so you'd have to have an
incredibly<00:01:48.410> broad<00:01:48.740> selection<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.429> cars<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.819> be

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
incredibly broad selection of cars to be

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.940 
incredibly broad selection of cars to be
able<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.179> give<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.509> in<00:01:50.630> any<00:01:51.200> amount<00:01:51.709> of<00:01:51.800> value

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
able to give it in any amount of value

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.919 
able to give it in any amount of value
and<00:01:52.280> hope<00:01:52.429> that<00:01:52.550> it's<00:01:52.729> state<00:01:52.940> and<00:01:53.660> you<00:01:53.780> always

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
and hope that it's state and you always

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.600 
and hope that it's state and you always
see<00:01:54.200> incremental<00:01:54.470> growth<00:01:54.979> because<00:01:55.490> they

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
see incremental growth because they

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.070 
see incremental growth because they
aren't<00:01:55.819> making<00:01:56.000> any<00:01:56.270> new<00:01:56.509> ones<00:01:56.690> but<00:01:56.990> the

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
aren't making any new ones but the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.210 
aren't making any new ones but the
problem<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.500> though<00:01:57.679> is<00:01:57.800> there's<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:58.039> bought

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
problem is though is there's a bought

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.119 
problem is though is there's a bought
sailed<00:01:58.520> on<00:01:58.610> emotion
