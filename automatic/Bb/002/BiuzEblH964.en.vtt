00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and it didn't really work all that well

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.440 
and it didn't really work all that well
when<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.739> was<00:00:34.950> putting<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.370> paper<00:00:35.550> mache<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.239> so

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
I'll show you how I changed it and I

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.880 
I'll show you how I changed it and I
also<00:00:39.149> did<00:00:39.450> some<00:00:39.600> experiments<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.350> try<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.590> find

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
also did some experiments to try to find

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.430 
also did some experiments to try to find
a<00:00:41.250> pace<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.510> could<00:00:42.660> use<00:00:42.840> with<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.200> shop

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
a pace that I could use with the shop

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.520 
a pace that I could use with the shop
towels<00:00:44.030> that<00:00:45.030> doesn't<00:00:45.420> use<00:00:45.570> any<00:00:45.750> Elmer's<00:00:46.170> glue

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
towels that doesn't use any Elmer's glue

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.319 
towels that doesn't use any Elmer's glue
just<00:00:46.920> because<00:00:47.219> Elmer's<00:00:47.550> glue<00:00:47.700> tends<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.239> be

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
just because Elmer's glue tends to be

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.110 
just because Elmer's glue tends to be
kind<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.629> expensive<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.640> tried<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> couple

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
kind of expensive and I I tried a couple

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.400 
kind of expensive and I I tried a couple
of<00:00:51.420> things<00:00:51.600> I'm<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> tell<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.289> about

shapes and especially for finding the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.479 
shapes and especially for finding the
exact<00:01:03.660> place<00:01:03.960> where<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.439> eyes<00:01:04.650> would<00:01:04.979> go<00:01:05.220> and

the<00:01:40.829> first<00:01:41.040> thing<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.430> did<00:01:41.490> was<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.030> fill<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the first thing I did was to fill in the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.490 
the first thing I did was to fill in the
cheeks<00:01:43.970> making<00:01:44.970> sure<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.450> cheeks<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
cheeks making sure that the cheeks the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.859 
cheeks making sure that the cheeks the
puffiness<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.310> went<00:01:47.579> behind<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.119> line<00:01:48.360> or

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
puffiness of it went behind the line or

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.899 
puffiness of it went behind the line or
the<00:01:49.049> eyes<00:01:49.409> go<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.740> didn't<00:01:50.159> want<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.520> really

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the eyes go I didn't want to be really

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.429 
the eyes go I didn't want to be really
careful<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.509> make<00:01:51.720> sure<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.899> those<00:01:52.170> eyes

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
careful to make sure that those eyes

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.679 
careful to make sure that those eyes
have<00:01:52.799> have<00:01:53.250> room<00:01:53.610> when<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> get<00:01:54.299> around<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
have have room when I get around to

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.780 
have have room when I get around to
actually<00:01:55.290> adding<00:01:55.619> them<00:01:55.770> with<00:01:55.950> my<00:01:56.219> air<00:01:56.579> dry

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
actually adding them with my air dry

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.840 
actually adding them with my air dry
clay<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.259> kept<00:01:58.740> building<00:01:58.829> up<00:01:59.460> shapes

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
clay then I just kept building up shapes

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.200 
clay then I just kept building up shapes
and<00:02:00.689> made<00:02:00.869> enough<00:02:01.140> room<00:02:01.490> between<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.060> eyes

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and made enough room between the eyes

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.319 
and made enough room between the eyes
just<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.780> little<00:02:03.920> thin<00:02:04.920> pieces<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.430> aluminum

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
just a little thin pieces of aluminum

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.660 
just a little thin pieces of aluminum
foil<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:07.170> each<00:02:07.350> side<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.829> pattern<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.520> that

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
foil on each side of the pattern so that

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.309 
foil on each side of the pattern so that
the<00:02:08.789> eyes<00:02:08.940> will<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.690> right<00:02:09.899> distance

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
the eyes will be the right distance

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.600 
the eyes will be the right distance
apart<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.160> kept<00:02:11.819> filling<00:02:12.150> it

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
apart and just kept filling it

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.270 
apart and just kept filling it
and<00:02:12.700> adding<00:02:13.600> more<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:13.990> more<00:02:14.080> aluminum<00:02:15.040> foil

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and adding more and more aluminum foil

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.500 
and adding more and more aluminum foil
just<00:02:15.550> like<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.850> would<00:02:16.090> if<00:02:16.210> you<00:02:16.330> were<00:02:16.360> using

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
just like you would if you were using

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.440 
just like you would if you were using
clay<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:17.860> isn't<00:02:18.220> exactly<00:02:18.310> like<00:02:18.700> clay<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.180> work

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
clay it isn't exactly like clay to work

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.750 
clay it isn't exactly like clay to work
with<00:02:19.660> it's<00:02:19.870> obviously<00:02:20.470> not<00:02:20.680> as<00:02:20.830> intuitive<00:02:21.190> but

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
with it's obviously not as intuitive but

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.330 
with it's obviously not as intuitive but
you<00:02:22.240> can<00:02:22.510> get<00:02:22.810> basically<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.500> same<00:02:23.770> results

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
you can get basically the same results

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.970 
you can get basically the same results
if<00:02:24.490> you're<00:02:24.580> really<00:02:24.850> really<00:02:25.090> careful<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:26.560> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
if you're really really careful the the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.280 
if you're really really careful the the
whole<00:02:27.190> process<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:27.970> basically<00:02:28.450> done<00:02:28.900> exactly

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
whole process is basically done exactly

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.380 
whole process is basically done exactly
the<00:02:29.590> same<00:02:29.800> ways<00:02:30.040> all<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.340> projects<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.210> my

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
the same ways all the projects in my

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.300 
the same ways all the projects in my
book<00:02:31.720> that's<00:02:32.260> called<00:02:32.620> make<00:02:32.890> animal

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
book that's called make animal

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.790 
book that's called make animal
sculptures<00:02:33.730> with<00:02:33.970> paper<00:02:34.180> mache<00:02:34.420> clay<00:02:35.020> so<00:02:35.620> if

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
sculptures with paper mache clay so if

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.110 
sculptures with paper mache clay so if
you<00:02:35.890> have<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.220> book<00:02:36.520> you'll<00:02:36.730> be<00:02:36.880> really

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
you have that book you'll be really

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.080 
you have that book you'll be really
familiar<00:02:37.360> with<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:37.990> whole<00:02:38.140> process<00:02:39.060> now<00:02:40.060> a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
familiar with this whole process now a

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.670 
familiar with this whole process now a
lot<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.450> people<00:02:40.690> prefer<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:41.050> use<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.470> hot<00:02:41.650> glue

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
lot of people prefer to use the hot glue

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.530 
lot of people prefer to use the hot glue
gun<00:02:41.920> instead<00:02:42.459> of<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.670> masking<00:02:43.060> tape<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.420> I'm

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
gun instead of the masking tape that I'm

gun instead of the masking tape that I'm
using<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:44.050> have<00:02:44.500> tried<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.160> really<00:02:45.730> don't

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
using I have tried it I really don't

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.760 
using I have tried it I really don't
like<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:46.450> this<00:02:46.990> is<00:02:47.050> just<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.440> way<00:02:47.560> I'm

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
doing it you might prefer to use the hot

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.449 
doing it you might prefer to use the hot
glue<00:02:49.870> gun<00:02:49.900> one<00:02:50.590> thing<00:02:50.800> that<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.040> will<00:02:51.220> want<00:02:51.400> to

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
glue gun one thing that you will want to

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.210 
glue gun one thing that you will want to
do<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.850> kind<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.120> squish<00:02:52.600> your<00:02:53.110> aluminum<00:02:53.709> foil

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
do is kind of squish your aluminum foil

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.949 
do is kind of squish your aluminum foil
after<00:02:54.550> it's<00:02:54.790> been<00:02:54.910> taped<00:02:55.180> on<00:02:55.390> just<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:55.810> that

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
after it's been taped on just so that

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.290 
after it's been taped on just so that
you<00:02:56.080> can<00:02:56.230> get<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.500> right<00:02:56.709> shape<00:02:57.160> again<00:02:57.640> kind

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
you can get the right shape again kind

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.940 
you can get the right shape again kind
of<00:02:58.390> like<00:02:58.540> using<00:02:58.720> clay<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.470> can<00:02:59.590> push<00:02:59.800> it

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
of like using clay you can push it

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.699 
of like using clay you can push it
around<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.520> can<00:03:00.550> smash<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.420> with<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:02.050> hammer<00:03:02.170> if

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
around you can smash it with a hammer if

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.670 
around you can smash it with a hammer if
you<00:03:02.830> need<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.640> can<00:03:03.880> smooth<00:03:04.570> it<00:03:04.720> off<00:03:04.870> with<00:03:05.650> a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
you need to you can smooth it off with a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.250 
you need to you can smooth it off with a
flat<00:03:06.130> tool<00:03:06.430> or<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> stick<00:03:07.180> so<00:03:07.570> there's<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.989> lot<00:03:08.170> of

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
flat tool or a stick so there's a lot of

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.720 
flat tool or a stick so there's a lot of
things<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.650> can<00:03:08.800> do<00:03:08.950> with<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.220> aluminum

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
things that you can do with the aluminum

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.910 
things that you can do with the aluminum
foil<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.209> get<00:03:10.690> it<00:03:10.840> in<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.080> shape<00:03:11.320> you<00:03:11.500> want<00:03:11.680> it

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
foil to get it in the shape you want it

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.220 
foil to get it in the shape you want it
now<00:03:12.550> the<00:03:12.610> tutorial<00:03:13.300> that<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.450> mentioned<00:03:14.020> does

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
now the tutorial that I mentioned does

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.170 
now the tutorial that I mentioned does
have<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.739> shape<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.280> ears<00:03:15.520> on<00:03:15.790> there<00:03:16.000> it

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
have the shape of the ears on there it

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.050 
have the shape of the ears on there it
was<00:03:16.360> really<00:03:16.690> helpful<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:18.400> basically

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
was really helpful that basically

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.479 
was really helpful that basically
they're<00:03:19.420> just<00:03:19.450> rounded<00:03:20.019> triangles<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.799> once

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
they're just rounded triangles and once

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.070 
they're just rounded triangles and once
you<00:03:21.610> get<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.850> first<00:03:22.000> one<00:03:22.330> looking<00:03:22.660> right<00:03:22.840> on

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
you get the first one looking right on

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.440 
you get the first one looking right on
on<00:03:23.350> your<00:03:23.640> raccoon<00:03:24.640> just<00:03:24.940> kind<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.180> hold<00:03:25.330> them

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
on your raccoon just kind of hold them

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.690 
on your raccoon just kind of hold them
up<00:03:25.630> there<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.049> see<00:03:26.320> if<00:03:26.440> if<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:27.220> looks<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.580> way

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
up there and see if if it looks the way

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.400 
up there and see if if it looks the way
you<00:03:27.730> want<00:03:27.820> it<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.510> then<00:03:28.690> use<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:28.930> as<00:03:29.320> a

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
you want it to and then use that as a

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.770 
you want it to and then use that as a
pattern<00:03:29.680> for<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:30.100> second<00:03:30.459> ear<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:30.940> put<00:03:31.570> more

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
pattern for the second ear I put more

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.530 
pattern for the second ear I put more
foil<00:03:32.200> around<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.890> edge<00:03:33.010> of<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.400> ear<00:03:33.430> too<00:03:33.910> just

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
foil around the edge of the ear too just

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.300 
foil around the edge of the ear too just
to<00:03:34.630> soften<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:35.260> edge<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.920> make<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:36.190> look

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
to soften that edge and make it look

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.720 
to soften that edge and make it look
like<00:03:36.370> he<00:03:36.640> had<00:03:36.790> some<00:03:37.030> fur<00:03:37.830> now<00:03:38.830> obviously<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.400> ran

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
like he had some fur now obviously I ran

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.460 
like he had some fur now obviously I ran
through<00:03:39.910> that<00:03:40.060> process<00:03:40.480> really<00:03:40.660> fast<00:03:41.049> it<00:03:41.260> took

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
through that process really fast it took

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.979 
through that process really fast it took
at<00:03:41.980> least<00:03:42.040> two<00:03:42.459> hours<00:03:42.610> for<00:03:43.209> me<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.360> get<00:03:43.600> that<00:03:43.780> on

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
at least two hours for me to get that on

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.030 
at least two hours for me to get that on
there<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:45.190> actually<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.480> next<00:03:46.780> day<00:03:47.049> I<00:03:47.410> did

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
there and I actually the next day I did

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.890 
there and I actually the next day I did
a<00:03:48.070> few<00:03:48.310> more<00:03:48.519> adjustments<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.269> showed<00:03:49.570> you<00:03:49.750> how

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
a few more adjustments I showed you how

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.610 
a few more adjustments I showed you how
I<00:03:49.930> put<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.890> toes<00:03:51.190> on<00:03:51.489> in<00:03:51.790> my<00:03:52.000> last<00:03:52.269> video<00:03:52.810> using

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
I put the toes on in my last video using

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.229 
I put the toes on in my last video using
some<00:03:53.799> wire<00:03:54.070> and<00:03:54.100> I<00:03:54.489> wrapped<00:03:54.670> them<00:03:54.880> up<00:03:55.000> with

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
some wire and I wrapped them up with

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.890 
some wire and I wrapped them up with
some<00:03:55.269> aluminum<00:03:55.989> foil<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.830> put<00:03:57.700> them<00:03:57.850> on<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.269> the

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
some aluminum foil I put them on the the

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.990 
some aluminum foil I put them on the the
hands<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.650> feet<00:03:59.920> with<00:04:00.340> some<00:04:00.549> masking

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
hands and the feet with some masking

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.479 
hands and the feet with some masking
tape<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:02.110> didn't<00:04:02.440> work<00:04:02.470> really<00:04:03.160> well

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
tape and it didn't work really well

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.940 
tape and it didn't work really well
today<00:04:04.000> when<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:04.480> was<00:04:04.750> putting<00:04:05.140> on<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.620> paper

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
today when I was putting on the paper

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.130 
today when I was putting on the paper
mache<00:04:06.400> because<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.970> toes<00:04:07.570> were<00:04:07.750> too<00:04:07.900> close

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
mache because the toes were too close

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.860 
mache because the toes were too close
together<00:04:08.350> and<00:04:08.769> it<00:04:08.860> was<00:04:08.980> really<00:04:09.190> hard<00:04:09.489> to<00:04:09.640> wrap

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
together and it was really hard to wrap

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.390 
together and it was really hard to wrap
the<00:04:10.870> paper<00:04:11.110> mache<00:04:11.470> around<00:04:11.829> them<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:12.220> get<00:04:12.310> it

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
the paper mache around them and get it

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.819 
the paper mache around them and get it
nice<00:04:12.579> and<00:04:12.610> smooth<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:13.810> actually<00:04:14.170> took<00:04:14.470> the

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
nice and smooth so I actually took the

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.920 
nice and smooth so I actually took the
toes<00:04:15.100> off<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.940> hands<00:04:16.150> in<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.479> feet<00:04:16.720> I

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
toes off of the hands in the feet I

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.759 
toes off of the hands in the feet I
wrapped<00:04:17.290> them<00:04:17.440> again<00:04:17.769> with<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.250> with<00:04:18.519> more

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
wrapped them again with it with more

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.710 
wrapped them again with it with more
aluminum<00:04:20.250> foil<00:04:20.430> because<00:04:20.639> I'm<00:04:21.090> kind<00:04:21.479> of<00:04:21.509> messed

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
aluminum foil because I'm kind of messed

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.559 
aluminum foil because I'm kind of messed
up<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.049> old<00:04:22.229> ones<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.650> I<00:04:23.129> wrapped<00:04:23.729> them<00:04:24.210> with

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:24.569 
up the old ones and I wrapped them with

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.680 
up the old ones and I wrapped them with
paper<00:04:25.050> mache<00:04:25.849> before<00:04:26.849> they<00:04:27.090> went<00:04:27.300> back<00:04:27.479> onto

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
paper mache before they went back onto

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.430 
paper mache before they went back onto
the<00:04:27.960> feet<00:04:28.229> I<00:04:28.500> had<00:04:29.099> to<00:04:29.220> let<00:04:29.340> them<00:04:29.490> dry<00:04:30.379> before<00:04:31.379> I

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
the feet I had to let them dry before I

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.860 
the feet I had to let them dry before I
could<00:04:31.650> put<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:31.889> back<00:04:32.009> on<00:04:32.310> because<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.419> wanted<00:04:33.780> to

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
could put it back on because I wanted to

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.110 
could put it back on because I wanted to
use<00:04:33.960> my<00:04:34.199> hot<00:04:34.379> glue<00:04:34.590> gun<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:35.099> so<00:04:35.729> I<00:04:35.759> just<00:04:35.940> stuck

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
use my hot glue gun and so I just stuck

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.390 
use my hot glue gun and so I just stuck
him<00:04:36.270> in<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.479> oven<00:04:36.840> about<00:04:36.990> 250<00:04:37.830> degrees<00:04:37.949> for

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
him in the oven about 250 degrees for

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.219 
him in the oven about 250 degrees for
maybe<00:04:38.610> half<00:04:38.879> an<00:04:39.030> hour<00:04:39.180> just<00:04:39.509> just<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.960> get<00:04:40.110> it

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
maybe half an hour just just to get it

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.379 
maybe half an hour just just to get it
dry<00:04:40.470> enough<00:04:40.830> so<00:04:40.889> that<00:04:41.099> it<00:04:41.370> wouldn't<00:04:41.580> there

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
dry enough so that it wouldn't there

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.520 
dry enough so that it wouldn't there
wouldn't<00:04:42.629> be<00:04:42.690> so<00:04:42.900> wet<00:04:43.139> that<00:04:43.319> it<00:04:43.409> would

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
wouldn't be so wet that it would

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.619 
wouldn't be so wet that it would
interfere<00:04:43.770> with<00:04:44.009> the<00:04:44.310> hot<00:04:44.460> glue<00:04:44.669> I<00:04:45.000> put<00:04:45.509> them

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
interfere with the hot glue I put them

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.279 
interfere with the hot glue I put them
back<00:04:45.750> on<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.020> covered<00:04:46.919> up<00:04:47.099> the<00:04:47.310> top<00:04:47.879> just<00:04:48.780> with

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
back on and covered up the top just with

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.050 
back on and covered up the top just with
with<00:04:49.620> more<00:04:49.800> paper<00:04:50.039> mache<00:04:50.430> just<00:04:50.699> to<00:04:50.789> kind<00:04:50.970> of

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
with more paper mache just to kind of

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.200 
with more paper mache just to kind of
get<00:04:51.180> it<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.419> blend<00:04:51.659> in<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.199> I<00:04:53.130> think<00:04:53.190> that<00:04:54.000> the

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
get it to blend in and I think that the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.120 
get it to blend in and I think that the
hand<00:04:54.509> and<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.139> feet<00:04:55.319> that<00:04:55.470> I've<00:04:55.590> gotten<00:04:55.889> done

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
hand and the feet that I've gotten done

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.610 
hand and the feet that I've gotten done
so<00:04:56.430> far<00:04:56.699> working<00:04:57.240> off<00:04:57.449> a<00:04:57.479> lot<00:04:57.810> better<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.289> still

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
so far working off a lot better I still

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.860 
so far working off a lot better I still
haven't<00:04:58.889> done<00:04:59.039> these<00:04:59.280> ones<00:04:59.520> on<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.789> back<00:05:00.030> but

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
haven't done these ones on the back but

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.140 
haven't done these ones on the back but
I<00:05:00.900> am<00:05:01.169> going<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:01.740> take<00:05:01.949> them<00:05:02.130> apart<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.759> do

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
I am going to take them apart and do

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.640 
I am going to take them apart and do
them<00:05:03.330> over<00:05:03.479> even<00:05:03.960> though<00:05:04.080> it<00:05:04.169> takes<00:05:04.349> a<00:05:04.470> long

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
them over even though it takes a long

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.070 
them over even though it takes a long
time<00:05:04.919> I'm<00:05:05.909> going<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:06.120> do<00:05:06.300> it<00:05:06.419> anyway<00:05:06.720> because<00:05:06.750> I

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
time I'm going to do it anyway because I

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.510 
time I'm going to do it anyway because I
think<00:05:07.440> they<00:05:07.560> came<00:05:07.740> out<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:07.979> lot<00:05:08.220> better<00:05:08.430> than

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
think they came out a lot better than

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.200 
think they came out a lot better than
they<00:05:08.789> did<00:05:08.849> before<00:05:09.090> so<00:05:09.960> I'm<00:05:10.319> trying<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.650> say

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
they did before so I'm trying to say

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.330 
they did before so I'm trying to say
ignore<00:05:12.210> what<00:05:12.539> I<00:05:12.569> told<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:13.020> in<00:05:13.169> my<00:05:13.199> last<00:05:13.500> book

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
ignore what I told you in my last book

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.700 
ignore what I told you in my last book
and<00:05:14.520> do<00:05:14.639> it<00:05:14.759> this<00:05:14.909> way<00:05:15.150> instead

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
and do it this way instead

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.559 
and do it this way instead
now<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:16.740> also<00:05:17.099> did<00:05:17.370> some<00:05:17.550> experiments<00:05:18.210> with<00:05:18.419> the

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
now I also did some experiments with the

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.689 
now I also did some experiments with the
paste<00:05:18.870> I<00:05:19.169> like<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.710> said<00:05:19.770> I<00:05:19.919> wanted<00:05:20.280> to<00:05:20.370> find<00:05:20.610> a

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
paste I like I said I wanted to find a

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.490 
paste I like I said I wanted to find a
paste<00:05:20.940> that<00:05:21.090> didn't<00:05:21.539> use<00:05:21.780> Elmer's<00:05:22.199> glue

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
paste that didn't use Elmer's glue

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.680 
paste that didn't use Elmer's glue
because<00:05:22.830> it's<00:05:22.949> kind<00:05:23.129> of<00:05:23.190> expensive<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.659> I

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
because it's kind of expensive and so I

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.800 
because it's kind of expensive and so I
tried<00:05:25.229> one<00:05:25.620> that<00:05:26.310> I<00:05:26.340> found<00:05:26.759> online<00:05:27.000> came<00:05:27.599> very

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
tried one that I found online came very

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.809 
tried one that I found online came very
highly<00:05:27.960> recommended<00:05:28.259> by<00:05:28.979> someone<00:05:29.370> who<00:05:29.550> uses

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
highly recommended by someone who uses

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.480 
highly recommended by someone who uses
it<00:05:30.000> with<00:05:30.360> newspaper<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.289> I'm<00:05:31.830> sure<00:05:32.190> it<00:05:32.340> would

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
it with newspaper and I'm sure it would

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.339 
it with newspaper and I'm sure it would
work<00:05:32.699> really<00:05:32.849> well<00:05:33.030> for<00:05:33.389> that<00:05:33.539> purpose<00:05:33.960> but

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
work really well for that purpose but

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.980 
work really well for that purpose but
with<00:05:34.500> blue<00:05:34.830> shop<00:05:35.130> towels<00:05:35.159> it<00:05:36.120> really<00:05:36.659> doesn't

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
with blue shop towels it really doesn't

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.439 
with blue shop towels it really doesn't
work<00:05:37.020> at<00:05:37.319> all<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:37.979> I<00:05:38.580> didn't<00:05:38.880> know<00:05:39.029> that<00:05:39.060> of

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
work at all and I didn't know that of

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.110 
work at all and I didn't know that of
course<00:05:39.659> until<00:05:40.229> I<00:05:40.529> had<00:05:40.800> covered<00:05:41.159> the<00:05:41.550> entire

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
course until I had covered the entire

course until I had covered the entire
raccoon<00:05:43.020> almost<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:44.370> then<00:05:44.639> let<00:05:44.849> it<00:05:44.880> dry

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
raccoon almost and then let it dry

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.089 
raccoon almost and then let it dry
overnight<00:05:45.539> that<00:05:45.960> was<00:05:46.110> when<00:05:46.289> I<00:05:46.319> found<00:05:46.590> out<00:05:46.860> that

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
overnight that was when I found out that

overnight that was when I found out that
there<00:05:47.639> was<00:05:47.789> a<00:05:47.819> real<00:05:48.180> problem<00:05:48.389> with<00:05:48.750> it<00:05:48.930> it<00:05:49.650> was

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830

a<00:05:49.860> weak<00:05:50.759> paste<00:05:51.090> that<00:05:51.449> was<00:05:51.569> cooked<00:05:51.930> with<00:05:52.289> a<00:05:52.349> very

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
a weak paste that was cooked with a very

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.570 
a weak paste that was cooked with a very
small<00:05:53.159> amount<00:05:53.340> of<00:05:54.080> all-purpose<00:05:55.080> flour<00:05:55.430> in<00:05:56.430> it

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
small amount of all-purpose flour in it

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.339 
small amount of all-purpose flour in it
there<00:05:57.000> was<00:05:57.090> a<00:05:57.120> lot<00:05:57.360> of<00:05:57.389> water<00:05:57.690> and<00:05:57.900> very<00:05:58.080> little

there was a lot of water and very little

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:01.850 
there was a lot of water and very little
flour<00:05:58.729> what<00:05:59.729> happened<00:06:00.180> was<00:06:00.389> it<00:06:00.810> got<00:06:00.990> dry<00:06:01.380> and

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
flour what happened was it got dry and

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.370 
flour what happened was it got dry and
it<00:06:02.159> stuck<00:06:02.490> everything<00:06:02.759> together<00:06:03.080> but<00:06:04.080> it<00:06:04.229> was

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
it stuck everything together but it was

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.430 
it stuck everything together but it was
still<00:06:04.650> soft<00:06:05.069> and<00:06:05.340> squishy

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
still soft and squishy

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.749 
still soft and squishy
just<00:06:07.440> like<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:07.740> towels<00:06:08.069> I<00:06:08.370> mean<00:06:08.520> it<00:06:08.610> really

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
just like the towels I mean it really

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.790 
just like the towels I mean it really
didn't<00:06:09.150> feel<00:06:09.360> much<00:06:09.539> different<00:06:10.050> from<00:06:10.289> just<00:06:10.680> a

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
didn't feel much different from just a

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.939 
didn't feel much different from just a
plain<00:06:11.039> old<00:06:11.069> dry<00:06:11.460> towel<00:06:12.020> so<00:06:13.020> obviously<00:06:13.680> that

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
plain old dry towel so obviously that

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.709 
plain old dry towel so obviously that
isn't<00:06:14.130> going<00:06:14.340> to<00:06:14.400> work<00:06:14.460> for<00:06:14.580> paper<00:06:14.940> mache<00:06:15.389> it's

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
isn't going to work for paper mache it's

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.420 
isn't going to work for paper mache it's
just<00:06:15.930> you<00:06:16.169> need<00:06:16.440> a<00:06:16.500> hard<00:06:16.889> shell<00:06:17.130> and<00:06:17.400> that

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
just you need a hard shell and that

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.689 
just you need a hard shell and that
didn't<00:06:17.849> do<00:06:17.940> it<00:06:18.090> so<00:06:18.840> I<00:06:18.900> made<00:06:19.380> up<00:06:19.409> this<00:06:19.620> pace<00:06:20.460> that

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
didn't do it so I made up this pace that

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.399 
didn't do it so I made up this pace that
I've<00:06:20.819> been<00:06:20.969> wanting<00:06:21.330> to<00:06:21.360> try<00:06:21.630> for<00:06:21.930> a<00:06:21.960> long<00:06:22.139> time

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
I've been wanting to try for a long time

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:26.930 
I've been wanting to try for a long time
it's<00:06:22.800> made<00:06:23.190> out<00:06:23.550> of<00:06:25.250> cornstarch<00:06:26.250> or<00:06:26.729> vinegar

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
really really liked it but it did not

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.990 
really really liked it but it did not
work<00:06:36.569> exactly<00:06:37.319> as<00:06:37.740> the<00:06:37.889> recipe<00:06:38.280> shows<00:06:38.729> that

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
work exactly as the recipe shows that

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.529 
work exactly as the recipe shows that
they<00:06:39.599> asked<00:06:40.139> for<00:06:40.199> two<00:06:40.949> cups<00:06:41.789> of<00:06:41.940> water<00:06:42.210> in

water<00:06:50.490> and<00:06:50.849> I<00:06:50.970> just<00:06:51.389> had<00:06:51.509> two<00:06:51.720> cups<00:06:51.990> of<00:06:52.110> water

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169 
water and I just had two cups of water

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:55.070 
water and I just had two cups of water
in<00:06:52.530> here<00:06:52.830> it<00:06:53.129> was<00:06:53.550> so<00:06:53.789> thick<00:06:54.240> that<00:06:54.629> just<00:06:54.930> kind

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
in here it was so thick that just kind

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.930 
in here it was so thick that just kind
of<00:06:55.139> gobbed<00:06:55.409> on<00:06:55.740> you<00:06:56.069> know<00:06:56.190> just<00:06:56.430> it<00:06:56.669> didn't

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
of gobbed on you know just it didn't

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.920 
of gobbed on you know just it didn't
really<00:06:57.680> go<00:06:58.680> on<00:06:58.889> smoothly<00:06:59.370> and<00:06:59.759> it<00:07:00.210> also<00:07:00.389> didn't

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
really go on smoothly and it also didn't

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.029 
really go on smoothly and it also didn't
absorb<00:07:01.470> into<00:07:01.889> the<00:07:02.190> to<00:07:03.120> the<00:07:03.150> paper<00:07:03.830> you'd<00:07:04.830> put

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 
absorb into the to the paper you'd put

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:08.180 
absorb into the to the paper you'd put
it<00:07:05.130> on<00:07:05.280> here<00:07:05.580> and<00:07:05.819> the<00:07:06.060> the<00:07:06.509> side<00:07:07.050> close<00:07:07.680> to<00:07:08.009> the

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
it on here and the the side close to the

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.480 
it on here and the the side close to the
raccoon<00:07:08.849> would<00:07:09.479> stick<00:07:09.840> on<00:07:10.080> but<00:07:10.770> then<00:07:10.949> the<00:07:11.159> top

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490 
raccoon would stick on but then the top

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.899 
raccoon would stick on but then the top
layer<00:07:11.880> of<00:07:11.909> the<00:07:12.300> paper<00:07:12.949> would<00:07:13.949> peel<00:07:14.250> off<00:07:14.520> and<00:07:14.789> it

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:14.909 
layer of the paper would peel off and it

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:16.430 
layer of the paper would peel off and it
would<00:07:14.970> delaminate<00:07:15.810> right<00:07:16.020> when<00:07:16.169> you<00:07:16.289> were

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 
would delaminate right when you were

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.350 
would delaminate right when you were
trying<00:07:16.620> to<00:07:16.800> work<00:07:17.009> on<00:07:17.220> it<00:07:17.370> it<00:07:17.729> just<00:07:18.000> it<00:07:18.180> wasn't

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
trying to work on it it just it wasn't

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.040 
trying to work on it it just it wasn't
it<00:07:19.080> wasn't<00:07:19.500> working<00:07:19.710> as<00:07:20.300> the<00:07:21.300> recipe<00:07:21.659> shows

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
it wasn't working as the recipe shows

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.620 
it wasn't working as the recipe shows
but<00:07:22.979> when<00:07:23.130> you<00:07:23.219> add<00:07:23.370> that<00:07:23.400> extra<00:07:23.849> cup<00:07:24.210> of<00:07:24.389> water

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630 
but when you add that extra cup of water

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.959 
but when you add that extra cup of water
it<00:07:24.930> worked<00:07:25.169> really<00:07:25.590> well<00:07:25.740> it's<00:07:26.400> dry<00:07:26.639> now<00:07:26.669> and

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:26.969 
it worked really well it's dry now and

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:29.570 
it worked really well it's dry now and
it's<00:07:27.270> really<00:07:27.449> hard<00:07:27.810> it's<00:07:28.680> nice<00:07:28.979> and<00:07:29.250> smooth

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580 
it's really hard it's nice and smooth

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.899 
it's really hard it's nice and smooth
that<00:07:30.120> for<00:07:30.750> some<00:07:30.930> reason<00:07:31.319> this<00:07:31.530> paste<00:07:31.919> really

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:32.909 
that for some reason this paste really

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:37.279 
that for some reason this paste really
helps<00:07:33.419> to<00:07:34.759> to<00:07:35.759> get<00:07:35.940> the<00:07:36.090> edges<00:07:36.569> feathered<00:07:37.110> in

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:37.289 
helps to to get the edges feathered in

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:38.540 
helps to to get the edges feathered in
together<00:07:37.650> really<00:07:37.949> nicely

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:38.550 
together really nicely

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.020 
together really nicely
so<00:07:39.090> it's<00:07:39.539> a<00:07:39.690> very<00:07:39.900> smooth<00:07:40.380> surface<00:07:40.560> I<00:07:41.159> really

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.030 
so it's a very smooth surface I really

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.909 
so it's a very smooth surface I really
like<00:07:42.240> that<00:07:42.449> I<00:07:42.659> think<00:07:43.080> that<00:07:43.259> this<00:07:43.440> is<00:07:43.590> going<00:07:43.800> to

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 
like that I think that this is going to

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:47.269 
like that I think that this is going to
be<00:07:44.039> a<00:07:44.069> really<00:07:44.580> nice<00:07:44.819> paste<00:07:45.240> to<00:07:45.539> use<00:07:45.750> with<00:07:46.279> blue

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:47.279 
be a really nice paste to use with blue

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:50.300 
be a really nice paste to use with blue

shop towels now in my next video I'm
really<00:07:50.639> hoping<00:07:50.969> that<00:07:51.029> I<00:07:51.180> can<00:07:51.300> get<00:07:51.569> this<00:07:51.719> guy

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:51.930 
really hoping that I can get this guy

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.990 
really hoping that I can get this guy
completely<00:07:52.409> finished<00:07:53.130> there's<00:07:53.729> going<00:07:53.849> to<00:07:53.909> be

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 
completely finished there's going to be

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.510 
completely finished there's going to be
another<00:07:54.270> experiment<00:07:55.199> with<00:07:55.380> the<00:07:55.650> with<00:07:56.490> a

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 
another experiment with the with a

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.550 
another experiment with the with a
tissue<00:07:56.819> paper<00:07:57.060> for<00:07:57.599> I'm<00:07:57.810> really<00:07:58.110> hoping<00:07:58.380> that

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 
tissue paper for I'm really hoping that

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.350 
tissue paper for I'm really hoping that
works<00:07:58.770> but<00:07:59.460> if<00:07:59.580> it<00:07:59.699> doesn't<00:07:59.909> we<00:08:00.120> can<00:08:00.270> always

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 
works but if it doesn't we can always

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.309 
works but if it doesn't we can always
try<00:08:00.690> something<00:08:00.719> else

00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 
try something else

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:04.370 
try something else
