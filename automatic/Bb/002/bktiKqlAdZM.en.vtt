mode but i thought i would show it to
you<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:28.800> if<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.099> useful<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.789> let's<00:00:29.939> take

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
you and see if it's useful so let's take

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.160 
you and see if it's useful so let's take
a<00:00:30.119> look<00:00:30.330> at<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:31.730> okay<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:32.790> here's<00:00:33.600> what<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
a look at it okay so here's what the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.290 
a look at it okay so here's what the
tool<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.559> basically<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.340> called<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.880> poor

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
tool is basically it's called a poor

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.959 
tool is basically it's called a poor
man's<00:00:36.510> grease<00:00:36.930> pencil<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:38.010> grease<00:00:38.460> pencil<00:00:38.610> is

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
man's grease pencil a grease pencil is

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.000 
man's grease pencil a grease pencil is
what<00:00:39.270> was<00:00:39.450> used<00:00:39.719> initially<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.620> write<00:00:40.860> on

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
what was used initially to write on

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.709 
what was used initially to write on
glass<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.730> kind<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.000> harkens<00:00:42.270> back<00:00:42.510> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
glass so it's kind of harkens back to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.450 
glass so it's kind of harkens back to
that<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.739> do<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.040> bring<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.370> up

that but what you do is you bring it up
and<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.850> get<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.180> little<00:00:45.390> window<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
and you get this little window here and

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.619 
and you get this little window here and
inside<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> window<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.149> see<00:00:48.210> there's<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
inside the window you can see there's a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.580 
inside the window you can see there's a
bunch<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.870> different<00:00:48.960> cameras<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.559> can

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
bunch of different cameras you can

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.350 
bunch of different cameras you can
choose<00:00:49.980> from<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.640> lets<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.120> is

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
choose from what this lets you do is

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.779 
choose from what this lets you do is
draw<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.989> any<00:00:52.500> particular<00:00:52.710> camera<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.610> right

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
draw in any particular camera so right

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.000 
draw in any particular camera so right
now<00:00:53.820> let's<00:00:54.180> put<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.449> perspective<00:00:54.860> I'm<00:00:55.860> just

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
now let's put it on perspective I'm just

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.470 
now let's put it on perspective I'm just
going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> tumble<00:00:56.550> my<00:00:56.699> view<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> little<00:00:57.149> bit<00:00:57.270> and

click the plus button again now you'll
notice<00:01:34.380> I've<00:01:34.619> got<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> one<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.340> A<00:01:35.640> six<00:01:35.670> here

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
notice I've got a one and A six here

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.679 
notice I've got a one and A six here
when<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.750> go<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.930> frame<00:01:37.229> six<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.180> previous

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
when I go to frame six the the previous

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.749 
when I go to frame six the the previous
drawing<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.140> had<00:01:40.439> ends<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.430> being<00:01:41.670> great

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
drawing that I had ends up being great

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.179 
drawing that I had ends up being great
out<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> little<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.570> basically<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.530> does<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> one

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
out a little bit basically it does a one

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.219 
out a little bit basically it does a one
frame<00:01:44.430> back<00:01:44.640> ghosting<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.390> I'll<00:01:45.479> draw<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> new

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
frame back ghosting so I'll draw a new

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.120 
frame back ghosting so I'll draw a new
frame<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:47.670> frame<00:01:47.820> six<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:49.680> maybe<00:01:49.860> I'll<00:01:50.009> just

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
frame for frame six and maybe I'll just

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.850 
frame for frame six and maybe I'll just
sort<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.490> go<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.960> if<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.439> scrub<00:01:52.680> back

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
sort of go like that and if I scrub back

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.100 
sort of go like that and if I scrub back
and<00:01:53.070> forth<00:01:53.310> between<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.880> two<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:54.840> see

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
and forth between the two you can see

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.100 
and forth between the two you can see
that<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.860> will<00:01:56.189> switch<00:01:56.909> frame<00:01:57.329> 62<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> new

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that it will switch frame 62 the new

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.590 
that it will switch frame 62 the new
drawing<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.130> then<00:01:59.399> maybe<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.790> go<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.000> frame<00:02:00.270> 10

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
drawing so then maybe we go to frame 10

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.730 
drawing so then maybe we go to frame 10
and<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.229> add<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> new<00:02:01.710> frame<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:03.409> maybe<00:02:04.409> that'll

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and I add a new frame and maybe that'll

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.170 
and I add a new frame and maybe that'll
be<00:02:04.860> my<00:02:05.040> stretched<00:02:05.399> out<00:02:05.640> one<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.030> I'll<00:02:06.119> just

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
be my stretched out one so I'll just

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.430 
be my stretched out one so I'll just
roughly<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:07.409> something<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:09.440> then

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
roughly do something like this and then

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.640 
roughly do something like this and then
go<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.679> frame<00:02:11.009> 13<00:02:11.610> add<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.629> new<00:02:12.870> frame

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
go to frame 13 add a new frame

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.500 
go to frame 13 add a new frame
and<00:02:14.400> we'll<00:02:14.610> maybe<00:02:15.060> place<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.569> up<00:02:15.689> here<00:02:15.829> and<00:02:17.510> do

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
and we'll maybe place it up here and do

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.100 
and we'll maybe place it up here and do
that<00:02:18.780> who<00:02:19.379> knows<00:02:19.590> say<00:02:20.430> frame<00:02:20.670> 16<00:02:21.209> add<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.870> new

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
that who knows say frame 16 add a new

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.750 
that who knows say frame 16 add a new
frame<00:02:22.459> let's<00:02:23.459> move<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.790> over<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.150> tiny<00:02:24.360> bit

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
frame let's move this over a tiny bit

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.839 
frame let's move this over a tiny bit
just<00:02:26.760> leave<00:02:26.909> my<00:02:27.030> pre-contact<00:02:27.720> frame<00:02:28.849> like

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
just leave my pre-contact frame like

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.020 
just leave my pre-contact frame like
that<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.390> then<00:02:31.079> say<00:02:31.290> frame<00:02:31.620> 19<00:02:32.189> add<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.760> new

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
that and then say frame 19 add a new

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.330 
that and then say frame 19 add a new
frame<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:36.060> will<00:02:36.209> be<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:37.430> landing<00:02:40.340> like

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
frame and that will be a landing like

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.380 
frame and that will be a landing like
this<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.849> then<00:02:42.150> frame<00:02:42.540> 21<00:02:43.489> will<00:02:44.489> be<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.670> settle

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
this and then frame 21 will be a settle

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.690 
this and then frame 21 will be a settle
up<00:02:45.659> into<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> default<00:02:47.099> pose<00:02:48.200> okay<00:02:49.340> so<00:02:50.340> if<00:02:50.549> we

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
up into a default pose okay so if we

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.729 
up into a default pose okay so if we
scrub<00:02:51.030> through<00:02:51.239> our<00:02:51.389> timeline<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.409> can<00:02:52.440> see

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
scrub through our timeline you can see

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.740 
scrub through our timeline you can see
we<00:02:52.920> had<00:02:53.099> this<00:02:53.310> animation<00:02:53.760> we<00:02:54.299> can<00:02:54.420> even<00:02:54.540> hit

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
we had this animation we can even hit

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.460 
we had this animation we can even hit
play<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.319> play<00:02:56.129> it<00:02:56.280> back<00:02:56.340> if<00:02:56.940> we<00:02:57.120> want<00:02:57.470> now

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
play and play it back if we want now

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.589 
play and play it back if we want now
what<00:02:58.650> we<00:02:58.769> can<00:02:58.950> do<00:02:59.129> is<00:02:59.400> we're<00:02:59.939> not<00:03:00.090> just<00:03:00.299> stuck

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
what we can do is we're not just stuck

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.330 
what we can do is we're not just stuck
directly<00:03:00.989> in<00:03:01.109> this<00:03:01.260> time<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.709> can<00:03:01.859> see<00:03:02.069> over

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
directly in this time you can see over

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.500 
directly in this time you can see over
here<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.609> the<00:03:02.670> list<00:03:02.849> I've<00:03:03.000> got<00:03:03.150> all<00:03:03.329> these

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
here in the list I've got all these

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.559 
here in the list I've got all these
different<00:03:03.780> times<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:05.069> represent<00:03:05.970> how<00:03:06.359> long

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
different times that represent how long

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.229 
different times that represent how long
my<00:03:06.720> animation<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.489> what<00:03:08.489> i<00:03:08.519> can<00:03:08.700> do<00:03:08.849> is<00:03:08.879> go<00:03:09.180> to

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
my animation is what i can do is go to

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.539 
my animation is what i can do is go to
any<00:03:09.629> one<00:03:09.840> of<00:03:09.870> these<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.290> say<00:03:10.470> i<00:03:10.769> want<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.400> have

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
any one of these and say i want to have

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.509 
any one of these and say i want to have
more<00:03:11.790> hang<00:03:12.060> time<00:03:12.090> up<00:03:13.010> when<00:03:14.010> he's<00:03:14.129> up<00:03:14.280> in<00:03:14.370> this

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
more hang time up when he's up in this

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.390 
more hang time up when he's up in this
position<00:03:14.939> so<00:03:15.599> i'll<00:03:15.989> go<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.319> frame<00:03:16.530> 16<00:03:17.069> and<00:03:17.310> i'll

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
position so i'll go to frame 16 and i'll

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.430 
position so i'll go to frame 16 and i'll
just<00:03:17.519> hit<00:03:17.699> the<00:03:17.879> down<00:03:18.120> button<00:03:18.449> and<00:03:18.750> what<00:03:19.290> that

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
just hit the down button and what that

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.400 
just hit the down button and what that
will<00:03:19.530> do<00:03:19.709> is<00:03:19.739> push<00:03:20.370> all<00:03:20.609> my<00:03:20.669> other<00:03:21.030> time

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
will do is push all my other time

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.280 
will do is push all my other time
further<00:03:22.410> down<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:24.209> now<00:03:24.389> he<00:03:24.449> actually<00:03:24.870> hangs

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
further down so now he actually hangs

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.729 
further down so now he actually hangs
quite<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> bit<00:03:25.829> longer<00:03:26.069> up<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.639> there<00:03:27.049> okay<00:03:28.049> what

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
quite a bit longer up in there okay what

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.530 
quite a bit longer up in there okay what
you<00:03:28.829> can<00:03:28.949> also<00:03:29.069> do<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.669> say<00:03:29.970> no<00:03:30.000> that's<00:03:30.329> too

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
you can also do is say no that's too

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.030 
you can also do is say no that's too
much<00:03:30.569> so<00:03:30.900> I'm<00:03:30.959> going<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.139> hit<00:03:31.260> up<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.680> I'm

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
much so I'm going to hit up and I'm

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.289 
much so I'm going to hit up and I'm
going<00:03:32.159> to<00:03:32.220> move<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.430> up<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.669> little<00:03:32.790> bit<00:03:32.909> so<00:03:33.209> it

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
going to move it up a little bit so it

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.680 
going to move it up a little bit so it

what<00:04:27.730> i<00:04:27.760> can<00:04:27.970> do<00:04:28.120> is<00:04:28.150> start<00:04:28.510> planning<00:04:28.990> out<00:04:29.140> the

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
what i can do is start planning out the

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.770 
what i can do is start planning out the
path<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:30.010> action<00:04:30.190> for<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.730> ball<00:04:30.940> so<00:04:31.510> again

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
path of action for that ball so again

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.860 
path of action for that ball so again
i'm<00:04:31.990> going<00:04:32.050> to<00:04:32.170> use<00:04:32.500> i'm<00:04:33.280> going<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.490> go<00:04:33.670> and<00:04:33.970> hit

the youth draw tool here to get that and

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.410 
the youth draw tool here to get that and
i'll<00:04:41.260> just<00:04:41.470> draw<00:04:42.250> a<00:04:42.280> path<00:04:42.640> for<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.030> bouncing

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
i'll just draw a path for a bouncing

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.500 
i'll just draw a path for a bouncing
ball<00:04:43.570> so<00:04:44.500> it's<00:04:44.650> going<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.830> do<00:04:44.920> this<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.510> do

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
ball so it's going to do this and do

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.710 
ball so it's going to do this and do
that<00:04:46.540> and<00:04:47.670> that's<00:04:48.670> the<00:04:48.910> path<00:04:49.090> i<00:04:49.270> want<00:04:49.450> to<00:04:49.540> use

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
that and that's the path i want to use

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.620 
that and that's the path i want to use
if<00:04:49.960> i<00:04:50.560> click<00:04:50.800> on<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:51.040> extras<00:04:51.550> tab<00:04:51.820> it<00:04:52.090> has

if i click on the extras tab it has

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.990 
if i click on the extras tab it has
something<00:04:52.990> here<00:04:53.140> called<00:04:53.320> stored<00:04:53.800> frames<00:04:54.220> what

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
something here called stored frames what

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.450 
something here called stored frames what
that<00:04:55.180> means<00:04:55.420> is<00:04:55.720> is<00:04:55.990> that<00:04:56.740> i<00:04:56.800> can<00:04:57.010> take<00:04:57.220> any

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
that means is is that i can take any

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.070 
that means is is that i can take any
frame<00:04:57.790> that<00:04:57.940> I've<00:04:58.030> drawn<00:04:58.240> up<00:04:58.270> here<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:58.840> kind

frame that I've drawn up here and kind

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.020 
frame that I've drawn up here and kind
of<00:04:59.170> save<00:04:59.440> that<00:04:59.710> i'm<00:05:00.070> going<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.280> call<00:05:00.460> it<00:05:00.490> path

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.900 

store<00:05:04.030> it<00:05:04.150> and<00:05:04.330> now<00:05:05.290> that<00:05:05.320> path<00:05:05.980> is<00:05:06.280> stored

store it and now that path is stored

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.070 
store it and now that path is stored
right<00:05:07.090> here<00:05:07.390> which<00:05:07.570> means<00:05:07.750> that<00:05:07.990> i<00:05:08.050> can

using<00:05:32.800> this<00:05:33.160> path<00:05:33.460> to<00:05:33.790> sort<00:05:34.030> of<00:05:34.090> work<00:05:34.300> out<00:05:34.510> the

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
using this path to sort of work out the

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.590 
using this path to sort of work out the
path<00:05:34.930> of<00:05:35.170> my<00:05:35.350> animation<00:05:35.980> so<00:05:36.610> i<00:05:36.640> know<00:05:37.030> that<00:05:37.180> if

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
path of my animation so i know that if

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.810 
path of my animation so i know that if
frame<00:05:38.470> 9<00:05:38.770> is<00:05:38.980> my<00:05:39.100> contact<00:05:39.580> frame<00:05:39.850> frame<00:05:40.570> 7<00:05:41.080> or

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
frame 9 is my contact frame frame 7 or

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.980 
frame 9 is my contact frame frame 7 or
frame<00:05:42.820> nine<00:05:43.000> sorry<00:05:43.240> as<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.450> squash<00:05:43.720> frame

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
frame nine sorry as the squash frame

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.620 
frame nine sorry as the squash frame
frame<00:05:44.740> seven<00:05:45.130> maybe<00:05:45.280> I<00:05:45.370> want<00:05:45.640> that<00:05:45.820> may<00:05:46.570> be

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
frame seven maybe I want that may be

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.020 
frame seven maybe I want that may be
framed<00:05:47.050> for<00:05:47.170> i'll<00:05:47.710> insert<00:05:48.160> a<00:05:48.220> frame<00:05:48.550> it'll<00:05:48.940> be

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
framed for i'll insert a frame it'll be

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.080 
framed for i'll insert a frame it'll be
like<00:05:49.180> this<00:05:49.390> and<00:05:50.490> so<00:05:51.490> you<00:05:51.580> can<00:05:51.700> start<00:05:51.880> working

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
like this and so you can start working

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.600 
like this and so you can start working
out<00:05:52.330> your<00:05:52.420> animation<00:05:52.960> along<00:05:53.320> that<00:05:53.560> path<00:05:53.830> then

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
out your animation along that path then

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.370 
out your animation along that path then
if<00:05:54.730> i<00:05:54.850> want<00:05:55.060> i<00:05:55.240> can<00:05:55.300> turn<00:05:55.930> off<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.230> visibility

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
if i want i can turn off the visibility

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.680 
if i want i can turn off the visibility
of<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:56.860> path<00:05:57.070> completely<00:05:57.640> so<00:05:58.390> i<00:05:58.420> don't<00:05:58.630> have

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
of the path completely so i don't have

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.110 
of the path completely so i don't have
to<00:05:58.840> see<00:05:59.140> it<00:05:59.170> i<00:05:59.440> can<00:05:59.890> turn<00:06:00.010> it<00:06:00.160> back<00:06:00.280> on<00:06:00.460> i<00:06:00.730> can

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
to see it i can turn it back on i can

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.720 
to see it i can turn it back on i can
even<00:06:01.240> select<00:06:01.540> it<00:06:01.900> go<00:06:02.740> to<00:06:02.800> my<00:06:02.980> move<00:06:03.190> tool<00:06:03.490> and

even select it go to my move tool and

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.240 
even select it go to my move tool and
move<00:06:03.820> the<00:06:04.660> path<00:06:04.840> around<00:06:05.080> if<00:06:05.380> i<00:06:05.500> want<00:06:05.740> i<00:06:05.920> can

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
move the path around if i want i can

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.860 
move the path around if i want i can
scale<00:06:06.730> it<00:06:08.250> in<00:06:09.250> a<00:06:09.370> particular<00:06:09.790> direction
