resilient<00:00:28.259> a<00:00:28.560> farm<00:00:28.950> is<00:00:29.099> out<00:00:29.250> here<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.730> think<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
resilient a farm is out here I think the

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.450 
resilient a farm is out here I think the
Pyro's<00:00:30.989> tattered<00:00:31.559> to<00:00:31.649> be<00:00:31.770> one<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.250> very

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
Pyro's tattered to be one of the very

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.210 
Pyro's tattered to be one of the very
few<00:00:32.759> unregulated<00:00:33.300> rivers<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.500> Australia

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
few unregulated rivers and in Australia

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.040 
few unregulated rivers and in Australia
on<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> continent<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.210> big<00:00:36.420> river<00:00:36.630> so

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
on the continent it's a big river so

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.930 
on the continent it's a big river so
therefore<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:37.890> pretty<00:00:38.190> important<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.760> terms

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
therefore it's pretty important in terms

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.970 
therefore it's pretty important in terms
of<00:00:39.149> wetlands<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:40.020> also<00:00:40.260> important<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
of wetlands it's also important to the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.470 
of wetlands it's also important to the
grazing<00:00:41.190> communities<00:00:41.880> because<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
grazing communities because of the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.540 
grazing communities because of the
nutrients<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.260> sediments<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:43.949> come<00:00:44.250> down

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
nutrients and sediments that come down

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.329 
nutrients and sediments that come down
it<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.449> a<00:00:45.480> lovely<00:00:45.690> place<00:00:45.839> to<00:00:46.050> go<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:47.039> good

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
it is a lovely place to go to in good

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.759 
it is a lovely place to go to in good
times<00:00:47.609> and<00:00:47.789> bad<00:00:47.879> times<00:00:48.109> it's<00:00:49.109> good<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.530> see<00:00:49.710> it

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
times and bad times it's good to see it

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.590 
times and bad times it's good to see it
when<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.100> good<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.519> a<00:00:50.550> lake<00:00:50.789> full<00:00:51.030> now<00:00:51.269> and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
when it's good with a lake full now and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.029 
when it's good with a lake full now and
it's<00:00:51.899> good<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.079> see<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.379> when<00:00:52.559> there's<00:00:52.710> nothing

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it's good to see it when there's nothing

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.729 
it's good to see it when there's nothing
there<00:00:53.249> and<00:00:53.519> it's<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.210> bare<00:00:54.390> as<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.690> road<00:00:54.870> in

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
there and it's as bare as the road in

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.410 
there and it's as bare as the road in
the<00:00:56.159> long<00:00:56.339> run<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.730> will<00:00:56.909> be<00:00:57.030> good<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the long run that will be good for the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.279 
the long run that will be good for the
town<00:00:57.659> I<00:00:58.850> think<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.269> establishment<00:01:00.719> phase

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
town I think in the establishment phase

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.770 
town I think in the establishment phase
of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> park<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.190> lot<00:01:02.819> of<00:01:02.850> consultation<00:01:03.629> was

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
of the park a lot of consultation was

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.530 
of the park a lot of consultation was
done<00:01:04.050> with<00:01:04.379> particularly<00:01:05.070> with<00:01:05.159> pastoris<00:01:05.700> so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
done with particularly with pastoris so

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.110 
done with particularly with pastoris so
they<00:01:06.780> basically<00:01:07.430> demystified<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.460> process

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
they basically demystified the process

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.649 
they basically demystified the process
and<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.510> wasn't<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.960> strange<00:01:10.500> set<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.659> green

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
and it wasn't this strange set of green

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.330 
and it wasn't this strange set of green
people<00:01:13.020> coming<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.680> doing<00:01:14.040> strange<00:01:14.520> things

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
people coming in doing strange things

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.950 
people coming in doing strange things
we've<00:01:17.340> been<00:01:17.550> really<00:01:17.760> fortunate<00:01:17.880> with<00:01:18.630> good

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
we've been really fortunate with good

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.680 
we've been really fortunate with good
neighbor<00:01:19.140> relations<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.040> cooperation<00:01:20.880> with

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
neighbor relations and cooperation with

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.960 
neighbor relations and cooperation with
boundary<00:01:22.230> fencing<00:01:22.770> goat<00:01:23.190> management<00:01:23.790> all

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
boundary fencing goat management all

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.610 
boundary fencing goat management all
that<00:01:24.300> sort<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.570> stuff<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:25.050> think<00:01:25.260> it's<00:01:25.530> because

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
that sort of stuff I think it's because

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.680 
that sort of stuff I think it's because
we<00:01:25.920> keep<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.250> information<00:01:26.550> flow<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.330> that

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
we keep that information flow going that

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.140 
we keep that information flow going that
we<00:01:27.930> saw<00:01:28.140> wean<00:01:28.550> it's<00:01:29.550> good<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
we saw wean it's good that the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.630 
we saw wean it's good that the
government<00:01:30.990> has<00:01:31.290> made<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> decision<00:01:32.610> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
government has made the decision to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.150 
government has made the decision to
secure<00:01:33.180> those<00:01:33.390> stations<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.590> their<00:01:34.770> parks

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
secure those stations for their parks

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.280 
secure those stations for their parks
because<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.850> areas<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.480> selected<00:01:37.050> did

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
because the areas that they selected did

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.990 
because the areas that they selected did
have<00:01:37.500> unique<00:01:37.950> features<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.790> should<00:01:38.970> be

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
have unique features it should be

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.390 
have unique features it should be
preserved<00:01:39.510> I<00:01:39.870> have<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.650> really<00:01:40.920> honest<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
preserved I have to be really honest and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.280 
preserved I have to be really honest and
say<00:01:41.580> that<00:01:41.610> we've<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.720> never<00:01:42.870> had<00:01:42.990> any

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
say that we've really never had any

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.990 
say that we've really never had any
problem<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.950> made<00:01:44.220> no<00:01:44.430> difference<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.940> our

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
problem it's made no difference to our
