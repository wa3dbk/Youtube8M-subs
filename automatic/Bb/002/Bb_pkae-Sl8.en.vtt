00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.000 
wolfy I just realized that a source
strange<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.300> then<00:00:36.750> he<00:00:36.870> gropes<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.590> trap

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
strange and then he gropes it's a trap

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.889 
strange and then he gropes it's a trap
but<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.940> know<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.239> really<00:00:39.360> not<00:00:39.570> trap

but you know it's really not trap

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:40.819 
but you know it's really not trap
because<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.140> didn't<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.440> anything<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.649> do

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
he decides to use like this charge beam

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.240 
he decides to use like this charge beam
I<00:03:51.600> don't<00:03:52.110> know<00:03:52.230> what<00:03:52.410> has<00:03:52.500> more<00:03:52.650> base<00:03:52.950> power

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
I don't know what has more base power

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.640 
I don't know what has more base power
ancient<00:03:53.970> power<00:03:54.180> charge<00:03:54.750> beam<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:55.530> like

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
ancient power charge beam I just like

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.870 
ancient power charge beam I just like
charge<00:03:55.920> being<00:03:56.100> better<00:03:56.340> because<00:03:56.610> it<00:03:56.730> looks

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
charge being better because it looks

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.580 
charge being better because it looks
cooler<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.540> might<00:03:57.720> get<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.900> stat<00:03:58.170> boosts<00:03:58.380> out

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
cooler and I might get a stat boosts out

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.050 
cooler and I might get a stat boosts out
of<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.769> but<00:03:59.130> I<00:03:59.190> also<00:03:59.370> biggest<00:03:59.730> that<00:03:59.910> boosts

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
of it but I also biggest that boosts

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.390 
of it but I also biggest that boosts
from<00:04:00.209> ancient<00:04:00.390> power<00:04:00.660> I<00:04:01.019> really<00:04:01.980> need<00:04:02.040> get<00:04:02.310> rid

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
from ancient power I really need get rid

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.530 
from ancient power I really need get rid
of<00:04:02.459> ancient<00:04:02.790> powers<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.180> don't<00:04:03.330> have<00:04:03.420> this

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540
