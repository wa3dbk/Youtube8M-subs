00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.780
 hi there, this is our elephant again 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.580
 the monastery is fairly easy setup with 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.890
 artillery and patient ns 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.470
 and the opponent the basis of the team are 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.140
 heavy tanks hence advantage 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.860
 maneuver for us and we will try it 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.710
 take advantage of such a plan t69 take 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.860
 monastery and hiding there their business shine 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.840
 meets the enemy in the monastery 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.630
 carnarvon goes climb highlights 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.050
 road to the monastery for pc and plays from 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.450
 towers 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.490
 Pepper is on a funny place 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.430
 covers the carnarvon controls the base 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.489
 and balcony ear to c1s goes to serpentine 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.739
 wagon ear and highlights it up to 1 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:01.630
 checks the intestine art stands on base 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.730
 covers the center of the map we are located by 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.900
 places and without interference occupy the monastery 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.970
 although waited there for a lonely 1390 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.490
 our opponents make a reasonable move 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.350
 they are not separated and collected 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.020
 take control of the center of the card 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.040
 dragging the whole group of heavy tanks myself 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.650
 the monastery hereby they have a chance 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.180
 deprive us gusting holding their monasteries and 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.600
 then finish us off piecemeal 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.510
 but there is a slight mistake for now 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.870
 mark up the attackers 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.370
 roads dwell on it more 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.220
 the enemy has led all tanks to attack 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.440
 including 1390 and left no one for 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.540
 cover it gives us a chance 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.730
 surround rivals and clamp their center 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.130
 getting the freedom to maneuver their 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.020
 forces what it will turn out for our 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.750
 rivals we will see later a 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.680
 until it becomes clear that on the flank 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.290
 there is nobody except t first and on the spitz 1c 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.450
 and at the first go on the hunt and in 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.140
 cycle destroy any opponent to seek 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.140
 to capture the base 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.599
 carnarvon fcm managed to hold up one of 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.730
 3 in the center and cut off 1390 from the main forces 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.050
 adversary 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.599
 the rest of the enemy strands break through 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.630
 nuns no sense to hold him now 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.220
 and our T69 can safely as 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.910
 cultivated from the monastery through after 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.870
 last to the first one succeeds easily 2 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.050
 is delayed 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.230
 and our cups continue to mark the victim 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.959
 lingering over the right road 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.690
 finally and 2 t69 leaves a dangerous place 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.670
 we are now free hand and our weights 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.680
 begin to pull up to the center to 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.810
 lock up the enemy in gut trap t 1 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.140
 meets rivals and loses 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.110
 duel 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.110
 father 1c deals with the enemy 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.840
 firefly ear and rushes to capture 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.910
 now the victory is a matter of technique in our burden 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.709
 need to be on both sides of the entrance to 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.769
 monastery and meet all those who go out 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.660
 fire on both sides of the device 69 were 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.760
 insure tyazh and destroy individual 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.130
 broke through or arrive at our base 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.769
 if necessary, the art will hunt 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.260
 it is necessary to look at the shortage 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.989
 how does that happen it's worth adding that 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.040
 opponents had a chance to escape if 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.290
 they didn't waste time 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.359
 on the gathering in the monastery and would continue 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.040
 together push the mass of one of our tank for 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.290
 others but they were confused 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.489
 lost time and scattered into small 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.560
 part of which we another one after the other not 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.239
 repeat these mistakes of our roles 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.239
 success lamp 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.460
 a blood contest to his wife does not threshold him
