00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.179 
checker now with all the different
batteries<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.369> run<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:19.080> might<00:00:19.980> be<00:00:20.100> of

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
batteries that I run and I might be of

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.070 
batteries that I run and I might be of
track<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.970> I'm<00:00:21.090> cycling<00:00:21.600> through<00:00:21.750> different

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
track and I'm cycling through different

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.259 
track and I'm cycling through different
batteries<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.830> every<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:23.699> I'll<00:00:23.820> actually

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
batteries and every one so I'll actually

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.210 
batteries and every one so I'll actually
forget<00:00:24.600> which<00:00:24.810> ones<00:00:25.050> I've<00:00:25.260> charged<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.130> which

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
forget which ones I've charged and which

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.429 
forget which ones I've charged and which
ones<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.550> haven't<00:00:26.849> well<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.480> I'm<00:00:27.900> charging<00:00:28.349> a

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
ones I haven't well if I'm charging a

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.950 
ones I haven't well if I'm charging a
couple<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.800> batteries<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:30.420> don't<00:00:30.660> have<00:00:30.929> a

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
couple of batteries and I don't have a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.749 
couple of batteries and I don't have a
way<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.679> kind<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.040> telling<00:00:32.279> which<00:00:32.460> ones<00:00:32.669> are

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
way of kind of telling which ones are

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.790 
way of kind of telling which ones are
charged<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.180> which<00:00:33.270> ones<00:00:33.480> aren't<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:34.530> thing

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
charged and which ones aren't this thing

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.220 
charged and which ones aren't this thing
is<00:00:35.040> definitely<00:00:35.550> cool<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.809> thing<00:00:37.020> plugs

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
is definitely cool now this thing plugs

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.560 
is definitely cool now this thing plugs
straight<00:00:37.380> into<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.280> balanced<00:00:38.790> adapter<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
straight into your balanced adapter and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.330 
straight into your balanced adapter and
tells<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.200> right<00:00:40.440> away<00:00:40.559> whether<00:00:40.980> or<00:00:41.100> not<00:00:41.160> your

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
tells you right away whether or not your

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.910 
tells you right away whether or not your
battery<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.850> charged<00:00:42.329> how<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.230> cells<00:00:43.649> look

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
battery is charged how the cells look

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.740 
battery is charged how the cells look
and<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.700> other<00:00:44.789> cool<00:00:45.000> feature<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.600> it

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and the other cool feature is it

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.350 
and the other cool feature is it
actually<00:00:46.230> balances<00:00:46.530> your<00:00:47.100> cells<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
actually balances your cells to the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.410 
actually balances your cells to the
lowest<00:00:48.870> voltage<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.579> know<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.210> cool

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
lowest voltage so you know really cool

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.119 
lowest voltage so you know really cool
feature<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.140> thing<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.530> only<00:00:52.920> will

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
feature that this thing not only will

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.740 
feature that this thing not only will
check<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> voltage<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.239> everything<00:00:54.300> else

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
check the voltage and everything else

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.709 
check the voltage and everything else
but<00:00:55.260> also<00:00:55.440> kind<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.890> equalize<00:00:56.460> things<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
but also kind of equalize things for you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.450 
but also kind of equalize things for you
before<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.500> happen<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.859> throw<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.280> thing

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
before you happen to throw that thing

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.450 
before you happen to throw that thing
back<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.910> your<00:01:00.390> charger<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.530> let's<00:01:02.219> go<00:01:02.340> ahead

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
back on your charger so let's go ahead

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.830 
back on your charger so let's go ahead
and<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> look<00:01:03.000> at<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.480> inside

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
and take a look at what you get inside

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.090 
and take a look at what you get inside
the<00:01:03.989> box<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.619> I'm<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.920> show<00:01:05.010> you

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
now this is going to be specifically for

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.929 
now this is going to be specifically for
lipo<00:01:37.200> batteries<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.650> wouldn't<00:01:38.340> really<00:01:38.670> work

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
lipo batteries I wouldn't really work

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.030 
lipo batteries I wouldn't really work
too<00:01:39.150> well<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.600> any<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> other<00:01:40.650> batteries

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
too well with any of the other batteries

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.170 
too well with any of the other batteries
on<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.189> market<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.729> doesn't<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.150> a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
on the market that doesn't have a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.679 
on the market that doesn't have a
balance<00:01:42.780> adapter<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.060> really<00:01:45.060> quick<00:01:45.299> let's<00:01:45.509> do

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
balance adapter so really quick let's do

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.810 
balance adapter so really quick let's do
some<00:01:45.930> boring<00:01:46.229> stuff<00:01:46.259> first<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.759> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
some boring stuff first this is going to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.480 
some boring stuff first this is going to
be<00:01:47.970> your<00:01:48.149> instruction<00:01:48.689> manual<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.680> lipo

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
be your instruction manual for the lipo

checker and balancer so gives you some
you<00:01:54.210> know<00:01:54.299> pretty<00:01:54.540> good<00:01:54.630> information<00:01:55.320> I'm

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
you know pretty good information I'm

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.469 
you know pretty good information I'm
going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> throw<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.369> my<00:01:56.520> pit<00:01:56.820> bag<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.329> if

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
going to throw this in my pit bag so if

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.999 
going to throw this in my pit bag so if
I<00:01:57.600> got<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> question<00:01:58.259> while<00:01:58.439> I'm<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
I got a question while I'm out in the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.480 
I got a question while I'm out in the
field<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.610> can<00:02:00.030> answer<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.540> right<00:02:00.780> away<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.490> next

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
field I can answer it right away so next

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.760 
field I can answer it right away so next
thing<00:02:02.610> here<00:02:03.000> let's<00:02:03.180> flip<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.689> over<00:02:03.930> let's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
thing here let's flip this over let's

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620 
thing here let's flip this over let's
see<00:02:04.950> what<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.159> get<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.549> here<00:02:05.880> now<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.479> is

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
see what we get in here now this is

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.059 
see what we get in here now this is
going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.930> an<00:02:06.990> adapter<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.680> happen<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
going to be an adapter if you happen to

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.580 
going to be an adapter if you happen to
run<00:02:08.340> Thunder<00:02:08.819> Power<00:02:09.119> Balance<00:02:09.899> adapters<00:02:10.560> so

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
run Thunder Power Balance adapters so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.680 
run Thunder Power Balance adapters so
under<00:02:11.310> power<00:02:11.489> runs<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.910> little<00:02:12.180> bit<00:02:12.300> different

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
under power runs a little bit different

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.760 
under power runs a little bit different
balance<00:02:13.020> adapter

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
balance adapter

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.890 
balance adapter
and<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.220> makes<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.880> lipo<00:02:15.300> checker<00:02:15.630> from

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and this makes the lipo checker from

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.590 
and this makes the lipo checker from
high-tech<00:02:16.170> work<00:02:16.950> with<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.430> other<00:02:18.210> cool<00:02:18.390> thing

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
high-tech work with it other cool thing

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.850 
high-tech work with it other cool thing
you<00:02:18.690> get<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> little<00:02:19.140> kind<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.500> wrist<00:02:19.770> strap

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
you get a little kind of a wrist strap

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.190 
you get a little kind of a wrist strap
you<00:02:20.340> know<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:20.520> can<00:02:20.910> kind<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.300> throw<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.020> on

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
you know you can kind of throw this on

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.690 
you know you can kind of throw this on
your<00:02:22.320> pit<00:02:22.530> bag<00:02:22.740> maybe<00:02:22.980> on<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.250> zipper<00:02:23.580> or

your pit bag maybe on the zipper or

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.310 
your pit bag maybe on the zipper or
something<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.270> just<00:02:24.480> kind<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.750> keep<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.080> kind

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
something and just kind of keep it kind

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.500 
something and just kind of keep it kind
of<00:02:25.380> handy<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.070> not<00:02:26.670> take<00:02:26.850> up<00:02:27.000> space<00:02:27.240> inside

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
of handy and not take up space inside

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.040 
of handy and not take up space inside
your<00:02:27.870> bag<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.800> last<00:02:29.430> but<00:02:29.700> not<00:02:29.850> least<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.480> lipo

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
your bag and last but not least the lipo

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.160 
your bag and last but not least the lipo
checker<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:32.370> thing<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.760> very<00:02:33.390> very<00:02:33.570> small

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
checker so this thing is very very small

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.220 
checker so this thing is very very small
on<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:35.340> know<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.270> can't<00:02:36.660> really<00:02:36.780> think<00:02:37.110> of

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
on you know I I can't really think of

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.250 
on you know I I can't really think of
what<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.710> compares<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.700> size<00:02:39.110> but<00:02:40.110> it's

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
what it compares to in size but it's

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.680 
what it compares to in size but it's
super<00:02:40.530> small<00:02:41.010> I'll<00:02:41.940> go<00:02:42.090> ahead<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.300> peel<00:02:42.510> off

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
super small I'll go ahead and peel off

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.320 
super small I'll go ahead and peel off
this<00:02:42.900> little<00:02:43.250> protective<00:02:44.250> strip<00:02:44.580> or<00:02:44.850> maybe

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
this little protective strip or maybe

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.960 
this little protective strip or maybe
I'm<00:02:45.480> not<00:02:45.630> let's<00:02:46.050> see<00:02:46.320> here<00:02:46.770> yeah<00:02:47.610> well<00:02:47.820> come

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
I'm not let's see here yeah well come

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.960 
I'm not let's see here yeah well come
off<00:02:48.120> anyways<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:48.960> pretty<00:02:49.860> much<00:02:49.950> it'll<00:02:50.280> do<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.460> 1

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
off anyways I pretty much it'll do a 1

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.120 
off anyways I pretty much it'll do a 1
to<00:02:51.210> a<00:02:51.240> 6<00:02:51.630> cell<00:02:51.900> lithium<00:02:52.890> polymer<00:02:53.700> battery<00:02:55.130> flip

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
to a 6 cell lithium polymer battery flip

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.890 
to a 6 cell lithium polymer battery flip
side<00:02:56.310> here<00:02:56.610> just<00:02:56.640> some<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.420> know<00:02:57.540> heat

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
side here just some you know heat

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.710 
side here just some you know heat
dissipation<00:02:58.500> ducts<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.370> that's<00:03:00.270> basically

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
dissipation ducts and that's basically

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.180 
dissipation ducts and that's basically
there's<00:03:00.960> a<00:03:01.020> little<00:03:01.320> tab<00:03:01.560> right<00:03:01.590> there<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.160> you

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
there's a little tab right there so you

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.060 
there's a little tab right there so you
can<00:03:02.660> attach<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.900> little<00:03:04.170> restaurant<00:03:04.560> so

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
can attach that little restaurant so

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.920 
can attach that little restaurant so
pretty<00:03:05.670> much<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.910> have<00:03:05.940> your<00:03:06.150> ground<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.750> you

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
pretty much you have your ground and you

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.860 
pretty much you have your ground and you
have<00:03:07.080> 1<00:03:07.320> through<00:03:07.590> 6<00:03:07.890> cells<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:09.420> let's<00:03:09.720> go

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
have 1 through 6 cells and let's go

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.470 
have 1 through 6 cells and let's go
ahead<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.200> see<00:03:10.380> how<00:03:10.410> this<00:03:10.650> thing<00:03:10.830> works<00:03:11.040> so

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
ahead and see how this thing works so

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.400 
ahead and see how this thing works so
pretty<00:03:12.480> much<00:03:12.570> from<00:03:12.780> what<00:03:12.960> I've<00:03:13.080> run<00:03:13.290> the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
pretty much from what I've run the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.310 
pretty much from what I've run the
instructions<00:03:13.920> if<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.280> leave<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:14.730> on<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:16.200> know

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
instructions if you leave it on you know

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.620 
instructions if you leave it on you know
hooked<00:03:16.680> up<00:03:16.890> for<00:03:17.550> less<00:03:17.730> than<00:03:17.940> five<00:03:18.150> seconds

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
hooked up for less than five seconds

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.330 
hooked up for less than five seconds
it'll<00:03:19.140> pretty<00:03:19.350> much<00:03:19.470> tell<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.160> voltage

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
it'll pretty much tell you the voltage

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.260 
it'll pretty much tell you the voltage
and<00:03:20.910> each<00:03:21.630> cell<00:03:22.310> capacity<00:03:23.310> if<00:03:23.490> you<00:03:23.970> leave<00:03:24.150> it

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
and each cell capacity if you leave it

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.170 
and each cell capacity if you leave it
over<00:03:24.630> five<00:03:24.900> seconds<00:03:25.440> it'll<00:03:25.650> start<00:03:26.180> balancing

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
over five seconds it'll start balancing

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.390 
over five seconds it'll start balancing
to<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.450> lowest<00:03:27.870> voltage<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:28.709> let's<00:03:29.220> go<00:03:29.340> ahead

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
to the lowest voltage so let's go ahead

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.110 
to the lowest voltage so let's go ahead
and<00:03:29.580> hook<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:29.940> thing<00:03:30.000> up<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:32.120> balance

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
and hook this thing up to the balance

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.440 
and hook this thing up to the balance
lead<00:03:33.390> here<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:35.190> immediately<00:03:35.940> you're<00:03:36.120> seeing

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
lead here and immediately you're seeing

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.140 
lead here and immediately you're seeing
I<00:03:36.660> have<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:37.220> 4.0<00:03:38.220> one<00:03:38.490> and<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:39.300> 4.0<00:03:40.080> 3<00:03:40.530> cell<00:03:41.150> 80%
