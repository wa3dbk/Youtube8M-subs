from someone who donated their brain to
science<00:00:24.260> to<00:00:25.260> get<00:00:25.410> started<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:25.920> want<00:00:26.220> to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
science to get started I just want to

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.099 
science to get started I just want to
take<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> moment<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.269> point<00:00:27.449> out<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.840> biggest

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109

take a moment to point out the biggest
landmarks<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> brain<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.670> we<00:00:29.699> have

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
landmarks on the brain so we have

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.420 
landmarks on the brain so we have
something<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.449> refer<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.900> later<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.230> at<00:00:31.590> the

the brain to control muscles heart rate
and<00:01:09.540> breathing<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.590> very<00:01:10.920> important<00:01:11.400> for

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
and breathing it's very important for

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.039 
and breathing it's very important for
initiating<00:01:11.820> sleep<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.450> many<00:01:12.840> other

entire rest of the brain they're just

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.899 
entire rest of the brain they're just
smaller<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.960> packed<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.650> really<00:01:32.070> really

smaller and packed and really really
really<00:01:33.060> tightly<00:01:33.360> I'll<00:01:33.659> talk<00:01:34.439> more<00:01:34.470> about

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
really tightly I'll talk more about

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.200 
really tightly I'll talk more about
these<00:01:35.009> brain<00:01:35.310> areas<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> following

these brain areas in the following

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.420 
these brain areas in the following
videos<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.320> want<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.890> cover<00:01:38.159> some<00:01:38.400> basic

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
videos but I do want to cover some basic

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.789 
videos but I do want to cover some basic
terminology<00:01:39.000> first<00:01:39.630> which<00:01:40.229> I'll<00:01:40.409> use<00:01:40.439> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
terminology first which I'll use to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.929 
terminology first which I'll use to
refer<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.100> breaches<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> brain<00:01:42.060> later<00:01:42.479> on

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
refer to breaches of the brain later on

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.580 
refer to breaches of the brain later on
these<00:01:44.939> words<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:45.479> standard<00:01:45.930> neuroscience

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
these words are standard neuroscience

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.289 
these words are standard neuroscience
literature<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.250> I'll<00:01:47.700> remind<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:48.210> they

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
literature and I'll remind you what they

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.270 
literature and I'll remind you what they
mean<00:01:48.329> later<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.649> your<00:01:49.860> best<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
mean later on but do your best to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.420 
mean later on but do your best to
memorize<00:01:50.430> them<00:01:50.880> now<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.930> first<00:01:52.590> let's<00:01:53.100> look<00:01:53.189> at

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
memorize them now so first let's look at

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.249 
memorize them now so first let's look at
the<00:01:53.520> types<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.030> cross<00:01:54.299> sections<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.049> have

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the types of cross sections you can have

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.920 
the types of cross sections you can have
there<00:01:56.040> are<00:01:56.219> three<00:01:56.670> types<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.240> cross<00:01:57.479> sections

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
there are three types of cross sections

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.660 
there are three types of cross sections
or<00:01:58.049> kant's<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.680> make<00:01:58.860> one<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.549> each

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
or kant's that you can make one for each

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.389 
or kant's that you can make one for each
dimension<00:02:00.439> sagittal<00:02:01.439> coronal<00:02:01.799> and

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
dimension sagittal coronal and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.469 
dimension sagittal coronal and
horizontal<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:04.549> sagittal<00:02:05.549> cross-section<00:02:06.240> cuts

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
horizontal a sagittal cross-section cuts

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.680 
horizontal a sagittal cross-section cuts
across<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.990> brain<00:02:07.200> lengthwise<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:07.890> this

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
across the brain lengthwise like this

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.029 
across the brain lengthwise like this
you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.869> think<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.289> like<00:02:10.319> cutting<00:02:10.979> a

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
you can think of it like cutting a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.880 
you can think of it like cutting a
hotdog<00:02:11.250> bun<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.930> coronal<00:02:12.930> slice<00:02:13.050> cuts<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.650> like

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
hotdog bun a coronal slice cuts it like

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.790 
hotdog bun a coronal slice cuts it like
loaf<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.250> bread<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:14.850> along<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.240> line<00:02:15.540> and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
loaf of bread so along this line and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.920 
loaf of bread so along this line and
finally<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.950> horizontal<00:02:17.790> slice

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
finally a horizontal slice

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.270 
finally a horizontal slice
unsurprisingly<00:02:18.930> cuts<00:02:19.290> along<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.709> horizon

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
unsurprisingly cuts along the horizon

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.730 
unsurprisingly cuts along the horizon
the<00:02:20.370> brain<00:02:21.080> horizontal<00:02:22.080> slices<00:02:22.290> are<00:02:22.560> also

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
the brain horizontal slices are also

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.190 
the brain horizontal slices are also
referred<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.310> as<00:02:23.550> axial<00:02:24.150> slices<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.810> just<00:02:25.080> keep

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
referred to as axial slices so just keep

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.449 
referred to as axial slices so just keep
that<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.350> mind<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.740> might<00:02:25.830> hear<00:02:26.040> either<00:02:26.190> way

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
that in mind you might hear either way

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.860 
that in mind you might hear either way
so<00:02:27.300> again<00:02:27.660> we<00:02:27.900> have<00:02:28.140> sagittal<00:02:28.800> coronal<00:02:29.250> and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
so again we have sagittal coronal and

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.470 
so again we have sagittal coronal and
horizontal<00:02:30.870> or<00:02:31.050> axial<00:02:31.620> slices<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:33.150> what<00:02:33.300> we

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
horizontal or axial slices so what we

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.510 
horizontal or axial slices so what we
call<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.780> cut<00:02:34.020> right<00:02:34.260> here<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:35.340> would<00:02:35.400> be<00:02:35.459> a

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
call this cut right here that would be a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.040 
call this cut right here that would be a
sagittal<00:02:36.000> cut<00:02:36.209> right<00:02:36.420> because<00:02:36.780> we're<00:02:36.900> cutting

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
sagittal cut right because we're cutting

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.979 
sagittal cut right because we're cutting
lengthwise<00:02:37.560> across<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.160> brain<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.660> cut

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
lengthwise across the brain and this cut

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.390 
lengthwise across the brain and this cut
here<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.739> is<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> big<00:02:41.040> one

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
here this is a big one

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.270 
here this is a big one
what's<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.760> as<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.600> horizontal<00:02:43.350> or<00:02:43.560> an<00:02:43.860> axial

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
what's that as a horizontal or an axial

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.810 
what's that as a horizontal or an axial
cross-section<00:02:46.040> next<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.130> want<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.430> go<00:02:47.580> over

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
cross-section next I want to go over

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.550 
cross-section next I want to go over
words<00:02:48.090> which<00:02:48.420> refer<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.930> what<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:49.410> could

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
words which refer to what you could

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.860 
words which refer to what you could
think<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.860> as<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.400> axes<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.270> brain<00:02:51.540> so

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
think of as the axes of the brain so

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.009 
think of as the axes of the brain so
imagine<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.380> have<00:02:52.500> three<00:02:52.800> axes<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.580> x<00:02:53.940> axis<00:02:54.150> z

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
imagine you have three axes in x axis z

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.520 
imagine you have three axes in x axis z
axis<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:56.000> y<00:02:57.000> axis<00:02:57.030> going<00:02:57.720> from<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.080> nose<00:02:58.380> to

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
axis and y axis going from the nose to

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.190 
axis and y axis going from the nose to
the<00:02:58.590> back<00:02:58.800> these<00:02:59.550> axes<00:03:00.390> go<00:03:00.660> through<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.959> brain

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the back these axes go through the brain

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.020 
the back these axes go through the brain
and<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.739> might<00:03:01.920> want<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.100> say<00:03:02.280> our<00:03:02.519> point<00:03:02.850> is

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
and you might want to say our point is

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.729 
and you might want to say our point is
long<00:03:03.300> each<00:03:03.480> axis<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.140> know<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.350> can<00:03:04.470> be<00:03:04.500> very

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
long each axis you know it can be very

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.340 
long each axis you know it can be very
useful<00:03:04.800> so<00:03:05.670> let's<00:03:05.910> start<00:03:06.269> with<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.540> z<00:03:06.780> axis<00:03:07.320> so

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
useful so let's start with the z axis so

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.440 
useful so let's start with the z axis so
up-and-down<00:03:08.070> movement<00:03:08.489> we<00:03:09.180> say<00:03:09.330> that

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
up-and-down movement we say that

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.120 
up-and-down movement we say that
something<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:09.840> dorsal<00:03:10.470> if<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:10.950> near<00:03:11.100> the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
something as dorsal if it is near the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.660 
something as dorsal if it is near the
top<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.700> brain<00:03:11.940> or<00:03:12.180> above<00:03:12.600> something<00:03:12.989> else

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
top of the brain or above something else

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.670 
top of the brain or above something else
therefore<00:03:14.670> if<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.480> were<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.810> say<00:03:15.989> dorsal

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
therefore if I were to say dorsal

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.520 
therefore if I were to say dorsal
temporal<00:03:17.519> lobe<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.970> would<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:19.049> referring<00:03:19.410> to

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
temporal lobe I would be referring to

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.069 
temporal lobe I would be referring to
the<00:03:19.799> top<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.880> temporal<00:03:21.420> lobe<00:03:21.450> so

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
the top of the temporal lobe so

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.949 
the top of the temporal lobe so
somewhere<00:03:22.950> around<00:03:23.040> here<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:24.360> can<00:03:24.570> remember

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
somewhere around here you can remember

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.600 
somewhere around here you can remember
that<00:03:25.110> dorsal<00:03:25.530> means<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.950> top<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.400> brain

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
that dorsal means the top of the brain

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.580 
that dorsal means the top of the brain
by<00:03:26.820> thinking<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.269> a<00:03:27.360> dorsal<00:03:27.750> fin<00:03:27.900> on<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:28.079> dolphin

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
by thinking of a dorsal fin on a dolphin

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.460 
by thinking of a dorsal fin on a dolphin
in<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:29.400> dolphin<00:03:29.820> its<00:03:30.329> head<00:03:30.570> points<00:03:30.900> up<00:03:31.049> with

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
in a dolphin its head points up with

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.319 
in a dolphin its head points up with
respect<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:31.890> its<00:03:32.010> back<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.850> top<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.209> its

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
respect to its back so the top of its

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.449 
respect to its back so the top of its
brain<00:03:33.570> is<00:03:33.780> on<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:33.989> same<00:03:34.320> side<00:03:34.680> as<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.070> store

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
brain is on the same side as a store

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.000 
brain is on the same side as a store
sylth<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.750> opposite<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.470> dorsal<00:03:37.890> is

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
sylth in the opposite of dorsal is

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.069 
sylth in the opposite of dorsal is
ventral<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:39.030> refers<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.690> bottom<00:03:40.019> of

so<00:03:42.260> using<00:03:43.260> our<00:03:43.350> example<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.890> temporal

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
so using our example of the temporal

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.130 
so using our example of the temporal
lobe<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.760> ventral<00:03:45.480> surface<00:03:45.630> of<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.019> temporal

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
lobe the ventral surface of the temporal

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.800 
lobe the ventral surface of the temporal
lobe<00:03:46.470> would<00:03:46.799> be<00:03:46.980> like<00:03:47.459> right<00:03:47.700> here<00:03:48.060> on<00:03:48.209> the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
lobe would be like right here on the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.340 
lobe would be like right here on the
bottom

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
bottom

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.020 
bottom
now<00:03:51.350> I<00:03:51.410> don't<00:03:51.680> want<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.070> confuse<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.490> but

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
now I don't want to confuse you but

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.850 
now I don't want to confuse you but
there<00:03:53.210> are<00:03:53.390> multiple<00:03:53.780> words<00:03:53.990> for<00:03:54.290> up-down

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
there are multiple words for up-down

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.160 
there are multiple words for up-down
forwards<00:03:55.520> and<00:03:55.640> back<00:03:55.900> superior<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.050> inferior

forwards and back superior and inferior

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.710 
forwards and back superior and inferior
serve<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.010> same<00:03:58.190> purpose<00:03:58.250> as<00:03:58.970> dorsal<00:03:59.570> and

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
serve the same purpose as dorsal and

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.110 
serve the same purpose as dorsal and
ventral<00:04:00.070> superior<00:04:01.070> refers<00:04:01.460> to<00:04:01.490> up<00:04:01.790> and

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
ventral superior refers to up and

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.810 
ventral superior refers to up and
inferior<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:02.900> down<00:04:03.400> alright<00:04:04.400> so<00:04:04.640> we've<00:04:04.790> got

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
inferior to down alright so we've got

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.150 
inferior to down alright so we've got
the<00:04:05.150> z-axis<00:04:05.390> peg<00:04:06.050> town<00:04:06.290> let's<00:04:06.620> go<00:04:06.830> for<00:04:07.070> the

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
the z-axis peg town let's go for the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.840 
the z-axis peg town let's go for the
x-axis<00:04:07.700> next<00:04:08.390> left<00:04:08.960> and<00:04:09.170> right<00:04:09.290> we<00:04:10.190> refer<00:04:10.520> to

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
x-axis next left and right we refer to

the left and right sides of the brain

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.520 
the left and right sides of the brain
simply<00:04:13.130> as<00:04:13.310> left<00:04:13.820> and<00:04:13.970> right<00:04:14.140> sometimes<00:04:15.140> we

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
simply as left and right sometimes we

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.470 
simply as left and right sometimes we
will<00:04:15.680> refer<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.070> an<00:04:16.160> area<00:04:16.460> being<00:04:16.640> EPSA<00:04:17.090> lateral

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
will refer to an area being EPSA lateral

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.390 
will refer to an area being EPSA lateral
or<00:04:17.690> contralateral<00:04:18.290> with<00:04:18.680> respect<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.190> another

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
or contralateral with respect to another

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.390 
or contralateral with respect to another
area<00:04:19.640> this<00:04:20.360> just<00:04:20.930> means<00:04:21.260> it's<00:04:21.500> on<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.770> same<00:04:22.070> or

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
area this just means it's on the same or

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.730 
area this just means it's on the same or
opposite<00:04:23.030> hemisphere<00:04:23.150> of<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.600> brain<00:04:23.630> as<00:04:24.110> the

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
opposite hemisphere of the brain as the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.220 
opposite hemisphere of the brain as the
other<00:04:24.890> area<00:04:25.400> that<00:04:25.550> we're<00:04:25.790> referring<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.210> so<00:04:26.960> if

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
other area that we're referring to so if

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.800 
other area that we're referring to so if
so<00:04:27.470> lateral<00:04:27.860> means<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.430> same<00:04:28.730> side<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.540> same

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
so lateral means the same side the same

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.650 
so lateral means the same side the same
hemisphere<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.760> contralateral<00:04:31.760> means<00:04:32.450> it's

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
hemisphere and contralateral means it's

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.990 
hemisphere and contralateral means it's
on<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.020> opposite<00:04:33.500> side<00:04:33.710> so<00:04:34.100> if<00:04:34.580> I<00:04:34.760> were<00:04:34.940> to

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
on the opposite side so if I were to

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.060 
on the opposite side so if I were to
mention<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.510> structure<00:04:36.110> here<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:36.560> say<00:04:36.920> that

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
mention a structure here and say that

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.040 
mention a structure here and say that
something<00:04:37.400> else<00:04:37.520> is<00:04:37.670> Epsilon<00:04:38.150> well<00:04:38.330> -<00:04:38.480> it<00:04:38.630> will

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
something else is Epsilon well - it will

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.090 
something else is Epsilon well - it will
find<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:39.440> structure<00:04:39.770> on<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:39.920> same

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
find that structure on the same

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.950 
find that structure on the same
hemisphere<00:04:40.310> of<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.730> brain<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:41.180> if<00:04:41.660> we<00:04:41.810> said

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
hemisphere of the brain and if we said

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.480 
hemisphere of the brain and if we said
it<00:04:41.990> was<00:04:42.140> concha<00:04:42.530> lateral<00:04:42.860> we'd<00:04:43.070> find<00:04:43.310> it<00:04:43.400> on

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
it was concha lateral we'd find it on

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.390 
it was concha lateral we'd find it on
the<00:04:43.670> opposite<00:04:44.060> side<00:04:44.240> of<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.420> brain<00:04:44.950> now<00:04:45.950> if<00:04:46.220> we

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
the opposite side of the brain now if we

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.560 
the opposite side of the brain now if we
want<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.640> refer<00:04:46.910> to<00:04:47.030> something<00:04:47.210> that<00:04:47.360> is

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
want to refer to something that is

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.630 
want to refer to something that is
bilateral<00:04:48.170> something<00:04:49.040> that<00:04:49.160> is<00:04:49.280> found<00:04:49.490> on

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
bilateral something that is found on

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.330 
bilateral something that is found on
both<00:04:50.060> sides<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:50.960> brain<00:04:51.140> we<00:04:51.860> want<00:04:52.100> to<00:04:52.220> use

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
both sides of the brain we want to use

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.820 
both sides of the brain we want to use
something<00:04:52.760> besides<00:04:53.060> right<00:04:53.450> and<00:04:53.600> left<00:04:53.840> so<00:04:54.470> for

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
something besides right and left so for

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.680 
something besides right and left so for
this<00:04:54.950> purpose<00:04:55.280> we<00:04:55.520> have<00:04:55.640> medial<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:56.420> lateral

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
this purpose we have medial and lateral

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.350 
this purpose we have medial and lateral
and<00:04:57.110> so<00:04:57.470> medial<00:04:58.430> refers<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.090> something

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
and so medial refers to something

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.940 
and so medial refers to something
towards<00:04:59.720> the<00:04:59.810> center<00:05:00.230> of<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.350> brain<00:05:00.620> and

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
towards the center of the brain and

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.970 
towards the center of the brain and
lateral<00:05:01.700> refers<00:05:02.420> to<00:05:02.450> something<00:05:02.900> on<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.320> sides

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
lateral refers to something on the sides

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.400 
lateral refers to something on the sides
of<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:04.250> brain<00:05:04.460> so<00:05:04.730> more<00:05:05.390> medial<00:05:05.780> or<00:05:05.990> more

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
of the brain so more medial or more

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.690 
of the brain so more medial or more
lateral<00:05:06.800> mean<00:05:06.980> something<00:05:07.280> else<00:05:07.340> further

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
lateral mean something else further

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.790 
lateral mean something else further
towards<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.120> center<00:05:08.510> or<00:05:08.690> edge<00:05:08.930> respectively

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
towards the center or edge respectively

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.490 
towards the center or edge respectively
that's<00:05:10.490> it<00:05:10.760> for<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.060> x-axis<00:05:11.660> let's<00:05:12.020> finally

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
that's it for the x-axis let's finally

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.550 
that's it for the x-axis let's finally
move<00:05:12.650> on<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.190> y<00:05:13.400> axis<00:05:13.990> like<00:05:14.990> dorsal<00:05:15.470> and

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
move on to the y axis like dorsal and

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.710 
move on to the y axis like dorsal and
superior<00:05:16.100> we're<00:05:17.000> going<00:05:17.300> to<00:05:17.450> encounter

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
superior we're going to encounter

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.390 
superior we're going to encounter
multiple<00:05:18.470> words<00:05:18.680> with<00:05:18.980> the<00:05:19.100> same<00:05:19.130> meaning

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.610 
refers to being towards the nose and I
like<00:05:29.300> to<00:05:29.390> think<00:05:29.570> of<00:05:29.630> it<00:05:29.720> as<00:05:29.810> our<00:05:30.080> four<00:05:30.350> rafts

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
like to think of it as our four rafts

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.040 
like to think of it as our four rafts
and<00:05:30.920> what<00:05:31.670> do<00:05:31.760> rats<00:05:31.940> have<00:05:32.210> they<00:05:32.510> have<00:05:32.630> big

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
and what do rats have they have big

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.220 
and what do rats have they have big
pointy<00:05:33.710> noses<00:05:33.950> so<00:05:34.340> towards<00:05:34.790> the<00:05:34.940> nose<00:05:35.230> the

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
pointy noses so towards the nose the

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.530 
pointy noses so towards the nose the
opposite<00:05:36.800> of<00:05:36.890> rostral<00:05:37.280> is<00:05:37.460> caudal<00:05:38.060> referring

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
opposite of rostral is caudal referring

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.480 
opposite of rostral is caudal referring
to<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.750> back<00:05:38.930> of<00:05:39.170> the<00:05:39.230> brain<00:05:39.490> caudal

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
to the back of the brain caudal

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.390 
to the back of the brain caudal
literally<00:05:41.210> means<00:05:41.480> towards<00:05:41.960> the<00:05:42.110> tail<00:05:42.380> we<00:05:43.190> also

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
literally means towards the tail we also

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.090 
literally means towards the tail we also
have<00:05:43.760> the<00:05:43.940> more<00:05:44.150> commonly<00:05:44.630> used<00:05:44.890> anterior<00:05:45.890> and

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
have the more commonly used anterior and

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.330 
have the more commonly used anterior and
posterior<00:05:46.460> referring<00:05:47.390> to<00:05:47.570> the<00:05:47.720> front<00:05:48.170> and<00:05:48.470> the

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
posterior referring to the front and the

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.250 
posterior referring to the front and the
back<00:05:49.580> of<00:05:49.940> the<00:05:50.000> brain<00:05:50.240> respectively<00:05:51.080> and

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
back of the brain respectively and

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.800 
back of the brain respectively and
that's<00:05:51.800> it<00:05:52.100> those<00:05:52.700> are<00:05:52.880> the<00:05:52.970> primary<00:05:53.300> words

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
that's it those are the primary words

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.710 
that's it those are the primary words
used<00:05:54.350> to<00:05:54.440> describe<00:05:54.500> areas<00:05:55.280> of<00:05:55.400> the<00:05:55.460> brain

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
used to describe areas of the brain

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.270 
used to describe areas of the brain
what's<00:05:56.720> great<00:05:57.110> is<00:05:57.320> that<00:05:57.410> you<00:05:57.650> can<00:05:57.890> string<00:05:58.190> them

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
what's great is that you can string them

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.670 
what's great is that you can string them
all<00:05:58.430> together<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.390> refer<00:05:59.780> to<00:05:59.930> a<00:05:59.990> specific<00:06:00.110> area

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
all together to refer to a specific area

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.460 
all together to refer to a specific area
of<00:06:00.980> the<00:06:01.130> brain<00:06:01.310> let's<00:06:02.060> try<00:06:02.180> that<00:06:02.300> out<00:06:02.360> now

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
of the brain let's try that out now

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.250 
of the brain let's try that out now
so<00:06:03.620> if<00:06:03.800> I<00:06:03.890> were<00:06:03.980> to<00:06:04.100> mention<00:06:04.220> the<00:06:04.430> dorsolateral

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
so if I were to mention the dorsolateral

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.780 
so if I were to mention the dorsolateral
frontal<00:06:06.260> lobe<00:06:06.500> where<00:06:07.340> would<00:06:07.490> I<00:06:07.520> be<00:06:07.640> talking

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
frontal lobe where would I be talking

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.390 
frontal lobe where would I be talking
about<00:06:08.030> so<00:06:08.840> something<00:06:09.650> like<00:06:09.680> right<00:06:10.010> here<00:06:10.370> right

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
about so something like right here right

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.210 
about so something like right here right
because<00:06:11.180> it's<00:06:11.840> the<00:06:11.930> top<00:06:12.230> remember<00:06:12.620> dorsal

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
because it's the top remember dorsal

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.670 
because it's the top remember dorsal
means<00:06:13.430> top<00:06:13.790> and<00:06:14.060> sighs<00:06:14.540> the<00:06:14.870> lateral<00:06:15.320> part<00:06:15.590> of

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
means top and sighs the lateral part of

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.730 
means top and sighs the lateral part of
the<00:06:15.800> frontal<00:06:16.370> lobe<00:06:16.610> and<00:06:17.140> what<00:06:18.140> if<00:06:18.260> I<00:06:18.380> said

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
the frontal lobe and what if I said

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.270 
the frontal lobe and what if I said
medial<00:06:19.730> rostral<00:06:20.360> temporal<00:06:20.840> lobe<00:06:21.020> sorry<00:06:21.770> this

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
medial rostral temporal lobe sorry this

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.940 
medial rostral temporal lobe sorry this
is<00:06:22.520> uh<00:06:22.900> has<00:06:23.900> been<00:06:24.080> falling<00:06:24.290> off<00:06:24.530> like<00:06:24.740> I<00:06:24.800> said

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
is uh has been falling off like I said

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.890 
is uh has been falling off like I said
this<00:06:25.010> is<00:06:25.160> a<00:06:25.190> dissected<00:06:25.880> brain<00:06:26.120> but<00:06:26.390> it<00:06:26.570> isn't

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
this is a dissected brain but it isn't

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.260 
this is a dissected brain but it isn't
you<00:06:26.960> can<00:06:27.080> see<00:06:27.200> the<00:06:27.320> corona<00:06:27.830> radiata<00:06:28.060> now<00:06:29.060> this

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
you can see the corona radiata now this

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.570 
you can see the corona radiata now this
is<00:06:29.390> falling<00:06:29.690> off<00:06:29.840> these<00:06:30.320> are<00:06:30.530> radiating<00:06:31.250> axons

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
is falling off these are radiating axons

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.490 
is falling off these are radiating axons
right<00:06:31.760> here<00:06:31.970> coming<00:06:32.900> out<00:06:33.050> of<00:06:33.110> the<00:06:33.170> corpus

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
right here coming out of the corpus

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.810 
right here coming out of the corpus
callosum<00:06:33.710> but<00:06:34.070> we'll<00:06:34.460> get<00:06:34.580> to<00:06:34.670> that<00:06:34.700> in

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
callosum but we'll get to that in

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.240 
callosum but we'll get to that in
another<00:06:35.120> video<00:06:35.330> so<00:06:35.810> just<00:06:36.050> bear<00:06:36.170> with<00:06:36.200> me<00:06:36.320> so

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
another video so just bear with me so

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.210 
another video so just bear with me so
when<00:06:37.940> I<00:06:37.970> say<00:06:38.180> medial<00:06:38.540> rostral<00:06:39.140> temporal<00:06:39.980> lobe

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
when I say medial rostral temporal lobe

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.790 
when I say medial rostral temporal lobe
so<00:06:40.700> to<00:06:41.150> see<00:06:41.330> that<00:06:41.540> we're<00:06:41.840> going<00:06:41.960> to<00:06:42.110> flip<00:06:42.620> the

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
so to see that we're going to flip the

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.650 
so to see that we're going to flip the
brain<00:06:43.010> over<00:06:43.340> which<00:06:43.520> because<00:06:44.360> it's<00:06:44.540> been

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.660 
brain over which because it's been

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.730 
brain over which because it's been
dissected<00:06:45.170> is<00:06:45.290> no<00:06:46.010> easy<00:06:46.250> task<00:06:46.480> but<00:06:47.590> yeah<00:06:48.590> so

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
dissected is no easy task but yeah so

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.150 
dissected is no easy task but yeah so
here<00:06:48.920> we<00:06:49.010> are<00:06:49.040> bound<00:06:49.550> on<00:06:49.670> the<00:06:49.730> brain<00:06:50.530> so<00:06:51.530> okay

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 
here we are bound on the brain so okay

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.000 
here we are bound on the brain so okay
medial<00:06:52.640> rostral<00:06:53.210> temporal<00:06:53.960> lobe<00:06:54.140> so<00:06:54.440> we've

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.010 
medial rostral temporal lobe so we've

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.440 
medial rostral temporal lobe so we've
got<00:06:55.190> the<00:06:55.340> temporal<00:06:55.700> of<00:06:55.820> this<00:06:55.940> right<00:06:56.090> here<00:06:56.120> and

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.450 
got the temporal of this right here and

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.800 
got the temporal of this right here and
we're<00:06:57.290> going<00:06:57.470> medial<00:06:58.250> so<00:06:58.520> this<00:06:58.880> inside<00:06:59.450> inner

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
we're going medial so this inside inner

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.659 
we're going medial so this inside inner
part<00:07:00.290> towards<00:07:00.680> the<00:07:00.770> center<00:07:01.100> of<00:07:01.130> the<00:07:01.220> brain<00:07:01.430> and

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:01.669 
part towards the center of the brain and

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:03.880 
part towards the center of the brain and
then<00:07:02.240> roshal<00:07:02.870> towards<00:07:03.260> the<00:07:03.350> nose<00:07:03.530> so<00:07:03.770> we're

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:03.890 
then roshal towards the nose so we're

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.640 
then roshal towards the nose so we're
talk<00:07:03.980> about<00:07:04.130> something<00:07:04.340> right<00:07:04.490> here<00:07:05.020> and<00:07:06.020> you

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.650 
talk about something right here and you

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.750 
talk about something right here and you
know<00:07:06.680> that<00:07:06.800> that's<00:07:06.980> pretty<00:07:07.190> that's<00:07:07.400> very

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
know that that's pretty that's very

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.520 
know that that's pretty that's very
specific<00:07:08.300> just<00:07:08.450> these<00:07:08.570> few<00:07:08.930> words<00:07:09.169> you<00:07:09.410> got

specific just these few words you got

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.320 
specific just these few words you got
meal<00:07:09.830> Ralph's<00:07:10.160> temporal<00:07:10.460> lobe<00:07:10.610> -<00:07:10.910> right<00:07:11.090> here

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
meal Ralph's temporal lobe - right here

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.690 
meal Ralph's temporal lobe - right here
this<00:07:11.540> uh<00:07:11.810> this<00:07:12.680> area<00:07:12.919> of<00:07:12.980> the<00:07:13.040> brain<00:07:13.130> so<00:07:13.430> pretty

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.700 
this uh this area of the brain so pretty

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.340 
this uh this area of the brain so pretty
cool<00:07:13.850> you<00:07:13.940> can<00:07:14.000> do<00:07:14.180> that<00:07:14.330> with<00:07:14.450> just<00:07:14.480> be<00:07:14.870> so<00:07:15.080> few
