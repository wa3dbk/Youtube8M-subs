there's<00:00:16.840> our<00:00:16.990> motor<00:00:17.230> mount<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:19.390> is<00:00:19.570> our

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
there's our motor mount this is our

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.580 
there's our motor mount this is our
exhaust<00:00:20.669> it's<00:00:21.669> off<00:00:21.910> system<00:00:22.419> extended

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
exhaust it's off system extended

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.240 
exhaust it's off system extended
that<00:00:25.190> we<00:00:25.280> bought<00:00:25.430> separately

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.560 

this<00:00:29.790> is<00:00:29.940> our<00:00:30.120> spark<00:00:30.630> plugs<00:00:31.020> and<00:00:32.210> tools<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.480> get

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
this is our spark plugs and tools to get

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.889 
this is our spark plugs and tools to get
a<00:00:33.739> tool<00:00:34.739> stuck<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> spark<00:00:35.670> plugs

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
a tool stuck in the spark plugs

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.920 
a tool stuck in the spark plugs
so<00:00:38.899> I<00:00:39.050> sprocket<00:00:40.000> like<00:00:41.000> a<00:00:41.030> regular<00:00:41.329> where<00:00:41.809> the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
so I sprocket like a regular where the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.319 
so I sprocket like a regular where the
chain<00:00:42.170> goes<00:00:42.469> on<00:00:42.680> it

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.560 

this<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.899> where<00:00:46.050> gas<00:00:46.260> tank<00:00:47.030> might<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.179> painting

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
this is where gas tank might be painting

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.060 
this is where gas tank might be painting
this<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> different<00:00:48.989> color<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.530> might<00:00:49.739> decide

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
this a different color we might decide

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.819 
this a different color we might decide
we're<00:00:50.339> still<00:00:50.550> deciding<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.030> we're<00:00:51.210> going<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
we're still deciding if we're going to

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.919 
we're still deciding if we're going to
or<00:00:52.829> get<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> different<00:00:53.460> tank<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:54.210> might<00:00:54.420> paint

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
or get a different tank we might paint

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.180 
or get a different tank we might paint
it<00:00:55.079> we<00:00:55.170> might<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> different<00:00:55.799> a<00:00:56.100> different

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it we might get a different a different

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.930 
it we might get a different a different
one<00:00:56.699> so

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
one so

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:07.500 
one so
and<00:00:59.079> this<00:01:00.079> right<00:01:00.350> here<00:01:00.590> is<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.920> gas<00:01:01.130> line

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.660 

this<00:01:08.140> goes<00:01:08.380> on<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.560> rear<00:01:08.890> sprocket

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.810 

this<00:01:14.240> is<00:01:14.420> straddle<00:01:15.320> controls<00:01:15.890> what's<00:01:16.700> the

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
this is straddle controls what's the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.580 
this is straddle controls what's the
other<00:01:16.909> one<00:01:17.180> right<00:01:17.990> here<00:01:18.200> these<00:01:18.380> are<00:01:18.440> the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
other one right here these are the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.220 
other one right here these are the
straddle<00:01:19.070> controls

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
straddle controls

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.370 
straddle controls
here<00:01:21.860> is<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:23.150> clot

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
here is the clot

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.990 
here is the clot
the<00:01:25.680> chain<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.920> this<00:01:28.920> goes<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the chain right here this goes up on the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.109 
the chain right here this goes up on the
motor<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:31.439> coil<00:01:31.920> hooks<00:01:32.340> onto<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.759> spark

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
motor and this coil hooks onto the spark

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.380 
motor and this coil hooks onto the spark
plug<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.400> then<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.729> our<00:01:35.880> motor<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.299> we

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
plug and then this is our motor that we

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:49.920 
plug and then this is our motor that we
bought

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.620 

okay<00:01:50.470> that's<00:01:50.800> our<00:01:50.950> motor<00:01:51.330> this<00:01:52.330> is<00:01:52.510> the

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
okay that's our motor this is the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.180 
okay that's our motor this is the
exhaust<00:01:52.930> system<00:01:53.140> that<00:01:53.380> came<00:01:53.710> with<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:53.980> which

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
exhaust system that came with it which

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.390 
exhaust system that came with it which
we're<00:01:54.400> not<00:01:54.640> going<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:55.030> be<00:01:55.120> using<00:01:56.160> and<00:01:57.160> then

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
we're not going to be using and then

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.070 
we're not going to be using and then
this<00:01:57.610> is<00:01:57.760> also<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.210> King<00:01:58.420> Guard<00:01:58.720> which<00:01:58.870> we're

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
this is also the King Guard which we're

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.200 
this is also the King Guard which we're
not<00:01:59.230> going<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.590> be<00:01:59.680> using<00:02:00.040> so<00:02:00.700> thanks<00:02:01.060> for

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
not going to be using so thanks for
