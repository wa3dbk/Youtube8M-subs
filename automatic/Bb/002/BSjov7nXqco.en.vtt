00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
now since we're on this laptop it's

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.100 
now since we're on this laptop it's
probably<00:02:59.370> going<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.610> take<00:02:59.880> a<00:03:00.510> while<00:03:00.570> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
probably going to take a while the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.480 
probably going to take a while the
installation<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:02.240> you<00:03:03.240> know<00:03:03.360> hopefully<00:03:03.630> the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
installation and you know hopefully the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.140 
installation and you know hopefully the
mouse<00:03:05.490> is<00:03:06.060> functional<00:03:06.990> because<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:08.160> mean<00:03:09.030> it's

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
mouse is functional because I mean it's

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.970 
mouse is functional because I mean it's
all<00:03:09.270> integrated<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:10.280> not<00:03:11.280> really<00:03:11.520> sure<00:03:12.980> I've

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
all integrated and not really sure I've

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.010 
all integrated and not really sure I've
never<00:03:14.250> done<00:03:14.460> it<00:03:14.610> on<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.760> laptop<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.780> just

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
never done it on a laptop and I just

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.620 
never done it on a laptop and I just
recently<00:03:16.790> obviously<00:03:17.790> did<00:03:17.970> my<00:03:18.150> first

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
recently obviously did my first

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.140 
recently obviously did my first
successful<00:03:21.020> desktop<00:03:22.020> hackintosh<00:03:22.800> so<00:03:23.790> anyway

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
successful desktop hackintosh so anyway

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.570 
successful desktop hackintosh so anyway
is<00:03:24.270> a<00:03:24.300> with<00:03:24.990> that<00:03:25.020> hard<00:03:25.200> drive<00:03:25.620> what<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.040> did<00:03:26.340> is

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
is a with that hard drive what I did is

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.540 
is a with that hard drive what I did is
I<00:03:26.730> actually<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:28.410> know<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.740> called<00:03:29.190> me<00:03:29.280> crazy

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
I actually you know it called me crazy

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.760 
I actually you know it called me crazy
but<00:03:30.330> I<00:03:30.360> like<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.870> think<00:03:31.020> outside<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.710> box

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
but I like to think outside of the box

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.080 
but I like to think outside of the box
and<00:03:33.920> kind<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:35.040> cheap<00:03:35.250> while<00:03:35.490> doing<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.910> but

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
and kind of cheap while doing it but

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.120 
and kind of cheap while doing it but
since<00:03:36.330> i<00:03:36.420> couldn't<00:03:36.690> find<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:37.080> temporarily<00:03:37.740> I

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
since i couldn't find that temporarily I

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.820 
since i couldn't find that temporarily I
just<00:03:38.490> cut<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:39.780> know<00:03:39.900> quite<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.320> bit<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.680> this

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
just cut you know quite a bit of this

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.490 
just cut you know quite a bit of this
off<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.750> stuck<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.900> together<00:03:43.050> you<00:03:43.380> know

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
off and stuck it together you know

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.200 
off and stuck it together you know
stacked<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.280> just<00:03:44.700> like<00:03:44.880> this<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:48.090> know

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
stacked it just like this and you know

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.500 
stacked it just like this and you know
that<00:03:48.450> gave<00:03:48.690> me<00:03:48.960> you<00:03:49.920> know<00:03:50.040> put<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.400> couple<00:03:51.270> ends

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
on there and that gave me enough room to

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.190 
on there and that gave me enough room to
you<00:03:54.930> know<00:03:54.960> have<00:03:55.410> it<00:03:56.300> pressed<00:03:57.300> up<00:03:57.630> against<00:03:58.110> the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200

named it mass OS x snow leopard and just

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.590 
named it mass OS x snow leopard and just
make<00:04:43.440> sure<00:04:43.650> it's<00:04:43.830> GUI<00:04:44.280> d<00:04:44.430> under<00:04:45.000> these<00:04:45.150> options

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
make sure it's GUI d under these options

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.980 
make sure it's GUI d under these options
down<00:04:45.840> there<00:04:46.139> and<00:04:46.380> mac<00:04:47.190> OS<00:04:47.520> extended<00:04:48.449> journaled

and<00:04:49.910> that<00:04:50.910> should<00:04:51.180> be<00:04:51.440> fine<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.949> turns<00:04:53.190> out

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
and that should be fine and it turns out

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.990 
and that should be fine and it turns out
actually<00:04:53.900> that<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:54.930> mouth<00:04:55.650> does<00:04:56.220> work<00:04:56.610> it

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
actually that the mouth does work it

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.180 
actually that the mouth does work it
seems<00:04:57.479> to<00:04:57.840> be<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:58.520> little<00:04:59.539> weird<00:05:00.539> though<00:05:02.150> so<00:05:04.190> you

you guys know obviously you're going to
install<00:05:15.240> it<00:05:15.539> on<00:05:15.949> the<00:05:16.949> hard<00:05:17.340> drive<00:05:17.580> that<00:05:18.000> you

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
install it on the hard drive that you

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.980 
install it on the hard drive that you
just<00:05:18.270> partitioned<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:21.030> can<00:05:21.270> dual<00:05:21.660> boot

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
just partitioned and you can dual boot

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.400 
just partitioned and you can dual boot
this<00:05:23.419> which<00:05:24.419> I'm<00:05:24.599> just<00:05:24.900> going<00:05:25.020> to<00:05:25.110> do<00:05:25.229> the<00:05:25.380> same

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
this which I'm just going to do the same

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.810 
this which I'm just going to do the same
method<00:05:26.010> that<00:05:26.130> i<00:05:26.190> have<00:05:26.460> on<00:05:26.789> my<00:05:26.849> computer

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
method that i have on my computer

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.180 
method that i have on my computer
whereas<00:05:29.820> if<00:05:29.880> you<00:05:30.389> don't<00:05:30.630> have<00:05:30.960> this<00:05:31.349> disk<00:05:31.860> in

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
whereas if you don't have this disk in

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.159 
whereas if you don't have this disk in
you're<00:05:32.669> just<00:05:32.880> not<00:05:33.120> going<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:33.360> boot<00:05:33.570> into<00:05:33.780> your

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
you're just not going to boot into your

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:40.550 
you're just not going to boot into your
your<00:05:34.729> packet<00:05:35.729> osh<00:05:37.280> because<00:05:38.280> I<00:05:39.180> mean<00:05:39.810> you<00:05:40.440> know

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
your packet osh because I mean you know

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.379 
your packet osh because I mean you know
i'm<00:05:41.130> not<00:05:41.310> sure<00:05:41.370> how<00:05:41.639> often<00:05:42.000> I'm<00:05:42.120> going<00:05:42.240> to<00:05:42.300> be

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
i'm not sure how often I'm going to be

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.890 
i'm not sure how often I'm going to be
doing<00:05:42.870> this<00:05:43.050> so<00:05:43.940> and<00:05:44.940> that'll<00:05:45.150> just<00:05:45.389> save<00:05:45.599> time

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
doing this so and that'll just save time

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.629 
doing this so and that'll just save time
for<00:05:46.169> later<00:05:46.349> on<00:05:46.530> you<00:05:46.710> don't<00:05:46.860> have<00:05:47.039> to<00:05:47.160> click<00:05:47.490> it

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
for later on you don't have to click it

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.150 
for later on you don't have to click it
every<00:05:47.910> time<00:05:48.120> you'll<00:05:48.630> just<00:05:48.870> know<00:05:49.139> that<00:05:49.949> when

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
every time you'll just know that when

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.800 
every time you'll just know that when
you<00:05:50.190> want<00:05:50.460> to<00:05:50.729> do<00:05:51.090> that<00:05:51.240> you'll<00:05:51.449> just<00:05:51.599> have

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
you want to do that you'll just have

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.290 
you want to do that you'll just have
this<00:05:51.990> disk<00:05:52.289> in<00:05:52.470> there<00:05:52.680> and<00:05:52.919> then<00:05:53.310> even<00:05:54.090> you

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
this disk in there and then even you

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.820 
this disk in there and then even you
know<00:05:54.389> when<00:05:54.750> you<00:05:54.840> do<00:05:54.990> that<00:05:55.139> that<00:05:55.169> in<00:05:55.500> there<00:05:55.680> then

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
know when you do that that in there then

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.430 
know when you do that that in there then
you<00:05:55.949> can<00:05:56.099> select<00:05:56.639> otherwise<00:05:57.060> so<00:05:57.840> this<00:05:58.410> is

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
you can select otherwise so this is

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.550 
you can select otherwise so this is
it'll<00:05:59.400> be<00:05:59.520> around<00:05:59.699> 31<00:06:00.330> minutes<00:06:00.810> I'm<00:06:01.110> assuming

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
it'll be around 31 minutes I'm assuming

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.110 
it'll be around 31 minutes I'm assuming
it<00:06:01.710> might<00:06:01.889> take<00:06:02.070> a<00:06:02.099> little<00:06:02.370> longer<00:06:02.490> than<00:06:02.970> that

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
it might take a little longer than that

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.110 
it might take a little longer than that
I<00:06:04.110> got<00:06:04.710> some<00:06:04.889> homework<00:06:05.039> to<00:06:05.250> do<00:06:05.550> so<00:06:05.580> I'm<00:06:05.940> going

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
I got some homework to do so I'm going

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.680 
I got some homework to do so I'm going
to<00:06:06.860> get<00:06:07.860> at<00:06:08.010> that<00:06:08.039> while<00:06:08.460> this<00:06:08.580> installs<00:06:10.280> well

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
to get at that while this installs well

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.050 
to get at that while this installs well
weirdly<00:06:12.690> enough<00:06:12.780> I<00:06:13.289> mean<00:06:13.530> just<00:06:13.849> start<00:06:14.849> it<00:06:14.970> up

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
weirdly enough I mean just start it up

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.120 
weirdly enough I mean just start it up
