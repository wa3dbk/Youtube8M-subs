00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
a little disappointed

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.330 
a little disappointed
that<00:02:12.849> it<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:14.590> says<00:02:14.890> light<00:02:15.099> to<00:02:15.250> medium

that it is it says light to medium
coverage<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:16.090> would<00:02:16.330> say<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.510> it's<00:02:16.750> more<00:02:16.930> on

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
coverage I would say that it's more on

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.320 
coverage I would say that it's more on
the<00:02:17.170> wider<00:02:17.379> end<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:17.830> spectrum<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.489> can<00:02:19.180> see

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
the wider end of the spectrum I can see

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.750 
the wider end of the spectrum I can see
how<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.480> would<00:02:19.690> build<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.080> but<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.290> i

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
how you would build it but I i

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.680 
how you would build it but I i

personally wouldn't want to build it up

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.170 
personally wouldn't want to build it up

wanted to like this especially because

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.710 
wanted to like this especially because
the<00:03:07.959> first<00:03:08.200> two<00:03:08.709> times<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.190> tried<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.720> I

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
the first two times that I tried it I

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.319 
the first two times that I tried it I
did<00:03:11.620> seem<00:03:11.859> to<00:03:11.980> like<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.220> it<00:03:12.609> was<00:03:12.790> but<00:03:13.030> the

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
did seem to like it it was but the

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.509 
did seem to like it it was but the
problem<00:03:13.870> is<00:03:14.019> when<00:03:14.200> they<00:03:14.379> I<00:03:14.680> had<00:03:15.129> the<00:03:15.250> first<00:03:15.370> two

problem is when they I had the first two

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.890 
problem is when they I had the first two
times<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.819> I<00:03:15.879> tried<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.239> was<00:03:16.450> they<00:03:16.629> had<00:03:16.750> put

what I was already wearing which I found

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.680 
what I was already wearing which I found
really<00:03:30.220> strange<00:03:30.819> but<00:03:31.810> oh<00:03:33.090> well<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.120> guess<00:03:34.359> so

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
really strange but oh well I guess so

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.000 
really strange but oh well I guess so
that's<00:03:34.840> definitely<00:03:35.079> why<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.470> couldn't<00:03:35.739> wait<00:03:35.919> to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
that's definitely why I couldn't wait to

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.699 
that's definitely why I couldn't wait to

didn't<00:04:07.180> look<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.389> same<00:04:07.510> as<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:07.870> had<00:04:08.049> put<00:04:08.349> it<00:04:08.440> on

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
didn't look the same as I had put it on

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.640 
didn't look the same as I had put it on
in<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.799> morning<00:04:08.889> and<00:04:09.459> put<00:04:09.609> it<00:04:09.699> that<00:04:09.819> way<00:04:09.879> so<00:04:10.750> if

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
in the morning and put it that way so if

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.240

you<00:04:12.129> have<00:04:12.900> drier<00:04:13.900> skin<00:04:14.199> you<00:04:14.680> may<00:04:14.799> really<00:04:15.010> like

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
you have drier skin you may really like

this<00:04:15.459> I<00:04:15.730> Nessus<00:04:16.690> I<00:04:16.870> wouldn't<00:04:17.169> necessarily

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
this I Nessus I wouldn't necessarily

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.990 
this I Nessus I wouldn't necessarily
recommend<00:04:17.739> it<00:04:18.130> if<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:18.310> have<00:04:18.400> oily<00:04:18.579> skin<00:04:18.760> I

recommend it if you have oily skin I

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.120 
recommend it if you have oily skin I
think<00:04:19.269> it<00:04:19.329> would<00:04:19.419> be<00:04:19.539> way<00:04:19.690> too<00:04:19.750> much<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.109> if<00:04:20.829> it

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
think it would be way too much and if it

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.580 
think it would be way too much and if it
makes<00:04:21.310> me<00:04:21.820> feel<00:04:22.030> like<00:04:22.659> this<00:04:23.200> is<00:04:23.349> how<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.500> feel

if I had oil a skin now and then put

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.290 
if I had oil a skin now and then put
this<00:04:28.470> on<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:29.090> would<00:04:30.090> feel<00:04:30.330> so<00:04:31.289> unbelievably

newer I wanted to get that out there and

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.990 
newer I wanted to get that out there and
they<00:04:39.690> do<00:04:39.750> have<00:04:39.990> a<00:04:40.370> they<00:04:41.370> don't<00:04:41.550> have<00:04:41.669> the<00:04:41.789> best

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000

they do have a they don't have the best
shade<00:04:42.270> range<00:04:42.569> it<00:04:43.110> seemed<00:04:43.500> like<00:04:43.770> they<00:04:44.310> didn't

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
shade range it seemed like they didn't

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.950 
shade range it seemed like they didn't
go<00:04:44.610> too<00:04:44.669> dark<00:04:45.120> so<00:04:45.210> if<00:04:45.389> you're<00:04:45.509> darker<00:04:45.750> skin

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960
