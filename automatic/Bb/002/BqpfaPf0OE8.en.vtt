so<00:00:21.789> bye<00:00:21.970> I<00:00:22.000> will<00:00:22.510> get<00:00:22.660> it<00:00:22.779> closed<00:00:23.080> and<00:00:23.380> then

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
so bye I will get it closed and then

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.320 
so bye I will get it closed and then
we'll<00:00:23.859> add<00:00:24.039> our<00:00:24.220> indicator<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:25.930> spindle

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
we'll add our indicator to the spindle

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.529 
we'll add our indicator to the spindle
and<00:00:29.130> indicate<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.279> hole<00:00:30.460> until<00:00:30.759> it's<00:00:31.090> exactly

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
and indicate the hole until it's exactly

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.290 
and indicate the hole until it's exactly
on<00:00:31.779> center

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.690 

once<00:00:36.870> we've<00:00:37.050> indicated<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.770> whole<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.580> it

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
once we've indicated the whole so it

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.540 
once we've indicated the whole so it
reads<00:00:38.970> the<00:00:39.210> same<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.810> around<00:00:40.190> we<00:00:41.190> now<00:00:41.340> know

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
reads the same all around we now know

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.200 
reads the same all around we now know
we're<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.850> Center<00:00:43.280> set<00:00:44.280> your<00:00:44.490> digital<00:00:44.850> readout

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
we're on Center set your digital readout

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.720 
we're on Center set your digital readout
to<00:00:45.450> read<00:00:45.630> XY<00:00:46.200> 0

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.110 

and<00:00:52.360> now<00:00:52.540> we<00:00:52.600> can<00:00:52.960> set<00:00:53.170> up<00:00:53.200> our<00:00:53.410> part<00:00:53.650> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
and now we can set up our part the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.420 
and now we can set up our part the
center<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.330> our<00:00:55.450> rotary<00:00:55.780> table<00:00:56.290> and<00:00:56.470> part<00:00:56.800> what

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
center of our rotary table and part what

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.420 
center of our rotary table and part what
we<00:00:57.550> now<00:00:57.670> need<00:00:57.880> to<00:00:57.940> do<00:00:58.210> is<00:00:58.450> move<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.930> y-axis<00:00:59.680> so

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
we now need to do is move the y-axis so

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.090 
we now need to do is move the y-axis so
that<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.820> edge<00:01:00.970> of<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.240> tool<00:01:01.480> will<00:01:02.440> be<00:01:02.680> past

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
that the edge of the tool will be past

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.040 
that the edge of the tool will be past
the<00:01:03.430> edge<00:01:03.580> of<00:01:03.760> our<00:01:03.910> part<00:01:04.210> will<00:01:04.600> feed<00:01:04.870> our

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
the edge of our part will feed our

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.350 
the edge of our part will feed our
y-axis<00:01:05.230> into<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.190> appropriate<00:01:06.760> number<00:01:07.120> and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
y-axis into the appropriate number and

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.630 
y-axis into the appropriate number and
then<00:01:07.840> we'll<00:01:07.990> engage<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.530> rotary<00:01:08.860> table<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.490> go

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
then we'll engage the rotary table to go

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.920 
then we'll engage the rotary table to go
around<00:01:09.940> in<00:01:10.600> this<00:01:10.780> particular<00:01:11.140> case<00:01:12.660> we<00:01:13.660> have<00:01:13.900> a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
around in this particular case we have a

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.980 
around in this particular case we have a
half<00:01:14.200> inch<00:01:14.410> diameter<00:01:14.710> cutting<00:01:15.310> tool<00:01:15.550> and<00:01:15.990> we

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
half inch diameter cutting tool and we

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.280 
half inch diameter cutting tool and we
require<00:01:17.380> 3/8<00:01:17.979> radius<00:01:18.430> on<00:01:18.580> our<00:01:18.700> part<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:20.140> we'll

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
require 3/8 radius on our part so we'll

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
require 3/8 radius on our part so we'll
move<00:01:20.470> our<00:01:20.650> tool<00:01:20.890> way<00:01:21.490> out<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:21.940> y-axis

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
move our tool way out in the y-axis

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.330 
move our tool way out in the y-axis
we'll<00:01:25.270> turn<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:25.869> on<00:01:25.960> lower<00:01:26.500> down<00:01:26.830> here<00:01:27.130> in<00:01:27.220> the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
we'll turn it on lower down here in the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.460 
we'll turn it on lower down here in the
clearance<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:27.790> our<00:01:27.940> fixture<00:01:28.360> feed<00:01:29.020> into<00:01:29.440> our

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
clearance and our fixture feed into our

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.109 
clearance and our fixture feed into our
number<00:01:29.800> so<00:01:30.190> our<00:01:30.310> number<00:01:30.580> we're<00:01:30.729> going<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.940> feed

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
number so our number we're going to feed

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.499 
number so our number we're going to feed
into<00:01:31.300> on<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:31.600> y-axis<00:01:32.259> keeping<00:01:33.070> X<00:01:33.280> on<00:01:33.490> 0<00:01:33.820> is<00:01:34.240> the

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
into on the y-axis keeping X on 0 is the

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.719 
into on the y-axis keeping X on 0 is the
radius<00:01:34.869> of<00:01:34.990> our<00:01:35.140> cutter<00:01:35.410> plus<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:36.220> radius<00:01:36.369> of

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
radius of our cutter plus the radius of

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.880 
radius of our cutter plus the radius of
our<00:01:36.850> part<00:01:37.150> so<00:01:37.900> we<00:01:38.020> have<00:01:38.170> three<00:01:38.470> two<00:01:38.710> part

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
our part so we have three two part

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.550 
our part so we have three two part
radius<00:01:39.340> plus<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.119> quarter<00:01:40.660> inch<00:01:40.840> tool<00:01:41.140> ratings

00:01:41.560 --> 00:02:21.100 
radius plus a quarter inch tool ratings
3/8<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:42.790> 1/4<00:01:43.300> is<00:01:43.630> five-eighths

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.780 

once<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.740> reach<00:02:21.980> five-eighths<00:02:22.430> I'm<00:02:22.610> going<00:02:22.730> to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
once I reach five-eighths I'm going to

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.320 
once I reach five-eighths I'm going to
lightly<00:02:23.210> lock<00:02:23.660> y-axes<00:02:24.620> our<00:02:25.580> tools<00:02:25.880> should<00:02:26.180> now

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
lightly lock y-axes our tools should now

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.510 
lightly lock y-axes our tools should now
be<00:02:26.540> just<00:02:26.930> touching<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.710> material

be just touching the material

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.630 
be just touching the material
we<00:02:30.210> want<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.510> full<00:02:30.780> 180<00:02:31.320> degree<00:02:31.740> arc<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.460> we're

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
we want a full 180 degree arc so we're

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.400 
we want a full 180 degree arc so we're
going<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.940> rotate<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.750> from<00:02:34.740> 90<00:02:35.360> plus<00:02:36.360> 180<00:02:37.110> to
