 I brought inside ro swivel juninho and 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.260
 Pro is from andré who was more

 calm to dominate and push to the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.980

 now to 2 for the botafogo a country with a 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.760
 goal to keep Basque connected there 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.950
 will have a first-half finish 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.750
 exciting thing that the Basque will 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.459
 Go up and show the botafogo. 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.280
 that the game is not decided 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.290

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:13.340
 lifted his head rang for the entrance 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.340

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.060
 to the network 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.490
 at the Eder Luís kick 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.520
 then will try to review that bid the 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.280
 andré maybe on the same line is seeing 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.750
 A little bit ahead, you get caught. 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.370
 rebound of the beam 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.500

 dominates rafael marques went inside 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.880
 of the stand area and rebounded I think the goal 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:29.000
 the Botafogo and is the second of rafael 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.910
 marques 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.920
 he puts the botafogo on the front again 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:39.050
 Rick beautiful goal invading area dribbled out of 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.450
 you will review the bid the legal position 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.510
 here at rafael marques 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:50.030
 He dominates, goes to the inside, leaves to the ground. 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:53.210
 the half hits high crossed to left the 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.690
