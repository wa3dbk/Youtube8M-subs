I've<00:03:06.540> been<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.959> dreaming<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.680> shot<00:03:08.150> where<00:03:09.150> I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
I've been to dreaming of a shot where I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.910 
I've been to dreaming of a shot where I
could<00:03:09.450> see<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> bird<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.140> foreground<00:03:10.440> and

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
could see a bird in the foreground and

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.830 
could see a bird in the foreground and
be<00:03:11.489> looking<00:03:11.790> out<00:03:11.880> over<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.209> rainforest<00:03:12.390> in

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
be looking out over the rainforest in

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.070 
be looking out over the rainforest in
the<00:03:12.870> background<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.510> saw<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.810> shot

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
the background and I and I saw the shot

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.840 
the background and I and I saw the shot
down<00:03:16.320> loaded<00:03:16.680> my<00:03:16.739> laptop<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.459> said<00:03:17.700> look

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
down loaded my laptop and I said look

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.750 
down loaded my laptop and I said look
that's<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:19.350> knew<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.590> had<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:22.760> that

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
that's it I just I knew I had it that

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.610 
that's it I just I knew I had it that
was<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.910> real<00:03:24.090> real<00:03:24.480> upsetting<00:03:24.959> moment<00:03:25.260> where<00:03:25.380> I

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
was a real real upsetting moment where I

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.740 
was a real real upsetting moment where I
had<00:03:25.980> said<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.340> sense<00:03:26.550> of<00:03:26.670> success<00:03:26.880> after<00:03:27.360> all

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
had said that sense of success after all

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.420 
had said that sense of success after all
these<00:03:28.290> years<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.590> sort<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:28.890> dreaming<00:03:29.220> about<00:03:29.340> a

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
these years of sort of dreaming about a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.880 
these years of sort of dreaming about a
shot<00:03:29.670> like<00:03:29.850> that
