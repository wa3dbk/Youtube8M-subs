00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.399
 all right 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.399
 ah 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.379
 these tents have a history of 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.420
 more than 50 years here have passed 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.590
 several generations of artists 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.779
 circus clowns acrobats and tamers 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.329
 It's the Beijing Chinese circus that today 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.700
 it goes through a pothole almost impossible to 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.820
 happen 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.140
 behind were the years of apogee 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.660
 those in which the tickets are 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.410
 they ran out and the seats filled with 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.660
 whole families today just reach 20 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.860
 percent attendance 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:51.210
 very difficult because let's say it's from a 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.489
 percentage almost without fills is more to 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.320
 sometimes we have up to 100 full under 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.780
 a 20 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.840
 15% already already be the people do not 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.840
 interest 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.900
 with the entry into force of the circus law 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.020
 without animals the circus show 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.330
 Chinese Beijing had to be modified and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.490
 with her spectacles went 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.890
 the bengal tigers the horses 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.130
 Arab camels zebras giraffes and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.409
 primates the spaces left by the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.149
 exotic species were covered with 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.759
 musical shows with dancers 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.970
 professionals plus clown acts and 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.179
 acrobatics the change has been complicated 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.800
 to say of the managers the circus no longer 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.690
 it is so attractive to 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.399
 spectators for the animals what 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.770
 we saved on a ranch 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.500
 outskirts of mexico 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.920
 waiting now, what do you say? 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.229
 we are approached by some deputy or some 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 senator or the people who pushed the law of 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.969
 to remove the animals from the circuses 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.939
 to give us an answer in a year 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.990
 the workforce was reduced from 150 to 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:07.740
 70 workers of 50 freight vehicles 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.110
 there are only four left in these tents and 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.660
 there are no cages or drinking fountains 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.200
 animals are only memories and 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.190
 stamped outside the trailers 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.040
 unfortunately we can not present 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.099
 our animals but we bring great 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.560
 artists we bring very good clowns and the 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.459
