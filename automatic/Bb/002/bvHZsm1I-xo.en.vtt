ceramic skateboard bearings and steel
skateboard<00:00:16.080> bearings<00:00:16.760> first<00:00:17.760> off<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
skateboard bearings first off the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.510 
skateboard bearings first off the
difference<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> can<00:00:19.410> think<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.010> about

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
difference that I can think of is about

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.710 
difference that I can think of is about
eighty<00:00:21.449> dollars<00:00:22.050> because<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:23.340> set<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:24.060> ceramics

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
eighty dollars because a set of ceramics

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.820 
eighty dollars because a set of ceramics
is<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.050> run<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.260> about<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.560> hundred

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
is going to run you about a hundred

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.630 
is going to run you about a hundred
dollars<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:27.390> pretty<00:00:27.779> good<00:00:28.019> set<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.710> regular

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
dollars and a pretty good set of regular

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.250 
dollars and a pretty good set of regular
steel<00:00:29.939> bearings<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.539> somewhere<00:00:31.140> around

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
steel bearings is somewhere around

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.830 
steel bearings is somewhere around
twenty<00:00:31.800> dollars<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:33.149> should<00:00:33.360> pay<00:00:33.570> about

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
twenty dollars you should pay about

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.400 
twenty dollars you should pay about
twenty<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.739> fifty<00:00:35.070> dollars<00:00:36.410> somewhere

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
twenty to fifty dollars somewhere

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.260 
twenty to fifty dollars somewhere
varying<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.920> there<00:00:38.129> depending<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.820> quality

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
varying in there depending on quality

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.930 
varying in there depending on quality
level<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.960> steel<00:00:40.260> bearings<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.920> when<00:00:41.850> it

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
level for steel bearings and when it

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.350 
level for steel bearings and when it
comes<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.390> buying<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.980> ceramic<00:00:44.910> bearings<00:00:45.270> is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
comes to buying the ceramic bearings is

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.760 
comes to buying the ceramic bearings is
going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.660> more<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> hundred<00:00:46.260> dollars

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
going to be more like a hundred dollars

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.400 
going to be more like a hundred dollars
I<00:00:47.059> think<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> only<00:00:48.360> companies<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.110> make

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
I think the only companies that make

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.580 
I think the only companies that make
ceramic<00:00:49.980> bearings<00:00:50.340> are<00:00:50.690> lucky<00:00:51.690> bearings<00:00:52.289> and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
ceramic bearings are lucky bearings and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.970 
ceramic bearings are lucky bearings and
and<00:00:54.949> powell<00:00:55.949> peralta<00:00:56.250> makes<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.000> swiss

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
and powell peralta makes the swiss

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.910 
and powell peralta makes the swiss
ceramics<00:00:58.980> now<00:01:00.440> ceramic<00:01:01.440> bearings<00:01:01.770> are

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
ceramics now ceramic bearings are

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.979 
ceramics now ceramic bearings are
supposed<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.520> better<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.809> don't

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
supposed to be better because they don't

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.000 
supposed to be better because they don't
break<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.500> from<00:01:05.430> heat<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.659> they<00:01:06.840> don't<00:01:07.290> they

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
break down from heat so they don't they

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.429 
break down from heat so they don't they
don't<00:01:08.040> get<00:01:09.030> stuck<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.659> spinning<00:01:10.350> around

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
don't get stuck in there spinning around

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.649 
don't get stuck in there spinning around
really<00:01:10.770> really<00:01:11.010> fast<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> heat<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.150> then

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
really really fast and heat up and then

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.840 
really really fast and heat up and then
give<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.930> problems<00:01:13.640> they're<00:01:14.640> probably

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
give you problems they're probably

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.820 
give you problems they're probably
better<00:01:15.299> for<00:01:15.390> downhill<00:01:15.720> skateboarding<00:01:16.530> let's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
better for downhill skateboarding let's

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.200 
better for downhill skateboarding let's
say<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.100> want<00:01:17.430> bearings<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.850> go<00:01:18.000> really

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
say you want bearings that go really

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.940 
say you want bearings that go really
fast<00:01:18.570> let's<00:01:19.020> say<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.170> get<00:01:19.439> you're<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
fast let's say you get you're going to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.010 
fast let's say you get you're going to
be<00:01:20.070> doing<00:01:20.189> 35<00:01:20.670> miles<00:01:21.119> per<00:01:21.270> hour<00:01:21.420> while<00:01:21.689> bombing

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
be doing 35 miles per hour while bombing

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.810 
be doing 35 miles per hour while bombing
a<00:01:22.080> hill<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.710> probably<00:01:22.950> want<00:01:23.340> ceramic

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
a hill you probably want ceramic

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.789 
a hill you probably want ceramic
bearings<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.350> your<00:01:25.380> price<00:01:25.650> range

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
bearings and if it's in your price range

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.190 
bearings and if it's in your price range
and<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.340> afford<00:01:26.610> those<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.150> think<00:01:28.049> they

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
and you can afford those I think they

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.230 
and you can afford those I think they
last<00:01:28.439> forever<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.220> mean<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:29.850> don't<00:01:30.030> really

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
last forever I mean they don't really

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.090 
last forever I mean they don't really
break<00:01:30.509> down<00:01:30.540> there<00:01:31.079> pretty<00:01:31.259> great<00:01:31.500> bearing<00:01:31.950> so

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
break down there pretty great bearing so

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.410 
break down there pretty great bearing so
if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.400> afford<00:01:32.490> them<00:01:32.759> get<00:01:33.270> those

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
if you can afford them get those

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.289 
if you can afford them get those
bearings<00:01:34.040> steel<00:01:35.040> bearings<00:01:35.430> pretty<00:01:35.850> good<00:01:36.060> for

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
bearings steel bearings pretty good for

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.109 
bearings steel bearings pretty good for
most<00:01:36.750> normal<00:01:37.380> Street<00:01:37.799> skateboarding<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.700> don't

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
most normal Street skateboarding I don't

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.130 
most normal Street skateboarding I don't
see<00:01:39.329> any<00:01:39.509> I've<00:01:39.810> never<00:01:40.020> had<00:01:40.229> any<00:01:40.380> problems<00:01:40.860> a
