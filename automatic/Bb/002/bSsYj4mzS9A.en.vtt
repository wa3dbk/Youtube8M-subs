says humor than half so it's shocking
it's<00:02:50.610> surprising<00:02:51.610> we're<00:02:51.790> not<00:02:51.940> too<00:02:52.120> sure

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
it's surprising we're not too sure

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.940 
it's surprising we're not too sure
what's<00:02:52.480> going<00:02:52.630> on<00:02:52.750> there<00:02:52.810> exactly<00:02:53.410> we<00:02:53.830> can

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
what's going on there exactly we can

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.890 
what's going on there exactly we can
make<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.070> lot<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.280> inferences<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.210> deductions

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
make a lot of inferences and deductions

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.350 
make a lot of inferences and deductions
like<00:02:56.650> how<00:02:57.040> because<00:02:57.700> he's<00:02:57.910> in<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.060> complete

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
like how because he's in a complete

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.110 
like how because he's in a complete
being<00:02:58.600> he's<00:02:59.380> unaffected<00:02:59.770> by<00:03:00.160> ray<00:03:00.670> out<00:03:00.700> to

fucking<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.850> know<00:03:12.940> let<00:03:13.090> me<00:03:13.120> do<00:03:13.210> it<00:03:13.330> that

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
fucking you know let me do it that

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.530 
fucking you know let me do it that
because<00:03:13.600> we<00:03:13.870> can<00:03:13.990> go<00:03:14.080> on<00:03:14.290> on<00:03:14.590> on<00:03:14.830> on<00:03:15.010> up<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:15.880> the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
because we can go on on on on up so the

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.880 
because we can go on on on on up so the
whole<00:03:16.720> point<00:03:16.960> here<00:03:17.080> is<00:03:18.390> this<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:19.600> where<00:03:19.810> we<00:03:20.740> can

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
whole point here is this is where we can

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.800 
whole point here is this is where we can
kind<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:21.460> see<00:03:21.820> a<00:03:22.390> rift<00:03:23.350> forming<00:03:24.070> between<00:03:24.810> judo

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
kind of see a rift forming between judo

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.490 
kind of see a rift forming between judo
and<00:03:26.170> bass<00:03:26.410> beat<00:03:26.710> and<00:03:27.450> this<00:03:28.450> is<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.780> initials

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
and bass beat and this is the initials

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.370 
and bass beat and this is the initials
like<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.640> catalyst<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.380> jewel

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
like this is the catalyst of jewel

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.890 
like this is the catalyst of jewel
becoming<00:03:32.770> the<00:03:32.860> man<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:33.310> he<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.459> today

at all and when the paradigm and that

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.600 
at all and when the paradigm and that
switches<00:03:48.790> almost<00:03:49.510> instantly<00:03:50.200> where<00:03:51.040> the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
switches almost instantly where the

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.680 
switches almost instantly where the
prodigy<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:53.170> one<00:03:53.410> who<00:03:54.070> is<00:03:54.280> beneath<00:03:54.940> the

prodigy is the one who is beneath the

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.199 
prodigy is the one who is beneath the
incomplete<00:03:56.260> being<00:03:56.650> that's<00:03:57.400> going<00:03:57.580> to<00:03:57.640> have<00:03:57.910> an

incomplete being that's going to have an

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.870 
incomplete being that's going to have an
obvious<00:03:59.010> psychological<00:04:00.010> effect<00:04:00.250> on<00:04:00.400> both<00:04:00.670> as

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
obvious psychological effect on both as

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.320 
obvious psychological effect on both as
the<00:04:01.120> end<00:04:01.300> judo<00:04:02.170> so<00:04:02.680> how<00:04:03.280> this<00:04:03.490> rolls<00:04:03.790> I'm<00:04:04.090> not

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
the end judo so how this rolls I'm not

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.830 
the end judo so how this rolls I'm not
too<00:04:04.570> sure<00:04:05.490> exactly<00:04:06.490> but<00:04:06.850> we<00:04:07.480> know<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.750> end

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
too sure exactly but we know the end

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.740 
too sure exactly but we know the end
result<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.580> that's<00:04:09.580> it<00:04:09.790> at<00:04:10.390> least<00:04:10.510> for<00:04:10.690> the

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
result and that's it at least for the

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.150 
result and that's it at least for the
most<00:04:10.900> part<00:04:11.020> because<00:04:11.260> we<00:04:11.380> can't<00:04:11.620> because<00:04:11.920> we're

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
most part because we can't because we're

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.910 
most part because we can't because we're
not<00:04:12.190> too<00:04:12.430> sure<00:04:12.459> if<00:04:12.990> judo<00:04:13.990> so<00:04:14.380> wants<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.709> kill

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
not too sure if judo so wants to kill

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.349 
not too sure if judo so wants to kill
you<00:04:15.220> out<00:04:15.400> we're<00:04:15.610> not<00:04:15.730> too<00:04:15.940> sure<00:04:15.970> at<00:04:16.270> all

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
you out we're not too sure at all

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.720 
you out we're not too sure at all
because<00:04:17.140> as<00:04:17.590> far<00:04:17.650> as<00:04:17.830> you<00:04:18.040> understand<00:04:18.459> the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
because as far as you understand the

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.100 
because as far as you understand the
corner<00:04:19.030> Baz<00:04:19.209> be<00:04:19.739> judo<00:04:20.739> betrayed<00:04:21.400> badges

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
corner Baz be judo betrayed badges

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.790 
corner Baz be judo betrayed badges
expectations<00:04:23.110> and<00:04:23.970> he<00:04:24.970> serves<00:04:25.630> you<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:25.930> loyally

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
expectations and he serves you I loyally

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.840 
expectations and he serves you I loyally
faithfully<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:28.000> how<00:04:28.930> rules<00:04:29.260> specifically

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
faithfully so how rules specifically

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.969 
faithfully so how rules specifically
again<00:04:30.850> not<00:04:31.000> too<00:04:31.150> sure<00:04:31.390> and<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:32.290> end<00:04:32.350> result<00:04:32.530> is

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
again not too sure and the end result is

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.950 
again not too sure and the end result is
for<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.610> most<00:04:33.790> part<00:04:34.030> clear<00:04:34.419> but<00:04:34.840> not

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
for the most part clear but not

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.719 
for the most part clear but not
completely<00:04:35.470> clear<00:04:35.710> but<00:04:36.190> that's<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.400> chapter

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
completely clear but that's the chapter

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:37.110 
completely clear but that's the chapter
that's

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
that's

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.909 
that's
it<00:04:37.180> so<00:04:37.570> overall<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.229> rating<00:04:38.530> is<00:04:38.560> going<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:38.800> be
