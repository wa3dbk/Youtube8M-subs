00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:12.210
 It 's just that I'm talking now that I'm 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.420
 Speaking here, Luis, everyone is welcome. 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.180
 To another video today I bring 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.060
 for you makley of contributors 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.570
 playing on the name map or strike 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.189
 sorry am the rope the two is in reality 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.990
 the same map, right? 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.019
 but anyway that video was really cool 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.840
 to really show you that the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.940
 two are the same map, but anyway it's a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.210
 it's a pretty cool test to play one of the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.610
 maps more calculation ways and ghosts 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.379
 and it is no wonder that the vast majority of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.510
 matches that you are watching my channel 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.090
 and in the other channels promises is always 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.010
 This map and sound ends up enjoying a lot. 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.600
 money because he is very nice has 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.140
 sometimes I've been very interesting 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.300
 small and still have the option of you 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.030
 use the queen street and with that you 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.420
 end up modifying snow were reading all over 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.360
 the scenery making it even cooler 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.799
 and with a greater incentive of you to want 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.170
 play on it call what is strange that 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.130
 either in the box or in the killing race 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.020
 25 opponents but finally the video a focus 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.750
 of today's gold video is completely 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.049
 different said we are talking 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.460
 and just want to start talking about it 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.280
 of today's video 16 compared to the last 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.750
 video Collor system or actor tava 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.420
 cool maybe say you were kind 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.880
 pink where it was also pink red 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.820
 anyway it really is that and I do not 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.979
 I remember enabled the radar system 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.350
 the tonic it ends up changing the color of the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.060
 game but according to what you'll say 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.250
 probably because the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.560
 red part of the game is half pink 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.540
 anyway should be that same thing that should have 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.450
 activated so the gameplay stays 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.040
 strange the coloring of the map since we 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.840
 other things you change the system of 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.399
 color for color blind and it does not change the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.040
 coloring the map it changes only the mini 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.079
 map in pocket and really changes 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.720
 appears the color of the map in getting one 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.229
 little different then in these game place 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.760
 even though I 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.400
 Bringing you will have this system 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.200
 mail is half pink 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.720
 not that I want but unfortunately it goes 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.510
 continue to do so and from the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.480
 game place that I start capturing such 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.569
 Probably then, yes, I'll come and see 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.090
 game play come out with the right image but 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.310
 finally let's get into the focus of the video is 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.310
 That we are already in 2 minutes and 30 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.079
 I took you here you rolling 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.599
 they are seeing there is a match a 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.370
 let's not say so random you go 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.890
 to be able to check it out 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.200
 You know I got in the game. 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.180
 We started playing my team and we are 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.000
 You've been missing since the beginning of the game. 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.650
 Until now we're losing and this 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.359
 it's probably going to continue 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.819
 You will see a game until the end. 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.970
 very complicated to play the team 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.010
 opponent was very difficult and even 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.599
 Some people have already told me it 's people. 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.670
 leaving a comment of the bridge here 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.680
 You only play the match when you play. 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.459
 wins the match when you lose too 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.079
 at the end of the match you go wrong so 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.060
 I was watching my videos that I 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.889
 I have recorded the game because now the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.510
 We have to record every game place. 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.459
 Because there's no more twitter, there's no more 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.680
 malt nothing and with that is fair in 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.870
 capture all here the game place and 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.150
 many of them are not really good at 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.310
 most all of the junk good 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.459
 it's a few matches are really good 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.310
 good are possible let's say so 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.109
 This is a game that I do not 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.209
 not in normal situations I might not 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.480
 I would bring you guys but I really wanted to 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.400
 bring because it 's a different match 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.739
 a match where my team like you 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.599
 they are taking it is not a 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.880
 but then at a disadvantage it is 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.669
 losing the opposing team gave a 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.709
 advantage over ours nor the 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.810
 players of the opposing team had a 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.419
 better quality than my uncle had 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.669
 players more skilled at this than 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:04.560
 people ended up suffering a lot on my team 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.060
 basically I was I think the only one 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.550
 stay 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.670
 reason for this title and was also 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.319
 female was not positive but not 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.930
 was negative was to them for they 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.660
 I'm not a member of the right 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.609
 score but this type of match that is 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.010
 basically to show you how 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.080
 the gameplay are very random 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.330
 sympathy goes you go very well party 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.790
 You 're very bad at starting, will you? 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.419
 neutral does not kill much does not die much 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.100
 sometimes it does not turn negative into positive 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.720
 finally they are very different matches 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.260
 different matches with an opponent 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.120
 different and yet I want to get into 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.900
 the topic of today's video that is 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.120
 You can have fun even if you lose. 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.150
 or you just have fun when you win 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.740
 be stopped to think so push 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.290
 sometimes you get pissed that a guy from 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.720
 your team went side made 2/1 15 for example 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.639
 the super negative of light rage because the 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.500
 face ended up wanting or not sinking the 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.940
 team is for you, you end up losing because of 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.330
 of this individual 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.160
 but if you stop to analyze the 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.289
 difficulties provided in this 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.240
 the case of your team is sinking 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.250
 He has more than one guy. 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.960
 doing this is much worse in this practice 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.970
 had three guys for example doing 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.250
 This then offends the game. 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.160
 whole but they are different situations 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.740
 They end up putting it on for you and you have 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.140
 that surpassing my team is playing well 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.570
 so beauty started to play secure 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.039
 quieter, more rhythmic was this 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:35.060
 that I made this match gave an insured 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.710
 to try to compensate for the shortfall 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.660
 my friends of you, right? 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.010
 I was not able to make conversation 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.510
 To you, I was very angry at this. 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.950
 because I was trying to play not 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.900
 I was able to take a sequence 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.039
 good because the opposing team was well 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.630
 balanced 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.910
 There were guys you could not take away. 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.740
 dying in no way and always had 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.280
 that damn dog you kill 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.200
 dog owner and a dog will charge 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.100
 before he came vice nobody over 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.380
 you 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.600
 This ended up making me very pissed off. 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.020
 life but it was a match with 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.090
 many difficulties but I ended up 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.240
 having fun enough because I got it 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.509
 overlapped me 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.180
 It's how he's going to tell you at last. 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.009
 I have managed to overcome myself in relation to 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.990
 My gameplay item we got 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.750
 overcome the difficulties and there 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.449
 Yes, I got a farm that I had 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:28.270
 good performance at the end of the game 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.190
 as much as my team did not win and still 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.419
 I was able to stand out from the 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.460
 other opponents 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.780
 This made me very happy and 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.120
 That's why I'm bringing you the 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.819
 I even started the fault that the 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.639
 Ikka I stayed 30/10 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:44.530
 it was a great score I'm going to put 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:48.669
 even more due to the proportions of the team 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:51.340
 léo 2 bar 17 2 10 3 4 10 14 13 13 anyway 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:53.259
 my team only took lead but anyway 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.000
 It was cool so this is it, it's a video one 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.620
 little different with 13 tests and I hope 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.919
 that you have understood that 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:03.250
 not always winning a match is a matter 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:05.289
 of fun and if you have the 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.539
 difficulties they have in learning has that 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:09.970
 line of learning and with that you 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:12.370
 You can even lose by getting 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:16.180
 fun can evolve into a gameplay 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:19.449
 de koff last and even more decode goals 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:22.539
 who is very hardcore hardcore is not core 

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:24.070
 finally you end up having to play with 

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:26.530
 much more intelligence than any other 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.360
 another game in the galera series, I hope 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.580
 You liked it so much. 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.360
 company and we see each other in 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.360
 video bye
