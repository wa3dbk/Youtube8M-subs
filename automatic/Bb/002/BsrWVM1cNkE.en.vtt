when I first install rom I couldn't see

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.089 
when I first install rom I couldn't see
multi<00:02:38.690> window<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.349> took<00:02:39.530> me<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.709> while<00:02:40.040> to

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
multi window and it took me a while to

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.920 
multi window and it took me a while to
figure<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.670> out<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.030> once<00:02:41.569> you<00:02:41.750> have<00:02:41.900> that

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
figure that out and once you have that

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.720 
figure that out and once you have that
in<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.349> quick<00:02:42.560> toggles<00:02:42.769> you<00:02:43.099> can<00:02:43.250> enable<00:02:43.459> it

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
in the quick toggles you can enable it

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.619 
in the quick toggles you can enable it
and<00:02:43.970> also<00:02:44.599> you<00:02:44.870> can<00:02:45.879> move<00:02:46.879> that<00:02:47.150> up<00:02:47.299> a<00:02:47.480> little

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
and also you can move that up a little

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.360 
and also you can move that up a little
bit<00:02:47.840> let's<00:02:48.230> change<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.680> button<00:02:48.859> orders<00:02:49.160> here

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
bit let's change the button orders here

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.509 
bit let's change the button orders here
so<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:50.390> can<00:02:50.540> do<00:02:50.690> this<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.109> make<00:02:51.829> multi<00:02:52.340> window

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
so you can do this and make multi window

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.780 
so you can do this and make multi window
easier<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.329> access<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:54.230> let's<00:02:55.190> actually<00:02:55.370> put

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
easier to access and let's actually put

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.289 
easier to access and let's actually put
it<00:02:56.380> way<00:02:57.380> up<00:02:57.889> here<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:59.319> like<00:03:00.319> it<00:03:00.500> about<00:03:00.739> fifth<00:03:01.670> yes

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
it way up here I like it about fifth yes

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.120 
it way up here I like it about fifth yes
that<00:03:02.840> way<00:03:02.900> when<00:03:03.049> I<00:03:03.079> swipe<00:03:03.380> down<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.769> can<00:03:03.889> simply

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
that way when I swipe down it can simply

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.909 
that way when I swipe down it can simply
go<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.549> this<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:05.000> enable<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.840> disable<00:03:06.380> a

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
go like this to enable and disable a

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:11.289 
go like this to enable and disable a
multi<00:03:07.790> window<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:09.680> that's<00:03:10.370> pretty<00:03:10.790> much<00:03:11.000> it

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
multi window so that's pretty much it

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.440 
multi window so that's pretty much it
all<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.870> these<00:03:12.049> small<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.519> I<00:03:13.549> customizations

you<00:03:14.569> can<00:03:14.780> do<00:03:15.019> and<00:03:15.849> actually<00:03:16.849> that's<00:03:17.120> not<00:03:17.239> it

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
you can do and actually that's not it

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.220 
you can do and actually that's not it

Colonel door makes colonel
and<00:03:31.260> s<00:03:32.260> tweaks<00:03:32.650> is<00:03:33.519> force<00:03:34.390> closing<00:03:34.450> on<00:03:34.870> me<00:03:35.019> it's

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
and s tweaks is force closing on me it's

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.949 
and s tweaks is force closing on me it's
okay<00:03:35.620> just<00:03:35.769> run<00:03:35.950> it<00:03:36.069> again<00:03:36.390> there<00:03:37.390> we<00:03:37.510> go<00:03:37.689> and

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
okay just run it again there we go and

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.729 
okay just run it again there we go and
you<00:03:38.739> can<00:03:38.890> overclock<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.489> up<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.209> 1.6<00:03:40.930> gigs<00:03:41.230> my

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
you can overclock it up to 1.6 gigs my

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.750 
you can overclock it up to 1.6 gigs my
recommendation<00:03:42.489> is<00:03:42.640> about<00:03:42.879> 1.4<00:03:43.810> gigahertz

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
recommendation is about 1.4 gigahertz

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.289 
recommendation is about 1.4 gigahertz
that<00:03:45.760> will<00:03:46.000> be<00:03:46.180> plenty<00:03:47.400> turn<00:03:48.400> off<00:03:48.579> a<00:03:48.879> multi

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
that will be plenty turn off a multi

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.830 
that will be plenty turn off a multi
window<00:03:49.510> here<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:51.579> I've<00:03:51.760> got<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:52.030> at<00:03:52.120> 1.4

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
window here and I've got it at 1.4

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.390 
window here and I've got it at 1.4
that's<00:03:53.139> what<00:03:53.349> i<00:03:53.379> recommend<00:03:53.590> but<00:03:54.069> you<00:03:54.159> can<00:03:54.310> go

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
that's what i recommend but you can go

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.280 
that's what i recommend but you can go
all<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.549> way<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.790> 1.6<00:03:55.659> if<00:03:56.500> you<00:03:56.650> want<00:03:56.859> to<00:03:57.040> and

all the way to 1.6 if you want to and
you<00:03:59.290> know<00:03:59.650> s<00:03:59.920> tweaks<00:04:00.219> you<00:04:00.400> can<00:04:00.900> tweak<00:04:01.900> the

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
you know s tweaks you can tweak the

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.849 
you know s tweaks you can tweak the
voltage<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:03.269> also<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.419> GPU<00:04:04.989> if<00:04:05.169> you<00:04:05.319> want<00:04:05.530> i

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
voltage and also the GPU if you want i

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.140 
voltage and also the GPU if you want i
don't<00:04:05.950> really<00:04:06.340> recommend<00:04:06.669> it<00:04:06.909> unless<00:04:06.970> you
