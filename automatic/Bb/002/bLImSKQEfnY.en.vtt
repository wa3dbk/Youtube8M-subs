going to see that it doesn't like the
same<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.700> mine<00:00:50.969> right<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.570> again<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.260> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
same as mine right here so again this is

only for the OS 6 users only

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.619 
only for the OS 6 users only

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
unfortunately it's not available for

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.529 
unfortunately it's not available for
always<00:00:58.079> five<00:00:58.609> yes<00:01:00.260> that's<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> hear<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
always five yes that's what I hear and

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.210

pretty<00:01:03.539> much<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.199> app<00:01:04.379> has<00:01:04.409> everything<00:01:05.040> in

pretty much the app has everything in

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.789 
pretty much the app has everything in
order<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.700> think<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.780> kind<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.170> review<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
order I think this is kind of review and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.140 
order I think this is kind of review and
not<00:01:07.920> review<00:01:08.189> again<00:01:08.369> right<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.790> if<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.970> made
