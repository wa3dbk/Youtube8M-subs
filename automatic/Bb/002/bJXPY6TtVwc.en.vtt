00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:01.319
 we received 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.060
 to evaluate the new pick-up 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.780
 newly launched and will be worth a new amount 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.780
 see how the evaluation was 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:16.599
 next year at 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.989
 receiving general motors from brazil 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:23.449
 the new pick-up chevrolet montana with 16-inch wheels and sea top 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.739
 for evaluation 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.179
 we ran 1920 pounds in two weeks 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.039
 see how it was to our assessment this agreement pointing out that they evaluate the 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:34.790
 damage the best tip 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.480
 exclusive details became more evident at the same time as 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.210
 I was not minimized and the more conservative rear 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.520
 that is showing previous becomes worse 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.370
 from the dead driver's point of view 2011 almost totally the agent 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.199
 the punishment direction is higher than in the previous world 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.569
 mainly due to the possibility of adjusting the height of the seat 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.170
 and allows better visibility 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.710
 the breadth of debt launched in Ceará 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.610
 the 17 agents and auxiliaries celso roth 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.190
 and looks with life all the lower back that the onboard of the bucket fulfilled 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.320
 this sense of visual control of the environment 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.200
 in the background I evaluated the supply of equipment provides a good 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.200
 great age arbitration feel 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.630
 this falcon perception is supported by the southern counters column instruments 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.650
 steering 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.220
 the gear pedals 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.610
 by action 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.440
 He visited the hospital. 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.780
 is obvious discomfort after a certain time 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.780
 the modesty with the movement shift sequence of the movement 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.590
 the cabin has length to accommodate well the highest surfers 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.380
 this movement is a work on the nearby slopes with exits and returns and dumps 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.880
 and answers with direct advisors 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.200
 the rear suspension was muddled we became more difficult ahead with the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.450
 car knew it was reincarnation than the previous generation 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.110
 but the feeling maybe the team just along the wheel rim 16 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.739
 comparing with the rest of the new montana more aveiro factories than the roads 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.459
 and also more successful that he inherited 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.819
 there are people who did not like set a point 4 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.589
 soon had world highs 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:23.469
 we worked the gear ratio are shorter 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.670
 the consumption that gm disclosed at the launch was pointed out as the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.889
 13th day 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.899
 comma six kilometers book with gasoline 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.839
 but nine point seven kilometers from são paulo 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:36.679
 in the combined average 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:38.129
 the road control 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.189
 but in our evaluation they do not give any of this 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.400
 the best way to get an average height was collected by goias 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:47.859
 if gasoline has the spontaneous 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.839
 the anxious for it 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:54.659
 although I really liked this tape I think this time the gmc and buick
