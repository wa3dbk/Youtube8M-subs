00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
the server Miller i'll be switching

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.249 
the server Miller i'll be switching
between<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:11.250> air-to-air<00:00:12.150> loadout<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.960> the

air-to-ground loadout and with my
air-to-air<00:00:15.780> loadout<00:00:16.230> i<00:00:16.440> use<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.130> default

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
air-to-air loadout i use the default

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.779 
air-to-air loadout i use the default
nose<00:00:17.760> gun<00:00:18.029> which<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.810> m20<00:00:19.529> mas<00:00:19.740> tanya<00:00:20.130> the

way absurd this default gun is with

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.790 
way absurd this default gun is with
maximum<00:00:23.550> magazine<00:00:24.150> size<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.650> thermal<00:00:25.650> optics

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
maximum magazine size and thermal optics

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.250 
maximum magazine size and thermal optics
and<00:00:26.400> instead<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.119> secondary<00:00:27.570> weapon<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.050> use

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
and instead of a secondary weapon I use

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:39.020 
and instead of a secondary weapon I use
the<00:00:28.439> external<00:00:29.099> afterburner<00:00:29.820> fuel<00:00:30.240> tanks<00:00:38.030> sup

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the external afterburner fuel tanks sup

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.700 
the external afterburner fuel tanks sup
next<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> typical<00:00:40.290> air-to-air

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
next here you see a typical air-to-air

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.310 
next here you see a typical air-to-air
hover<00:00:41.250> duel<00:00:41.489> between<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.149> ESS<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.840> kind<00:00:43.290> of

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
hover duel between to ESS that kind of

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.830 
hover duel between to ESS that kind of
defines<00:00:43.739> why<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> choose<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.000> load<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
defines why I choose this load out and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.690 
defines why I choose this load out and
is<00:00:46.230> also<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.559> typical<00:00:46.920> example<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.370> what<00:00:47.579> has

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
is also a typical example of what has

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.850 
is also a typical example of what has
kept<00:00:47.969> my<00:00:48.180> passion<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:48.750> flying<00:00:49.200> implants<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.800> to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
kept my passion for flying implants I to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:26.680 
kept my passion for flying implants I to
for<00:00:50.640> over<00:00:50.940> two<00:00:51.180> years

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.090 

so<00:01:27.690> now<00:01:27.780> let's<00:01:27.960> switch<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.770> air-to-ground

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
so now let's switch to the air-to-ground

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
so now let's switch to the air-to-ground
load<00:01:29.460> out<00:01:29.640> where<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.240> air<00:01:30.390> hammer<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.870> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
load out where the air hammer and the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.380 
load out where the air hammer and the
rocket<00:01:31.290> pods<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.800> still<00:01:32.370> have<00:01:32.610> hover<00:01:32.940> stability

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
rocket pods I still have hover stability

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.440 
rocket pods I still have hover stability
airframe<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.080> still<00:01:34.590> use<00:01:34.910> magazine<00:01:35.910> size<00:01:36.120> for

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
airframe I still use magazine size for

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.890 
airframe I still use magazine size for
the<00:01:36.480> air<00:01:36.810> hammer<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:38.510> sometimes<00:01:39.510> I<00:01:39.660> switch<00:01:39.870> to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the air hammer and sometimes I switch to

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.680 
the air hammer and sometimes I switch to
the<00:01:40.440> flares<00:01:40.800> instead<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.910> fire

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
the flares instead of the fire

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.390 
the flares instead of the fire
suppression<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.620> in<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.800> case<00:01:44.010> I<00:01:44.220> haven't

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
suppression but in this case I haven't

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.910 
suppression but in this case I haven't
i'm<00:01:45.150> still<00:01:45.360> using<00:01:45.540> thermal<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.229> optics<00:01:46.710> on

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
i'm still using thermal for optics on

00:01:46.920 --> 00:02:23.940 
i'm still using thermal for optics on
both<00:01:47.220> weapons

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.990 

so<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.099> it<00:02:25.250> long<00:02:25.400> before<00:02:25.519> one<00:02:25.819> of<00:02:25.849> the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
so it is it long before one of the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.080 
so it is it long before one of the
pilots<00:02:26.180> from<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.780> outfit<00:02:27.140> f<00:02:27.319> RC<00:02:27.830> wanted<00:02:28.760> to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
pilots from the outfit f RC wanted to

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.080 
pilots from the outfit f RC wanted to
duel<00:02:29.930> me<00:02:30.049> a<00:02:30.170> little<00:02:30.290> bit<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.730> yeah<00:02:31.730> we<00:02:31.879> did<00:02:32.030> a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
duel me a little bit and yeah we did a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.970 
duel me a little bit and yeah we did a
couple<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:32.690> yeah<00:02:33.049> this<00:02:33.230> is<00:02:33.290> what<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.709> looks

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980

she obviously a couple of guys from FRC
was<00:04:46.139> here<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:46.770> check<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.370> out<00:04:47.490> and<00:04:47.760> I<00:04:48.389> guess<00:04:48.630> one

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
was here to check it out and I guess one

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.220 
was here to check it out and I guess one
of<00:04:48.990> them<00:04:49.230> wanted<00:04:49.980> to<00:04:50.100> try<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.370> get<00:04:50.639> me<00:04:50.960> in<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:52.050> kid

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
of them wanted to try to get me in a kid
