00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.289 
I'm going to put my jack stands
underneath<00:00:13.450> the<00:00:13.690> axle<00:00:13.839> and<00:00:14.879> we<00:00:15.879> were<00:00:15.999> going<00:00:16.209> to

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
underneath the axle and we were going to

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.259 
underneath the axle and we were going to
be<00:00:16.390> taking<00:00:16.810> off<00:00:16.960> the<00:00:17.260> differential<00:00:17.800> cover<00:00:18.269> to

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:19.269 
be taking off the differential cover to

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.339 
be taking off the differential cover to
figure<00:00:19.630> out<00:00:19.779> exactly<00:00:19.990> why<00:00:21.960> she<00:00:22.960> locked<00:00:23.170> up

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
figure out exactly why she locked up

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:33.840 
figure out exactly why she locked up
yesterday<00:00:31.770> my<00:00:32.770> wheels<00:00:33.010> are<00:00:33.220> blocked<00:00:33.310> front

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
yesterday my wheels are blocked front

00:00:33.850 --> 00:01:12.270 
yesterday my wheels are blocked front
and<00:00:33.970> back<00:01:08.220> under<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.430> Jeep<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:11.830> you<00:01:12.159> know

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280

yesterday<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:13.259> was<00:01:14.259> driving<00:01:14.619> down<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.860> road<00:01:15.040> at

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
yesterday I was driving down the road at

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.780 
yesterday I was driving down the road at
about<00:01:15.220> 45<00:01:15.820> when<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:18.130> pinion<00:01:19.200> sheared<00:01:20.200> off<00:01:20.409> I

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
about 45 when the pinion sheared off I

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.020 
about 45 when the pinion sheared off I
think<00:01:21.790> Lisa<00:01:22.509> so<00:01:22.780> they<00:01:22.900> could<00:01:23.049> city<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:24.030> came

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
think Lisa so they could city and came

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.780 
think Lisa so they could city and came
to<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.450> really<00:01:26.229> sudden<00:01:26.710> halt<00:01:27.159> screeching

river so today I'm going to take the

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.569 
river so today I'm going to take the
differential<00:01:37.689> cover<00:01:37.810> off<00:01:38.430> we're<00:01:39.430> going<00:01:39.520> to

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
differential cover off we're going to

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.300 
differential cover off we're going to
open<00:01:39.909> this<00:01:40.000> up<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.740> we're<00:01:41.860> gonna<00:01:41.950> see<00:01:42.189> what

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
open this up and we're gonna see what

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.510 
open this up and we're gonna see what
exactly<00:01:42.820> broke<00:01:43.000> in<00:01:43.210> there

I<00:03:37.450> found<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.540> pinion<00:03:40.090> pinion<00:03:41.090> down<00:03:41.330> in<00:03:41.510> the

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
I found the pinion pinion down in the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.520 
I found the pinion pinion down in the
bottom<00:03:42.110> of<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.500> carrier<00:03:44.020> if<00:03:45.020> we<00:03:45.200> can<00:03:45.350> get<00:03:45.500> a

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
bottom of the carrier if we can get a

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.900 
bottom of the carrier if we can get a
good<00:03:45.680> look<00:03:45.740> at<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.130> for<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:47.440> okay

jammed

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
jammed

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.530 
jammed
I<00:03:56.890> guess<00:03:58.630> down<00:03:59.630> in<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.930> bottom<00:04:00.320> there<00:04:00.350> oh<00:04:01.540> good

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
I guess down in the bottom there oh good

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.810 
I guess down in the bottom there oh good
gosh<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:07.510> see<00:04:08.510> pieces<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.080> parts<00:04:09.260> everywhere

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
gosh and see pieces and parts everywhere

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.940 
gosh and see pieces and parts everywhere
um<00:04:12.100> some<00:04:13.420> bearings<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.900> metal<00:04:15.230> pieces<00:04:15.500> I

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
um some bearings and metal pieces I

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:30.240 
um some bearings and metal pieces I
think<00:04:16.640> what<00:04:16.760> I'm<00:04:16.850> gonna<00:04:16.970> do

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.840 

ha<00:04:31.250> z<00:04:31.310> lock<00:04:31.700> are<00:04:31.910> still<00:04:32.150> working<00:04:32.360> I<00:04:35.350> love<00:04:36.350> it

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850

alright<00:04:38.890> let<00:04:39.890> me<00:04:40.010> regroup<00:04:40.370> here

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.270 

so<00:05:09.229> from<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.350> looks<00:05:10.560> of<00:05:10.710> it<00:05:10.889> would<00:05:11.100> actually

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
so from the looks of it would actually

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.990 
so from the looks of it would actually
cause<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:12.030> whole<00:05:12.240> when<00:05:12.509> the<00:05:12.630> housing<00:05:14.000> was

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
cause the whole when the housing was

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.860 
cause the whole when the housing was
having<00:05:15.389> opinion<00:05:17.810> shot<00:05:18.810> right<00:05:19.110> down<00:05:20.870> inside

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
having opinion shot right down inside

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.830 
having opinion shot right down inside
the<00:05:21.990> housing<00:05:22.380> and<00:05:22.620> actually<00:05:23.360> almost<00:05:24.360> came

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
the housing and actually almost came

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:37.010 
the housing and actually almost came
through<00:05:25.229> the<00:05:25.410> bottom<00:05:25.949> of<00:05:26.070> it<00:05:26.479> the<00:05:35.810> here's<00:05:36.810> the

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
through the bottom of it the here's the

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.980 
through the bottom of it the here's the
pinion<00:05:37.729> which<00:05:38.729> ain't<00:05:39.300> supposed<00:05:39.570> to<00:05:39.690> be<00:05:39.810> there

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
pinion which ain't supposed to be there

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.830 
pinion which ain't supposed to be there
and<00:05:40.919> if<00:05:41.910> you<00:05:42.090> look<00:05:42.270> down<00:05:42.509> underneath<00:05:44.840> right

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
and if you look down underneath right

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.620 
and if you look down underneath right
here<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:47.280> there<00:05:47.610> were<00:05:47.789> the<00:05:47.849> pinion<00:05:48.389> gear

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
here and there were the pinion gear

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.089 
here and there were the pinion gear
Union<00:05:51.630> is<00:05:52.470> actually<00:05:53.419> almost<00:05:54.830> broke<00:05:55.830> right

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
Union is actually almost broke right

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:03.300 
Union is actually almost broke right
through<00:05:57.680> housing

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310
