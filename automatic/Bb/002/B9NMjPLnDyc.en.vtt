00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.680
 doing an incubator I decided to equip it 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.200
 modern appliances in electronic 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.560
 digital 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.310
 unusual thermometers there and in general 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.090
 keeping up with the times 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.269
 but to make it happen not excessively 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.859
 expensive here through chinese 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.460
 online store 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:39.660
 I wrote a thermostat for an incubator 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:42.450
 somewhere on the 25th day the package arrived in 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.230
 In this form, that is, everything is all neat 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.230
 sealed 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.850
 all safe and sound well 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.079
 the only small minus 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.949
 this thermostat itself it is not 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.320
 at some 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.000
 boxes are beautiful there packaging but it's me 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.000
 I think it doesn't matter 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.350
 it means that its size is just a little bit 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.840
 more matchbox means we have 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:25.220
 immediately certainly equipped with a sensor 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:30.360
 temperature that's what it looks like 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:37.549
 it means just to compare here 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:41.250
 size definitely equipped 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:45.390
 accompanied by a passport which 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.500
 quite clear and understandable given 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.700
 wiring diagram of this 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.990
 thermostat well quite clear 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:02.549
 intuitively there is no translation 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:04.350
 do not need anything 4 terminals to the two right we 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.650
 we connect 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.250
 power supply well here you don't 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.690
 Piri Piri Yes, do not confuse the plus or minus 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.880
 we connect 12 volt to the left two 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.930
 heater well in my case it will be 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:26.640
 light bulbs two light bulbs so source 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.790
 power means again show here 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.480
 these are the terminals 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.030
 connect so that's it in principle 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.880
 what box is there in the farm 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.459
 we find the backside to cover so that the dust does not 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.720
 got here is the regulator and 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:50.510
 such small miniature but ufa 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.430
 but you can use 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.760
 there is no point behind gigantism 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.860
 to strive for quality work 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:05.930
 Well, and as a power source 12 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:10.230
 ready adapter the same through this 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:15.560
 Chinese online store has written 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:19.620
 so if you did not say something, we remind 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.739
 this thermostat itself cost me 3 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.840
 dollar well by the time i 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:30.470
 paid this purchase it was a hundred 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:35.900
 seventy four rubles i want to say that 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:40.109
 All Russian Electronic Options 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.480
 digital thermostat less than 600-700 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:46.130
 I have not met rubles 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:53.630
 it is at least but it is there further further 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:57.140
 like this, and the adapter itself is 12 volts 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.140
 cost $ 2 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:11.170
 here is 2 dollars 27 cents such and such 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:11.170
 12 volt doctor 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:22.070
 all that is, in principle, already an incubator 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:26.720
 will be equipped with a thermostat which 0 0 1 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:29.810
 where they hold 01 degrees in that degree 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.790
 the other side and and well I think that this 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.580
 much more convenient than using the usual 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.760
 non-alcohol thermometer 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.460
 really i'm decent on this alcohol 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.490
 thermometers incubate quantity 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.340
 quail eggs 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.210
 but it has constant control 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.140
 a lot of fuss some strange 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:59.980
 changes and that's all then manually this 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.300
 the thermostat that I had there 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.790
 some kind of mechanically there manually 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.760
 I have to tune in here, but I think 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.550
 that this will still be better than one 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.920
 already working directly 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.030
 on the very incubator to new clips 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.310
 subscribe see all my 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.820
