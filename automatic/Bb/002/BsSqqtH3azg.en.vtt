00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
and now the dials the one on the right

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.270 
and now the dials the one on the right
is<00:01:50.550> four<00:01:52.200> by<00:01:53.200> an<00:01:53.260> adjustment<00:01:53.710> that<00:01:54.040> goes<00:01:54.220> up<00:01:55.110> in

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
is four by an adjustment that goes up in

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.370 
is four by an adjustment that goes up in
100<00:01:57.280> millisecond<00:01:57.970> intervals<00:01:59.550> and<00:02:00.550> it<00:02:00.730> goes<00:02:01.380> up

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
100 millisecond intervals and it goes up

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.450 
100 millisecond intervals and it goes up
to<00:02:03.120> 100<00:02:04.120> seconds<00:02:07.230> so<00:02:08.230> right<00:02:08.890> now<00:02:09.040> it's<00:02:09.250> taking

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
to 100 seconds so right now it's taking

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.580 
to 100 seconds so right now it's taking
photos<00:02:09.910> as<00:02:10.060> fast<00:02:10.330> as<00:02:10.510> it<00:02:10.630> can<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:11.020> then<00:02:11.200> as<00:02:11.380> we

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
photos as fast as it can and then as we

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.330 
photos as fast as it can and then as we
slowly<00:02:12.220> set<00:02:12.670> adjusting<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.300> style<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:15.280> the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
slowly set adjusting the style and the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.750 
slowly set adjusting the style and the
rule<00:02:15.580> will<00:02:15.760> increase

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.630 

so<00:02:22.760> now<00:02:23.860> kind<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.890> latch<00:02:25.070> interval<00:02:27.640> and

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
so now kind of latch interval and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.480 
so now kind of latch interval and
there's<00:02:28.970> other<00:02:29.180> one<00:02:29.500> it's<00:02:30.500> for<00:02:30.770> larger

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
there's other one it's for larger

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:38.020 
there's other one it's for larger
adjustments<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:35.750> goes<00:02:36.080> up<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:37.030> 1000

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
adjustments and it goes up to 1000

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.250 
adjustments and it goes up to 1000
seconds<00:02:38.360> in<00:02:39.730> 10-second<00:02:40.730> intervals<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.960> it's

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
seconds in 10-second intervals so it's

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.080 
seconds in 10-second intervals so it's
for<00:02:42.500> longer<00:02:43.190> time<00:02:43.670> lapse<00:02:43.910> shots<00:02:44.660> shots<00:02:46.090> okay

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
for longer time lapse shots shots okay

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.770 
for longer time lapse shots shots okay
and<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:48.190> think<00:02:49.190> we've<00:02:50.030> just<00:02:50.060> about<00:02:50.390> covered

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
and I think we've just about covered

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.290 
and I think we've just about covered
everything<00:02:51.440> with<00:02:51.620> this<00:02:51.890> if<00:02:52.490> there's<00:02:52.910> any

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
everything with this if there's any

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.280 
everything with this if there's any
questions<00:02:53.870> feel<00:02:54.230> free<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.470> ask<00:02:54.590> thank<00:02:55.190> you
