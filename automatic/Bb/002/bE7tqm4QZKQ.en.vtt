00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.120 

will<00:00:15.839> never<00:00:15.870> get<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.260> energy<00:00:16.529> crisis<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:16.949> need

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
will never get the energy crisis we need

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.859 
will never get the energy crisis we need
based<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> sheer<00:00:17.970> fact<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.539> need<00:00:18.840> a

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
based on the sheer fact I need a

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.279 
based on the sheer fact I need a
crapload<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.500> transport<00:00:20.250> trucks<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.640> get<00:00:21.289> all

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
crapload of transport trucks to get all

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.550 
crapload of transport trucks to get all
that<00:00:22.590> or<00:00:26.240> rather<00:00:27.240> interesting<00:00:27.930> hazard<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.470> be

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
that or rather interesting hazard to be

that or rather interesting hazard to be
sure<00:00:34.940> hallelujah<00:00:45.710> oh<00:00:50.660> yeah<00:00:53.780> these<00:00:54.780> are<00:00:55.469> energy

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
sure hallelujah oh yeah these are energy

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.310 
sure hallelujah oh yeah these are energy
crystals<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:56.489> looking<00:00:56.820> for<00:01:00.230> fortunately<00:01:01.230> the

duty careful here so I'll destroy any of
these<00:01:26.330> energy<00:01:27.330> crystals<00:01:27.840> same<00:01:32.750> this<00:01:33.750> appears

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
these energy crystals same this appears

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:43.280 
these energy crystals same this appears
to<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:35.780> impossible<00:01:40.280> we<00:01:41.280> lost<00:01:41.430> one<00:01:42.079> nope<00:01:43.079> we

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
to be impossible we lost one nope we

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.569 
to be impossible we lost one nope we
didn't<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> energy<00:01:43.860> crystal<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.310> appear

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
didn't the energy crystal just appear

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:59.810 
didn't the energy crystal just appear
right<00:01:44.759> there

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.810 

okay<00:02:01.259> everything<00:02:02.259> can<00:02:02.440> drill<00:02:02.860> oh<00:02:03.100> boy<00:02:05.820> quickly

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
okay everything can drill oh boy quickly

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:15.240 
okay everything can drill oh boy quickly
check<00:02:07.330> everything<00:02:07.659> here<00:02:11.400> nope<00:02:14.100> someone<00:02:15.100> drill

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
check everything here nope someone drill

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.030 
check everything here nope someone drill

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
amount of it oh my word we should win

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.740 
amount of it oh my word we should win
the<00:03:10.120> mission<00:03:10.420> soon<00:03:11.400> thankfully<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:16.630> you

change and say we go okay slimy simple
and<00:04:04.790> cold<00:04:05.210> comfort<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:07.450> think<00:04:08.450> both<00:04:08.690> of<00:04:08.720> them

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
and cold comfort I think both of them

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.050 
and cold comfort I think both of them
are<00:04:09.520> all<00:04:10.520> tutorial<00:04:11.360> missions<00:04:12.550> slimy<00:04:13.550> simple

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
are all tutorial missions slimy simple

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.570 
are all tutorial missions slimy simple
I'm<00:04:14.210> going<00:04:14.450> to<00:04:14.630> hate<00:04:15.820> but<00:04:16.820> thats<00:04:17.150> related
