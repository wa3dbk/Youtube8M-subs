00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.580
 today we will prepare a typical dessert together with the caramelized haunted apples 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.460
 of the American tradition for the night of halloween we see together the 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.800
 ingredients 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.119
 of apples with yellow quotas 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.050
 100 ml of water 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.190
 4 wooden sticks 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.150
 a envelope of vanillin 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.290
 half a teaspoon of cinnamon 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.120
 the tip of a teaspoon of powdered red food coloring 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.640
 40 grams of honey 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.760
 500 grams of sugar and three cloves 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.760
 well now let's move on to preparation 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.980
 First let's melt the sugar 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.060
 in a saucepan 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.540
 together 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.540
 with honey 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.320
 to 100 ml of water 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.170
 the melted sugar now we go to add the spices 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.890
 cecchetti of carnation with cinnamon and vanillin 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.310
 and decorated red on the heart 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.310
 mix 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.920
 at this point we are going to put the sugar thermometer for jams 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.840
 and we continue the temperature until it reaches 140 degrees 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.900
 while the sugar is reaching the ideal temperature we are going to prepare 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.750
 apples 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.540
 first we wait for the petiole then we pass to insult them with a 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.550
 wooden stick 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.840
 you can also use a Chinese restaurant wand 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.770
 wait until the sugar, if ready, prepare a pan with a sheet on it 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.809
 of parchment paper 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.539
 it was caramelized with honey 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:20.529
 be very careful because the sugar is very hot 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.829
 bergamo 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.969
 this way the apple 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.969
 until it covers the entire stick 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.839
 the face is a little schoolish 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.529
 and we tag it 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:41.619
 on paper yes 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:45.529

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:49.729
