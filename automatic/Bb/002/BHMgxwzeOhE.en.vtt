00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello today we will cook 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.940
 red bean gods soup 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.200
 for some it may be a little 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.309
 exotic soup 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.820
 but no less useful and satisfying 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.869
 because it is known that legumes contain 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.890
 protein 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.340
 which can replace even meat and so 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.279
 I start cooking for cooking 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.769
 this dish we need the beans itself 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.190
 as we see red beans somewhere 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.000
 about 250 grams of beans or 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.620
 olive or sunflower oil red 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.640
 hot pepper nuts 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.670
 kenzo dry mint 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.870
 several pieces 10-12 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:58.350

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.760
 dried two teeth of large garlic and 1 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.190
 medium bulb 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.869
 start cooking soup with the fact that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.760
 put the beans on the fire filled with water and 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.510
 close the lid and wait for it 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:18.320
 cook until our beans are cooked we 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.320
 chop onions after we have it 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.229

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.530

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.049

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.880
 save it was given the pot pour 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.880
 a small portion of olive oil and 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.880
 sending 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:43.850
 onions as I said not to 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.090

 set off preparing our special 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.860
 goes to completion in total 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:49.070
 the beans were cooked for about two two s 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.630
 half an hour you can like this 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:58.250
 and and even more memory it will be still 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:06.430
 tastier even better the next we ship 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:06.430
 already cooked soup nuts with garlic 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:17.020
 especially cooks do not need and left 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.860
 just fill the soup with greens 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:27.130

 red beans ready for it 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.349
 preparations we needed of course 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.230
 plenty of time two two and a half hours 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.300
 but a friend so that you can put the beans 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.150

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.550
