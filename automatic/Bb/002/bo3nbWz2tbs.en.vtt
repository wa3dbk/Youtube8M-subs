 100 grams of water a little bit of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.689
 vanilla to form our syrup and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.219
 chocolate chips will start with 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:42.690
 to make our syrup so I put my name 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:45.960

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.350

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:56.100
 boil and then I'll stop my 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:59.640
 good fire if we're ready I 'll cut the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:09.750
 base of my cookies to stabilize my 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:10.790
 charlotte and then I'll soaked and then 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.700

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:24.900
 fast in the syrup I will detail 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:28.049
 a circle of magic noise that I'm going 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:35.310
 soaked in my siro I'm not going too much 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:37.740
 huh just a little bit here after I 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.040
 I'm going to put the chocolate ganache 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.790

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.939

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.939

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:25.660
