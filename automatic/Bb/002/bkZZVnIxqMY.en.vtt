you're<00:03:50.540> going<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.750> get<00:03:50.900> in<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.530> box<00:03:51.770> and<00:03:52.010> if<00:03:52.130> we

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
you're going to get in the box and if we

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:07.810 
you're going to get in the box and if we
lift<00:03:52.460> up<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:54.830> tab<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:07.370> doesn't

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
lift up the that this tab it doesn't

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.100

look<00:04:07.850> like<00:04:08.210> it<00:04:08.420> once<00:04:08.600> to<00:04:09.470> go<00:04:09.650> on<00:04:09.740> delay<00:04:10.040> so

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
look like it once to go on delay so

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.210 
look like it once to go on delay so
we're<00:04:12.110> going<00:04:12.230> to<00:04:12.320> assume<00:04:12.440> that<00:04:12.710> there's<00:04:13.160> and
