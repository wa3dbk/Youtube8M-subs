leave<00:03:56.450> Matt<00:03:56.660> obviously<00:03:56.780> has<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.410> has<00:03:57.560> to<00:03:57.709> be<00:03:57.799> in

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
leave Matt obviously has it has to be in

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.430 
leave Matt obviously has it has to be in
the<00:03:57.980> team<00:03:58.250> his<00:03:58.700> best<00:03:59.660> position<00:03:59.810> here<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.350> an

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
the team his best position here is an

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.020 
the team his best position here is an
inside<00:04:00.769> forward<00:04:01.190> but<00:04:01.459> he's<00:04:01.579> finished<00:04:01.850> in

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
inside forward but he's finished in

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.720 
inside forward but he's finished in
signing<00:04:02.269> 12<00:04:02.570> so<00:04:02.870> I<00:04:03.200> think<00:04:03.799> he's<00:04:04.310> better<00:04:04.610> as

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
signing 12 so I think he's better as

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.520 
signing 12 so I think he's better as
advanced<00:04:05.450> playmaker<00:04:05.959> cuz<00:04:06.200> he's<00:04:06.290> got<00:04:06.320> the

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
winger he am yeah he's probably a little

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.370 
winger he am yeah he's probably a little
bit<00:05:02.210> better<00:05:02.360> in<00:05:02.540> the<00:05:02.630> middle<00:05:02.960> but<00:05:03.140> when<00:05:03.260> you

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
bit better in the middle but when you

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.650 
bit better in the middle but when you

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
he's got good pace

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.730 
he's got good pace
dribbling<00:05:13.910> 18<00:05:14.330> off<00:05:14.630> the<00:05:14.870> bull<00:05:15.050> fifteen<00:05:15.440> Flair

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
dribbling 18 off the bull fifteen Flair

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.280 
dribbling 18 off the bull fifteen Flair
fifteen<00:05:16.700> technique<00:05:17.120> 18<00:05:17.570> and<00:05:17.720> his<00:05:17.780> crossings

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
fifteen technique 18 and his crossings

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.920 
fifteen technique 18 and his crossings
for<00:05:18.560> in<00:05:18.770> so<00:05:19.160> he<00:05:19.940> can't<00:05:20.180> really<00:05:20.270> ask<00:05:20.480> for<00:05:20.660> much

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
for in so he can't really ask for much

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.170 
for in so he can't really ask for much
too<00:05:21.590> much<00:05:21.770> better<00:05:21.950> source<00:05:22.580> stats<00:05:22.910> for<00:05:23.120> a

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
too much better source stats for a

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.020 
too much better source stats for a
winner<00:05:23.360> really<00:05:24.160> yeah<00:05:25.160> it's<00:05:25.310> question<00:05:25.610> a<00:05:25.670> 14

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
winner really yeah it's question a 14

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.990 
winner really yeah it's question a 14
and<00:05:26.240> his<00:05:26.300> creativity<00:05:26.720> of<00:05:27.050> 15<00:05:27.530> I<00:05:27.860> think<00:05:28.700> he<00:05:28.850> can

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
and his creativity of 15 I think he can

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.600 
and his creativity of 15 I think he can
just<00:05:29.030> do<00:05:29.930> once<00:05:30.410> really<00:05:30.800> and<00:05:31.070> obviously<00:05:31.520> it's

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
just do once really and obviously it's

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.340 
just do once really and obviously it's
got<00:05:31.730> a<00:05:31.760> preferred<00:05:32.120> mode<00:05:32.420> moves<00:05:32.780> that<00:05:33.080> runs

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
got a preferred mode moves that runs

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.220 
got a preferred mode moves that runs
with<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:33.560> ball<00:05:33.710> down<00:05:33.920> left<00:05:34.160> and<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:34.460> right

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
with the ball down left and the right

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.840 
with the ball down left and the right
yeah<00:05:36.230> I<00:05:36.410> think<00:05:36.680> he<00:05:36.860> he<00:05:37.130> could<00:05:37.400> easily<00:05:37.550> play

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
yeah I think he he could easily play

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.670 
yeah I think he he could easily play
that<00:05:38.030> position<00:05:38.180> absolutely<00:05:39.140> no<00:05:39.230> problems

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
that position absolutely no problems

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.330 
that position absolutely no problems
I've<00:05:39.920> gone<00:05:40.520> for<00:05:40.850> Torres<00:05:41.330> up<00:05:41.510> from<00:05:42.070> in<00:05:43.070> real

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
I've gone for Torres up from in real

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.390 
I've gone for Torres up from in real
life<00:05:43.550> he's<00:05:43.940> obviously<00:05:44.980> decline<00:05:45.980> in<00:05:46.160> quite<00:05:46.370> a

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
life he's obviously decline in quite a

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.630 
life he's obviously decline in quite a
bit<00:05:46.670> but<00:05:47.240> I<00:05:47.510> still<00:05:47.900> think<00:05:48.320> on<00:05:48.620> on<00:05:48.980> football

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
bit but I still think on on football

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.790 
bit but I still think on on football
manager<00:05:50.060> you<00:05:50.150> could<00:05:50.270> just<00:05:50.510> have<00:05:50.690> him<00:05:50.720> as<00:05:51.620> like

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
an advanced forward he's still got a

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.870 
an advanced forward he's still got a
pace<00:05:53.500> like<00:05:54.500> good<00:05:54.860> work<00:05:55.040> where<00:05:55.340> he's<00:05:55.460> finishing

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
pace like good work where he's finishing

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.600 
pace like good work where he's finishing
in<00:05:55.970> composure<00:05:56.440> is<00:05:57.440> still<00:05:57.740> pretty<00:05:58.010> decent<00:05:58.160> good

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
in composure is still pretty decent good

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.210

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
I mean you could always use some USA as

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.080 
I mean you could always use some USA as
a<00:06:09.410> poacher<00:06:09.830> obviously<00:06:10.220> with<00:06:10.400> his<00:06:10.550> finishing

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
a poacher obviously with his finishing

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.350 
view and it's sort acting I'll probably
actually<00:06:33.770> would<00:06:34.190> to<00:06:34.370> put<00:06:34.550> them<00:06:34.730> Byron<00:06:35.240> as

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.219 
weird as it sounds
yeah<00:06:38.000> if<00:06:38.090> you<00:06:38.180> look<00:06:38.300> at<00:06:38.390> his<00:06:38.510> work<00:06:38.660> rate<00:06:38.990> look

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
yeah if you look at his work rate look

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:41.800 
yeah if you look at his work rate look
at<00:06:39.320> his<00:06:39.440> pace<00:06:39.710> from<00:06:40.510> acceleration<00:06:41.510> good
