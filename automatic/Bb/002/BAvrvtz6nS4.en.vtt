00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
limited issue but i guess it made it

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.520 
limited issue but i guess it made it
permanent<00:04:46.370> now<00:04:46.640> Thank<00:04:47.030> You<00:04:47.120> lush<00:04:47.540> but<00:04:48.080> I<00:04:48.140> love

it<00:04:49.450> unfortunately<00:04:50.450> it<00:04:50.540> does<00:04:50.630> not<00:04:50.870> fit<00:04:51.230> in<00:04:51.470> the

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
it unfortunately it does not fit in the

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.060 
it unfortunately it does not fit in the
10th<00:04:52.630> there<00:04:53.630> are<00:04:53.930> a<00:04:53.960> couple<00:04:54.110> that<00:04:54.680> don't<00:04:54.890> fit

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070

in<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.250> 10<00:04:55.460> I<00:04:55.490> think<00:04:55.910> that<00:04:56.480> really<00:04:56.510> blows

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
in the 10 I think that really blows

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.760 
in the 10 I think that really blows
that's<00:04:57.950> probably<00:04:58.250> my<00:04:58.400> only<00:04:58.580> complaint<00:04:59.770> they

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
that's probably my only complaint they

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.060 
that's probably my only complaint they
don't<00:05:00.950> fit<00:05:01.100> in<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.250> tin<00:05:01.490> um<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.900> have<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:03.740> whole

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
don't fit in the tin um I have a whole

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.750 
don't fit in the tin um I have a whole
list<00:05:04.520> that<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:04.970> want<00:05:05.240> to<00:05:05.390> order<00:05:05.690> of<00:05:05.810> those<00:05:06.020> and

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
list that I want to order of those and

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.010 
list that I want to order of those and
but<00:05:07.760> I'm<00:05:07.910> afraid<00:05:08.060> they're<00:05:08.360> going<00:05:08.480> to<00:05:08.570> melt<00:05:08.810> and

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
but I'm afraid they're going to melt and

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.840 
but I'm afraid they're going to melt and
shipping<00:05:09.320> so<00:05:09.980> I'm<00:05:10.100> probably<00:05:10.310> going<00:05:10.640> to<00:05:10.730> wait

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
shipping so I'm probably going to wait

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.960 
shipping so I'm probably going to wait
till<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.090> fall<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:11.630> she's<00:05:12.110> what<00:05:12.410> I<00:05:12.440> have<00:05:12.710> now

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
till the fall and she's what I have now

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.340 
till the fall and she's what I have now
for<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.060> summer<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.450> then<00:05:14.780> maybe<00:05:14.990> like<00:05:15.170> in

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
for the summer and then maybe like in

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.470 
for the summer and then maybe like in
september-october<00:05:15.920> when<00:05:16.730> the<00:05:17.060> weather<00:05:17.210> cools

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
september-october when the weather cools

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.530 
september-october when the weather cools
down<00:05:17.780> i'll<00:05:18.410> probably<00:05:18.680> order<00:05:19.010> and<00:05:19.430> i<00:05:20.210> think<00:05:20.450> i

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.740 
combination and you'll just put you know
a<00:06:12.360> little<00:06:12.630> on<00:06:12.900> here<00:06:13.230> and<00:06:13.790> rub<00:06:14.790> it<00:06:14.820> in<00:06:15.120> on<00:06:15.480> that

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
a little on here and rub it in on that

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:22.190 
a little on here and rub it in on that
spot<00:06:16.110> and<00:06:20.030> this<00:06:21.030> candy<00:06:21.420> flip<00:06:21.570> has<00:06:21.720> glitter<00:06:22.020> in

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
spot and this candy flip has glitter in

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.900 
spot and this candy flip has glitter in
it<00:06:22.290> if<00:06:22.470> you<00:06:22.590> see<00:06:22.770> that<00:06:22.920> it's<00:06:23.130> not<00:06:23.340> the<00:06:23.580> massage

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
it if you see that it's not the massage

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.910 
it if you see that it's not the massage
bar<00:06:24.240> um<00:06:24.690> it<00:06:26.360> locks<00:06:27.360> in<00:06:27.690> the<00:06:27.720> moisture<00:06:27.870> but<00:06:28.800> it

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
bar um it locks in the moisture but it

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.880 
bar um it locks in the moisture but it
takes<00:06:29.100> away<00:06:29.490> the<00:06:29.940> oily<00:06:30.390> shine<00:06:30.930> and<00:06:31.290> the<00:06:31.560> oily

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
takes away the oily shine and the oily

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.250 
takes away the oily shine and the oily
residue<00:06:32.270> so<00:06:34.550> like<00:06:35.550> this<00:06:36.390> each<00:06:36.600> peach<00:06:36.900> I<00:06:37.080> think

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
residue so like this each peach I think

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.340 
residue so like this each peach I think
would<00:06:37.380> be<00:06:37.470> great<00:06:37.680> with<00:06:37.830> vanilla<00:06:38.310> and<00:06:39.350> destiny

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
would be great with vanilla and destiny

would be great with vanilla and destiny
powder<00:06:40.530> i<00:06:40.620> think<00:06:40.860> is<00:06:40.950> what<00:06:41.070> it's<00:06:41.220> called<00:06:41.280> the

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
powder i think is what it's called the

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.050 
powder i think is what it's called the
vanilla<00:06:42.030> one<00:06:42.290> um<00:06:43.290> i<00:06:43.610> think<00:06:44.610> that<00:06:44.850> would<00:06:44.910> be

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
vanilla one um i think that would be

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.130 
vanilla one um i think that would be
