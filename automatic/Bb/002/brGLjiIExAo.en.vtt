00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
MacBook in action it does run the game

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.499 
MacBook in action it does run the game
on<00:06:20.439> low<00:06:21.129> graphics<00:06:21.580> which<00:06:21.699> is<00:06:21.759> pretty<00:06:21.969> good

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509 
on low graphics which is pretty good

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:24.269 
on low graphics which is pretty good
I<00:06:22.539> had<00:06:22.869> the<00:06:22.989> resolution<00:06:23.499> up<00:06:23.589> a<00:06:23.679> little<00:06:24.009> bit

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:24.279 
I had the resolution up a little bit

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.269 
I had the resolution up a little bit
higher<00:06:24.610> than<00:06:24.999> what<00:06:25.439> you<00:06:26.439> can<00:06:26.619> can<00:06:26.979> put<00:06:27.069> it<00:06:27.189> down

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:27.279 
higher than what you can can put it down

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:29.070 
higher than what you can can put it down
even<00:06:27.429> lower<00:06:27.580> is<00:06:27.849> what<00:06:27.969> I'm<00:06:28.059> saying<00:06:28.330> so<00:06:28.869> if<00:06:28.989> you

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
even lower is what I'm saying so if you

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.899 
even lower is what I'm saying so if you
did<00:06:29.229> it<00:06:29.349> at<00:06:29.529> the<00:06:29.679> very<00:06:29.889> lowest<00:06:30.159> resolution<00:06:30.819> the

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909 
did it at the very lowest resolution the

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.449 
did it at the very lowest resolution the
game<00:06:31.059> would<00:06:31.209> run<00:06:31.330> even<00:06:31.569> better<00:06:31.779> but<00:06:32.739> again<00:06:33.009> I

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:33.459 
game would run even better but again I

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.219 
game would run even better but again I
would<00:06:33.939> say<00:06:33.969> you<00:06:34.149> know<00:06:34.360> what<00:06:34.539> the<00:06:34.869> game<00:06:35.050> is

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
would say you know what the game is

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.979 
would say you know what the game is
playable<00:06:35.589> on<00:06:35.739> low<00:06:35.979> it's<00:06:36.669> sort<00:06:37.300> of<00:06:37.389> playable<00:06:37.839> on

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:37.989 
playable on low it's sort of playable on

00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:39.629 
playable on low it's sort of playable on
medium<00:06:38.349> depending<00:06:38.769> on<00:06:38.860> which<00:06:39.009> map<00:06:39.219> you<00:06:39.399> play

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
medium depending on which map you play

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.109 
medium depending on which map you play
on<00:06:39.819> so<00:06:40.529> just<00:06:41.529> play<00:06:41.979> around<00:06:42.219> with<00:06:42.459> it<00:06:42.669> I<00:06:42.879> think

00:06:43.109 --> 00:06:43.119 
on so just play around with it I think

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:44.850 
on so just play around with it I think
it's<00:06:43.239> great<00:06:43.449> that<00:06:43.509> you<00:06:43.779> can<00:06:43.929> at<00:06:44.050> least<00:06:44.080> take

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
it's great that you can at least take

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.679 
it's great that you can at least take
that<00:06:44.889> with<00:06:45.279> you<00:06:45.489> and<00:06:45.519> if<00:06:45.939> you<00:06:46.149> are<00:06:46.300> gonna<00:06:46.419> play

00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:46.689 
that with you and if you are gonna play

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:48.659 
that with you and if you are gonna play
a<00:06:47.080> little<00:06:47.379> bit<00:06:47.769> of<00:06:47.889> battle<00:06:48.369> through<00:06:48.550> this

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:48.669 
a little bit of battle through this
