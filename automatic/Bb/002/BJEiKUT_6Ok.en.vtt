Jeep<00:00:14.170> Cherokee<00:00:14.549> I'm<00:00:15.549> here<00:00:15.850> to<00:00:15.940> discuss

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
Jeep Cherokee I'm here to discuss

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.910 
Jeep Cherokee I'm here to discuss
specifically<00:00:16.750> the<00:00:16.990> engineering<00:00:17.500> attributes

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
specifically the engineering attributes

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.589 
specifically the engineering attributes
that<00:00:18.070> went<00:00:18.220> into<00:00:18.339> the<00:00:18.490> vehicle<00:00:18.910> that<00:00:19.330> make<00:00:19.480> it

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
that went into the vehicle that make it

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.480 
that went into the vehicle that make it
the<00:00:19.660> most<00:00:19.839> capable<00:00:20.080> and<00:00:20.500> refined<00:00:20.949> vehicle<00:00:21.369> in

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
the most capable and refined vehicle in

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.820 
the most capable and refined vehicle in
the<00:00:21.580> segment<00:00:22.169> capability<00:00:23.169> that<00:00:23.289> Cherokee<00:00:23.710> is

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
the segment capability that Cherokee is

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.470 
the segment capability that Cherokee is
what<00:00:23.980> we<00:00:24.070> started<00:00:24.429> the<00:00:24.490> vehicles<00:00:24.939> foundation

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
what we started the vehicles foundation

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.749 
what we started the vehicles foundation
on<00:00:25.630> so<00:00:25.839> on-road<00:00:26.829> the<00:00:27.220> vehicle<00:00:27.579> has<00:00:27.730> a

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
on so on-road the vehicle has a

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.480 
on so on-road the vehicle has a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
liter multi air engine that we have in

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.190 
liter multi air engine that we have in
the<00:01:09.700> cherokee<00:01:10.180> it<00:01:10.540> allows<00:01:10.810> us<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.080> give

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
the cherokee it allows us to give

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.290 
the cherokee it allows us to give
best-in-class<00:01:11.830> range<00:01:12.610> for<00:01:12.880> fuel<00:01:13.060> economy

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
best-in-class range for fuel economy

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.450 
best-in-class range for fuel economy
what<00:01:14.140> we<00:01:14.170> do<00:01:14.410> is<00:01:14.560> we<00:01:14.680> have<00:01:14.830> a<00:01:14.890> system<00:01:15.310> that

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
what we do is we have a system that

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.340 
what we do is we have a system that
allows<00:01:15.610> us<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.970> open<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.570> close<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.960> valves

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
allows us to open and close the valves

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.770 
allows us to open and close the valves
at<00:01:17.500> specific<00:01:17.980> times<00:01:18.250> during<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.850> combustion

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
at specific times during the combustion

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.780 
at specific times during the combustion
portion<00:01:20.350> of<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.590> event<00:01:20.950> for<00:01:21.370> the<00:01:21.430> engine

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
portion of the event for the engine

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.330 
portion of the event for the engine
which<00:01:22.480> is<00:01:22.750> unlike<00:01:23.380> anything<00:01:23.650> really<00:01:23.980> in<00:01:24.190> this

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
which is unlike anything really in this

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.730 
which is unlike anything really in this
segment<00:01:24.550> so<00:01:24.940> all<00:01:25.420> those<00:01:25.660> things<00:01:25.960> allows<00:01:26.350> us<00:01:26.590> to

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
segment so all those things allows us to

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.220 
segment so all those things allows us to
fine<00:01:27.190> tune<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.580> amount<00:01:28.240> of<00:01:28.450> air<00:01:28.510> and<00:01:29.050> fuel

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
fine tune the amount of air and fuel

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.930 
fine tune the amount of air and fuel
we're<00:01:29.500> putting<00:01:29.740> into<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:30.040> system<00:01:30.460> to

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
we're putting into the system to

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.750 
we're putting into the system to
maximize<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:32.590> range<00:01:32.830> of<00:01:33.010> the<00:01:33.100> vehicle<00:01:33.220> on

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
maximize the range of the vehicle on

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.910 
maximize the range of the vehicle on
road<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.990> one<00:01:35.110> other<00:01:35.230> thing<00:01:35.410> that<00:01:35.440> we<00:01:35.650> have<00:01:35.680> on

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
road so one other thing that we have on

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.040 
road so one other thing that we have on
the<00:01:36.010> vehicle<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:36.520> we<00:01:37.390> have<00:01:37.480> a<00:01:37.510> disconnecting

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
the vehicle is we have a disconnecting

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.930 
the vehicle is we have a disconnecting
rear<00:01:38.080> drive<00:01:38.470> system<00:01:38.920> but<00:01:39.310> amount<00:01:39.610> allows<00:01:39.760> us

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
rear drive system but amount allows us

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.910 
rear drive system but amount allows us
to<00:01:40.060> maximize<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.810> vehicles<00:01:41.170> fuel<00:01:41.350> efficiency

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
to maximize the vehicles fuel efficiency

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.710 
to maximize the vehicles fuel efficiency
so<00:01:42.430> essentially<00:01:43.030> what<00:01:43.180> we're<00:01:43.300> doing<00:01:43.510> is<00:01:43.570> we're

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
so essentially what we're doing is we're

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.510 
so essentially what we're doing is we're
operating<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.290> vehicle<00:01:44.440> in<00:01:44.800> front<00:01:45.310> wheel

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
operating the vehicle in front wheel

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.400 
operating the vehicle in front wheel
drive<00:01:45.760> mode<00:01:46.030> until<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.900> vehicle<00:01:47.050> actually

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410
