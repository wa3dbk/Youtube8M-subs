00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
is a very tight fit so it may take a

right back on top latch all three clamps

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.069 
right back on top latch all three clamps
there<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.400> then<00:01:41.659> we're<00:01:42.659> gonna<00:01:42.750> go<00:01:42.930> ahead<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
there and then we're gonna go ahead and

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.069

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
so it takes a little bit of muscle on

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.560 
so it takes a little bit of muscle on
this<00:01:49.110> part<00:01:49.610> but<00:01:50.610> once<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.240> fitted

angle<00:02:17.070> tool<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:18.540> let's<00:02:18.720> go<00:02:18.840> on<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:18.930> start

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
angle tool so let's go on and start

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.290 
angle tool so let's go on and start
comparing<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.710> two<00:02:19.860> units<00:02:20.240> in<00:02:21.240> a

comparing the two units in a
side-by-side<00:02:21.720> comparison<00:02:22.170> between<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
side-by-side comparison between the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.720 
side-by-side comparison between the
Cougar<00:02:24.150> or<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.630> cheetah<00:02:24.840> 2<00:02:25.140> there's<00:02:25.800> only<00:02:26.190> one

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
Cougar or the cheetah 2 there's only one

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.600 
Cougar or the cheetah 2 there's only one
difference<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.890> cheetah

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
difference and that is that the cheetah

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.510 
difference and that is that the cheetah
2<00:02:29.940> sounds<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.420> little<00:02:30.540> bit<00:02:30.750> more<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.620> shot

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
opening than it does on the actual tube

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.909 
opening than it does on the actual tube
now<00:04:24.510> it's<00:04:24.690> there<00:04:24.870> for<00:04:25.200> a<00:04:25.230> really<00:04:25.590> good<00:04:25.740> reason

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:24.439 
particles coming out and a little bit of
dust<00:06:22.289> and<00:06:22.679> this<00:06:23.219> is<00:06:23.399> a<00:06:23.429> great<00:06:23.819> option<00:06:24.059> instead

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449
