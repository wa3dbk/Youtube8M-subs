00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the lord this is the most clear

reference<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> tattoos<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.640> bible<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
reference to tattoos in the bible and it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.380 
reference to tattoos in the bible and it
seems<00:00:40.200> pretty<00:00:40.410> straightforward<00:00:41.180> but<00:00:42.180> some

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
seems pretty straightforward but some

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.540 
seems pretty straightforward but some
don't<00:00:42.570> think<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.890> say<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.370> only

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
don't think so they say this is the only

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.970 
don't think so they say this is the only
place<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.090> Bible<00:00:45.270> God<00:00:45.960> mentions<00:00:46.440> tattoos

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
and it was commandment only for the Jews

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.400 
and it was commandment only for the Jews
they<00:00:50.520> also<00:00:50.640> point<00:00:51.030> out<00:00:51.180> other<00:00:51.690> laws<00:00:52.020> in

they also point out other laws in
Leviticus<00:00:53.399> 19<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:54.180> Christians<00:00:54.570> simply<00:00:55.320> do

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
Leviticus 19 that Christians simply do

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.740 
Leviticus 19 that Christians simply do
not<00:00:55.500> observe<00:00:57.260> that<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> kiss<00:00:58.620> 19<00:00:59.430> 23<00:01:00.000> through<00:01:00.329> 25

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
not observe that a kiss 19 23 through 25

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.500 
not observe that a kiss 19 23 through 25
talks<00:01:01.230> about<00:01:01.469> not<00:01:01.770> eating<00:01:02.010> fruit<00:01:02.489> before<00:01:03.210> the

talks about not eating fruit before the
fifth<00:01:04.049> year<00:01:04.530> after<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.100> has<00:01:05.250> been<00:01:05.280> planted

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
fifth year after it has been planted

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.840 
fifth year after it has been planted
they<00:01:06.930> reason<00:01:07.350> while<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.860> eat<00:01:08.040> fruit<00:01:08.520> before

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
they reason while we eat fruit before

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.300 
they reason while we eat fruit before
the<00:01:09.180> fifth<00:01:09.390> year<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.439> therefore<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.070> also

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the fifth year so therefore we can also

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.120 
the fifth year so therefore we can also
have<00:01:12.030> tattoos<00:01:14.540> what<00:01:15.540> about<00:01:15.570> Leviticus<00:01:16.320> 19<00:01:16.560> 26

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
have tattoos what about Leviticus 19 26

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.340 
have tattoos what about Leviticus 19 26
who<00:01:17.700> says<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.540> can't<00:01:18.570> eat<00:01:18.960> anything<00:01:19.170> with

who says we can't eat anything with

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.140 
who says we can't eat anything with
blood<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:20.310> ate<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.400> types<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.000> meat

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
blood in it we ate all types of meat

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.390 
blood in it we ate all types of meat
therefore<00:01:22.140> tattoos<00:01:23.009> are<00:01:23.580> probably<00:01:23.820> okay<00:01:25.400> hey

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
therefore tattoos are probably okay hey

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.640 
therefore tattoos are probably okay hey
let's<00:01:26.700> apply<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.030> logic<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> rest<00:01:28.320> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
let's apply this logic to the rest of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.380 
let's apply this logic to the rest of
Leviticus<00:01:29.250> 19<00:01:31.040> verse<00:01:32.040> 11<00:01:32.549> thou<00:01:33.000> shalt<00:01:33.240> not
