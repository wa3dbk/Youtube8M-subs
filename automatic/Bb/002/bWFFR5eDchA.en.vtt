 now you will learn how to make hi 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.940
 friends today we are in my kitchen and we will 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.730
 with you cooking protein at home 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.869
 conditions come to me very often 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.019
 letters from school students say 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.269
 or no means to buy protein 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.969
 or not where to buy it and let's 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.309
 let's see how to make proteins in 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.129
 home conditions 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.100
 before when I was engaged in the 90s 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.559
 Nasty, too, was not and here we went 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:54.510
 from this situation in the following way 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:01:02.129
 take the eggs take the vacuum here from me 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.300
 there is honey and now we mix it all up and 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.140
 will we have a patient 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:13.040
 the most important rule of such 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:16.080
 sebaceous gland disease she usually 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.750
 come when eggs can not many 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.580
 believe that three eggs can not drink because 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.700
 that you can pick up prices for ios but I will take you 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.820
 I assure you he is right on 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.990
 an egg shell to make it all 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.060
 clean you need eggs wash well take care 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:46.130
 his father now we did it 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:02:03.530
 by mine so that we have our cocktail nothing 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:02:05.899
 didn't get the recipe very simple you him 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.410
 you can also do the same 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:12.440
 breaks served and more importantly each 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.160
 her price is about 5 grams of protein and here 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:23.390
 look to make you under 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:29.799
 opposite about gram 24 I make from 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.799
 two eggs and whip 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.349
 begun to talk about the egg yolks and friends and 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:40.670
 if you work on muscle mass 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:42.980
 then extra calories and big 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.310
 the amount of fat that is contained 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.820
 the yolk form will prevent still not terrible 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:56.000
 will take milk 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:03:00.380
 about percent well, there is no milk on interest 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.190
 you need to take there 32 percent honestly 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.600
 saying i think either milk or kefir 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.180
 now actively sell com percentage of it 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.459
 0.1 percent don't take such milk or 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.459
 kefir because honestly I 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.400
 colored water and there are no 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.519
 no nutrients you pay 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.519
 money 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:33.470
 name is easier water just add well 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:35.780
 okay half a percent we pour there somewhere 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:42.489
 approximately 400 grams 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:45.440
 400 milliliters of milk add 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.740
 in fact it turns out not pure protein 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.350
 of course, but money 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.220
 Well, honey we have carbohydrates 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.080
 a shot of carbohydrate eggs is a little bit of fat 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.370
 proteins and milk is 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:05.880
 main protein change 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.880
 tea you go we put it all 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.790
 close and beat 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.680
 if you add more to this drink 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.590
 you can buy lecithin from a pharmacy 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.110
 lecithin granules and add this 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.110
 a tablespoon of lecithin will be even better 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.970
 lecithin is not very phospholipids 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.360
 good for the body and not important 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.820
 gain you muscle mass either 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.930
 trying to lose weight lecithin is very important 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:02.230
 but if of course you work on 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.300
 relief such a drink will not suit you 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.140
 because as I said you are with us 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:11.650
 genius and genia 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:16.660
 drying is usually not using all possible 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:19.600
 use do about three such 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.250
 cartel day between meals 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.230
 be sure to use 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:28.230
 farther away like protein you can 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:32.440
 buy a sports nutrition store 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.540
