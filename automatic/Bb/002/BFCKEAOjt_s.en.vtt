looks to stay on the test of time I've

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.219 
looks to stay on the test of time I've
collected<00:07:21.850> my<00:07:22.120> delegates<00:07:22.539> votes<00:07:22.750> and<00:07:23.020> to

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:30.700 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.190 

so<00:07:31.700> that<00:07:31.970> is<00:07:32.090> what<00:07:32.210> I<00:07:32.240> thought<00:07:32.480> a<00:07:32.720> brave<00:07:32.990> new

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:33.200 
so that is what I thought a brave new

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.320 
so that is what I thought a brave new
world<00:07:33.230> it<00:07:33.710> is<00:07:33.830> at<00:07:33.950> July<00:07:34.220> 9th<00:07:34.460> in<00:07:34.670> North<00:07:34.910> America

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330 
world it is at July 9th in North America

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.780 
world it is at July 9th in North America
in<00:07:35.510> July<00:07:35.900> 12th<00:07:36.290> overseas<00:07:36.830> and<00:07:37.160> it's<00:07:37.610> also

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:37.790 
in July 12th overseas and it's also

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.370 
in July 12th overseas and it's also
worth<00:07:38.060> noting<00:07:38.300> that<00:07:38.570> it<00:07:38.780> includes<00:07:39.200> the

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:39.380 
worth noting that it includes the

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.470 
worth noting that it includes the
espionage<00:07:39.950> and<00:07:40.250> religion<00:07:40.670> systems<00:07:41.120> that<00:07:41.360> were

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:41.480 
espionage and religion systems that were

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.660 
espionage and religion systems that were
in<00:07:41.600> gods<00:07:41.840> and<00:07:42.050> kings<00:07:42.290> so<00:07:42.590> if<00:07:42.920> you<00:07:43.100> skip<00:07:43.400> last

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:43.670 
in gods and kings so if you skip last

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.580 
in gods and kings so if you skip last
year's<00:07:43.940> expansion<00:07:44.540> you're<00:07:44.990> only<00:07:45.080> missing<00:07:45.290> out

was unable to play with the multiplayer

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.930 
was unable to play with the multiplayer
in<00:08:00.110> my<00:08:00.230> time<00:08:00.470> with<00:08:00.650> the<00:08:00.740> game<00:08:00.950> so<00:08:01.250> if<00:08:01.670> that<00:08:01.790> is

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:01.940 
in my time with the game so if that is

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.490 
in my time with the game so if that is
your<00:08:02.000> primary<00:08:02.300> way<00:08:02.630> of<00:08:02.660> playing<00:08:02.990> I<00:08:03.170> suggest

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:05.030 
that you wait until the game is out and

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.190 
that you wait until the game is out and
check<00:08:05.300> out<00:08:05.420> some<00:08:05.600> reports<00:08:05.960> from<00:08:06.020> the
