00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:12.589 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:23.070 

taking<00:05:13.589> it<00:05:13.740> from<00:05:13.889> here<00:05:13.979> to<00:05:14.249> there

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.730 

and<00:05:23.229> you<00:05:23.319> pick<00:05:23.560> them<00:05:23.680> in<00:05:23.860> pick<00:05:24.280> great

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.189 

if<00:05:28.160> I<00:05:28.340> was<00:05:28.520> you<00:05:28.789> at<00:05:29.180> least<00:05:29.360> with<00:05:29.509> my<00:05:29.660> Subaru<00:05:29.930> I

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
if I was you at least with my Subaru I

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.810 
if I was you at least with my Subaru I
think<00:05:30.350> a<00:05:30.380> logging<00:05:30.650> road<00:05:30.710> it's<00:05:30.979> it's<00:05:31.400> faster

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
think a logging road it's it's faster
