quick animation that I I made using some
motion<00:00:32.969> capture<00:00:33.329> files<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.250> I<00:00:35.250> rented<00:00:36.059> this

motion capture files and I rented this
file<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:37.260> one<00:00:37.620> frame<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.280> file<00:00:38.579> and

light and one spotlight with a soft
shadow<00:01:35.040> alright<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.950> come

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
shadow alright so what I do is I come

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.280 
shadow alright so what I do is I come
here<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.520> wireframe<00:01:39.119> click<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:39.750> time<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
here to the wireframe click one time and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.840 
here to the wireframe click one time and
switch<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.100> realistic<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:44.100> what<00:01:44.610> you're

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
switch to realistic so what you're

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.440 
switch to realistic so what you're
looking<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.799> real<00:01:46.799> time<00:01:48.829> nitrous<00:01:49.829> engine

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
looking at is real time nitrous engine

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.300 
looking at is real time nitrous engine
showing<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.720> what<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.470> scene<00:01:52.740> looks<00:01:53.009> like

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
showing you what this scene looks like

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.940 
showing you what this scene looks like
and<00:01:53.640> as<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> slide<00:01:54.659> backwards<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.649> see<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and as I slide backwards you can see the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.370 
and as I slide backwards you can see the
shadows<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.479> takes<00:01:57.659> about<00:01:57.810> maybe<00:01:58.259> a

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
shadows and it takes about maybe a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.620 
shadows and it takes about maybe a
second<00:01:58.920> before<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.490> screen<00:01:59.880> redraws<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.570> you

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
second before the screen redraws and you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.830 
second before the screen redraws and you
can<00:02:00.810> see<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:00.990> soft<00:02:01.350> shadows<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.790> imagine<00:02:03.570> if

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
can see the soft shadows so imagine if

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.929 
can see the soft shadows so imagine if
you<00:02:04.020> needed<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> quick<00:02:05.369> render

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
you needed to do like a quick render

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.150 
you needed to do like a quick render
just<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.689> preview<00:02:07.110> what<00:02:07.140> your<00:02:07.350> animation<00:02:08.039> will

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
just to preview what your animation will

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.320 
just to preview what your animation will
look<00:02:08.310> like<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:10.200> could<00:02:10.349> either<00:02:10.560> render<00:02:11.459> you

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
look like you could either render you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.790 
look like you could either render you
know<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.510> try<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.840> get<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.200> extra

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
know to try to get that extra

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.300 
know to try to get that extra
quality<00:02:14.460> inn<00:02:14.640> then<00:02:14.880> until<00:02:15.270> take<00:02:15.510> about<00:02:15.780> two<00:02:16.080> to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
quality inn then until take about two to

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.250 
quality inn then until take about two to
seven<00:02:17.310> minutes<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:18.060> me<00:02:18.270> what<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.570> did<00:02:18.750> was<00:02:18.960> I<00:02:19.110> I

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
seven minutes for me what I did was I I

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.030 
seven minutes for me what I did was I I
cranked<00:02:19.710> up<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.240> resolution<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:21.530> all<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
cranked up the resolution and all the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.750 
cranked up the resolution and all the
way<00:02:23.190> up<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:23.910> could<00:02:24.000> actually<00:02:24.300> get<00:02:24.600> this<00:02:24.810> soft

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
way up so I could actually get this soft

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.190 
way up so I could actually get this soft
rendering<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.120> added<00:02:27.480> depth<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.870> field

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
rendering of the added depth of field
