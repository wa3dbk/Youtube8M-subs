let's<00:00:12.490> get<00:00:12.759> started<00:00:13.570> we're<00:00:14.230> going<00:00:14.559> to<00:00:14.740> start

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
let's get started we're going to start

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:22.440 
let's get started we're going to start
out<00:00:15.280> with<00:00:15.580> an<00:00:16.390> upside<00:00:17.080> down<00:00:17.619> you<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:22.180> that

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
out with an upside down you like that

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.880 
out with an upside down you like that
now<00:00:23.410> we're<00:00:23.619> going<00:00:23.770> to<00:00:23.890> close<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:24.699> you<00:00:24.910> up<00:00:25.890> with

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
now we're going to close the you up with

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.749 
now we're going to close the you up with
the<00:00:27.070> line<00:00:27.310> and<00:00:28.270> you'll<00:00:28.450> want<00:00:28.599> to<00:00:28.719> make<00:00:28.779> sure

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
the line and you'll want to make sure

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.220 
the line and you'll want to make sure
that<00:00:30.759> the<00:00:30.939> curves<00:00:31.180> right<00:00:31.419> here<00:00:31.629> kind<00:00:31.899> of<00:00:31.989> soft

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
that the curves right here kind of soft

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.910 
that the curves right here kind of soft
softish<00:00:32.920> curves<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:34.780> underneath<00:00:35.410> we're

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
softish curves then underneath we're

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.170 
softish curves then underneath we're
going<00:00:36.129> to<00:00:36.250> put<00:00:37.710> some<00:00:38.710> views<00:00:39.219> and<00:00:39.640> we<00:00:39.850> are<00:00:39.969> going

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
going to put some views and we are going

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.569 
going to put some views and we are going
to<00:00:40.270> attach<00:00:40.629> those<00:00:41.020> used<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.510> bottom<00:00:43.899> line

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
to attach those used to the bottom line

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:55.470 
to attach those used to the bottom line
all<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:46.210> way<00:00:46.239> across<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.809> like<00:00:53.409> that<00:00:54.480> now

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
all the way across just like that now

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.969 
all the way across just like that now
we're<00:00:55.690> going<00:00:55.839> to<00:00:55.929> put<00:00:56.140> some<00:00:56.350> tentacles<00:00:56.800> down

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
we're going to put some tentacles down

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.809 
we're going to put some tentacles down
here<00:00:58.679> so<00:00:59.679> we're<00:01:00.039> going<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.309> make<00:01:00.550> them<00:01:00.760> a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:00.819 
here so we're going to make them a

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:05.610 
here so we're going to make them a
little<00:01:01.179> bit<00:01:01.600> curvy<00:01:02.639> and<00:01:03.780> then<00:01:04.780> swirly<00:01:05.320> at<00:01:05.440> the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
little bit curvy and then swirly at the

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.260 
little bit curvy and then swirly at the
end<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:08.080> I<00:01:08.140> usually<00:01:08.409> put<00:01:08.680> maybe<00:01:09.100> about<00:01:09.400> four<00:01:09.880> or

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
end so I usually put maybe about four or

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:20.850 
end so I usually put maybe about four or
five<00:01:12.870> tentacles<00:01:13.870> like<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.650> okay

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
five tentacles like that okay

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.560 
five tentacles like that okay
now<00:01:21.040> what<00:01:21.220> I<00:01:21.250> like<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.670> do<00:01:21.790> is<00:01:22.000> I<00:01:22.120> like<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.330> go

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
now what I like to do is I like to go

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.240 
now what I like to do is I like to go
over<00:01:22.600> them<00:01:22.960> again<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.500> I<00:01:23.530> don't<00:01:23.590> go<00:01:23.860> over<00:01:24.100> them

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
over them again and I don't go over them

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.760 
over them again and I don't go over them
very<00:01:25.440> carefully

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
very carefully

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.240 
very carefully
I<00:01:27.010> just<00:01:27.490> kind<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:27.760> follow<00:01:27.970> along<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.510> same

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
I just kind of follow along the same

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.800 
I just kind of follow along the same
lines<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:30.580> if<00:01:30.670> I<00:01:30.790> go<00:01:30.940> out<00:01:31.120> of<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.570> line<00:01:31.780> a

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
lines and if I go out of the line a

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.630 
lines and if I go out of the line a
little<00:01:32.200> bit<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:32.530> think<00:01:32.650> it<00:01:32.950> what<00:01:33.100> makes<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.520> look

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
little bit I think it what makes it look

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.540 
little bit I think it what makes it look
even<00:01:33.850> more<00:01:34.000> interesting<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:36.400> I<00:01:36.490> just<00:01:36.820> go<00:01:37.090> over

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
even more interesting so I just go over

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.550 
even more interesting so I just go over
each<00:01:39.550> one<00:01:39.610> of<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.330> lines<00:01:40.570> again<00:01:43.320> give<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.350> a

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
each one of the lines again give it a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.510 
each one of the lines again give it a
little<00:01:44.770> bit<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:46.050> or<00:01:47.050> die<00:01:47.200> menschen<00:01:47.470> so<00:01:48.340> we'll

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
little bit of or die menschen so we'll

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.940 
little bit of or die menschen so we'll
go<00:01:48.640> back<00:01:48.670> up<00:01:48.880> let's<00:01:49.810> make<00:01:50.020> them<00:01:50.140> some<00:01:50.410> wide-set
