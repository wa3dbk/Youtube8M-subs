 training behind come back like this in 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.750

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.620
 incredible freight because on one side we 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.329

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:12.740
 europe is then that the 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:15.259
 so cardboard the point of being discovered 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.030
 by being fraud abramoff who did 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.350
 almost the rope to greet their property in 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.350

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.820
 first 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.259
 with a shot that goes from step to the 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:46.820
 high it goes down and it goes up in the 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:48.380
 dormer on stage clear stage they 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:56.450

 athich there down 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.540

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.540
 that this season starts 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.440

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.760

 defender the awful parents but without 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.340

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.930

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.390
 in their shells and and exclusion 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:57.560

 Sabia hurt herself by falling back wide 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.300
 think it's a whole I think 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:17.430
 it's a whole musical ground is 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.170
 beautiful on the road to the movement of 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.410
 rotation on the back base we use 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.840
 of pivot in scene a shot to the right a 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.080
 blow left 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.730
 all the bodies thanks to the stockings this one to 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.720
 my opinion she if we will not see 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.550
 a lot in the year because we 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.120
 looked at the wrist that we turn to 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.710
 more than a meter on the other side 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.700

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.710

 look at the second rule to whom 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.260
 we make a shot of which he has the secret he 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.120
 is unbalanced 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.010
 behind ball in the back to finish 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.010
