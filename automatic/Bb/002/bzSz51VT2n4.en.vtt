00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
care deeply for this girl and I was very

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.890 
care deeply for this girl and I was very
familiar<00:03:46.220> with<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.730> specific<00:03:47.209> problem<00:03:47.570> but

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
familiar with the specific problem but

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.479 
familiar with the specific problem but
as<00:03:48.020> we<00:03:48.200> SAT<00:03:48.410> there<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:48.680> talked<00:03:48.950> an<00:03:49.160> idea

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
as we SAT there and talked an idea

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.400 
as we SAT there and talked an idea
struck<00:03:49.760> me<00:03:49.820> like<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:50.090> lightning<00:03:50.360> bolt<00:03:50.600> that

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410

past week I had been trying to

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.130 
past week I had been trying to

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
understand and solve a similar but

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.870 
understand and solve a similar but
unrelated<00:03:54.500> problem<00:03:55.070> for<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.280> course<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.760> was

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
unrelated problem for a course I was

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.850 
unrelated problem for a course I was
creating<00:03:56.180> primarily<00:03:56.600> for<00:03:56.870> men<00:03:57.050> with<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.560> surge
