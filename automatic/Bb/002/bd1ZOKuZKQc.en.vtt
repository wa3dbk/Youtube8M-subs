00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
the past that the Buffalo International

the weight capacities or whatever are

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.090 
the weight capacities or whatever are
there<00:01:48.119> some<00:01:48.299> conditions<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.350> had<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.009> be

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
there some conditions that had to be

actually<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.820> there<00:01:57.719> early<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.079> no<00:01:58.229> problem

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
actually the there early is no problem

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.899 
actually the there early is no problem
with<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> weight<00:01:58.920> bearing<00:01:59.159> capacity<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.820> the

underneath<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.670> runways<00:02:03.210> were<00:02:03.479> thought<00:02:03.750> to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
underneath the runways were thought to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.070 
underneath the runways were thought to
be

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
be

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.810 
be

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
much not stressed enough to be able to

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.100 
much not stressed enough to be able to
accommodate<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.300> large<00:02:07.480> planes<00:02:07.780> but<00:02:07.990> they

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
accommodate the large planes but they

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.650 
accommodate the large planes but they
can<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:09.009> big<00:02:09.190> issue<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:09.910> aircraft<00:02:10.390> comes

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
can the big issue is this aircraft comes

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.870 
can the big issue is this aircraft comes
in<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:11.020> doesn't<00:02:11.320> have<00:02:11.470> 550<00:02:12.160> people<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.790> it

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
in it doesn't have 550 people on it it

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.540 
in it doesn't have 550 people on it it
doesn't<00:02:13.030> have<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.300> full<00:02:13.570> load<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.900> luggage<00:02:14.550> it

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
doesn't have a full load of luggage it

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.720 
doesn't have a full load of luggage it
doesn't<00:02:15.970> have<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.150> fuel<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.730> commercial

doesn't have the fuel that commercial

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.700 
doesn't have the fuel that commercial
carrier<00:02:19.090> would<00:02:19.210> have<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.320> problems

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
carrier would have and the problems

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.890 
carrier would have and the problems
never<00:02:20.950> on<00:02:21.130> landing<00:02:21.550> it's<00:02:21.700> taking<00:02:22.060> off<00:02:22.210> really

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
never on landing it's taking off really

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.510 
never on landing it's taking off really
yeah<00:02:23.200> they<00:02:23.410> need<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.680> added<00:02:23.860> runway<00:02:24.310> length

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
yeah they need the added runway length

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.410 
yeah they need the added runway length
to<00:02:24.610> be<00:02:24.700> able<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.880> get<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.060> plane<00:02:25.240> off<00:02:25.270> the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
to be able to get the plane off the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.910 
to be able to get the plane off the
ground<00:02:25.540> but<00:02:25.930> because<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.320> doesn't<00:02:26.560> have<00:02:26.650> as

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
ground but because it doesn't have as

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.500 
ground but because it doesn't have as
much<00:02:27.070> load<00:02:27.370> on<00:02:27.550> this<00:02:27.700> plane<00:02:27.910> it'll<00:02:28.120> be<00:02:28.270> able<00:02:28.330> to

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
much load on this plane it'll be able to

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.240 
much load on this plane it'll be able to
get<00:02:28.600> off<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.140> these<00:02:29.350> airports<00:02:29.710> pilots
