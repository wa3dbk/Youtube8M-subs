this<00:02:00.479> corner<00:02:00.750> he<00:02:01.350> jumps<00:02:01.649> out<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.040> wouldn't

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
this corner he jumps out and I wouldn't

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.219 
this corner he jumps out and I wouldn't
actually<00:02:02.579> recommend<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.270> because<00:02:03.780> he<00:02:04.079> took

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
actually recommend this because he took

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.929 
actually recommend this because he took
on<00:02:04.380> two<00:02:04.590> guys<00:02:04.799> at<00:02:05.130> two<00:02:05.310> areas<00:02:05.640> I'm<00:02:05.729> let's<00:02:05.850> have

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
on two guys at two areas I'm let's have

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.029 
on two guys at two areas I'm let's have
a<00:02:05.969> look<00:02:06.119> from<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.360> new<00:02:06.479> cap<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.200> guy<00:02:07.560> one<00:02:07.829> to

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
a look from the new cap so guy one to

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.800 
a look from the new cap so guy one to
his<00:02:08.160> left<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.610> one<00:02:08.759> guy<00:02:08.940> two<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.479> front<00:02:09.690> of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
his left and on one guy two in front of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.970 
his left and on one guy two in front of
him<00:02:09.899> not<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> smart<00:02:10.950> thing<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.489> do

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
him not a smart thing to do

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.619 
him not a smart thing to do
because<00:02:12.790> if<00:02:12.879> those<00:02:13.000> guys<00:02:13.120> had<00:02:13.180> been<00:02:13.450> better

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
because if those guys had been better

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.210 
because if those guys had been better
they<00:02:14.019> would<00:02:14.170> have<00:02:14.260> take<00:02:14.379> him<00:02:14.500> down<00:02:14.650> easily<00:02:14.950> and

they would have take him down easily and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.880 
they would have take him down easily and
it's<00:02:15.400> because<00:02:16.299> of<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.349> know<00:02:17.379> Derek's

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
it's because of the you know Derek's

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.229 
it's because of the you know Derek's
tremendous<00:02:18.370> skill<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.790> game<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.120> he's

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
tremendous skill of the game and he's

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.910 
tremendous skill of the game and he's
easy<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.750> quick<00:02:20.049> to<00:02:20.290> get<00:02:20.530> shots<00:02:20.739> on<00:02:20.890> target

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
easy and quick to get shots on target

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.890 
easy and quick to get shots on target
and<00:02:21.519> maybe<00:02:21.940> combined<00:02:22.269> a<00:02:22.390> little<00:02:22.599> bit<00:02:22.720> with

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
and maybe combined a little bit with

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.630 
and maybe combined a little bit with
with<00:02:23.140> their<00:02:23.440> lack<00:02:23.709> of<00:02:23.739> being<00:02:24.069> able<00:02:24.159> to<00:02:24.340> do<00:02:24.430> so

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
with their lack of being able to do so

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.410 
with their lack of being able to do so
that<00:02:25.090> helps<00:02:25.299> him<00:02:25.420> get<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:26.470> double<00:02:26.680> kill<00:02:26.830> their

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
that helps him get the double kill their

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.490 
that helps him get the double kill their
pick-sixes<00:02:28.420> mortars<00:02:28.840> obviously<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.319> gives

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
pick-sixes mortars obviously and gives

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.979 
pick-sixes mortars obviously and gives
himself<00:02:29.620> another<00:02:29.920> double<00:02:30.220> kill<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:31.269> at<00:02:31.900> this

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
himself another double kill and at this

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.809
