00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
here it's more of an aesthetic look

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.579 
here it's more of an aesthetic look
thing<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.239> sure<00:01:03.390> does<00:01:03.570> look<00:01:04.140> super<00:01:04.290> nice

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589

thing but it sure does look super nice
now<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.970> tires<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.420> axles<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:06.990> spread

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
now the tires and the axles are spread

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.469 
now the tires and the axles are spread
apart<00:01:07.530> eight<00:01:07.770> inches<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.939> allows<00:01:09.210> us<00:01:09.240> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
apart eight inches and that allows us to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
apart eight inches and that allows us to
trim<00:01:09.869> out<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.200> between<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.680> tires<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.369> allows

trim out in between the tires and allows

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.270 
trim out in between the tires and allows
us<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.360> put<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.659> these<00:01:12.810> nice<00:01:13.280> exterior

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.230 
us to put on these nice exterior
friender<00:01:14.850> ends<00:01:16.580> now<00:01:17.580> when<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.759> comes<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.030> car

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
friender ends now when it comes to car

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.510 
friender ends now when it comes to car
hauler<00:01:18.450> trailers<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.470> pull<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:19.890> vehicle<00:01:19.920> in

hauler trailers you pull your vehicle in

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.730 
hauler trailers you pull your vehicle in
and<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.060> question<00:01:21.450> becomes<00:01:21.780> how<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.530> get

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
and the question becomes how do you get

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.590 
and the question becomes how do you get
out<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> car<00:01:23.340> especially<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
out of the car especially if you have a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.719 
out of the car especially if you have a
low<00:01:24.810> profile<00:01:25.259> vehicle<00:01:25.740> now<00:01:26.159> if<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
low profile vehicle now if you have a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.880 
low profile vehicle now if you have a
typical<00:01:27.090> escape<00:01:27.900> door<00:01:28.110> sits<00:01:28.470> right<00:01:28.650> about

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
typical escape door sits right about

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.789 
typical escape door sits right about
here<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.390> if<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.600> too<00:01:30.810> low<00:01:31.020> profile<00:01:31.470> can't

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
here and if it's too low profile can't

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.170 
here and if it's too low profile can't
open<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.100> your<00:01:32.189> car<00:01:32.430> door<00:01:32.610> because<00:01:32.850> it'll<00:01:33.090> hit

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
open up your car door because it'll hit

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.969 
open up your car door because it'll hit
the<00:01:33.329> wheel<00:01:33.509> well<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.079> inside<00:01:34.470> you

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the wheel well on the inside you

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.920 
the wheel well on the inside you
literally<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.520> climb<00:01:35.880> out<00:01:36.030> Dukes<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
literally have to climb out Dukes of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.140 
literally have to climb out Dukes of
Hazzard<00:01:37.320> style<00:01:37.590> through<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.070> window<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
Hazzard style through the window so the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.460 
Hazzard style through the window so the
solution<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.250> our<00:01:41.250> 88<00:01:41.820> inch<00:01:42.030> wide

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
solution to this is our 88 inch wide

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.789 
solution to this is our 88 inch wide
premium<00:01:43.470> escape<00:01:43.799> door<00:01:44.869> now<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.930> entire<00:01:46.320> side

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
premium escape door now the entire side

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.039 
premium escape door now the entire side
of<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.040> trailer<00:01:47.520> just<00:01:48.000> lifts<00:01:48.390> right<00:01:48.570> up

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.840 

so<00:01:51.740> once<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.070> door<00:01:52.250> is<00:01:52.280> in<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.549> up<00:01:52.820> position

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
so once the door is in the up position

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.399 
so once the door is in the up position
you<00:01:53.840> just<00:01:54.020> simply<00:01:54.350> take<00:01:54.560> your<00:01:54.770> fender<00:01:55.189> well

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
you just simply take your fender well

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.810 
you just simply take your fender well
which<00:01:57.409> is<00:01:57.560> made<00:01:57.740> out<00:01:57.890> of<00:01:58.009> aluminum<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:58.670> it's

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
which is made out of aluminum so it's

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.080 
which is made out of aluminum so it's
ultra<00:01:59.240> light<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:01.100> you<00:02:01.310> lift<00:02:01.549> it<00:02:01.729> right<00:02:01.759> out<00:02:02.060> of

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
ultra light and you lift it right out of

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.240 
ultra light and you lift it right out of
the<00:02:02.270> trailer<00:02:02.659> now<00:02:03.170> if<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.439> pull<00:02:03.649> your<00:02:03.679> vehicle

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
the trailer now if you pull your vehicle

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.660 
the trailer now if you pull your vehicle
in<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:05.750> just<00:02:05.899> simply<00:02:06.259> step<00:02:06.590> down<00:02:06.829> onto

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
in and you just simply step down onto

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.130 
in and you just simply step down onto
this<00:02:07.819> step<00:02:08.149> that's<00:02:08.360> built<00:02:08.660> right<00:02:08.780> in<00:02:09.019> between

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
this step that's built right in between

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.380 
this step that's built right in between
the<00:02:09.500> fenders<00:02:09.890> on<00:02:10.039> that<00:02:10.549> Sprite<00:02:10.849> axle<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:11.269> we

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
the fenders on that Sprite axle that we

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.729 
the fenders on that Sprite axle that we
looked<00:02:11.569> at<00:02:11.690> earlier<00:02:14.230> another<00:02:15.230> common<00:02:15.650> issue

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
looked at earlier another common issue

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.650 
looked at earlier another common issue
that<00:02:16.040> people<00:02:16.160> have<00:02:16.519> with<00:02:16.700> longer<00:02:17.060> trailers<00:02:17.480> is

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
that people have with longer trailers is

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.089 
that people have with longer trailers is
you<00:02:17.750> always<00:02:17.930> have<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.290> worry<00:02:18.500> about<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.890> rear

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
you always have to worry about the rear

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.250 
you always have to worry about the rear
end<00:02:19.340> getting<00:02:19.549> scraped<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.239> damaged<00:02:20.660> when<00:02:21.170> you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
end getting scraped and damaged when you

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.380 
end getting scraped and damaged when you
go<00:02:21.379> up<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.709> down<00:02:21.860> inclines<00:02:22.459> or<00:02:22.849> even<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.239> and

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
go up and down inclines or even in and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.420 
go up and down inclines or even in and
out<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.660> gas<00:02:23.840> station<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.920> solution<00:02:25.400> to

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
out of a gas station so the solution to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.800 
out of a gas station so the solution to
that<00:02:25.549> is<00:02:25.760> what<00:02:25.910> we<00:02:25.970> call<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.209> reverse<00:02:26.510> beaver

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
that is what we call the reverse beaver

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.870 
that is what we call the reverse beaver
tail<00:02:27.019> now<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.590> inside<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.489> trailer<00:02:28.700> the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
tail now the inside of the trailer the

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.030 
tail now the inside of the trailer the
floor<00:02:29.209> actually<00:02:29.420> slopes<00:02:29.959> down<00:02:30.260> makes<00:02:30.890> it

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
floor actually slopes down makes it

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.309 
floor actually slopes down makes it
easier<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.579> load<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:31.910> unload<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:32.239> vehicle<00:02:32.780> but

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
easier to load and unload a vehicle but

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.979 
easier to load and unload a vehicle but
the<00:02:33.470> exterior<00:02:34.099> trim<00:02:34.489> actually<00:02:35.390> kicks<00:02:35.690> up<00:02:35.870> in

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
the exterior trim actually kicks up in

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.660 
the exterior trim actually kicks up in
the<00:02:36.079> rear<00:02:36.319> reverse<00:02:36.799> beavertail<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:37.549> that

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
the rear reverse beavertail so that

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.890 
the rear reverse beavertail so that
actually<00:02:37.910> protects<00:02:38.269> this<00:02:38.450> rear<00:02:38.660> end<00:02:38.750> from

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
actually protects this rear end from

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.930 
actually protects this rear end from
getting<00:02:39.230> damaged<00:02:39.620> we<00:02:40.130> also<00:02:40.310> put<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.670> pair<00:02:40.910> of

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
getting damaged we also put a pair of

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.280 
getting damaged we also put a pair of
skid<00:02:41.239> plates<00:02:41.540> on<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.810> rear<00:02:41.930> it's<00:02:42.049> just<00:02:42.170> a

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
skid plates on the rear it's just a

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.589 
skid plates on the rear it's just a
simple<00:02:42.650> aluminum<00:02:43.069> plate<00:02:43.340> just<00:02:44.000> protects<00:02:44.390> that

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
simple aluminum plate just protects that

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.960 
simple aluminum plate just protects that
as<00:02:44.750> well<00:02:44.930> we<00:02:45.709> could<00:02:45.980> upgrade<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.640> add<00:02:46.760> some

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
diamond-plate extended flap on the end

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.009 
diamond-plate extended flap on the end
and<00:03:30.620> if<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.519> do<00:03:31.700> have<00:03:31.849> a<00:03:31.880> super<00:03:32.359> low<00:03:32.480> profile

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
and if you do have a super low profile

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.750 
and if you do have a super low profile
vehicle<00:03:33.530> we<00:03:33.680> could<00:03:33.859> go<00:03:34.040> with<00:03:34.099> an<00:03:34.220> extended

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
vehicle we could go with an extended

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.500 
vehicle we could go with an extended
flap<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:35.269> helps<00:03:35.840> with<00:03:35.930> floating

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.300 

so<00:03:39.260> going<00:03:39.470> inside<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.860> trailer<00:03:40.129> we<00:03:40.220> have

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
so going inside the trailer we have

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.009 
so going inside the trailer we have
what's<00:03:40.459> called<00:03:40.519> a<00:03:40.700> gapless<00:03:41.000> continuous<00:03:41.780> hinge

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
what's called a gapless continuous hinge

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.500 
what's called a gapless continuous hinge
so<00:03:42.260> it's<00:03:42.379> a<00:03:42.470> one<00:03:42.650> solid<00:03:43.150> basically<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.180> piano

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
so it's a one solid basically a piano

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.809 
so it's a one solid basically a piano
hinge<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.170> we<00:03:45.769> cover<00:03:46.010> this<00:03:46.220> with<00:03:46.400> rubber<00:03:46.670> to

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
hinge and we cover this with rubber to

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.789 
hinge and we cover this with rubber to
prevent<00:03:47.209> dirt<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.019> debris<00:03:48.319> from<00:03:48.560> dropping

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
prevent dirt and debris from dropping

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.759 
prevent dirt and debris from dropping
down<00:03:49.069> into<00:03:49.400> that<00:03:49.519> got<00:03:50.030> some<00:03:50.180> nice<00:03:50.330> heavy-duty

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
down into that got some nice heavy-duty

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.589 
down into that got some nice heavy-duty
recess<00:03:51.769> D<00:03:52.040> rings<00:03:52.310> in<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.549> floor<00:03:52.819> and<00:03:53.060> some

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
recess D rings in the floor and some

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.509 
recess D rings in the floor and some
linoleum<00:03:54.230> flooring<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.799> cover<00:03:55.010> up<00:03:55.190> just<00:03:55.400> a

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
linoleum flooring to cover up just a

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.050 
linoleum flooring to cover up just a
standard<00:03:55.790> plywood<00:03:57.549> now<00:03:58.549> here's<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.819> really

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
standard plywood now here's a really

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.610 
standard plywood now here's a really
good<00:03:59.269> look<00:03:59.480> at<00:03:59.599> these<00:03:59.750> wheel<00:03:59.989> wells<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:00.470> your

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
good look at these wheel wells so your

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.740 
good look at these wheel wells so your
typical<00:04:00.860> real<00:04:01.310> well<00:04:01.549> is<00:04:01.760> about<00:04:02.299> eleven<00:04:02.599> and<00:04:02.690> a

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
typical real well is about eleven and a

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.110 
typical real well is about eleven and a
half<00:04:02.810> inches<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:03.950> if<00:04:04.280> you've<00:04:04.400> got<00:04:04.519> a<00:04:04.579> car<00:04:04.879> door

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
half inches so if you've got a car door

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.630 
half inches so if you've got a car door
that<00:04:05.599> stands<00:04:06.230> eleven<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:06.799> a<00:04:06.860> half<00:04:06.920> inches<00:04:07.430> or

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
that stands eleven and a half inches or

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.729 
that stands eleven and a half inches or
shorter<00:04:08.290> then<00:04:09.290> you're<00:04:09.409> going<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:09.590> be<00:04:09.650> in

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
shorter then you're going to be in

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.680 
shorter then you're going to be in
trouble<00:04:09.950> so<00:04:10.579> when<00:04:10.970> we've<00:04:11.120> got<00:04:11.269> the<00:04:11.420> premium

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
trouble so when we've got the premium

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.259 
trouble so when we've got the premium
escape<00:04:12.079> door<00:04:12.319> and<00:04:12.590> you<00:04:13.069> lift<00:04:13.459> this<00:04:13.640> fender<00:04:14.090> out

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
you actually end up with just about

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.819 
you actually end up with just about
eight<00:04:17.180> inch<00:04:17.479> it's<00:04:17.720> just<00:04:17.959> over<00:04:18.229> eight<00:04:18.440> inches

mention the extra depth that you get
from<00:04:23.479> taking<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.840> fender<00:04:24.139> well<00:04:24.289> out<00:04:24.490> now<00:04:25.490> with

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
from taking a fender well out now with

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.520 
from taking a fender well out now with
the<00:04:25.729> escape<00:04:26.000> door<00:04:26.120> closed<00:04:26.539> one<00:04:27.380> of<00:04:27.470> the

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
the escape door closed one of the

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.290 
the escape door closed one of the
concerns<00:04:27.889> is<00:04:28.100> that<00:04:28.130> is<00:04:28.550> this<00:04:28.760> fender<00:04:29.120> well

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
concerns is that is this fender well

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.779 
concerns is that is this fender well
secured<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.110> answer<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:31.010> that<00:04:31.039> is<00:04:31.280> yes<00:04:31.490> so

secured and the answer to that is yes so

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.400 
secured and the answer to that is yes so
there's<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.120> piece<00:04:32.360> of<00:04:32.510> aluminum<00:04:32.960> here<00:04:33.229> and

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
actually pushes down on this fender well

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.909 
actually pushes down on this fender well
and<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.210> creates<00:04:38.479> a<00:04:38.570> very<00:04:38.600> sturdy<00:04:39.110> nice<00:04:39.440> sealed
