fingernail it's part of yourself it's
almost<00:03:23.380> like<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.650> phonograph<00:03:24.130> needle<00:03:25.350> which

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
almost like a phonograph needle which

you're holding your hands but the music
that's<00:03:28.900> played<00:03:29.380> comes<00:03:29.980> from<00:03:30.220> inside<00:03:31.060> me<00:03:31.680> so

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
that's played comes from inside me so

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
that's played comes from inside me so
it's<00:03:33.270> very<00:03:34.270> very<00:03:34.600> sensitive<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.460> like<00:03:36.460> all

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
it's very very sensitive and like all

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.680 
it's very very sensitive and like all
tools<00:03:37.000> are<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:38.680> an<00:03:38.980> extension<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.550> one's<00:03:40.540> own

fingers<00:03:46.350> well<00:03:47.350> I<00:03:47.380> think<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.680> artists<00:03:48.040> job<00:03:48.130> is

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
fingers well I think the artists job is

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.640 
fingers well I think the artists job is
to<00:03:49.750> try<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.260> touch<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:52.390> seek<00:03:52.660> for<00:03:52.930> some<00:03:53.380> kind<00:03:53.620> of

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
to try to touch to seek for some kind of

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.300 
to try to touch to seek for some kind of
universal<00:03:54.420> meeting<00:03:55.420> point<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:56.310> somehow

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
universal meeting point and somehow

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.730 
universal meeting point and somehow
create<00:03:57.910> something<00:03:58.600> which<00:03:58.840> strikes<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.380> chord

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
create something which strikes a chord

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.110 
create something which strikes a chord
in<00:04:00.280> your<00:04:00.600> heart<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.650> in<00:04:02.740> a<00:04:02.800> sense<00:04:03.040> it's<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.520> reach

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
in your heart so in a sense it's I reach

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.010 
in your heart so in a sense it's I reach
into<00:04:04.420> mine<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:05.500> make<00:04:07.770> images<00:04:08.910> which<00:04:10.020> means

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
into mine to make images which means

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.760 
into mine to make images which means
something<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.590> me

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
something to me

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.470 
something to me
and<00:04:11.950> because<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.460> that<00:04:12.610> meaning<00:04:12.940> to<00:04:13.120> meet<00:04:13.300> they

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
and because of that meaning to meet they

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.600 
and because of that meaning to meet they
will<00:04:13.660> also<00:04:13.870> mean<00:04:14.230> on<00:04:14.440> one<00:04:14.710> level<00:04:14.920> something<00:04:15.490> to

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
will also mean on one level something to

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.479 
will also mean on one level something to
the<00:04:15.700> artist<00:04:16.060> which<00:04:16.180> is<00:04:16.330> in<00:04:16.450> you<00:04:17.040> in<00:04:18.040> a<00:04:18.130> musical

the artist which is in you in a musical

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.280 
the artist which is in you in a musical
term<00:04:18.640> it's<00:04:18.880> almost<00:04:19.120> like<00:04:19.330> you're<00:04:19.840> trying<00:04:19.989> to
