nectarine tree that we planted here
about<00:00:17.520> three<00:00:17.820> years<00:00:18.090> ago<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.859> it's<00:00:19.859> growing

more<00:01:09.870> it<00:01:10.200> grows<00:01:10.760> faster<00:01:11.760> every<00:01:12.150> year<00:01:14.000> he<00:01:15.000> has

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
more it grows faster every year he has

got a weed three years the first year
remember<00:02:21.940> when<00:02:22.239> we<00:02:22.530> planted<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.920> was<00:02:24.280> um<00:02:24.640> it

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600

remember when we planted it it was um it
was<00:02:25.660> pretty<00:02:25.959> windy<00:02:26.380> I'm<00:02:26.530> just<00:02:26.800> thought<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.100> was

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
was pretty windy I'm just thought it was

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.170 
was pretty windy I'm just thought it was
gonna<00:02:27.459> fall<00:02:27.850> down<00:02:28.120> because<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.780> was<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.110> fresh

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
gonna fall down because it was so fresh

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.699 
gonna fall down because it was so fresh
now<00:02:31.180> it's<00:02:31.800> it's<00:02:32.800> in<00:02:32.980> there<00:02:33.190> yeah<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:35.590> an

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
now it's it's in there yeah it's an

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.900 
now it's it's in there yeah it's an
established<00:02:36.390> nectarine<00:02:37.390> tree<00:02:38.160> with<00:02:39.160> fruit

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
established nectarine tree with fruit

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.030 
established nectarine tree with fruit
growing<00:02:40.239> see<00:02:40.870> all<00:02:40.959> this<00:02:41.079> is<00:02:41.260> dangling<00:02:41.709> maybe

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
growing see all this is dangling maybe

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.190 
growing see all this is dangling maybe
we<00:02:42.190> should<00:02:42.340> tie<00:02:42.970> this<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.299> a<00:02:43.329> trellis

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.130 

it's<00:02:48.200> just<00:02:49.150> there's<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.269> lot<00:02:50.659> of<00:02:50.750> through<00:02:50.959> it's

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
it's just there's a lot of through it's

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.679 
it's just there's a lot of through it's
just<00:02:51.260> winging<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.739> new<00:02:51.890> branches<00:02:52.480> should<00:02:53.480> we

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
just winging the new branches should we

00:02:53.689 --> 00:03:03.520 
just winging the new branches should we
trim<00:02:54.230> these<00:02:54.560> off<00:02:55.040> in<00:02:55.819> on<00:02:56.329> the<00:02:56.510> bottom<00:03:02.409> you<00:03:03.409> know

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
trim these off in on the bottom you know

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.550 
trim these off in on the bottom you know
this<00:03:03.709> is<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.980> first<00:03:04.190> time<00:03:04.569> we're<00:03:05.569> seeing<00:03:05.599> this

this is the first time we're seeing this
much<00:03:06.920> amount<00:03:07.159> of<00:03:07.310> fruit<00:03:19.000> I'm<00:03:20.000> actually<00:03:20.150> right

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
much amount of fruit I'm actually right

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.089 
much amount of fruit I'm actually right
in<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.140> middle<00:03:21.349> of<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.560> tree

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099
