the American Dream is the idea that

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.740 
the American Dream is the idea that
anybody<00:03:56.370> can<00:03:56.580> achieve<00:03:56.880> anything<00:03:57.180> they<00:03:57.480> want

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
to in America if they work hard enough

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.480 
to in America if they work hard enough
but<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.900> gold<00:04:01.230> rimmed<00:04:01.620> spectacles<00:04:01.740> are<00:04:02.460> a

but the gold rimmed spectacles are a

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.030 
but the gold rimmed spectacles are a
symbol<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.090> Steinbeck's<00:04:03.600> major<00:04:03.870> theme<00:04:04.200> of<00:04:04.410> the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
symbol of Steinbeck's major theme of the

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.860 
symbol of Steinbeck's major theme of the
futility<00:04:05.400> of<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.880> American<00:04:06.300> dream

futility of the American dream

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.170 
futility of the American dream
Brooks<00:04:07.560> can<00:04:07.800> never<00:04:08.070> achieve<00:04:08.250> his<00:04:08.670> American

Dream because again he is a black man in
a<00:04:12.210> racist<00:04:12.540> society<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:13.530> therefore<00:04:14.400> they<00:04:14.910> are

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
a racist society and therefore they are

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.180 
a racist society and therefore they are
certain<00:04:15.300> his<00:04:15.450> dream<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:15.960> symbolically<00:04:16.470> hung

up<00:04:17.540> now<00:04:18.540> what<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:18.690> did<00:04:18.900> there<00:04:19.110> was<00:04:19.230> I<00:04:19.290> talked

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
up now what I did there was I talked

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.250 
up now what I did there was I talked
about<00:04:19.650> one<00:04:20.130> short<00:04:20.820> quotation<00:04:21.510> gold<00:04:21.900> rimmed

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
about one short quotation gold rimmed

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.790 
about one short quotation gold rimmed
spectacles<00:04:22.730> hung<00:04:23.730> on<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:23.970> nail<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.600> I<00:04:25.290> was<00:04:25.470> able

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
spectacles hung on a nail and I was able

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.290 
spectacles hung on a nail and I was able
to<00:04:25.830> write<00:04:26.160> what<00:04:26.490> would<00:04:26.640> probably<00:04:27.000> have<00:04:27.090> been<00:04:27.270> a

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
to write what would probably have been a

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.720 
to write what would probably have been a
whole<00:04:27.540> page<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:28.140> analysis<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.980> that's<00:04:29.490> this

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
whole page of analysis and that's this

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.820 
whole page of analysis and that's this
idea<00:04:30.090> of<00:04:30.210> writing<00:04:30.360> a<00:04:30.600> lot<00:04:30.900> about<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.440> little

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
idea of writing a lot about a little

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.040 
idea of writing a lot about a little
it's<00:04:32.520> where<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:32.940> take<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.240> short<00:04:33.630> quotations

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
it's where you take a short quotations

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.520 
it's where you take a short quotations
and<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:35.340> analyze<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:36.210> you<00:04:36.660> perhaps<00:04:36.870> look<00:04:37.230> for

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
and you analyze it you perhaps look for

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.980 
and you analyze it you perhaps look for
more<00:04:37.770> than<00:04:37.950> one<00:04:38.130> interpretation<00:04:38.730> of<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.330> you

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
more than one interpretation of it you

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.900 
more than one interpretation of it you
link<00:04:40.260> it<00:04:40.440> to<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.680> writers<00:04:41.010> ideas<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.640> themes

link it to the writers ideas and themes

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.570 
link it to the writers ideas and themes
what<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.420> the<00:04:42.600> writer<00:04:42.930> saying<00:04:43.920> what's<00:04:44.490> the

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
the headline in question two I think

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.530 
the headline in question two I think
it's<00:06:17.010> better<00:06:17.160> to<00:06:17.370> come<00:06:17.520> up<00:06:17.610> with<00:06:17.790> one<00:06:18.030> really

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
it's better to come up with one really

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.480 
it's better to come up with one really
clever<00:06:18.780> point<00:06:19.110> than<00:06:19.590> three<00:06:19.920> or<00:06:20.010> four<00:06:20.190> brief

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
clever point than three or four brief

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.550 
clever point than three or four brief
points<00:06:20.940> about<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.270> headline<00:06:21.630> and<00:06:21.930> perhaps

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
points about the headline and perhaps

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.930 
points about the headline and perhaps
the<00:06:22.890> same<00:06:23.040> about<00:06:23.250> the<00:06:23.400> picture

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
the same about the picture

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.820 
the same about the picture
so<00:06:24.510> I<00:06:24.540> hope<00:06:24.690> this<00:06:24.840> video<00:06:25.110> has<00:06:25.170> been<00:06:25.290> useful<00:06:25.350> to
