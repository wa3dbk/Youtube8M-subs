something really off-the-wall never ever
baby<00:04:48.120> Richard<00:04:49.080> Blackmar<00:04:49.380> in<00:04:49.470> particular<00:04:49.680> I

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
baby Richard Blackmar in particular I

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.200 
baby Richard Blackmar in particular I
think<00:04:49.890> Mizzou<00:04:50.220> was<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.490> leading<00:04:50.670> improviser

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
think Mizzou was the leading improviser

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.830 
think Mizzou was the leading improviser
with<00:04:51.660> in<00:04:51.810> purple<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:53.300> quite<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.330> volatile

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
with in purple and quite a volatile

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.050 
with in purple and quite a volatile
character<00:04:55.500> and<00:04:55.620> I<00:04:55.650> think<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:56.010> pleased<00:04:56.370> him<00:04:56.820> to

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
character and I think it pleased him to

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.530 
character and I think it pleased him to
go<00:04:57.450> off<00:04:57.480> you<00:04:58.440> know<00:04:58.590> somewhere<00:04:59.190> else<00:04:59.370> and<00:05:00.210> hope

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
go off you know somewhere else and hope

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.030 
go off you know somewhere else and hope
that<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.900> other<00:05:01.050> guys<00:05:01.260> would<00:05:01.470> follow<00:05:01.740> you

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
that the other guys would follow you

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.560 
that the other guys would follow you
know<00:05:02.130> he<00:05:02.220> was<00:05:02.340> kind<00:05:02.490> of<00:05:02.550> teasing<00:05:03.030> them<00:05:03.180> really

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
know he was kind of teasing them really

mistakes

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.550 

I'm<00:05:17.120> sure<00:05:17.539> there<00:05:17.810> was<00:05:17.930> some<00:05:17.990> sort<00:05:18.379> of

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
I'm sure there was some sort of

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.219 
I'm sure there was some sort of
initially<00:05:19.550> friendly<00:05:20.180> competition<00:05:20.900> which

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
initially friendly competition which

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.129 
initially friendly competition which
later<00:05:21.610> developed<00:05:22.610> into<00:05:22.729> animosity<00:05:23.449> in<00:05:23.599> some

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
later developed into animosity in some

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.860 
later developed into animosity in some
areas<00:05:24.500> in<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:24.680> camp<00:05:25.150> but<00:05:26.150> I'm<00:05:26.270> sure<00:05:26.479> there<00:05:26.719> was

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
areas in the camp but I'm sure there was

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.629 
areas in the camp but I'm sure there was
and<00:05:27.050> I'm<00:05:27.110> sure<00:05:27.289> they<00:05:27.439> spurred<00:05:27.770> one<00:05:28.099> another<00:05:28.370> on

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
and I'm sure they spurred one another on

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:38.580 
and I'm sure they spurred one another on
to<00:05:28.939> even<00:05:29.060> greater<00:05:29.509> heights

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
musical motifs so a phrase would be

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.749
