00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
certainly makes sense here we have the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.100 
certainly makes sense here we have the
hotshot<00:02:33.130> who<00:02:34.130> thinks<00:02:34.370> he's<00:02:34.520> hot<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.690> we

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
hotshot who thinks he's hot and we

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.130 
hotshot who thinks he's hot and we
have<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.560> rigger<00:02:37.069> more<00:02:37.730> designed<00:02:38.150> with<00:02:38.420> or

have the rigger more designed with or
with<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.739> idea<00:02:40.100> in<00:02:40.220> mind<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.580> sort<00:02:40.760> of

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
with the idea in mind of sort of

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.809 
with the idea in mind of sort of
crafting<00:02:41.830> vehicles<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:42.980> specializing<00:02:43.700> them

crafting vehicles and specializing them

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.460 
crafting vehicles and specializing them
got<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.120> wonder<00:02:44.360> if<00:02:44.450> when<00:02:44.600> these<00:02:44.690> guys<00:02:44.930> all<00:02:45.140> get

got to wonder if when these guys all get

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.410 
got to wonder if when these guys all get
together<00:02:45.650> if<00:02:46.070> any<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:46.910> them<00:02:47.030> walk<00:02:47.150> in<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.330> room

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
together if any of them walk in the room

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.020 
together if any of them walk in the room
and<00:02:47.540> say<00:02:47.630> hey<00:02:47.870> what's<00:02:48.320> up<00:02:48.530> my<00:02:48.769> rigger<00:02:49.030> no

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
and say hey what's up my rigger no

we've got stuff like armor astromech

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.610 
we've got stuff like armor astromech
droids<00:03:12.790> vehicles<00:03:13.790> lots<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:14.900> ships<00:03:15.260> and

you would expect from this type of
chapter<00:03:20.840> then<00:03:21.410> we<00:03:21.470> get<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.709> dangerous<00:03:22.310> sorties

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
chapter then we get to dangerous sorties

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.860 
chapter then we get to dangerous sorties
not<00:03:23.900> stories<00:03:24.320> sorties<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.579> this<00:03:26.360> actually<00:03:26.840> I

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
not stories sorties and this actually I

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.180 
not stories sorties and this actually I
think<00:03:27.110> is<00:03:27.410> what<00:03:27.560> makes<00:03:27.769> this<00:03:27.980> book

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
think is what makes this book

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.729 
think is what makes this book
indispensable<00:03:28.840> lots<00:03:29.840> of<00:03:29.989> information<00:03:30.230> about

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
indispensable lots of information about

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
adding aces into your campaigns adding

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.740 
adding aces into your campaigns adding
astromechs<00:03:34.070> type<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.850> encounters<00:03:35.360> to<00:03:35.510> use

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
astromechs type of encounters to use

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.509 
astromechs type of encounters to use
suggestions<00:03:36.590> for<00:03:36.709> ways<00:03:36.829> to<00:03:36.860> handle<00:03:37.220> things

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
suggestions for ways to handle things

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.300
