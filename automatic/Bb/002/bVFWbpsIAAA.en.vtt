 jose calderon settled in all cars 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.010
 since 2005 I had been for several years 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.809
 target of handover rumors 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.669
 lakers new york and even memphis it 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.370
 they pointed as possible destinations in the 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.959
 finally the Spanish base finished 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.599
 forming part of a transfer to three 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.330
 bands between the raptors the grizzlies and 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:24.859
 the pistons tayshaun prince a memphis 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.880
 rudy gay to toronto and calderón to detroit 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.589
 Calderón debuted with his new team 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.929
 being the top scorer of the match 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.210
 with 15 points against the new york knicks 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.520
 and before the game these were his 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.840
 feelings I'm quiet good 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.820
 quiet quiet I'm not at all 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.070
 because the first match came but not 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.360
 well it's a new start it 's clear that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.040
 had never been in this situation are 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.140
 many the years that I've been with 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.280
 with Toronto but good has arrived 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.620
 we knew we could pass in any 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.410
 moment with this that ends contract and 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.180
 nothing here I'm ready to debut and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.950
 and see how the thing people call me 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.960
 when I was in Atlanta in the locker room 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.280
 and it confirms to me how good it is made 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.920
 what we are going to return to the hotel of 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.530
 team would call because we were a little 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.210
 we knew it could happen and it happened 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.320
 just before starting the game to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.300
 I'm happy 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.150
 what they have talked to me take me 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.950
 trying to have for a couple of years 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.170
 they thought he was the important player 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.880
 for them and it's different to be in a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.260
 transferred because yes because I had to 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.030
 be because my contract is just going to 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.830
 go to a place where they really love you 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.200
 and that's why that's why they got 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.030
 at the last minute in the transfer a little 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.140
 nervous because the truth is that I was 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.300
 time I was not in this situation 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.860
 of having to debut to have everything 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.810
 new and more without knowing my colleagues 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.190
 let's say training and well it will be a 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.720
 little more complicated if it fits but good 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.979
 we will go there I will try to do the best 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.530
 that I can hopefully help the team 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.910
 from the beginning and there is no other 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.500
 nothing of all the open doors of 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.700
 all of course or you never know what 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.410
 that will happen not yet played with 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.630
 everything and I do not know what will happen but but 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.880
 of course everyone 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.470
 will see and wait to see what happens to see 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.690
 what teams are really interested 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.670
 and from there to study everything that 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.210
 be the best possible for so much for me 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.210
 as for my family
