how<00:00:06.180> do<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.480> get<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:06.779> home<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.890> safe<00:00:08.099> way<00:00:08.309> oh<00:00:08.610> you

how do I get it home the safe way oh you

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.940 
how do I get it home the safe way oh you
got<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.450> couple<00:00:09.690> options<00:00:09.929> but<00:00:10.380> probably<00:00:10.769> the

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
got a couple options but probably the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.039 
got a couple options but probably the
best<00:00:11.130> way<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.460> do<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> wire<00:00:11.969> transfer<00:00:12.049> and

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
best way is to do a wire transfer and

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.369 
best way is to do a wire transfer and
that's<00:00:13.799> probably<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.280> foreign<00:00:14.610> idea<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:15.379> many

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
that's probably a foreign idea to many

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.109 
that's probably a foreign idea to many
people<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.980> know<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.130> didn't<00:00:17.760> even<00:00:17.880> really

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
people you know I didn't even really

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.359 
people you know I didn't even really
understand<00:00:18.660> how<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.810> do<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> whole<00:00:19.320> thing<00:00:19.369> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
understand how to do the whole thing the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.730 
understand how to do the whole thing the
first<00:00:20.550> time<00:00:20.850> but<00:00:21.689> it's<00:00:22.020> pretty<00:00:22.170> easy<00:00:22.289> once<00:00:22.619> you

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
first time but it's pretty easy once you

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.779 
first time but it's pretty easy once you
get<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.949> holding<00:00:23.310> all<00:00:23.400> your<00:00:23.460> information

together<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.449> that's<00:00:24.600> really<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.320> hardest

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
together and that's really the hardest

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.800 
together and that's really the hardest
part<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:25.980> all<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.720> contacting<00:00:27.720> your

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
split it up into smaller amounts split

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.450

that big chunk up into smaller amounts
and<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.630> put<00:02:42.780> on<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.930> schedule<00:02:43.470> maybe<00:02:43.770> a

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
and have it put on a schedule maybe a

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.250 
and have it put on a schedule maybe a
monthly<00:02:44.340> or<00:02:44.880> every<00:02:45.270> couple<00:02:45.720> weeks<00:02:46.080> or

something like that to be sent home

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.120 
something like that to be sent home
automatically<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.900> what<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.200> does<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.710> much

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
automatically and what that does is much

back<00:03:30.000> home<00:03:30.330> because<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.380> exchange<00:03:31.740> rate<00:03:31.950> will

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
back home because the exchange rate will

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.460 
back home because the exchange rate will
be<00:03:32.250> negatively<00:03:32.760> affected<00:03:33.330> by<00:03:33.360> that<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:33.959> that's

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
be negatively affected by that so that's

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.500 
be negatively affected by that so that's
one<00:03:34.650> thing<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:34.920> keep<00:03:35.040> in<00:03:35.190> mind<00:03:35.250> most<00:03:35.940> banks<00:03:36.360> my

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
one thing to keep in mind most banks my

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.540 
one thing to keep in mind most banks my
bank<00:03:36.780> I'm<00:03:36.930> here<00:03:37.080> with<00:03:37.230> your<00:03:37.380> son<00:03:37.530> bank<00:03:37.860> they

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
bank I'm here with your son bank they

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.160 
bank I'm here with your son bank they
have<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.820> system<00:03:39.239> set<00:03:39.270> up<00:03:39.480> for<00:03:39.600> that<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.020> can

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
have a system set up for that you can

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.550 
have a system set up for that you can
put<00:03:40.320> it<00:03:40.410> on<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.530> schedule<00:03:41.270> and<00:03:42.270> I<00:03:42.870> would<00:03:43.410> just

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
put it on a schedule and I would just

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.680 
put it on a schedule and I would just
recommend<00:03:44.010> looking<00:03:44.459> into<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:44.970> if<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.450> don't

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
recommend looking into that if you don't

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.490 
recommend looking into that if you don't
do<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:45.989> on<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.230> on<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.739> schedule<00:03:47.220> already<00:03:48.380> so<00:03:49.380> the

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
do it on a on a schedule already so the

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.550 
do it on a on a schedule already so the
wire<00:03:49.650> transfer<00:03:50.190> fees<00:03:51.150> they<00:03:51.930> weren't<00:03:52.200> quite<00:03:52.530> as

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
wire transfer fees they weren't quite as

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.410 
wire transfer fees they weren't quite as
bad<00:03:52.830> as<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.070> thought<00:03:53.220> they<00:03:53.430> would<00:03:53.459> be<00:03:53.730> I'm<00:03:54.209> not

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
bad as I thought they would be I'm not

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.840 
bad as I thought they would be I'm not
sure<00:03:54.480> what<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:55.110> but<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.920> just<00:03:56.040> expected<00:03:56.700> to

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
sure what that is but I just expected to

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.640 
sure what that is but I just expected to
be<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.000> little<00:03:57.239> bit<00:03:57.330> more<00:03:57.540> but<00:03:57.989> I'm<00:03:58.110> doing<00:03:58.350> five

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
be a little bit more but I'm doing five

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.350 
be a little bit more but I'm doing five
monthly<00:03:59.250> wire<00:03:59.430> transfers<00:04:00.000> said<00:04:00.239> on<00:04:00.330> a

monthly wire transfers said on a

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
schedule with the with the automated

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.820 
schedule with the with the automated
system<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.580> was<00:04:03.000> just<00:04:03.030> talking<00:04:03.780> about<00:04:03.870> and

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
system that was just talking about and

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.130 
system that was just talking about and
that<00:04:05.010> comes<00:04:05.220> out<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.430> about<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.330> hundred

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
that comes out to about a hundred

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.780 
that comes out to about a hundred
dollars<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.709> change<00:04:07.950> now<00:04:08.250> if<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.520> were<00:04:08.640> to<00:04:08.730> have

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
dollars and change now if I were to have

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.699 
dollars and change now if I were to have
done<00:04:08.850> everything<00:04:09.300> in<00:04:09.420> one<00:04:09.540> lump<00:04:09.720> sum<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:10.230> think

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
done everything in one lump sum I think

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.260 
done everything in one lump sum I think
it<00:04:10.770> was<00:04:10.890> somewhere<00:04:11.190> around<00:04:11.250> thirty<00:04:11.790> or<00:04:11.940> forty

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
it was somewhere around thirty or forty

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.030 
it was somewhere around thirty or forty
dollars<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:12.570> it's

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
dollars so it's

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.610 
dollars so it's
not<00:04:13.280> astronomical<00:04:14.319> depending<00:04:15.319> on<00:04:15.409> how<00:04:15.500> much

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
not astronomical depending on how much

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.039 
not astronomical depending on how much
you're<00:04:15.799> sending<00:04:16.070> home<00:04:16.509> but<00:04:17.509> like<00:04:17.630> I<00:04:17.750> said<00:04:17.810> it

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
you're sending home but like I said it

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.150 
you're sending home but like I said it
goes<00:04:18.199> up<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:18.500> down<00:04:18.560> with<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.889> amount<00:04:19.130> that

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
goes up and down with the amount that

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.189 
goes up and down with the amount that
you're<00:04:19.370> sending<00:04:19.669> in<00:04:19.759> each<00:04:19.880> transfer<00:04:20.449> so

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
you're sending in each transfer so

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.969 
you're sending in each transfer so
that's<00:04:21.650> it

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
that's it

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.909 
that's it
that's<00:04:22.370> wire<00:04:22.610> transfers<00:04:23.210> exchange<00:04:23.960> rates<00:04:24.770> and

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
that's wire transfers exchange rates and

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.800 
that's wire transfers exchange rates and
all<00:04:25.070> that<00:04:25.190> kind<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.400> stuff<00:04:25.699> in<00:04:26.449> a<00:04:26.509> nutshell

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
all that kind of stuff in a nutshell

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.510 
all that kind of stuff in a nutshell
there's<00:04:27.259> a<00:04:27.320> lot<00:04:27.440> of<00:04:27.560> information<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:28.280> I

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
there's a lot of information that I

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.120 
there's a lot of information that I
could<00:04:28.880> probably<00:04:29.030> go<00:04:29.210> over<00:04:29.240> but<00:04:29.750> all<00:04:30.130> those

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
could probably go over but all those

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.409 
could probably go over but all those
codes<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:31.699> everything<00:04:31.940> like<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.090> you<00:04:32.210> can

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
codes and everything like that you can

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.060 
codes and everything like that you can
just<00:04:32.449> google<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:32.930> and<00:04:33.620> figure<00:04:33.889> it<00:04:33.949> out

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
just google it and figure it out

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.350 
just google it and figure it out
yourself<00:04:34.430> you're<00:04:34.610> smart<00:04:34.850> people<00:04:35.150> so
