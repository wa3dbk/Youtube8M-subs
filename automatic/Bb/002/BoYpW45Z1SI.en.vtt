00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.570
 So let's start with one first 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.500
 portrait 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.910
 always important depending on 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.600
 light situations we have a lot now 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.670
 a lot of sun 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.070
 the photographer has to have it back 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.330
 because we do not want that and 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.920
 time somehow not in the lens 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.220
 want to photograph the field and back light 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.630
 We also do not have sun in the back 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.449
 Now we are looking for a nice place 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.189
 we have a love here with one 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.380
 light slope situation and we like 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.660
 keep it up and that we happen to be there 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.900
 header nice background have the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.010
 is how she has to go to heaven in one 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.110
 standing in perfect relationship 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.730
 that is, the horizon should therefore be at 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.710
 Portrait of the dog does not cross the 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.030
 but he should go where he is 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.030
 belongs in the lower picture area 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.210
 OK
