LinkedIn<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:40.980> out<00:03:41.130> but<00:03:41.400> let's<00:03:41.430> see<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.820> PhD

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
LinkedIn it out but let's see the PhD

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.300 
LinkedIn it out but let's see the PhD
they<00:03:42.510> like<00:03:42.690> they're<00:03:42.900> in<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.290> I've<00:03:43.860> been<00:03:44.190> out<00:03:44.280> I

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
they like they're in and I've been out I

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.920 
they like they're in and I've been out I
did<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.730> same<00:03:44.910> thing<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.239> converted<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.780> this

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
did the same thing I converted to this

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.330 
did the same thing I converted to this
and<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.769> had<00:03:47.310> much<00:03:47.670> less<00:03:47.940> difficulties<00:03:48.660> with

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
and I I had much less difficulties with

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.500 
and I I had much less difficulties with
any<00:03:50.340> injuries<00:03:50.670> going<00:03:50.940> all<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.180> way<00:03:51.209> from<00:03:51.420> the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
any injuries going all the way from the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.930 
any injuries going all the way from the
football<00:03:51.959> left<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:52.950> act<00:03:53.190> I<00:03:53.400> mean<00:03:53.519> it<00:03:53.730> just

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
football left that I act I mean it just

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.110 
football left that I act I mean it just
it<00:03:54.510> decreases<00:03:55.440> your<00:03:55.560> stress<00:03:55.860> levels<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.519> I

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
it decreases your stress levels and I I

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.970 
it decreases your stress levels and I I
the<00:03:57.720> other<00:03:58.049> thing<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.350> can<00:03:58.500> do<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.620> can<00:03:58.769> assure

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
the other thing I can do I can assure

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.510 
the other thing I can do I can assure
you

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
you

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.970 
you
longer<00:04:00.210> believe<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.540> or<00:04:00.600> not<00:04:00.750> oh<00:04:01.050> sure<00:04:01.650> they

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
longer believe it or not oh sure they

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.340 
longer believe it or not oh sure they
just<00:04:02.190> they<00:04:02.490> see<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.120> last<00:04:03.390> longer<00:04:03.690> right

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
just they see the last longer right

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.770 
just they see the last longer right
I<00:04:04.380> said<00:04:05.130> one<00:04:05.310> warning<00:04:05.670> Brad<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:06.330> we<00:04:06.390> decided

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
I said one warning Brad and we decided

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.710 
I said one warning Brad and we decided
by<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.130> this<00:04:08.130> pose<00:04:08.520> method<00:04:08.880> does<00:04:09.270> increased

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
by this this pose method does increased

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.530 
by this this pose method does increased
amount<00:04:10.080> of<00:04:10.170> stress<00:04:10.410> on<00:04:10.590> your<00:04:10.770> calves<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.540> your

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
amount of stress on your calves and your

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.860 
amount of stress on your calves and your
tendons<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:14.430> I<00:04:14.460> mean<00:04:14.880> you<00:04:15.000> got<00:04:15.180> you're<00:04:15.750> going

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
tendons so I mean you got you're going

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.510 
tendons so I mean you got you're going
to<00:04:15.930> buy<00:04:16.049> on<00:04:16.230> your<00:04:16.260> calves<00:04:16.590> make<00:04:16.890> it<00:04:17.070> or<00:04:17.310> where

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
to buy on your calves make it or where

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.820 
to buy on your calves make it or where
you<00:04:17.610> start<00:04:18.239> using<00:04:18.420> this<00:04:18.630> method<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.500> that's

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
you start using this method and that's

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.740 
you start using this method and that's
fine<00:04:20.130> because<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:21.000> taking<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.540> stress

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
fine because that taking the stress

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.600 
fine because that taking the stress
instead<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.260> all<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.500> other<00:04:22.650> variety<00:04:23.160> joints

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
instead of all the other variety joints

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.980 
instead of all the other variety joints
and<00:04:23.850> if<00:04:24.390> you<00:04:24.600> go<00:04:24.750> progressively<00:04:25.560> right<00:04:26.490> you'll

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
and if you go progressively right you'll

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.860 
and if you go progressively right you'll
avoid<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.260> right<00:04:28.680> so<00:04:29.330> good<00:04:30.330> good<00:04:30.570> block<00:04:30.840> good

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
avoid that right so good good block good

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.830 
avoid that right so good good block good
method<00:04:31.530> um<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:32.130> would<00:04:33.090> highly<00:04:33.360> recommend<00:04:33.390> if

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
method um I would highly recommend if

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.570 
method um I would highly recommend if
you're<00:04:33.990> a<00:04:34.020> runner<00:04:34.200> Alta<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.950> use<00:04:35.100> that<00:04:35.340> in

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
you're a runner Alta to use that in

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.040 
you're a runner Alta to use that in
these<00:04:35.850> are<00:04:36.000> good<00:04:36.120> three<00:04:36.300> secrets<00:04:36.660> with<00:04:36.810> that

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
these are good three secrets with that

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.230 
these are good three secrets with that
and<00:04:37.350> their<00:04:37.710> field<00:04:38.130> tested<00:04:38.640> by<00:04:38.850> yours<00:04:39.120> truly

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
and their field tested by yours truly

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.400 
and their field tested by yours truly
and<00:04:39.750> what<00:04:40.440> I'm<00:04:40.680> sold<00:04:41.310> on<00:04:41.490> it<00:04:41.700> so<00:04:41.960> you<00:04:42.960> can<00:04:43.230> have

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
and what I'm sold on it so you can have

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.050 
and what I'm sold on it so you can have
it<00:04:43.470> this<00:04:43.980> is<00:04:44.190> going<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.370> take<00:04:44.580> probably<00:04:44.820> about

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
it this is going to take probably about

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.030 
it this is going to take probably about
four<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.660> six<00:04:45.900> months<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.410> get<00:04:46.560> through<00:04:46.860> all

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
four to six months to get through all

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.770 
four to six months to get through all
this<00:04:47.280> you<00:04:47.490> need<00:04:47.700> a<00:04:47.730> core<00:04:48.000> strength<00:04:48.390> and<00:04:48.510> I<00:04:48.600> hit

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
this you need a core strength and I hit

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.420 
this you need a core strength and I hit
over<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.110> winter<00:04:49.410> times<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.830> three<00:04:50.070> months

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
over the winter times the three months

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.240 
over the winter times the three months
they<00:04:50.940> still<00:04:51.270> do<00:04:51.480> but<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:52.320> got<00:04:52.500> a<00:04:52.530> detail<00:04:52.980> of

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
they still do but you got a detail of

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.490 
they still do but you got a detail of
them<00:04:53.430> yeah<00:04:53.820> I'm<00:04:54.120> in<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.420> horror<00:04:54.690> all<00:04:55.170> right<00:04:55.320> you

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
them yeah I'm in a horror all right you

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:05.650 
them yeah I'm in a horror all right you
know<00:04:55.590> they're<00:04:55.830> done<00:04:56.100> be<00:04:56.550> careful
