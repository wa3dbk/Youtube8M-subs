00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.029
 despite the size of the representativeness 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:06.580
 it is of course a car for the driver 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.740
 it is around him that the salon is cut out and 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.400
 it is about him the car most 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.829
 care 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.749
 care is felt as soon as 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:17.260
 buckle and snap buckle belt 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:19.029
 safety belt itself is trying slightly 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.800
 strangle the driver so the system with safe 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.300
 recalls its existence under 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.259
 ability demonstration attack 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.070
 driving enthusiasm 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.750
 little bit besides two driving 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.609
 two eyes are still looking at the road 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.169
 stereoscopic camera she 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.910
 peers at everything that happens before 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.730
 machine from under the top edge of the wind 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.289
 glass and helps the electronic brain 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.449
 assess the situation even at a distance 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.760
 500 meters in front of the car 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.739
 the camera sees both the road signs and 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.930
 marking lines and help recognize 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.210
 danger of collision at the crossroads and 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.399
 even see a pedestrian about what will not slow down 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.440
 inform the driver moreover any 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.359
 excessive approach to riding ahead 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.910
 car or trying to cross the line 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:00.579
 markings are stopped at the root and 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.320
 even without the participation of the driver about the possibility 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.540
 hitting a pedestrian and saying no 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.610
 have the very thought of like 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.290
 causes a storm of magnetic disturbance in 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.780
 automotive electronic brain 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.670
 in general we set the e-class behaves 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.920
 as a very strict governess when 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.509
 overly restless child want 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.640
 buttoned up and looking 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.290
 strictly forward however and it is not 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.450
 necessarily because forward 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.790
 already watching the distronic radar system 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.740
 plus world kindergarten cruise control and so 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.320
 was one of the best 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.090
 And now he has become a purebred like 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.189
 it can work with brakes before 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.320
 full stop crawling in traffic not 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.970
 hurrying and now also recognizes 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.530
 possibility of collision with the oncoming 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.930
 transport and in case of inaction 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.270
 the driver himself will return the car to his lane 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.189
 with power steering in 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.179
 this is not involved everything is done when 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.710
 brake assistance is easier and safer 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.020
 Of course excessive care can be tiring. 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.390
 having rummaged in the menu and having studied the instruction 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.399
 open all these collars of all helpers 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.479
 but the feast of disobedience can be arranged 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.740
 and in a simpler way you can just 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.590
 a few clicks to translate 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.840
 car in sport mode getting rid of 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.729
 annoying freken side you can finally 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840
 call your inner carlson and 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.299
 fool around 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.519
 and at the same time remember that mercedes e-class 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.739
 it 's still a car and that is created 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.980
 first of all to go and what 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.910
 with the wheel can be controlled independently 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.280
 steering updated 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.459
 e-class is called a proprietary term 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.750
 derek steering principle is onion 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.220
 name because no 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.290
 direct contact with 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.820
 driven wheels in general then no this 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.370
 It is not up to good old-fashioned steam 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.440
 gear-rake which is so loved and appreciated 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.709
 all fans of active driving 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.359
 it is a cunning electromechanical organism 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.100
 which ensures the operation of systems 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.540
 auto parking constantly changes 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.549
 force ratio on the steering wheel 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.890
 it all happens constantly in every 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.720
 turn on every meter well 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.430
 the advantage of this whole process 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.780
 only one thing he does not feel 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.019
 problems start when you try 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.930
 go quickly everything seems to be a place and 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.620
 effort and information content on the steering 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.390
 the wheel 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.459
 but at some point you start anyway 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.700
 getting past corners is unclear 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.109
 inexplicable and tasteless if 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.549
 can not feel the presence 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.859
 This does not mean that it is impossible 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.930
 feel the absence is worth it all the same 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.639
 delve into the onboard menu and quite 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.159
 disable all additional systems 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.500
 to stay with the car alone and 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:26.139
 finally evaluate the work of mercedes vskih 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.970
 motorists after restyling audi class 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.370
 Only one new engine appeared on 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.540
 but what are you shaped six volume 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.599
 3 liters and 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.450
 equipped with two turbines they blow out 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.060
 from the engine 330 horsepower and 500 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.010
 newton meters main feature two 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.019
 motor is what gave it and make it very 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.859
 cost effective due to new system 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.659
 fuel injection 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.639
 compressed air piston injected 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.379
 tiny clouds binder she 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.959
 concentrates around the spark plug 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:56.260
 and one millisecond candle produces 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.010
 4 pussy to benzyl absolutely burning 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.040
 completely 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.650
 it's impossible to understand but you can hear 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.299
 And in Stuttgart came up with a new 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.430
 algorithm control pump system 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.500
 cooling until the engine is warm 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.109
 the pump is completely inactive so as not to 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.060
 reduce the efficiency of the power unit such 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.069
 little things could fit all the motors and 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.220
 Classes Toughest Environmental Standards 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.320
 euro 6 and also mercedes c are very proud 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.180
 so that the updated declasse reached 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.970
 energy efficiency class a 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.800
 just like a good washing machine and 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.840
 all in order to owners of large 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.430
 sedans stopped looking like 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.580
 walk 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.410
 and nature for many years level 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.420
 wealth e-class owners and for any 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.830
 another mercedes was determined by this 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.930
 numbers on the trunk lid 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.940
 the more the better from this point of view 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.410
 new motor v6 biturbo real gift 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.780
 on the facts 3-liter so you 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.370
 you can get a liter as a gift 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.020
 but in fact lately all 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.440
 more often these numbers symbolize not 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.270
 so many 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.250
 wealth how much extravagance 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.020
 mercedes owners because if 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.000
 want to go really fast need 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.390
 buy a car not with three figures but with 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.390
 three letters 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.530
 This is a mercedes c63 amg and he also has 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.879
 back seat on them better not 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.800
 enjoy because after riding on 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.750
 rear seats of this car looks like you 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.940
 you will be about like this all mercedes s 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.610
 monogram and m g builds exclusively for 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.530
 driver for engineers from of alter bach 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.870
 wheelbase simply means 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.970
 highway characteristic and unrelated 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.490
 with open spaces in the back of the couch and the volume 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.409
 trunk is not a measure of the cargo hold 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.720
 just one of the figure affecting 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.520
 aerodynamic portrait of the body is for 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.440
 the driver wizard manually build 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.479
 V-shaped 8-cylinder eights 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.039
 It was for him that another masterpiece was created. 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.000
 with two turbines and 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.690
 index m 157 for him 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.610
 torque converter in automatic 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.340
 the box was replaced with an ultra-fast package 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.110
 friction and of course it is for him 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.969
 elegant body hoisted on 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.409
 low profile tires with landing 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:04.740
 19 inch diameter 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:05.819
 one such tire costs from 13 to 20 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.680
 thousand rubles and 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:09.270
 800 newton meters will easily turn these 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.090
 money in smoke in the truest sense of the word 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.219
 words so that costs do not grow so fast 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.479
 mercedes came up with a distribute torque 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:19.740
 point between all four wheels in 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.330
 why would such a thoroughbred 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.460
 almost a race car like a mercedes 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.919
 ng four-wheel drive will now explain 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.300
 Now this rear-wheel drive car will be fulfilled 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:31.289
 sprint from zero to one hundred kilometers per hour 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.719
 in 4.2 seconds and it's fast but this 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.789
 all-wheel drive versions will still 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:38.580
 do the same exercise for 3.6 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:41.250
 seconds how it looks real life 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.840
 now try to check to your left 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.850
 white all-wheel drive mercedes e63 mgs 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.250
 right painted banal silver 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.139
 rear wheel drive version find take for 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.590
 drag racing around barcelona not 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:53.570
 succeeded 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.210
 so I had to start right on 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.080
 second gear due to speed of about 70 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.169
 kilometers per hour 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.150
 the result as they say on the scoreboard even in 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.919
 such simplified conditions for rivals 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.290
 all-wheel drive version turns 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:08.540
 much faster but that doesn't mean that 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:11.270
 now this particular car will become 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.250
 darling of suicide clubs is although mg but 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.949
 Still, the e-class in this here is all 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.870
 systems that pulls down 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.130
 vibrate in general do not give the driver 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.050
 normally enjoy the process 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.760
 driving a car more here 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.370
 there is even an expensive speaker system 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:30.910
 which is special for this car 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:30.910
 developed why are you such a motor
