00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
district 12 was kind of American so it

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.880 
district 12 was kind of American so it
was<00:01:00.809> kind<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.170> these<00:01:01.350> people<00:01:01.530> were<00:01:01.829> just

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
was kind of like these people were just

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.219 
was kind of like these people were just
using<00:01:02.340> things<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.030> were<00:01:03.329> left<00:01:03.600> over<00:01:04.019> from

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
using things that were left over from

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.200 
using things that were left over from
the<00:01:04.409> old<00:01:04.799> America<00:01:05.309> which<00:01:05.489> would<00:01:05.790> make<00:01:05.970> sense

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the old America which would make sense

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.789 
the old America which would make sense
it<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.510> looked<00:01:06.780> very<00:01:06.840> different<00:01:07.140> from<00:01:07.500> what

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it just looked very different from what

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.560 
it just looked very different from what
I<00:01:07.830> imagined<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.670> example<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.150> felt<00:01:09.420> like

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
I imagined for example I felt like

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.390 
I imagined for example I felt like
Katniss's<00:01:10.110> leather<00:01:10.380> jacket<00:01:10.950> was<00:01:11.159> way<00:01:11.340> too

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
Katniss's leather jacket was way too

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.969 
Katniss's leather jacket was way too
modern<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> Capitol<00:01:12.900> everything<00:01:13.470> seemed

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
modern in the Capitol everything seemed

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.039 
modern in the Capitol everything seemed
very<00:01:14.220> retro<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.360> furniture<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
very retro the furniture and the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.929 
very retro the furniture and the
decorations<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> color<00:01:17.220> scheme<00:01:17.640> I

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
decorations and the color scheme I

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.580 
decorations and the color scheme I
thought<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.479> was<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> very<00:01:18.960> interesting

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
thought that that was a very interesting

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.490 
thought that that was a very interesting
choice<00:01:20.070> one<00:01:20.670> set<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.299> kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.020> bothered<00:01:22.470> me

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
choice one set that kind of bothered me

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.620 
choice one set that kind of bothered me
which<00:01:22.920> might<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> weird<00:01:23.580> thing<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
which might be a weird thing was the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.310 
which might be a weird thing was the
forest

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
forest

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.840 
forest
I<00:01:25.470> felt<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.830> there<00:01:25.979> weren't<00:01:26.159> enough<00:01:26.400> big

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
I felt like there weren't enough big

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.700 
I felt like there weren't enough big
trees<00:01:27.210> close<00:01:27.600> together<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.470> very

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
trees close together it's just a very

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.380 
trees close together it's just a very
different<00:01:29.310> forest<00:01:29.759> from<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.240> was

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
different forest from what I was

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.240 
different forest from what I was
imagining<00:01:30.630> now<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> costumes<00:01:31.979> which

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
imagining now on to the costumes which

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950 
imagining now on to the costumes which
is<00:01:32.400> kind<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> big<00:01:32.850> deal<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.360> loved<00:01:33.689> their

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
is kind of a big deal I loved their

perfect<00:02:28.310> for<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.550> scene<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:28.970> sometimes<00:02:29.480> it

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
perfect for the scene and sometimes it

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.210 
perfect for the scene and sometimes it
was<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.720> little<00:02:29.989> bit<00:02:30.110> annoying<00:02:30.290> there<00:02:30.890> are<00:02:31.010> lots

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
awesome it was but it wasn't a feeling

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.289 
awesome it was but it wasn't a feeling
of<00:03:00.890> disappointment<00:03:01.069> either<00:03:01.610> I<00:03:01.970> think<00:03:02.060> what

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
of disappointment either I think what

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.750

horrific The Hunger Games are but also

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.190 
horrific The Hunger Games are but also
kind<00:03:07.130> of<00:03:07.190> how<00:03:07.370> ridiculous<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.480> people

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
kind of how ridiculous is that people

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.130 
kind of how ridiculous is that people
enjoy<00:03:09.769> it<00:03:09.799> so<00:03:10.100> much<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.730> that<00:03:10.970> feeling<00:03:11.510> of<00:03:11.540> I

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
enjoy it so much and that feeling of I

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.080 
enjoy it so much and that feeling of I
wouldn't<00:03:12.380> say<00:03:12.500> shame<00:03:12.920> but<00:03:13.400> something<00:03:13.819> close

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
wouldn't say shame but something close

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.970 
wouldn't say shame but something close
to<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.359> was<00:03:14.600> very<00:03:14.870> strong<00:03:15.260> in<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.530> movie<00:03:15.859> and

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
to it was very strong in this movie and

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.559 
to it was very strong in this movie and
I<00:03:16.010> guess<00:03:16.250> that's<00:03:16.579> what<00:03:16.970> made<00:03:17.180> me<00:03:17.329> feel<00:03:17.510> a

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
I guess that's what made me feel a

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.900 
I guess that's what made me feel a
little<00:03:17.720> bit<00:03:17.930> weird<00:03:18.590> about<00:03:18.889> it<00:03:19.069> afterwards<00:03:19.639> and

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
little bit weird about it afterwards and

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.129 
little bit weird about it afterwards and
it's<00:03:20.060> one<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.299> most<00:03:20.450> important<00:03:20.870> parts<00:03:21.049> of

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
it's one of the most important parts of

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.020 
it's one of the most important parts of
the<00:03:21.290> book<00:03:21.500> so<00:03:21.769> it's<00:03:22.190> really<00:03:22.519> good<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:22.910> they

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
the book so it's really good that they

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.090 
the book so it's really good that they
knew<00:03:23.180> how<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.359> convey<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.470> there<00:03:24.829> were<00:03:24.889> some

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
knew how to convey that there were some

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.410 
knew how to convey that there were some
scenes<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.489> this<00:03:25.579> movie<00:03:25.639> that<00:03:26.090> they<00:03:26.209> just
