points for both figures follows the same
as<00:01:59.590> bouken<00:02:00.159> red<00:02:00.310> so<00:02:00.700> like<00:02:01.570> for<00:02:01.750> example<00:02:01.780> here

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
as bouken red so like for example here

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.499 
as bouken red so like for example here
we<00:02:02.770> have<00:02:02.799> a<00:02:02.979> head<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.579> neck<00:02:03.729> joint<00:02:04.000> but<00:02:04.360> the

we have a head and neck joint but the

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.840 
we have a head and neck joint but the
next<00:02:04.810> chunk<00:02:04.930> is<00:02:05.140> rendered<00:02:05.560> useless<00:02:05.850> because

next chunk is rendered useless because

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.169 
next chunk is rendered useless because
it's<00:02:07.180> stiff<00:02:08.220> although<00:02:09.220> you<00:02:09.280> can<00:02:09.549> move<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.970> from

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.490 
right here and on the next ranked which
is<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:59.430> downer<00:03:00.000> for<00:03:00.510> those<00:03:01.020> who<00:03:01.200> have<00:03:01.350> already

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
is a downer for those who have already

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.699 
is a downer for those who have already
had<00:03:01.770> their<00:03:02.220> book<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.580> read<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.720> there<00:03:04.410> are<00:03:04.500> no

improvements whatsoever from from that

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.220 
improvements whatsoever from from that
would<00:03:07.680> be<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:08.160> if<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:08.790> are<00:03:08.940> getting<00:03:09.390> book<00:03:10.080> and

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
would be so if you are getting book and

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.080 
would be so if you are getting book and
read<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.190> figure<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.970> will

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
read and you like the figure it will

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.059 
read and you like the figure it will
definitely<00:03:12.300> have<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.750> same<00:03:12.989> feeling<00:03:13.530> with

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
definitely have the same feeling with

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.400 
definitely have the same feeling with
the<00:03:14.250> book<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.670> blue<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:15.569> token<00:03:15.930> book<00:03:16.200> and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
the book and blue and token book and

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.940 
the book and blue and token book and
left<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:17.239> light<00:03:18.239> idea<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.380> thought<00:03:19.680> of

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
left a light idea that and I thought of

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.280 
left a light idea that and I thought of
going<00:03:20.190> for<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.549> two<00:03:20.730> pack<00:03:20.970> set<00:03:21.269> instead<00:03:22.049> of

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
going for a two pack set instead of

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.470 
going for a two pack set instead of
waiting<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.709> separate<00:03:23.100> release<00:03:23.430> though<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.120> am

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
waiting a separate release though I am

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.090 
waiting a separate release though I am
expecting<00:03:24.959> something<00:03:25.170> else<00:03:25.470> than<00:03:25.950> the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
expecting something else than the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.190 
expecting something else than the
obvious<00:03:26.310> weapons<00:03:26.940> but<00:03:27.450> what<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.870> already

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
obvious weapons but what is already

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.229 
obvious weapons but what is already
included<00:03:28.530> in<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.980> set<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.370> think<00:03:29.489> it's<00:03:29.910> enough

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
included in the set I think it's enough

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.479 
included in the set I think it's enough
if<00:03:30.630> both<00:03:30.959> figures<00:03:31.380> are<00:03:31.530> patent<00:03:31.920> with<00:03:32.130> bow<00:03:32.310> can

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
if both figures are patent with bow can

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.640 
if both figures are patent with bow can
read<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:33.090> means<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.750> these<00:03:33.959> also<00:03:34.260> shared

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
read this means that these also shared

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.770 
read this means that these also shared

the lacked midsection movement but as a
complete<00:03:37.290> package<00:03:37.470> they<00:03:38.100> have<00:03:38.130> enough<00:03:38.580> to

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
complete package they have enough to

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.759 
complete package they have enough to
