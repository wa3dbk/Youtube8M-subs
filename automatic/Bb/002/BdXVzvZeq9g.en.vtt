backlash actually I started engaged it

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.250

have<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.430> free<00:03:51.000> spool<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:53.450> like<00:03:54.450> I

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
have it on free spool and like I

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.370 
have it on free spool and like I
loosened<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:56.630> spool<00:03:57.630> tension<00:03:57.989> knob<00:03:58.170> a

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
loosened the the spool tension knob a

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.440 
loosened the the spool tension knob a
lot<00:03:58.860> so<00:03:59.730> it's<00:03:59.940> pretty<00:04:00.120> much<00:04:00.330> just<00:04:01.040> before<00:04:02.040> I

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
lot so it's pretty much just before I

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.759 
lot so it's pretty much just before I
loosened<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.690> until<00:04:04.200> where<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.500> spool

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
loosened it to until where the spool

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.890 
loosened it to until where the spool
became<00:04:05.070> loose<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.489> then<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.450> just<00:04:06.660> tightened

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
became loose and then I just tightened

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.500 
became loose and then I just tightened
it<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.260> where<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.560> stopped<00:04:07.830> becoming<00:04:08.160> loose

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
it to where it stopped becoming loose

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.759 
it to where it stopped becoming loose
we're<00:04:09.510> stopped<00:04:09.930> wiggling<00:04:10.320> back<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.470> forth

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
we're stopped wiggling back and forth

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.160 
we're stopped wiggling back and forth
which<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.580> pretty<00:04:11.790> pretty<00:04:12.660> free

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
which is pretty pretty free

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.279 
which is pretty pretty free
that's<00:04:14.160> um<00:04:14.460> and<00:04:14.790> I'm<00:04:14.970> casting<00:04:15.240> a<00:04:15.780> lot<00:04:16.020> farther

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
that's um and I'm casting a lot farther

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.810 
that's um and I'm casting a lot farther
now<00:04:16.530> because

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
now because

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.170 
now because
of<00:04:17.910> being<00:04:18.450> of<00:04:18.780> adjusting<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.560> like<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:19.860> and<00:04:20.180> I

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
of being of adjusting it like that and I

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.570 
of being of adjusting it like that and I
have<00:04:21.360> the<00:04:22.100> ABS<00:04:23.100> brakes<00:04:23.430> um<00:04:24.410> I<00:04:25.410> lost<00:04:26.250> one<00:04:26.490> of

grips

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
grips

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.020 
grips
they<00:05:36.000> just<00:05:36.180> feel<00:05:36.300> good<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:37.280> on<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.730> fact<00:05:38.940> that

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
they just feel good and on the fact that

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.240 
they just feel good and on the fact that
there's<00:05:39.210> actually<00:05:39.600> a<00:05:39.810> ball<00:05:40.020> bearing<00:05:40.250> inside

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
there's actually a ball bearing inside

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.890 
there's actually a ball bearing inside
the<00:05:41.370> grips<00:05:41.750> is<00:05:43.580> pretty<00:05:44.580> nice<00:05:44.760> but<00:05:45.600> it<00:05:45.690> kind<00:05:45.840> of

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
the grips is pretty nice but it kind of

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.050 
the grips is pretty nice but it kind of
sucks<00:05:46.020> that<00:05:46.170> it's<00:05:46.350> not<00:05:46.470> in<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.650> reel<00:05:46.950> it<00:05:47.190> says

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
sucks that it's not in the reel it says

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.410 
sucks that it's not in the reel it says
seven<00:05:48.540> ball<00:05:48.690> bearings<00:05:49.520> but<00:05:50.520> two<00:05:50.940> of<00:05:51.060> them<00:05:51.240> are

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
seven ball bearings but two of them are

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.210 
seven ball bearings but two of them are
in<00:05:51.570> each<00:05:51.870> handle<00:05:52.290> so<00:05:52.710> there's<00:05:52.920> one<00:05:53.490> two<00:05:53.790> and

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
in each handle so there's one two and

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.710 
in each handle so there's one two and
then<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.340> rest<00:05:56.520> are<00:05:56.640> inside<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.030> room<00:05:57.180> just

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
then the rest are inside the room just

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.140 
then the rest are inside the room just
like<00:05:57.810> a<00:05:58.280> just<00:05:59.280> like<00:05:59.400> the<00:05:59.760> other<00:06:00.110> um<00:06:02.000> I'm<00:06:03.000> going

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
like a just like the other um I'm going

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.890 
like a just like the other um I'm going
to<00:06:03.210> compare<00:06:03.540> this<00:06:03.660> to<00:06:03.840> the<00:06:04.080> new<00:06:04.200> case<00:06:04.410> maybe<00:06:04.920> um

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
to compare this to the new case maybe um

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.140 
to compare this to the new case maybe um
case<00:06:06.900> has<00:06:06.930> five<00:06:07.410> or<00:06:07.680> four<00:06:07.980> no<00:06:08.520> I<00:06:08.550> think<00:06:08.910> it's

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
case has five or four no I think it's

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.300 
case has five or four no I think it's
three<00:06:09.300> plus<00:06:09.480> one

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
three plus one

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.890 
three plus one
but<00:06:11.310> um<00:06:11.520> on<00:06:11.820> the<00:06:11.970> retrieve<00:06:12.300> is<00:06:12.450> very<00:06:12.630> smooth

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
but um on the retrieve is very smooth

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.570 
but um on the retrieve is very smooth
like<00:06:13.380> when<00:06:13.530> you're<00:06:13.680> reeling<00:06:13.860> in<00:06:14.070> your<00:06:14.190> lure<00:06:14.340> on

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
like when you're reeling in your lure on

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.180 
like when you're reeling in your lure on
the<00:06:15.240> when<00:06:15.690> you're<00:06:15.780> fighting<00:06:15.960> a<00:06:16.110> fish<00:06:16.320> a<00:06:16.620> small

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
the when you're fighting a fish a small

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.460 
the when you're fighting a fish a small
fish<00:06:17.370> you<00:06:17.550> can't<00:06:17.730> really<00:06:17.940> tell<00:06:18.150> but<00:06:18.810> um<00:06:19.050> on<00:06:19.410> a

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
fish you can't really tell but um on a

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.110 
fish you can't really tell but um on a
pretty<00:06:20.010> decent-sized<00:06:20.460> fish<00:06:20.490> that<00:06:20.880> has<00:06:20.970> some

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
pretty decent-sized fish that has some

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.890 
pretty decent-sized fish that has some
pulling<00:06:21.300> power<00:06:21.510> you<00:06:22.350> feel<00:06:22.380> the<00:06:23.630> sloppiness<00:06:24.630> of

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
pulling power you feel the sloppiness of

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.930 
pulling power you feel the sloppiness of
the<00:06:24.990> gears<00:06:25.230> you<00:06:25.590> know<00:06:25.830> just<00:06:26.040> you<00:06:26.669> can<00:06:26.790> just

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
the gears you know just you can just

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.450 
the gears you know just you can just
tell<00:06:27.090> it's<00:06:27.210> not<00:06:27.390> as<00:06:27.660> high-quality<00:06:28.260> as<00:06:28.710> the

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
tell it's not as high-quality as the

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.629 
tell it's not as high-quality as the
other<00:06:29.610> Shimano's

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
other Shimano's

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.570 
other Shimano's
as<00:06:30.699> to<00:06:30.879> higher<00:06:31.030> dollar<00:06:31.240> ones<00:06:31.539> but<00:06:32.379> for<00:06:33.099> $90

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
as to higher dollar ones but for $90

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.080 
as to higher dollar ones but for $90
it's<00:06:33.729> a<00:06:33.939> very<00:06:34.240> good<00:06:34.389> real<00:06:34.599> arm<00:06:35.490> the<00:06:36.490> only<00:06:36.939> other

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
it's a very good real arm the only other

it's a very good real arm the only other
thing<00:06:37.330> I<00:06:37.539> could<00:06:37.749> gripe<00:06:37.990> about<00:06:38.139> is<00:06:38.499> the<00:06:39.370> drag

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
thing I could gripe about is the drag

thing I could gripe about is the drag
there<00:06:40.210> is<00:06:40.509> very<00:06:40.990> little<00:06:41.289> drag<00:06:41.499> it<00:06:42.039> is<00:06:42.999> not<00:06:43.180> made

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
there is very little drag it is not made

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
for big fish that that fight hard on
