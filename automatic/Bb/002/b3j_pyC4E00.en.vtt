I<00:02:18.219> think<00:02:18.489> is<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:19.000> over<00:02:19.329> driven<00:02:19.689> sound<00:02:19.930> so

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
I think is that the over driven sound so

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.990 
I think is that the over driven sound so
let's<00:02:20.650> see<00:02:20.769> what<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.010> sounds<00:02:21.370> like<00:02:21.430> with<00:02:21.849> the
