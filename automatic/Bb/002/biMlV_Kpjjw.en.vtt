00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:17.739
 the first point nor the absence of a perspective of the socio-cultural context 

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:20.849
 the sense of applied knowledge 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.519
 school life 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.849
 the role of the school 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.750
 do not stay clear silver school thesis teachers 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.120
 it is important that teachers do not yet have in the classroom that they 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.250
 has 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.920
 even though he does not have 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.200
 people to homogenize a heterogeneity 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.630
 people come from different families with the religious rejected 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.649
 this means 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.670
 value different different behaviors 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.699
 it looks like the world and the background he does not need to get 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.829
 - notions of cultural anthropology 'and to situate oneself is still a bit of 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.110
 sociology 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.430
 but reflects not only on the theory of sociology but how this shows itself 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.570
 in society as a whole and in schools 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.600
 this awareness of being a teacher this identity of being a teacher 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.740
 it is not installed 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.280
 the identity will appear later 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.750
 in the exercise of teaching 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.720
 but not before as a professional proposal 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.280
 future teacher the 'teacher' he has to have little notion 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.170
 of this institution 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.150
 concrete where he will enter 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.400
 it is not for nothing that we have so much studies 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.520
 very interesting is about beginner teachers 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.550
 it is important to look can be literate roth can serve the 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.550
 mathematics of biology of whatever it is 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.970
 he got scared when he goes to school 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.800
 why the world does not discuss in your curriculum the issue of school 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.730
 a medical student presented to hospital 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.410
 on Wednesday 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.299
 he goes to the hospital 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.980
 now some student gives pedagogy often he does not go to school 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.959
 dalla is not a thing so naturally yes you do 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.959
 dealing with some things in school reality 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.980
 it is first necessary to have a mastery of this content with certainty and 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.519
 see you later for a little longer 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.169
 to be an intellectual 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.229
 the area that accompanies them. 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:33.630
 the advances 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.630
 but you have to have a good pedagogical background 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.200
 We do not know anything about staff who train teachers. 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.559
 Of course if you have a great diversity if you know that he is a doctor in 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.559
 this doctor and here he has a curriculum lattes 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.909
 but we do not know the formation that he has this union working in a 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.119
 course that forms the process 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:04.859
 Where do you live in general? 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.119
 It's very complicated, these same people. 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:11.699
 which is not of foundations that early grounds the person can refuse 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.349
 tested to good 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.599
 but without the same weight as among the methodologies for teaching practices 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.729
 many of them never entered a crowded room 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:22.939
 they made the goal 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.059
 the course of pedagogy the masters in education the doctorate in education in 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:31.059
 make a gaspar speech 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.549
 we do not doubt 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.299
 tested 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.689
 net social logy 'of education if you have discussed this day you have a 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.689
 an institutional fragmentation of training 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:47.729
 so you do not have more then generates an identification building 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:50.340
 what kind in a statement 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.829
 vialle profile 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.439
 and professional 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.669
 it is then of the nine of course how professionals then pounding with the nose 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.659
 at the door 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.659
 maia pt-sp that teachers 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:04.929
 that is reality is a bit different from our undergraduate training 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.809
 more 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:17.699
 little head decorations 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.019
 and they get somewhat asked in that situation 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.330
 so this is a crop is a bit complicated 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
 that it deserves is really a 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.240
 I debated more 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.580
 well this maybe 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.900
 commissions in various parts of the country 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.210
 catching heavy 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.210
 that they will have in tap is in practice because there have always been 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.759
 a dissociation between the systems 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.610
 educational 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.529
 Senate - I convert very few people 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.770
 on one side you have is that the executive 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.169
 the education secretariat masaya teaching superintendency but 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.830
 teaching directories 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.860
 Maliki who comes and goes from a more academic background has to deal 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.729
 with the fire of every day 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.610
 It's right and make it happen. 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.240
 and I think there is contained in it 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.220
 I have a knowledge we go recently as civilian mayor 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.410
 but that in judo 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.029
 in theory with practice 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:16.339
 and we are arguing all the time does not join theory with practice 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.669
 but I think we even from Univesp is not know how to join until the 4th
