00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.929
 Essentially, dear listeners video listeners 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.049
 who watch and listen to my chatter 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:19.250
 but the roof is possible for you 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:21.529
 useful if you are somehow more 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.170
 choose meticulously 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.220
 your future kitchen today we will talk 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.260
 about the kitchen apron 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.630
 briefly tell you what they are 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.510
 there are no advantages and so 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:46.500
 further well here in the kitchen stands forts 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:48.960
 here it is a glass fartuh standing here 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.309
 used branded 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.399
 Glass lakobel ie 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.199
 lacobel is a glass which 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.870
 paint which baked oven 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:08.700
 that is, it is more uniform that is, well 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:12.240
 or but ideally no longer afraid in principle 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.110
 nothing heat there and so forth that is how 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.920
 bios we talk about that glass in just 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.040
 any any 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.009
 any paint then lacobel is perfect 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.159
 option exactly this option is a bit cheaper 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.040
 it will just be painted glass i.e. 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.460
 you can order it out lacquered a 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.370
 plain tinted glass and select by 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.060
 ralu 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:41.120
 the color scheme that you will be here 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.740
 it is also very fashionable to apply now 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.890
 various drawings on the apron that is it 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.380
 absolutely normal option that is you 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.520
 order a picture and install it here 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.420
 there everything you want there fruit 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.620
 coffee beans 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.800
 cities and so on and so forth but all 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.970
 it is anyway installed on 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:11.240
 so that the glass is already someone like that 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.790
 in principle, you can choose yourself 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.840
 100 here as well as some innovation here 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.100
 still been applied 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.280
 that is, the glass has no fastening if 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.190
 you look one does not have a mount in 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.950
 principle for someone is not important for 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.260
 someone is important if you see 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.820
 You can on the Internet there photos 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.500
 look look here are such four 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.160
 blanks on each glass you will 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.500
 see it is undignified good kitchens 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.050
 apply a completely different way 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:50.150
 fixing glass here in principle and 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.880
 applied to an excellent organization which 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.180
 called furniture proxy that is 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.390
 you will not see any mounting here 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:03.230
 everything is completely perfect done as if 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.680
 This glass is sewn inexplicably in 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.180
 this kitchen also exist fartuh 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.260
 aprons yet 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.980
 that is, other species are also very 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.260
 common apron is postforming 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.730
 that is, a 10 mm plate approximately 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.950
 from the same material that is made 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.950
 the tabletop is only 10 millimeters and 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:36.620
 In principle, it is also attached to 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.690
 wall in this way we also them 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.440
 mounted and 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.630
 and they behave beautifully in what they 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.000
 better than glass but not clear what 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.000
 they beat that is glass if you are very 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.330
 hit something hard I'm pans here 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.350
 there is a run up or so on pace 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.250
 run a spoon then principle it 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:09.160
 will break 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:09.160
 so the advantage of postforming is 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.200
 unbreakable absolute surface if 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.019
 you are able to put the apron 10 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.030
 millimeter for example firm luxury form 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.600
 releases such replenished 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.090
 and send them there we are in 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.640
 Ukraine in Ukraine, any city can 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.050
 do n't even directly climb or him 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.730
 Suppliers can take this groove form 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.490
 Well, if you order in a solid company 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.130
 she you all do what you want something 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.570
 have you only need some kind of desire and 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.820
 this desire to convey to the manufacturer 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.700
 well, a good manufacturer is furniture 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:54.490
 proxy can carry anything 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:58.910
 everything will be done for the highest quality 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.940
 principle, the main thing as if the main two types 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.280
 aprons I told you well and your aprons 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.280
 which is not associated with an apron of course 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.040
 tile that is a form of a fartuh and you can 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.960
 you can lay a tile 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.150
 choose absolutely any small 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:19.750
 big medium huge 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.770
 that is the same apron you put in the form 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.980
 tiles 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.980
 how can you say the third kind 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:34.350
 the third kind of apron and therefore make your 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.320
 choice of course glass 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.450
 monophonic very beautiful she is very in 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.480
 principle looks expensive, I even said 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.230
 what looks better than installed 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.710
 this photo 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.530
 full color well although you have to watch what 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.480
 photo that is, if the photo is very large 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.720
 good resolution if everything is perfect 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.580
 fronts are chosen 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.530
 photo on the apron that is perfect 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.800
 chosen then of course it is beautiful there 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.810
 it's just some kind of photo then this 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.440
 may be ugly on lapis then well there 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.150
 and so on do not match that is 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:14.620
 more scrupulous approach to the choice 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:16.900
 photos if you of course put on 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.980
 some kind of apron you will put 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:24.970
 some photo is basically important 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:28.180
 all by apron for kitchen therefore 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:33.790

 future kitchen that is clear that this 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.000
 there must be a 3d project in which you 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.790
 you can plan everything completely and 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.910
 then prescribe what you want is not firm 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:00.540
