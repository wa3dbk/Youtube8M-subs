00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.889 
label and my answer to that would always
be<00:01:59.920> like<00:02:00.100> if<00:02:00.580> I<00:02:00.729> wanted<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.270> release<00:02:01.630> a<00:02:01.660> record

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
be like if I wanted to release a record

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.590 
be like if I wanted to release a record
of<00:02:02.410> pigs<00:02:02.740> farting<00:02:03.490> then<00:02:03.910> I<00:02:03.940> could<00:02:04.300> because

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
of pigs farting then I could because

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.710 
of pigs farting then I could because
it's<00:02:04.750> my<00:02:04.899> label<00:02:05.679> so<00:02:05.920> it's<00:02:06.850> kind<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.090> yeah<00:02:07.240> that

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
it's my label so it's kind of yeah that

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.029 
it's my label so it's kind of yeah that
kind<00:02:07.929> of<00:02:07.990> sums<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.319> up<00:02:08.440> really<00:02:08.500> you<00:02:08.770> know<00:02:08.860> it's

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
kind of sums it up really you know it's

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.120 
kind of sums it up really you know it's
like<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.940> can<00:02:10.290> it's<00:02:11.290> just<00:02:11.560> freedom<00:02:11.950> really

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
like you can it's just freedom really

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.270 
like you can it's just freedom really
it's<00:02:13.030> an<00:02:13.210> interesting<00:02:13.480> process<00:02:14.319> you<00:02:15.069> know<00:02:15.190> if

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
it's an interesting process you know if

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.610 
it's an interesting process you know if
you're<00:02:15.430> releasing<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.970> physical<00:02:16.540> like<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> CD<00:02:17.470> or

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
you're releasing a physical like a CD or

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.920 
you're releasing a physical like a CD or
record<00:02:17.920> or<00:02:18.010> whatever

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
record or whatever

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.280 
record or whatever
even<00:02:19.109> with<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.890> guess<00:02:20.400> even<00:02:20.879> with<00:02:21.090> files<00:02:21.989> that

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
even with I guess even with files that

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.630 
even with I guess even with files that
contain<00:02:22.379> artwork<00:02:22.980> or<00:02:23.189> something<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.519> know

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
contain artwork or something you know

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.539 
contain artwork or something you know
it's<00:02:23.849> it's<00:02:24.359> a<00:02:24.480> process<00:02:25.219> and<00:02:26.219> it's<00:02:26.400> quite

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
it's it's a process and it's quite

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.699 
it's it's a process and it's quite
interesting<00:02:27.019> you<00:02:28.019> know<00:02:28.140> from<00:02:28.319> making<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
interesting you know from making the

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.849 
interesting you know from making the
music<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.489> cutting<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.510> record<00:02:30.859> manufacturing

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
music to cutting a record manufacturing

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.789 
music to cutting a record manufacturing
and<00:02:32.219> you<00:02:32.250> know<00:02:32.790> deciding<00:02:33.469> every<00:02:34.469> little

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
and you know deciding every little

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.149 
and you know deciding every little
detail<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.359> you<00:02:36.480> know<00:02:36.599> it's<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.129> a

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
detail of it you know it's it is a

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.309 
detail of it you know it's it is a
permanent<00:02:38.819> interesting<00:02:39.450> process<00:02:39.810> releasing

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
permanent interesting process releasing

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.369 
permanent interesting process releasing
music<00:02:40.439> so<00:02:40.980> yeah<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.760> think<00:02:41.909> it's<00:02:42.120> good<00:02:42.299> when<00:02:42.510> you

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
music so yeah I think it's good when you

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.270 
music so yeah I think it's good when you
take<00:02:43.969> take<00:02:44.969> PI<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.540> every<00:02:45.840> every<00:02:46.230> process<00:02:46.769> and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
take take PI and every every process and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.280 
take take PI and every every process and
I<00:02:47.370> think<00:02:47.670> it's<00:02:47.790> more<00:02:47.939> rewarding<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.599> I<00:02:48.989> know

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
I think it's more rewarding but I know

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.330 
I think it's more rewarding but I know
different<00:02:49.680> people<00:02:49.769> more<00:02:49.950> than<00:02:50.069> different

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
different people more than different

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.520 
different people more than different
ways<00:02:50.489> some<00:02:50.819> someone<00:02:51.299> maybe<00:02:52.079> would<00:02:52.349> rather

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
ways some someone maybe would rather

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.140 
ways some someone maybe would rather
just<00:02:52.829> make<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.099> tunes<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.609> just<00:02:53.790> give<00:02:54.030> them

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
just make the tunes and just give them

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.059 
just make the tunes and just give them
to<00:02:54.269> someone<00:02:54.480> else<00:02:54.629> and<00:02:54.989> they<00:02:55.139> take<00:02:55.560> care<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.889> it

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
to someone else and they take care of it

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.330 
to someone else and they take care of it
you<00:02:56.189> know<00:02:56.310> it's<00:02:56.939> time-consuming<00:02:57.359> but<00:02:57.919> I<00:02:58.919> I

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
you know it's time-consuming but I I
