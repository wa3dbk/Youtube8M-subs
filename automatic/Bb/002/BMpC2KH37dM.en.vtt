00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.280 
vision when we look at a moving object
we<00:01:54.280> really<00:01:54.700> see<00:01:54.909> it<00:01:55.000> in<00:01:55.180> two<00:01:55.360> places<00:01:55.540> at<00:01:55.900> once

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
we really see it in two places at once

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.030 
we really see it in two places at once
where<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:57.010> is<00:01:57.040> and<00:01:57.520> where<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.450> was<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:59.140> fraction

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
where it is and where it was a fraction

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.430 
where it is and where it was a fraction
of<00:02:00.159> a<00:02:00.220> second<00:02:00.610> before<00:02:00.840> let's<00:02:01.840> get<00:02:02.049> out<00:02:02.140> into<00:02:02.409> a

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
of a second before let's get out into a

of a second before let's get out into a
rainstorm<00:02:02.650> for<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.430> good<00:02:03.580> example<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.840> water

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
rainstorm for a good example the water

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.260 
rainstorm for a good example the water
you<00:02:05.290> seem<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.650> see<00:02:05.799> falling<00:02:06.250> in<00:02:06.369> streams<00:02:06.760> is

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
you seem to see falling in streams is

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.140 
you seem to see falling in streams is
really<00:02:07.869> a<00:02:07.900> lot<00:02:08.319> of<00:02:08.560> separate<00:02:09.039> drops

persistence<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.269> vision<00:02:13.330> makes<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.439> see<00:02:14.709> each

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
persistence of vision makes you see each

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.429 
persistence of vision makes you see each
raindrop<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:15.849> several<00:02:16.239> places<00:02:16.480> over<00:02:17.409> a

distance<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:18.010> several<00:02:18.430> inches<00:02:18.750> let's<00:02:19.750> look<00:02:19.959> at

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
distance of several inches let's look at

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.259 
distance of several inches let's look at
a<00:02:20.110> picture<00:02:20.319> of<00:02:20.439> a<00:02:20.590> car<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.129> the<00:02:21.790> picture<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.209> a

a picture of a car and the picture of a

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.080 
a picture of a car and the picture of a
moving<00:02:22.569> landscape<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.799> show<00:02:24.040> how<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.610> can

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
moving landscape to show how the I can

moving landscape to show how the I can
make<00:02:25.299> them<00:02:25.480> seem<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.989> overlap<00:02:26.620> let's<00:02:27.310> run<00:02:27.519> them

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
make them seem to overlap let's run them

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.210 
make them seem to overlap let's run them
on<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.849> screen<00:02:28.060> one<00:02:28.780> after<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.200> other<00:02:29.230> we

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
on the screen one after the other we

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.740 
on the screen one after the other we
look<00:02:30.489> at<00:02:30.640> them<00:02:30.819> for<00:02:31.030> two<00:02:31.180> seconds<00:02:31.599> each<00:02:33.750> then

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
look at them for two seconds each then

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.979 
look at them for two seconds each then
for<00:02:35.080> one<00:02:35.290> second<00:02:35.709> each<00:02:35.830> now<00:02:36.779> faster<00:02:37.779> and

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
for one second each now faster and

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.330 
for one second each now faster and
faster<00:02:38.230> until<00:02:38.739> we<00:02:39.639> see<00:02:39.819> the<00:02:39.969> two<00:02:40.150> pictures

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
faster until we see the two pictures

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.820 
faster until we see the two pictures
as<00:02:41.400> if<00:02:41.519> they<00:02:41.670> were<00:02:41.730> both<00:02:42.030> one<00:02:42.510> picture<00:02:43.019> another
