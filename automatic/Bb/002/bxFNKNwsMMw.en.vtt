00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.230
 in this appointment with chip leader 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.029
 the strategies of the pros to win the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.070
 poker tournaments we will talk about how 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.290
 handle ace woman once you get to 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.940
 final table to give us two ideas in 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.500
 thinks alessandro clarified 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.500
 pokerclub pro team member 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.640
 ace is the final hand is a hand 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.830
 particular because it is one of those hands 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.290
 apparently very strong but 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.780
 concretely very tricky ie that 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.340
 often hides many pitfalls 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.080
 actually like all hands go 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.670
 analyzed the commercials are analyzed the 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.140
 situations and all the information that 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.170
 we have available to take the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.960
 correct choices this hand with me zac 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.580
 zac as capadonna hands of this type 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.650
 they are always those that risk 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.470
 create the greatest difficulties 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.420
 definitely against ace short players 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.979
 woman a hand laid quietly 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.619
 we can go and call some oils not 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.110
 we can risk a little bit though too 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.020
 true that making speeches of this kind 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.950
 often tends to generalize 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.300
 I always prefer situations anyway 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.560
 analyze all the situation as 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.290
 said earlier based on all the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.149
 information where my provision 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.520
 I don't go to take the right choice 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.350
 never broke up with a woman ace or I always go 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.640
 broken with ace woman in my opinion does not have 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.490
 too much sense to reason in these terms 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.740
 but I prefer to say ok my opponent 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.110
 having dark opened by the button has me 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.210
 pushato I call with ace a woman yes because 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.390
 this is a situation in which there is or 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.280
 tg childbirth the tg1 player tribetta pusha 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.149
 the player from the big blind with 20 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.500
 buy 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.910
 the money is always the same as 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.090
 I should put it however this is an aspect 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.950
 a little different then it is a beautiful hand e 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.399
 as a beautiful hand must be taken with the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.100
 pliers 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.780
 after he raised someone there 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.490
 we find with ace a woman clearly le 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.900
 our choices are always 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.710
 the same or raise with the fold with is one 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.620
 choice that in my opinion 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.850
 can become very profitable 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.930
 especially with the evolution it has 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.640
 had the field in the sense that being there 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.260
 sometimes very final tables with 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.640
 very aggressive players who are late to 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.080
 put pressure on the stairs 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.360
 prizes etc. etc. 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.340
 if we are willing to take lines 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.320
 as with we give woman colossus hoping 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.210
 that someone re made behind us for 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.260
 then go up there again or otherwise 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.370
 don't give up a hand 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.680
 regardless of the line that 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.580
 according to me it is a very good choice 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.580
 very valid
