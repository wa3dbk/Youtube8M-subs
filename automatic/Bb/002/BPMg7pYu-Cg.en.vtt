structure<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:25.890> Lynch<00:02:26.129> became<00:02:26.489> somewhat<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:26.849> a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
structure so Lynch became somewhat of a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.180 
structure so Lynch became somewhat of a
folk<00:02:27.239> hero<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.810> also<00:02:28.319> somewhat<00:02:28.739> of<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.920> bet

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
so hence the theory goes okay we're

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.309 
so hence the theory goes okay we're
going<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.819> win<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.120> game<00:02:36.239> anyway<00:02:36.720> who's
