 this thinner while just flowing 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.860

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.990
 thin to the success of the recipe have to 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.710

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.140
 baking powder 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.009
 in this recipe we put yeast 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.020
 in powder 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.720
 here we talk 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.899
 we do not give a light beat 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.899
 on the staff and we mix 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.640

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.770
 mass of which is sausage or sausage 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.630
 it's already seasoned 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.680
 now we are putting milk to the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.680
 few stirring 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:21.610
 now with the help of one was but let's 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.610
 doing so until a mass today is 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.800
 here we have to stay in this 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.980
 consistency 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.460

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.370
 more comfort and pray flu now we 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:40.320
 we took the barbecue skewer and 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.320
 so we put the sausage 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.990
 now we've got a container like this 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.530
 longer or cup and we turn this 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.530
 pasta 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.900
 now we have improved the sausage in this 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.900
 pasta 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.160
 to not know if the oil temperature 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.030
 is good but we put a toothpick 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.880
 wood celebrated looking around and already 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.670
 is now more than looking at leaving it 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.460
 that being a little more is in the fire 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.790

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.580

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.790

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.790
 drain and place in hot oil 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.640
 Let's do it like this with all of them. 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.140
 that's why the dough has to be 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.840
 pasty 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.710
 If it becomes very liquid it starts to 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.570
 drain very still works out 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.130
