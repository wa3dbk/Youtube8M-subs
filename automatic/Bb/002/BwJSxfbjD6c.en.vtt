00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 to 

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:07.110
 how to know if a mobile is stolen as 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.269
 no doubt you know buying a phone 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.970
 stolen is not just a moral problem 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.800
 worrying but also the phone 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.529
 could lose his ability to 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.170
 work if the purchased device is 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.680
 know that I have stolen the transporters 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.770
 will have the blacklist of sn for 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.140
 start this assuming of course that 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.289
 do not remain marked and investigated at 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.780
 try to activate it is a situation that 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.020
 can give you problems fortunately 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.200
 you can still avoid how can I 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.149
 Avoid buying a stolen phone 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.730
 your first line of action in the purchase 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.250
 online of a phone is to make sure 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.680
 that is legitimate to the person who is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.440
 you are buying it goes without saying that 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.079
 this can be a challenge just 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.840
 you must buy products with real photos 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.390
 available unlike the images 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.239
 of the product ask questions and ask 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.060
 inquiries about the seller as well 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.040
 as the product the simplest way 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.220
 to know if a phone 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.500
 is stolen is checking your email on 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.080
 email from a phone is unique in each 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.630
 terminal if a person is trying 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.030
 selling a stolen phone will change this 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.920
 number or at least try it 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.680
 the email of the phone we can 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.930
 find in the box inside the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.010
 phone behind the battery and if 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.640
 we mark asterisk to 06 pad the 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.070
 phone will tell us what is the number that 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.440
 we are given we can put it in a base of 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.990
 data from stolen phones to know if 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.119
 the device is in the list if 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.550
 you decide to buy the mobile from a seller 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.430
 unknown ask if you can 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.280
 check the phone's email before 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.590
 buy it although obviously the seller 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.080
 it can be denied in the beginning 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.060
 you must explain that you are interested in 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.090
 buy the phone but before 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.180
 you want to make sure it's not stolen 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.310
 if they allow you to check the great thing if not 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.320
 you must decide if you are willing to 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.819
 take the risk you can also 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.609
 check the 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.349
 sn of a device or the email number 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:20.549
 in the swap there is a limit of 20 per hour 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.540
 alternatively you can call your 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:27.900
 company to check the sn not all 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.109
 the companies will do sn checks 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.790
 but nothing happens by asking 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.829
 alternatively you can request an appointment 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.079
 in your support store so they can 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.200
 activate your phone as soon as 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.510
 buy however the best way to 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.450
 protect yourself is simply to make a 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.519
 Smart purchase if a deal seems 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.590
 too good to be true 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.590
 it probably is
