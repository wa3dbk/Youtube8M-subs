just you know a carbine rifle for me it
just<00:03:38.430> feels<00:03:38.700> better<00:03:39.060> whenever<00:03:39.660> I'm<00:03:39.750> in<00:03:39.840> a

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
just feels better whenever I'm in a

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.750 
just feels better whenever I'm in a
deathmatch<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.530> usually<00:03:40.829> choose<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.370> carbine

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
deathmatch I usually choose the carbine

reform<00:03:42.120> maybe<00:03:42.359> advanced<00:03:42.959> rifle<00:03:43.260> just<00:03:43.440> because

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
reform maybe advanced rifle just because

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.860 
reform maybe advanced rifle just because

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
my opinion it it doesn't feel as great

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.449 
my opinion it it doesn't feel as great
you<00:03:48.870> know<00:03:48.959> not<00:03:49.170> only<00:03:49.200> does<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.709> have<00:03:50.100> pretty

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
you know not only does it have pretty

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.759 
you know not only does it have pretty
much<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.670> same<00:03:50.970> stats<00:03:51.390> as<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.989> carbine<00:03:52.350> rifle

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.440 
much the same stats as the carbine rifle
although<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.489> spread<00:03:53.760> on<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.090> special

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
although the spread on the special

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.449 
although the spread on the special
carbon<00:03:54.720> doesn't<00:03:54.959> seem<00:03:55.079> to<00:03:55.380> be<00:03:55.530> as<00:03:55.769> large<00:03:56.280> as

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
carbon doesn't seem to be as large as

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.380 
carbon doesn't seem to be as large as
the<00:03:57.090> carbine<00:03:57.840> rifle<00:03:58.200> for<00:03:58.709> me<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.340> recoil<00:03:59.910> you

would also recommend getting this weapon

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.510 
would also recommend getting this weapon
because<00:04:54.479> it<00:04:54.599> isn't<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.930> salt<00:04:55.169> rifle<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:56.400> is

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
because it isn't a salt rifle and it is

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.179 
because it isn't a salt rifle and it is
kind<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.240> nice<00:04:57.419> and<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:58.560> know<00:04:58.710> it's<00:04:58.919> just<00:04:59.009> kind

kind of nice and you know it's just kind

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:02.029
