00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.500 
just like torches you could hold the
lantern<00:06:00.550> in<00:06:00.820> your<00:06:00.970> hand

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
lantern in your hand

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.570 
lantern in your hand
but<00:06:01.660> unlike<00:06:02.140> torches<00:06:02.710> you<00:06:02.950> did<00:06:03.130> not<00:06:03.280> have<00:06:03.460> to

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
but unlike torches you did not have to

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.370 
but unlike torches you did not have to
place<00:06:03.850> the<00:06:04.030> lantern<00:06:04.450> for<00:06:04.900> it<00:06:05.020> to<00:06:05.110> shine

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
place the lantern for it to shine

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.200 
place the lantern for it to shine
meaning<00:06:06.220> you<00:06:06.340> could<00:06:06.490> walk<00:06:06.670> around<00:06:07.030> at<00:06:07.180> night

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
meaning you could walk around at night

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.480 
meaning you could walk around at night
with<00:06:07.690> the<00:06:07.780> lantern<00:06:07.990> equipped<00:06:08.560> and<00:06:08.890> be<00:06:09.130> able<00:06:09.310> to

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
with the lantern equipped and be able to

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.480 
with the lantern equipped and be able to
see<00:06:09.760> just<00:06:09.790> fine<00:06:10.440> emerald<00:06:11.440> ore<00:06:11.740> was<00:06:12.100> never

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
see just fine emerald ore was never

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.730 
see just fine emerald ore was never
supposed<00:06:12.790> to<00:06:13.180> be<00:06:13.270> in<00:06:13.570> the<00:06:13.690> game<00:06:13.930> but<00:06:14.500> was

don't worry

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.140 
don't worry
many<00:06:43.080> of<00:06:43.230> these<00:06:43.380> dropped<00:06:43.800> or<00:06:44.130> on<00:06:44.280> hold<00:06:44.610> ideas
