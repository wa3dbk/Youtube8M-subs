00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
well in the stepping stone and slowed

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.440 
well in the stepping stone and slowed
down<00:00:20.250> quite<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.580> bit<00:00:20.670> on<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.940> way<00:00:21.030> this<00:00:21.180> foggy

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
down quite a bit on the way this foggy

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.760 
down quite a bit on the way this foggy
so<00:00:21.870> I<00:00:21.900> was<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.020> little<00:00:22.080> bit<00:00:22.290> worried<00:00:22.500> after

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
so I was a little bit worried after

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.880 
so I was a little bit worried after
skazhi<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.490> then<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.410> went<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.530> cook<00:00:25.680> dinner

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
skazhi and then I went to cook dinner

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.890 
skazhi and then I went to cook dinner
and<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.190> realized<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.910> had<00:00:26.940> maybe<00:00:27.300> our

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
and I realized that we had maybe our

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.480 
and I realized that we had maybe our
gosh<00:00:28.380> two<00:00:28.590> minutes<00:00:28.860> left<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.250> they<00:00:29.369> have

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
gosh two minutes left and they have

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.580 
gosh two minutes left and they have
their<00:00:29.610> miles<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.970> go<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:31.020> I<00:00:31.050> got<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> little<00:00:31.350> bit

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
their miles to go so I got a little bit

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.659 
their miles to go so I got a little bit
worried<00:00:31.710> at<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.860> point<00:00:31.980> but<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.309> thought<00:00:32.520> well

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
worried at that point but I thought well

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.069 
worried at that point but I thought well
I<00:00:32.699> think<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.300> make<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.480> through<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.960> we'll

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
I think we can make it through and we'll

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.559 
I think we can make it through and we'll
just<00:00:34.260> keep<00:00:34.410> going<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.969> it<00:00:35.969> wasn't<00:00:36.269> too<00:00:36.359> cold

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:36.569 
just keep going and it wasn't too cold

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.419 
just keep going and it wasn't too cold
out<00:00:36.719> which<00:00:37.019> is<00:00:37.199> great<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:37.739> then<00:00:37.949> we<00:00:38.100> hit<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:38.429 
out which is great but then we hit the

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.209 
out which is great but then we hit the
black<00:00:38.640> hills<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.289> my<00:00:40.289> dogs<00:00:40.499> have<00:00:40.710> never<00:00:40.920> quite

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
black hills and my dogs have never quite

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.950 
black hills and my dogs have never quite
run<00:00:41.429> and<00:00:41.579> heels<00:00:41.760> quite<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.269> before<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
run and heels quite like that before and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.020 
run and heels quite like that before and
I<00:00:43.589> think<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:43.949> the<00:00:44.010> combination<00:00:44.249> of<00:00:44.670> offense

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
I think just the combination of offense

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.579 
I think just the combination of offense
maybe<00:00:45.479> a<00:00:45.600> little<00:00:45.809> less<00:00:46.019> fuel<00:00:46.319> than<00:00:46.350> they

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
maybe a little less fuel than they

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.309 
maybe a little less fuel than they
needed<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.159> then<00:00:47.940> working<00:00:48.780> mistake<00:00:49.170> not

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:49.319 
needed and then working mistake not

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:50.540 
needed and then working mistake not
packing<00:00:49.710> enough<00:00:49.920> course<00:00:50.339> not<00:00:50.489> really

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
packing enough course not really

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.639 
packing enough course not really
understanding<00:00:51.179> returing<00:00:51.479> it<00:00:52.139> was<00:00:52.260> coming<00:00:52.559> up

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
understanding returing it was coming up

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.889 
understanding returing it was coming up
in<00:00:52.769> that<00:00:52.889> 100<00:00:53.339> mile<00:00:53.460> stretch<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.179> so<00:00:54.780> they

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
in that 100 mile stretch and so they

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.389 
in that 100 mile stretch and so they
slowed<00:00:55.170> down<00:00:55.199> considerably<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.129> black

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
slowed down considerably in the black

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.969 
slowed down considerably in the black
hills<00:00:56.609> and<00:00:57.179> we<00:00:57.389> had<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.600> take<00:00:57.749> that<00:00:57.960> extra<00:00:58.739> rest

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
hills and we had to take that extra rest

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.379 
hills and we had to take that extra rest
breaks<00:00:59.249> at<00:00:59.729> which<00:00:59.850> point<00:00:59.999> then<00:01:00.179> we<00:01:00.269> were

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:00.389 
breaks at which point then we were

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:03.590 
breaks at which point then we were
pretty<00:01:00.539> much<00:01:00.690> out<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.899> food<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:02.389> lost<00:01:03.389> power

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
pretty much out of food and lost power

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.590 
pretty much out of food and lost power

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
of the wind and out of the wind it was

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.060 
of the wind and out of the wind it was
kind<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.190> up<00:02:00.370> on<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.670> top<00:02:01.500> near<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.680> top<00:02:02.860> not

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
kind of up on the top near the top not

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.070 
kind of up on the top near the top not
we<00:02:03.340> got<00:02:03.490> past<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.910> real<00:02:04.060> drifted<00:02:04.420> in<00:02:04.510> part<00:02:04.750> and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
we got past the real drifted in part and

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.750 
we got past the real drifted in part and
then<00:02:05.440> I<00:02:05.500> thought<00:02:05.830> we<00:02:05.950> had<00:02:05.980> started<00:02:06.160> a<00:02:06.370> descent

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
then I thought we had started a descent

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.040 
then I thought we had started a descent
but<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.090> didn't<00:02:07.300> realize<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.570> was<00:02:07.840> just

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
but I didn't realize that was just

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.900 
but I didn't realize that was just
starting<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.350> switchbacks<00:02:08.860> so<00:02:09.190> we<00:02:09.610> but

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
starting the switchbacks so we but

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.950 
starting the switchbacks so we but
that's<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.240> point<00:02:10.390> where<00:02:10.570> we<00:02:10.660> had<00:02:10.750> pulled

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
that's the point where we had pulled

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.840 
that's the point where we had pulled
over<00:02:11.050> yeah<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.770> they<00:02:11.980> rested<00:02:12.370> pretty<00:02:12.670> well

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
over yeah and they rested pretty well

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.390 
over yeah and they rested pretty well
there<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.380> we<00:02:14.380> fed<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.710> last<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.070> our<00:02:15.160> nails

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
there and we fed the last of our nails

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.930 
there and we fed the last of our nails
and<00:02:15.820> then<00:02:16.240> when<00:02:16.720> we<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:17.310> took<00:02:18.310> off<00:02:18.460> again<00:02:18.640> that

and then when we I took off again that
speed<00:02:19.390> just<00:02:19.600> wasn't<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.320> I<00:02:20.590> even<00:02:20.800> speed<00:02:21.070> so

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
yesterday I didn't realize this plane

yesterday I didn't realize this plane
was<00:02:39.970> looking<00:02:40.600> for<00:02:40.810> me<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:41.080> just<00:02:41.110> thought<00:02:41.470> of

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
was looking for me I just thought of

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.110 
was looking for me I just thought of
something<00:02:41.860> about<00:02:42.010> playing<00:02:42.310> when<00:02:42.820> I<00:02:42.850> saw<00:02:43.060> the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
something about playing when I saw the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.700 
something about playing when I saw the
snow<00:02:43.360> machines<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.870> they<00:02:43.960> just<00:02:44.140> happen<00:02:44.650> to

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
snow machines and they just happen to

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.110 
snow machines and they just happen to
have<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:44.830> bag<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.310> dog<00:02:45.460> food<00:02:45.490> I<00:02:45.790> thought<00:02:45.970> that

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
have a bag of dog food I thought that

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.780 
have a bag of dog food I thought that
was<00:02:46.240> a<00:02:46.270> blessing<00:02:46.540> yes<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:48.370> did<00:02:48.550> get<00:02:48.700> us

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
was a blessing yes and that did get us

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.310 
was a blessing yes and that did get us
through<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.030> night<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.390> then<00:02:49.540> again<00:02:49.960> hoping

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
through the night and then again hoping

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.860 
through the night and then again hoping
you<00:02:50.440> arrested<00:02:50.980> eight<00:02:51.070> hours<00:02:51.340> fed<00:02:51.580> twice

you arrested eight hours fed twice

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.550 
you arrested eight hours fed twice
hoping<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:52.900> they'd<00:02:53.080> have<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.200> little<00:02:53.350> power

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
hoping that they'd have a little power

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.960 
hoping that they'd have a little power
when<00:02:53.830> we<00:02:53.920> woke<00:02:54.160> up<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.430> there<00:02:54.580> were<00:02:54.700> sports
