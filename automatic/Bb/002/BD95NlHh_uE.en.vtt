00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.879
 let's sharpen then the vehicle 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.910
 number 2 with the triangulation method 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:16.120
 according to the measures we take 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.180
 then the vehicle number 2 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.450
 we fix it to a point 3 and 4 point 3 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.430
 is the left anterior vertex and the 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.310
 point 4 left posterior vertex 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.290
 then we have the measure of the two 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.090
 referent points two points let's say 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.150
 that of reference to auxiliary points 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.820
 there you see certain projected perpendicular 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.690
 of the mete of a point of reference that 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.309
 was prolongation of the platforms 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.570
 would be our point of reference the 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.570
 projection of the platforms 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.210
 then point number 3 I'm going to 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:56.750
 locate with the compass is 752 meters 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:02.409
 with respect to the point with respect to 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.409
 then the compass placed it 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.520
 at point zero centimeters either the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.430
 important is to consider the scale 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.530
 that we're going to work scale 1 200 to 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.979
 scale 200 means that one centimeter 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.220
 is equivalent to 200 centimeters in this case 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.080
 2 meters then one centimeter if in the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.220
 moment we are going to measure point 3 is 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:32.470
 of 7 52 here we open the compass two 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:35.890
 three four five six seven meters with 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.039
 52 that would be in the middle of these two 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.039
 lines 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.990
 now doctor at the point 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.990
 and I'm going to generate an arc 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.450
 we make a very smooth arch for 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:58.550
 then delete those lines and now 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.280
 with regard to seeing 854 he misplaced the 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.720
 compass on the square or the rule of 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.600
 scale that you have of what you are 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:11.720
 using let's go to 854 this 78 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.380
 854 equally in half of the lines 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.380
 and I'm located in b 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.620
 and there I found I did something else and with 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.870
 the two arcs I found point number 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.150
 three 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.780
 but we mark so that we do not miss 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.640
 later 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:38.150
 point number 4 with respect to 11 0 7 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:43.420
 wii with compass we open here we would be 24 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:46.300
 68 meters 10 meters 11 meters 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.830
 11 07 that is about 10 centimeters 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.830
 11 solution 13 no 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.110
 11 10 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.130
 and we make a bow and then the point 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.810
 number four with respect to five 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.810
 meters with 42 centimeters 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.580
 obviously I'm not taking from the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.060
 centimeter 1 if then I have here 2 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.060
 meters 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.700
 345 meters now with 42 each line each 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.800
 1000 and chopped 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.490
 each line equals 20 centimeters 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.640
 so, we have 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.730
 40 if we approximate 40 in the rule in the 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.730
 food square the next 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.730
 wycombe 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.460
 and some small bow and I found the 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.840
 point number 4 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:45.830
 now we give you the handling 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.830
 from the location of that point 3 and the 4 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.980
 and placing in the first line that would be 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:58.580
 the left side of the vehicle now 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.110
 what we do is with the width 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:06.099
 vehicle width from 160 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.099
 one meter sixty 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.340
 likewise at this point about 60 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.340
 and the Caribbean 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.550
 and let's wait 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.300
 yes 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.820
 and now draw the front of the 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.820
 vehicle 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.190
 let's say as the panoramic the 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.639
 two very small arcs then for not 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:48.689
 leave a panoramic later two others 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.939
 arches note that there is a relationship 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:52.979
 of what is the back a bit 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:56.669
 narrower than the previous part of 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:59.179
 vehicle and then draw some lines like 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.179
 joining them 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.950
 and we have our vehicle number 2 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:18.630
 behind the city 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.990
 we have already finished the measurement part 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.860
 or location of the vehicles with the 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.860
 triangulation method
