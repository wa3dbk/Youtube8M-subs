00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.040
 Welcome to another video! 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.170
 of the channel and today I'll show you the 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.360
 which weighs most in terms of configurations 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.189
 have a game and to show this 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.560
 and I'll put the game called tomb raider 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.180
 for it has a fixed benchmark and also 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.390
 because it has most of the settings 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.239
 that I will say that you then follow the 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.040
 video with the game giving badly here 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.809
 inside the game so let's go there I will 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.960
 show you why I 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.180
 first I see more weight in the game 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.260
 It's certainly a dialysis. It's 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.790
 sanitation 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.610
 here I put as much as this game 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.159
 support applied and let the listener mark 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.559
 For you to notice first, I'll put it. 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.210
 with a grade of 17 at the most, and then 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.909
 I'm going to benchmarke without spotting and 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.839
 You will notice the fps difference. 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.030
 What do you want? 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.520
 Good, now, have charles at all in the 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.240
 maximum running about 19 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.640
 ps and me graphic is sure to be 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.190
 good cooling causes this impression 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.720
 of a chart getting very good and I took it 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.780
 that hair business in this game has 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.110
 in the hair business that in this game weighs 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.640
 then James was first and 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.650
 Now what I'm going to do I go here in 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.180
 graphical options again and I'm going to 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.210
 anti aliasing for you to see 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.920
 it is in fact the difference that makes with and without 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.220
 anti areas so let's go there before 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.530
 progress and I will take leave off 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.990
 anti aliasing and now we will pass 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.060
 The night is set again for you to see. 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.920
 the real difference difference 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.180
 so coming back here with us there looks 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.900
 45 fps surprise was now at 18 fps 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.690
 now without anti aliasing is at 45 to 40 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.090
 frames per second of average and you 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.320
 note that the chart did not reduce much 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.290
 that we do not touch the textures 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.790
 anti-aliasing effect now 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.590
 coming back here in the settings 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.190
 second is the quality of the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.770
 shadows and the smoke galley shadow stands 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.810
 extremely heavy in a game 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.610
 in most games I'll turn off the 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.650
 shadow that is leave everything in the low to 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.290
 You had a notion so much. 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.600
 prudent martin shade all in the least 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.990
 you see that it is a very high average 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.330
 between 68 and 70 frames per second and 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.340
 too much difference in the graph then too 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.380
 if you have a low video card 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.210
 you will make you what you will get where 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.730
 fact that will take the quality of 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.280
 shadows that you can already print 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.290
 very high and without taking much of the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.410
 Texture quality texture that almost 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.690
 does not weigh a video card now in 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.340
 third place I took the tc read and 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.560
 you notice that you have already won more than 10 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.630
 prizes with the second and the game stayed 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.130
 Extremely playable has no 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.170
 problem you take the third axis 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.300
 you will not have a reduction of the graph 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.470
 very strong and has improved a lot 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.150
 also 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.400
 remembering that tc leaves can only be 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.500
 used when the game has support for 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.330
 directx 11 another observation that I 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.210
 I wanted to tell you, do not touch the 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.550
 I think it's much better to play 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.990
 resolution of your native monitor and 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.450
 that's why I did not say anything about 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.370
 revolution sure resolution weighs 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.410
 But I recommend to touch these 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.570
 other settings before you move in 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.980
 resolve the resolution in the last case and 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.260
 also the galeras you have another one 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.850
 opinion puts the comments if you 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.630
 liked the video by clicking joinha sÃ£o 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.700
 favorites 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.690
 a hug until the next video all from 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.080
 good for you 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.080
