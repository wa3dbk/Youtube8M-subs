2011<00:00:32.910> they've<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:33.660> put<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> hybrid<00:00:34.320> tech

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
2011 they've now put the hybrid tech

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.459 
2011 they've now put the hybrid tech
into<00:00:34.800> their<00:00:34.950> indian<00:00:35.340> flagship<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:35.969> camry<00:00:36.540> and

into their indian flagship the camry and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.850 
into their indian flagship the camry and
it's<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.800> complex<00:00:38.250> bit<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.730> technology<00:00:39.860> so

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
it's a complex bit of technology so
