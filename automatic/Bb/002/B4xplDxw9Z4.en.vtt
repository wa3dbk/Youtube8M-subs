00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
short and I am going to let it grow to a

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.400 
short and I am going to let it grow to a
certain<00:03:44.580> length<00:03:44.760> my<00:03:45.060> first<00:03:45.510> goal<00:03:45.780> was<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:46.230> get

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
certain length my first goal was to get

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.010 
certain length my first goal was to get
to<00:03:46.440> like<00:03:47.430> waist<00:03:47.760> length<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.420> I<00:03:48.480> might<00:03:48.720> still

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
to like waist length and I might still

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.710 
to like waist length and I might still
want<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.410> get<00:03:49.590> some<00:03:49.650> left<00:03:50.190> this<00:03:50.970> time<00:03:51.300> but

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
want to get some left this time but

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.310 
want to get some left this time but
because<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.740> my<00:03:53.040> age<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.780> think<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:54.990> would<00:03:55.170> look

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
because of my age I think I would look

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.820 
because of my age I think I would look
better<00:03:55.620> with<00:03:55.770> short<00:03:56.280> hair<00:03:56.610> um<00:03:57.050> so<00:03:58.050> my<00:03:58.230> goal<00:03:58.500> is

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
better with short hair um so my goal is

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.370 
better with short hair um so my goal is
to<00:03:59.010> just<00:03:59.550> get<00:03:59.850> it<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.180> length<00:04:00.540> where<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:00.960> can

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
to just get it to length where I can

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.290 
to just get it to length where I can
keep<00:04:01.830> my<00:04:02.160> back<00:04:02.940> in<00:04:03.270> my<00:04:03.510> side<00:04:03.810> faded<00:04:04.640> but<00:04:05.640> before

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
keep my back in my side faded but before

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.960 
keep my back in my side faded but before
I<00:04:06.330> you<00:04:07.140> know<00:04:07.170> do<00:04:07.830> that<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.070> might<00:04:08.430> just<00:04:08.670> let<00:04:08.820> it

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
I you know do that I might just let it

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.620 
I you know do that I might just let it
grow<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:10.440> like<00:04:11.030> mid-back<00:04:12.030> length<00:04:12.360> or

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
grow to like mid-back length or

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.900 
grow to like mid-back length or
something<00:04:12.990> like<00:04:13.140> that<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.830> I<00:04:14.100> would<00:04:14.610> have

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
something like that so I would have

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.479 
something like that so I would have
enough<00:04:15.209> hair<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.570> work<00:04:15.930> with<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:17.070> style<00:04:17.370> that

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
enough hair to work with the style that

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.990 
enough hair to work with the style that
I<00:04:17.670> ultimately<00:04:17.880> want<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.600> have<00:04:18.840> um<00:04:19.970> but<00:04:20.970> again

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000
