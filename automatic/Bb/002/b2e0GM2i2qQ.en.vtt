down<00:00:38.489> here<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.879> south<00:00:39.120> since<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.629> moved

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
down here in the south since I moved

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.650 
down here in the south since I moved
here<00:00:39.980> used<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.579> time<00:00:41.670> you

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
here used to see this all the time you

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.650 
here used to see this all the time you
know<00:00:42.750> these<00:00:42.930> rusted<00:00:43.620> out<00:00:43.680> holes<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.480> this<00:00:45.480> one

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
know these rusted out holes and this one

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.889 
know these rusted out holes and this one
came<00:00:45.870> from<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.200> north<00:00:47.239> and<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.690> got<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
came from the north and so it's got a

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.080 
came from the north and so it's got a
pretty<00:00:48.989> good<00:00:49.350> rust<00:00:49.649> hole<00:00:49.920> there<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.789> think

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
pretty good rust hole there but I think

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.779 
pretty good rust hole there but I think
it<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.329> be<00:00:51.390> fixed<00:00:51.949> so<00:00:52.949> I'm<00:00:53.039> gonna<00:00:53.190> maybe<00:00:53.489> try

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
it can be fixed so I'm gonna maybe try

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.220 
it can be fixed so I'm gonna maybe try
to<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.210> some<00:00:54.420> sculpting<00:00:56.809> there's<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
to do some sculpting there's just a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.979 
to do some sculpting there's just a
little<00:00:58.910> scrape<00:00:59.910> right<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.840> can

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
little scrape right there that can

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.030 
little scrape right there that can
probably<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.379> buffed<00:01:01.710> off<00:01:03.589> tops<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.860> good

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
probably be buffed off tops in good

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.910 
probably be buffed off tops in good

shape no hail damage just a little bit
of<00:01:11.070> discoloring<00:01:11.640> right<00:01:11.970> there<00:01:13.580> probably<00:01:14.580> just

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
of discoloring right there probably just

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.340 
of discoloring right there probably just
shoot<00:01:15.420> some<00:01:15.659> new<00:01:15.780> paint<00:01:16.020> over<00:01:16.350> it
