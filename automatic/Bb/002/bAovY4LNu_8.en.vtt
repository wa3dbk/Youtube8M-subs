00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
that you've got a trigger just

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.070 
that you've got a trigger just
underneath<00:01:12.630> there<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.740> your<00:01:13.950> forefinger<00:01:15.080> so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
underneath there with your forefinger so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.010 
underneath there with your forefinger so
if<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:16.229> turn<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.590> around<00:01:16.680> you'll<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:18.020> bottom

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
you squeeze the trigger first clip it

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.780 
you squeeze the trigger first clip it
goes<00:01:25.530> into<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.830> test<00:01:26.070> function<00:01:26.250> you'll<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.759> a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
goes into a test function you'll get a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.510 
goes into a test function you'll get a
roll<00:01:27.030> rates<00:01:27.680> when<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.770> when<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.340> then

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
roll rates when you when you then

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.030 
roll rates when you when you then
squeeze<00:01:29.970> again<00:01:30.360> you'll<00:01:31.290> then<00:01:31.500> start<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.890> get

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
squeeze again you'll then start to get

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.370 
squeeze again you'll then start to get
your<00:01:32.159> temperature<00:01:32.579> readings<00:01:33.170> you'll<00:01:34.170> see

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
your temperature readings you'll see

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.289 
your temperature readings you'll see
they're<00:01:34.560> 19<00:01:35.720> you've<00:01:36.720> also<00:01:36.869> got<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.820> light<00:01:38.820> that

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
they're 19 you've also got a light that

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.810 
they're 19 you've also got a light that
you<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.540> illuminate<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> screen<00:01:41.009> with

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
you can illuminate the screen with

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.270 
you can illuminate the screen with
easier<00:01:42.180> reading<00:01:42.799> when<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.920> release<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
easier reading when you release the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.940 
easier reading when you release the
trigger<00:01:44.869> then<00:01:45.869> it'll<00:01:46.079> hold<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.470> temperature

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
trigger then it'll hold that temperature

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.130 
trigger then it'll hold that temperature
so<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.340> see<00:01:47.490> there<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.820> moment<00:01:48.140> 18.9

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
so we can see there at the moment 18.9

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.649 
so we can see there at the moment 18.9
the<00:01:49.350> groups<00:01:49.729> we've<00:01:50.729> squeezed<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.180> again<00:01:51.450> we

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the groups we've squeezed it again we

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.420 
the groups we've squeezed it again we
owe<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.880> get<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> different<00:01:54.270> reading

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
owe it to get a different reading

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.270 
owe it to get a different reading
soon<00:01:55.820> as<00:01:55.910> we<00:01:56.030> release<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:56.590> 9.6<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.890> then<00:01:58.130> it'll

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
soon as we release it 9.6 and then it'll

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.640 
soon as we release it 9.6 and then it'll
hold<00:01:58.520> that<00:01:58.730> temperature<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.510> give<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:00.620> a

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
hold that temperature and give you a

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.470 
hold that temperature and give you a
chance<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:01.100> breathe<00:02:01.280> okay<00:02:02.000> let<00:02:02.150> me<00:02:02.240> run<00:02:02.360> you

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
chance to breathe okay let me run you

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.580 
chance to breathe okay let me run you
through<00:02:02.510> some<00:02:02.870> of<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:02.960> more<00:02:03.140> advanced

is<00:03:11.269> in<00:03:11.720> for<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:11.959> from<00:03:12.110> moment<00:03:12.470> up<00:03:12.560> is<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.310> it

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
is in for it from moment up is that it

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.350 
is in for it from moment up is that it
has<00:03:13.549> its<00:03:13.730> own<00:03:13.850> inbuilt<00:03:14.299> laser<00:03:14.930> beam<00:03:16.239> so<00:03:17.239> I'll

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
has its own inbuilt laser beam so I'll

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.640 
has its own inbuilt laser beam so I'll
just<00:03:17.480> turn<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.720> around<00:03:17.930> on<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.290> white<00:03:18.410> hand

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
just turn that around on the white hand

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.560 
just turn that around on the white hand
there<00:03:18.799> now<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.160> see<00:03:19.400> Wallach<00:03:19.790> wasn't<00:03:20.120> treated

and<00:03:57.250> best<00:03:57.370> feature<00:03:57.730> an<00:03:57.910> infrared<00:03:58.239> thermometer

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
and best feature an infrared thermometer

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.720 
and best feature an infrared thermometer
is<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.739> never<00:03:59.890> has<00:04:00.099> to<00:04:00.129> actually<00:04:00.549> touch

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
is that it never has to actually touch

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.460 
is that it never has to actually touch
the<00:04:00.910> wax<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:01.510> there's<00:04:01.690> no<00:04:01.840> messy<00:04:02.110> cleanup

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
the wax so there's no messy cleanup
