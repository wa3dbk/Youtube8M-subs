00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.450 

I'm<00:00:05.210> just<00:00:05.990> going<00:00:06.200> to<00:00:06.230> go<00:00:06.350> ahead<00:00:06.470> and<00:00:06.589> see<00:00:07.040> this

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
I'm just going to go ahead and see this

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.420 
I'm just going to go ahead and see this
should<00:00:07.700> be<00:00:07.819> nice<00:00:08.000> and<00:00:08.029> warm<00:00:08.240> by<00:00:08.600> now<00:00:08.630> yep<00:00:09.620> good

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.430 
should be nice and warm by now yep good

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.169 
should be nice and warm by now yep good
there<00:00:10.670> so<00:00:11.510> I<00:00:11.540> have<00:00:11.840> my<00:00:12.019> lead<00:00:12.830> free<00:00:13.100> solder<00:00:13.340> my

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
there so I have my lead free solder my

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.320 
there so I have my lead free solder my
solder<00:00:14.540> iron<00:00:14.780> and<00:00:15.380> I'm<00:00:16.040> not<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:16.279> best<00:00:17.119> at

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
solder iron and I'm not the best at

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.990 
solder iron and I'm not the best at
soldering<00:00:17.750> but<00:00:18.140> not<00:00:18.650> the<00:00:18.800> worst<00:00:19.009> either<00:00:19.279> but

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
soldering but not the worst either but

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.300 
soldering but not the worst either but
basically<00:00:20.360> what<00:00:20.570> i<00:00:20.630> like<00:00:20.840> to<00:00:21.020> do<00:00:21.169> if<00:00:21.560> it's<00:00:22.160> a

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
basically what i like to do if it's a

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.030 
basically what i like to do if it's a
heavier<00:00:22.759> gauge<00:00:22.970> wire<00:00:23.329> i<00:00:23.689> usually<00:00:24.380> hold<00:00:24.829> it

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.040 
heavier gauge wire i usually hold it

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.159 
heavier gauge wire i usually hold it
against<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.090> wire<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:26.649> just<00:00:27.649> slowly<00:00:28.130> melt

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
against the wire and just slowly melt

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.380 
against the wire and just slowly melt
the<00:00:30.169> solder<00:00:30.380> into<00:00:30.860> there<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:31.040> it'll<00:00:31.300> kind<00:00:32.300> of

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
the solder into there and it'll kind of

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.010 
the solder into there and it'll kind of
blend<00:00:33.020> in<00:00:33.170> there<00:00:33.350> but<00:00:33.530> this<00:00:33.710> is<00:00:33.920> real<00:00:35.020> real

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
blend in there but this is real real

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.779 
blend in there but this is real real
tiny<00:00:36.290> wire<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:36.950> i<00:00:37.010> can't<00:00:37.309> hold<00:00:37.460> it<00:00:37.609> there<00:00:37.760> for

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
tiny wire so i can't hold it there for

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:43.989 
tiny wire so i can't hold it there for
very<00:00:38.030> long<00:00:38.359> i<00:00:42.519> see<00:00:43.519> that<00:00:43.550> one's<00:00:43.850> already

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:43.999 
very long i see that one's already

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:53.450 
very long i see that one's already
soldered<00:00:44.329> and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.049 

there<00:00:54.460> we<00:00:54.579> go<00:00:54.750> ok<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.699> those<00:00:57.820> are<00:00:58.059> good<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
there we go ok so those are good and

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.420 
there we go ok so those are good and
I'll<00:01:01.510> just<00:01:01.629> go<00:01:01.809> ahead<00:01:01.899> get<00:01:02.140> these<00:01:02.350> two<00:01:02.649> and<00:01:02.920> I

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
I'll just go ahead get these two and I

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.370 
I'll just go ahead get these two and I
did<00:01:03.670> try<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.000> zoom<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.070> camera<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:08.200> if<00:01:08.290> i

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
did try to zoom in the camera but if i

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.520 
did try to zoom in the camera but if i
zoom<00:01:08.409> it<00:01:08.710> in<00:01:08.799> too<00:01:09.369> much<00:01:09.759> it<00:01:10.690> gets<00:01:10.899> real<00:01:11.320> blurry

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
zoom it in too much it gets real blurry

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.440 
zoom it in too much it gets real blurry
so<00:01:14.530> hopefully<00:01:15.070> you<00:01:15.580> guys<00:01:15.700> can<00:01:15.820> see<00:01:16.270> this

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
so hopefully you guys can see this

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:24.149 
so hopefully you guys can see this
fairly<00:01:16.810> well<00:01:20.520> ok<00:01:21.520> I'll<00:01:21.759> that's<00:01:22.320> excuse<00:01:23.320> me<00:01:23.440> hmm

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
fairly well ok I'll that's excuse me hmm

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.469 
fairly well ok I'll that's excuse me hmm
that's<00:01:24.399> about<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:24.729> for<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:26.440> soldering<00:01:27.479> pretty

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
that's about it for the soldering pretty

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.109 
that's about it for the soldering pretty
easy<00:01:28.690> on<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:29.050> little<00:01:29.319> wires<00:01:29.500> bigger<00:01:30.340> wires<00:01:30.640> I

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
easy on the little wires bigger wires I

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.600 
easy on the little wires bigger wires I
would<00:01:31.390> just<00:01:31.539> hold<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.590> iron<00:01:32.830> on<00:01:33.100> their<00:01:33.369> order

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
would just hold the iron on their order

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.240 
would just hold the iron on their order
side<00:01:33.850> or<00:01:34.000> gone<00:01:34.149> whichever<00:01:34.569> you<00:01:34.690> had<00:01:35.130> let<00:01:36.130> it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
side or gone whichever you had let it

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.340 
side or gone whichever you had let it
heat<00:01:36.460> out<00:01:36.640> for<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.210> few<00:01:37.509> seconds<00:01:37.899> of<00:01:38.020> then<00:01:38.140> just

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
heat out for a few seconds of then just

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.940 
heat out for a few seconds of then just
slowly<00:01:38.619> try<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.690> work<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:41.259> side<00:01:41.530> or<00:01:41.710> in<00:01:41.740> there

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
slowly try to work the side or in there

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.010 
slowly try to work the side or in there
it'll<00:01:42.100> just<00:01:42.460> absorb<00:01:42.909> into<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.240> wire<00:01:43.479> so<00:01:43.810> I

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
it'll just absorb into the wire so I

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.770 
it'll just absorb into the wire so I
just<00:01:44.649> a<00:01:44.770> soldering<00:01:45.130> tip<00:01:45.369> ok<00:01:46.119> I'm<00:01:46.330> going<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.539> let

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
just a soldering tip ok I'm going to let

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.320 
just a soldering tip ok I'm going to let
that<00:01:46.810> dry<00:01:47.170> real<00:01:47.409> quick<00:01:47.649> ok<00:01:48.490> I'm<00:01:48.789> not<00:01:48.880> gonna<00:01:49.119> do

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
that dry real quick ok I'm not gonna do

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.260 
that dry real quick ok I'm not gonna do
after<00:01:50.049> I'm<00:01:50.140> done<00:01:50.319> let's<00:01:51.190> make<00:01:51.399> sure<00:01:51.429> it<00:01:51.850> lights

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
after I'm done let's make sure it lights

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.139 
after I'm done let's make sure it lights
up<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.959> does<00:01:53.380> so<00:01:54.009> that's<00:01:54.190> definitely<00:01:54.789> good

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
up it does so that's definitely good

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.429 
up it does so that's definitely good
sign<00:01:55.360> quite<00:01:56.140> shut<00:01:56.409> back<00:01:56.619> off<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:58.509> don't

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
sign quite shut back off and I don't

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.149 
sign quite shut back off and I don't
have<00:01:59.950> a<00:01:59.979> lot<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.369> room<00:02:00.700> inside<00:02:01.439> here<00:02:02.439> so<00:02:02.740> what<00:02:03.130> I

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
have a lot of room inside here so what I

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.479 
have a lot of room inside here so what I
normally<00:02:03.280> do<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:05.409> usually<00:02:05.619> wrap<00:02:06.810> one<00:02:07.810> wire

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
normally do I just usually wrap one wire

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.680 
normally do I just usually wrap one wire
with<00:02:09.489> electric<00:02:09.970> tape<00:02:11.250> because<00:02:12.250> if<00:02:12.519> you<00:02:12.730> put

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
with electric tape because if you put

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.150 
with electric tape because if you put
them<00:02:13.780> together<00:02:13.870> it's<00:02:14.500> going<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.739> short<00:02:15.010> out

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
them together it's going to short out

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.150 
them together it's going to short out
nothing's<00:02:15.670> going<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:15.850> happen<00:02:16.799> if<00:02:17.799> you<00:02:17.980> wrap

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
nothing's going to happen if you wrap

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:26.400 
nothing's going to happen if you wrap
one<00:02:18.489> of<00:02:18.609> them<00:02:18.730> up<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.790> will<00:02:22.000> get<00:02:24.870> one<00:02:25.870> nice<00:02:26.079> and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
one of them up you will get one nice and

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.050 
one of them up you will get one nice and
insulated<00:02:26.620> from<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.220> other<00:02:27.400> one<00:02:27.579> so<00:02:27.850> this

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
insulated from the other one so this

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.920 
insulated from the other one so this
should<00:02:28.390> not<00:02:28.660> short<00:02:29.230> out<00:02:29.410> at<00:02:29.530> all<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.930> normally

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
should not short out at all so normally

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.090 
should not short out at all so normally
after<00:02:32.170> then<00:02:32.440> I'm<00:02:32.590> just<00:02:32.650> going<00:02:32.799> to<00:02:32.890> go<00:02:32.950> ahead

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
after then I'm just going to go ahead

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.470 
after then I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:02:33.840> wrap<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.109> over<00:02:35.530> there<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.820> I'll<00:02:37.239> do<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
and wrap this over there and I'll do the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.080 
and wrap this over there and I'll do the
other<00:02:37.870> one<00:02:37.989> off<00:02:38.410> camera<00:02:38.799> so<00:02:39.519> now<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.850> I<00:02:39.880> have

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
other one off camera so now that I have

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.199 
other one off camera so now that I have

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
you want to melt anything so turn

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.300 
you want to melt anything so turn
good<00:02:56.190> angle<00:02:56.550> here<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:58.590> go<00:02:58.739> ahead<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:58.920> hold

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
good angle here just go ahead and hold

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.089 
good angle here just go ahead and hold
the<00:02:59.640> flame<00:03:00.590> might<00:03:01.590> be<00:03:01.709> hard<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.010> see<00:03:02.250> but<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.950> be

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
the flame might be hard to see but to be

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.440 
the flame might be hard to see but to be
able<00:03:05.129> to<00:03:05.310> see<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.580> shrinking<00:03:06.120> almost

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
able to see it shrinking almost

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:15.640 
able to see it shrinking almost
immediately<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.730> it'll<00:03:08.730> be<00:03:08.910> real<00:03:09.239> tight

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.430 

Isley<00:03:16.650> hold<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:16.980> about<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.310> good<00:03:18.180> inch<00:03:18.840> two

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
Isley hold it about a good inch two

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.350 
Isley hold it about a good inch two
inches<00:03:19.470> away<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:21.769> just<00:03:22.769> make<00:03:23.069> sure<00:03:26.360> it's

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
inches away and just make sure it's

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.390 
inches away and just make sure it's
a<00:03:27.450> little<00:03:27.569> more<00:03:27.780> but<00:03:28.080> that's<00:03:28.200> right<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.099> once

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
a little more but that's right so once

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.880 
a little more but that's right so once
once<00:03:29.849> again<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.150> would<00:03:30.390> like<00:03:30.569> to<00:03:30.599> just<00:03:30.720> turn<00:03:31.709> it

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
once again I would like to just turn it

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.300 
once again I would like to just turn it
on<00:03:32.510> where's<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.660> sensor<00:03:34.049> it<00:03:34.200> there<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.590> go<00:03:34.709> so

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
on where's the sensor it there we go so

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.339 
on where's the sensor it there we go so
now<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.610> works<00:03:35.849> that's<00:03:36.150> great<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.110> I'm<00:03:37.200> just

room okay so um have both ends done and
went<00:03:43.079> ahead<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.530> checked<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:44.880> works

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810

I've<00:03:57.510> been<00:03:57.569> using<00:03:57.989> these<00:03:58.950> glass<00:03:59.280> jars<00:03:59.959> ibex<00:04:00.959> a

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
I've been using these glass jars ibex a

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.789 
I've been using these glass jars ibex a
hand<00:04:01.260> for<00:04:01.410> quite<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.650> few<00:04:01.739> years<00:04:01.920> I<00:04:03.590> thought<00:04:04.590> I'd

hand for quite a few years I thought I'd

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.830 
hand for quite a few years I thought I'd
make<00:04:05.010> millions<00:04:05.310> making<00:04:05.880> candles<00:04:06.269> but<00:04:06.600> that

leftover<00:04:09.630> bottles<00:04:10.019> have<00:04:10.500> these<00:04:10.829> and<00:04:11.989> a<00:04:12.989> lot<00:04:13.500> of

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
leftover bottles have these and a lot of

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.330 
leftover bottles have these and a lot of

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
have the single solar light that would

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.690 
have the single solar light that would
be<00:04:21.900> like<00:04:22.229> two<00:04:22.919> or<00:04:23.160> three<00:04:23.190> dollars<00:04:23.550> at<00:04:23.940> Walmart

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
these little jars i got from ikea as you

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.310 
these little jars i got from ikea as you
can<00:04:36.270> see<00:04:36.539> but<00:04:36.780> these<00:04:36.900> are<00:04:37.050> a<00:04:37.080> little<00:04:37.139> more

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
can see but these are a little more

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.020 
can see but these are a little more
complicated<00:04:37.740> there's<00:04:38.160> four<00:04:38.430> wires<00:04:38.700> and

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
complicated there's four wires and

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.159 
complicated there's four wires and
they're<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:40.110> lot<00:04:40.229> more<00:04:41.690> soldering<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.870> do<00:04:42.990> and

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
they're a lot more soldering to do and

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.839 
they're a lot more soldering to do and
stuff<00:04:43.380> so<00:04:44.130> anyway<00:04:45.020> i'm<00:04:46.020> going<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.229> go<00:04:46.349> ahead

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
stuff so anyway i'm going to go ahead

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.430 
stuff so anyway i'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:47.849> use<00:04:48.300> this<00:04:48.510> jar<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.139> this<00:04:50.130> guy<00:04:50.340> is<00:04:51.410> quite<00:04:52.410> a

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
and use this jar and this guy is quite a

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.010 
and use this jar and this guy is quite a
bit<00:04:52.650> bigger<00:04:52.950> than<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:53.729> other<00:04:54.419> ones<00:04:54.720> that<00:04:54.930> i've

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
bit bigger than the other ones that i've

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.460 
bit bigger than the other ones that i've
been<00:04:55.050> using<00:04:55.849> which<00:04:56.849> let<00:04:57.150> me<00:04:57.270> just<00:04:57.450> show<00:04:57.690> you

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.180 

this<00:05:01.470> is<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.889> one<00:05:02.099> from<00:05:03.409> walgreens<00:05:04.409> quite<00:05:05.159> a

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
this is the one from walgreens quite a

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.860 
this is the one from walgreens quite a
bit<00:05:05.370> smaller

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
bit smaller

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.960 
bit smaller
so<00:05:07.870> I'm<00:05:08.050> going<00:05:08.200> to<00:05:08.230> have<00:05:08.410> to<00:05:08.460> do<00:05:09.460> a<00:05:09.490> little<00:05:09.790> more

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
so I'm going to have to do a little more

little sister okay so I very carefully
went<00:05:31.420> and<00:05:31.660> cut<00:05:32.020> around<00:05:32.170> and<00:05:33.210> a<00:05:34.210> couple<00:05:34.930> reasons

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
went and cut around and a couple reasons

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.770 
went and cut around and a couple reasons
to<00:05:35.380> be<00:05:35.470> careful<00:05:35.890> one<00:05:36.070> nice<00:05:36.850> and<00:05:37.090> slow<00:05:37.390> so<00:05:37.420> it

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
to be careful one nice and slow so it

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.830 
to be careful one nice and slow so it
doesn't<00:05:38.170> skip<00:05:39.100> and<00:05:39.430> you<00:05:39.970> know<00:05:40.090> cut<00:05:40.330> your<00:05:40.480> hands

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
doesn't skip and you know cut your hands

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.620 
doesn't skip and you know cut your hands
or<00:05:40.960> anything<00:05:41.050> and<00:05:41.590> this<00:05:42.310> is<00:05:42.490> just<00:05:42.640> plastic<00:05:43.330> so

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
or anything and this is just plastic so

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.320 
or anything and this is just plastic so
it<00:05:43.840> breaks<00:05:44.200> kind<00:05:44.560> of<00:05:44.650> easy<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:45.400> another

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
it breaks kind of easy and another

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.780 
it breaks kind of easy and another
reason<00:05:46.710> you<00:05:47.710> have<00:05:47.800> to<00:05:47.920> hang<00:05:48.130> on<00:05:48.250> to<00:05:48.400> it<00:05:48.550> nice

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
reason you have to hang on to it nice

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.100 
reason you have to hang on to it nice
and<00:05:49.060> care<00:05:49.240> for<00:05:49.420> all<00:05:49.480> the<00:05:49.600> way<00:05:49.690> I<00:05:49.720> just<00:05:49.900> start

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
and care for all the way I just start

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
and care for all the way I just start
ripping<00:05:50.290> out<00:05:50.620> your<00:05:50.890> wires<00:05:51.580> then<00:05:52.000> just<00:05:52.270> have<00:05:52.480> to

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
ripping out your wires then just have to

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.680 
ripping out your wires then just have to
start<00:05:54.130> soldering<00:05:54.460> again<00:05:55.030> so<00:05:55.240> this<00:05:55.450> is<00:05:55.660> a

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
start soldering again so this is a

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.320 
start soldering again so this is a
definitely<00:05:56.140> safer<00:05:56.950> I<00:05:57.220> just<00:05:57.820> take<00:05:58.000> your<00:05:58.120> time

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
definitely safer I just take your time

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.510 
definitely safer I just take your time
when<00:05:58.570> you're<00:05:58.690> doing<00:05:58.990> it<00:05:59.140> so<00:05:59.770> okay<00:06:00.250> let<00:06:00.430> me
