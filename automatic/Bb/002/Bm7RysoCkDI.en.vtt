00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
like is rip rip through and the same

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.819 
like is rip rip through and the same
thing<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> other<00:00:58.020> end<00:00:58.289> too

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
thing on the other end too

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.590 
thing on the other end too
there's<00:00:59.699> rips<00:00:59.910> through<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.300> we're<00:01:00.449> going<00:01:00.539> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
there's rips through so we're going to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.470 
there's rips through so we're going to
do<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.899> probably<00:01:01.760> give<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.940> little<00:01:03.090> spray

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
do is probably give it a little spray

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.600 
do is probably give it a little spray
and<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:03.780> let<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.049> sit<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.470> while<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.949> guess

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and then let it sit for a while so guess

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.230 
and then let it sit for a while so guess
what<00:01:06.479> Fred<00:01:06.689> does<00:01:07.610> those<00:01:08.610> nuts<00:01:08.909> are<00:01:09.000> going<00:01:09.150> to

washers<00:03:40.350> they're<00:03:41.250> just<00:03:41.459> wide<00:03:41.640> enough<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.350> that

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
washers they're just wide enough so that

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.160 
washers they're just wide enough so that
when<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.500> place<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:44.270> on<00:03:45.270> top<00:03:45.570> it<00:03:45.840> would<00:03:45.959> give<00:03:46.080> me

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
when I place the on top it would give me

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.500 
when I place the on top it would give me
enough<00:03:46.380> material<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:46.890> hold<00:03:47.070> down<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:48.330> heat

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
enough material to hold down the heat

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.240 
enough material to hold down the heat
shield<00:03:48.780> because<00:03:49.140> what<00:03:49.320> it's<00:03:49.470> happened<00:03:49.860> is

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.830 

it's<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.730> heat<00:03:53.910> part<00:03:54.360> of<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.480> heat<00:03:54.570> shields

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
it's the heat part of the heat shields

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.980 
it's the heat part of the heat shields
rip<00:03:55.080> or<00:03:55.320> rip<00:03:56.130> past<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:57.240> nut<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:57.690> there's<00:03:57.900> not

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
rip or rip past the nut so there's not

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.680 
rip or rip past the nut so there's not
enough<00:03:58.230> anything<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:59.580> hold<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.880> back<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.390> this

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
enough anything to hold it back so this

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.990 
enough anything to hold it back so this
look<00:04:00.840> at<00:04:00.930> male<00:04:01.020> enough<00:04:01.760> should<00:04:02.760> be<00:04:02.820> wide

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
look at male enough should be wide
