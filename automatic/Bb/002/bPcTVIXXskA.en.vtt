i'm sure rich does it normally do that
with<00:03:48.590> his<00:03:48.769> board<00:03:49.009> games<00:03:49.280> but<00:03:50.239> some<00:03:51.019> people<00:03:51.290> are

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
with his board games but some people are

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.589 
with his board games but some people are
less<00:03:51.620> careful<00:03:51.889> about<00:03:52.159> that<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.639> it<00:03:52.819> kind<00:03:53.449> of

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
less careful about that and it kind of

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.080 
less careful about that and it kind of
you<00:03:54.139> know<00:03:54.169> triggers<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:54.769> reaction<00:03:54.949> in<00:03:55.489> other
