00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.140
 i 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.260
 hi i am anabel fernandez 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.880
 dietician-nutritionist of feeds and today 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.890
 I want to answer a question that we 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.380
 Álvaro Rodrigo has done it through the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.390
 web running point is to talk or we 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.310
 comments that the week of the competition 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.200
 as normal except the last three 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.780
 days in which they consume more carbohydrates 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.100
 carbon but he asks us what can be done 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.539
 see that there is one before the 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.189
 competition sometimes feels 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.410
 heavy 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.140
 pre-race feeding 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.050
 I should do as Álvaro says 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.489
 carbohydrate rich food this 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.469
 will help us increase our 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.379
 muscle energy store that is 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.360
 our glycogen reserves therefore 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.040
 during the two or three days before the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.079
 race the right thing is to make a diet 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.870
 of carbohydrate overload is 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.280
 say a diet that contains 9 to 12 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.190
 grams of carbohydrates per 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.719
 kilogram of weight on the other hand the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.629
 fact that breakfast is for us 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.280
 heavy can be for several reasons 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.929
 one side you may not be leaving the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.720
 enough time from breakfast 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:12.550
 until the competition what should be 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.320
 adequate would be about two or three hours 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.300
 you also have to assess your tolerance 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.710
 to certain foods since there are 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.150
 athletes who do not have any 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.070
 problem in taking foods like 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.800
 milk and others who find it difficult to digest 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.030
 until a yogurt the best thing is that you do 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.090
 breakfast tests during 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.800
 training to know what you tolerate better 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.720
 finally think that breakfast has 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.700
 to be rich in carbohydrates and easy to 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.760
 digest so it should be low in 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.350
 fiber and fat proteins is therefore 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.300
 adequate to avoid foods such as 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.850
 cereals or whole wheat bread or 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.860
 sausages or pastries if all 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.800
 ways you can not solve your case 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.740

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.660
