00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.510 
I used a acid yellow Copic marker as a
base<00:01:45.299> color<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.590> used<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> sand<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
base color and I used the sand and the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
base color and I used the sand and the
dark<00:01:47.850> brown<00:01:48.030> Copic<00:01:48.479> marker<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.869> add<00:01:49.020> some

dark brown Copic marker to add some
extra<00:01:49.439> details<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.070> those<00:01:50.220> areas<00:01:50.430> along<00:01:51.390> with

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
extra details to those areas along with

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.380 
extra details to those areas along with
a<00:01:51.869> brown<00:01:52.409> prismacolor<00:01:53.070> pencil<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.820> bring<00:01:54.270> out

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
a brown prismacolor pencil to bring out

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.929 
a brown prismacolor pencil to bring out
a<00:01:54.420> few<00:01:54.540> more<00:01:54.840> details<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.590> some<00:01:56.189> as<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.610> few

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
a few more details like some as a few

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.389 
a few more details like some as a few
cracks<00:01:57.240> around<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.750> edges<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:59.100> think<00:01:59.310> that

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
cracks around the edges and I think that

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.060 
cracks around the edges and I think that
gave<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> very<00:01:59.820> cool<00:01:59.969> effects<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:01.500> area<00:02:01.920> of

white<00:02:13.379> pen<00:02:13.620> around<00:02:14.040> some<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.430> outlines<00:02:14.790> to

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
white pen around some of the outlines to

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.300 
white pen around some of the outlines to
make<00:02:15.569> spyro<00:02:15.930> stand<00:02:16.379> out<00:02:16.560> from<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.769> page<00:02:17.010> and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
make spyro stand out from the page and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.880 
make spyro stand out from the page and
finally<00:02:18.209> for<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.599> red<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:19.019> Spyros<00:02:19.440> wings<00:02:19.680> I

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
finally for the red of Spyros wings I

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.369 
finally for the red of Spyros wings I
used<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.220> cadmium<00:02:20.700> red<00:02:21.080> along<00:02:22.080> with<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
used a cadmium red along with the

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.039 
used a cadmium red along with the

Cardinal Pope marker for the outlining

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.030 
Cardinal Pope marker for the outlining
overall<00:02:25.049> I<00:02:25.080> think<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.440> drawing<00:02:25.620> turned<00:02:25.950> out

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
overall I think this drawing turned out

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.009 
overall I think this drawing turned out
to<00:02:26.159> be<00:02:26.250> much<00:02:26.790> different<00:02:27.209> from<00:02:27.420> my<00:02:27.810> previous

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
to be much different from my previous

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.830 
to be much different from my previous
fan<00:02:28.620> art<00:02:28.769> fighting<00:02:29.069> videos<00:02:29.310> because<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.390> spent

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840

a<00:02:30.900> lot<00:02:31.019> more<00:02:31.049> time<00:02:31.200> using<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.709> prismacolor

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
a lot more time using the prismacolor

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.309 
a lot more time using the prismacolor
