we<00:00:02.129> took<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.399> original<00:00:02.520> concept<00:00:03.270> from<00:00:03.570> the

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
we took the original concept from the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.599 
we took the original concept from the
pioneers<00:00:04.560> who<00:00:04.770> lived<00:00:04.950> in<00:00:05.040> Appalachian

Mountains<00:00:06.000> they<00:00:06.629> lived<00:00:07.319> on<00:00:07.470> subsistence

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
Mountains they lived on subsistence

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.950 
Mountains they lived on subsistence
farms<00:00:08.460> that<00:00:08.639> had<00:00:08.820> buildings<00:00:09.269> around<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.809> main

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
farms that had buildings around the main

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.690 
farms that had buildings around the main
house<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.559> supported<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.040> main<00:00:11.250> farmhouse

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
house that supported the main farmhouse

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.249 
house that supported the main farmhouse
those<00:00:12.360> buildings<00:00:12.750> were<00:00:12.870> things<00:00:13.049> like<00:00:13.139> smoke

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
those buildings were things like smoke

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.560 
those buildings were things like smoke
houses<00:00:13.620> barns<00:00:14.070> things<00:00:14.580> like<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.360> took

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
houses barns things like that we took

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.939 
houses barns things like that we took
the<00:00:15.750> idea<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.379> made<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.680> into<00:00:16.830> our

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the idea and made it into our

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.230 
the idea and made it into our
outbuilding<00:00:17.460> modules<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.090> those

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
outbuilding modules and those

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.540 
outbuilding modules and those
outbuildings<00:00:18.900> create<00:00:19.289> energy<00:00:19.650> which<00:00:20.340> now

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
outbuildings create energy which now

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.790 
outbuildings create energy which now

power the main home the concept has been

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.830 
power the main home the concept has been

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
design of this home you can see this

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.210 
design of this home you can see this
within<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.840> massing<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> house<00:00:28.859> it's

within the massing of the house it's

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.420 
within the massing of the house it's

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
essentially a compound of buildings it

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.100 
essentially a compound of buildings it
can<00:00:32.579> also<00:00:32.700> be<00:00:32.820> seen<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.180> all<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> materials

can also be seen in all the materials

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.930 
can also be seen in all the materials
that<00:00:34.200> we've<00:00:34.440> used<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:34.980> well<00:00:35.160> as<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.460> detailing

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
of the home and the overall experience I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.549 
of the home and the overall experience I
think<00:00:38.700> reinforces<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.809> notion<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.350> home

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
think reinforces this notion of home

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
facial canopy it's something that you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.490 
facial canopy it's something that you
experience<00:01:24.509> from<00:01:24.720> underneath<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> also

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
experience from underneath but it also

experience from underneath but it also
produces<00:01:25.950> energy<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.880> solar<00:01:27.090> thermal

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
produces energy the solar thermal

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.080 
produces energy the solar thermal
skylight<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.290> located<00:01:29.189> right<00:01:29.310> over<00:01:29.369> our<00:01:29.640> core

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
skylight is located right over our core

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.780 
skylight is located right over our core
so<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.630> our<00:01:30.750> hot<00:01:30.960> waters<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.790> created

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
so that all our hot waters is created

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.249 
so that all our hot waters is created
right<00:01:32.970> above<00:01:33.299> where<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.720> need<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.020> which<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
right above where we need it which is

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.800 
right above where we need it which is
our<00:01:34.380> bathroom<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.920> our<00:01:35.040> kitchen<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:36.060> actually

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
our bathroom in our kitchen we actually

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.539 
our bathroom in our kitchen we actually
let<00:01:36.960> light<00:01:37.229> through<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.740> skylight<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.430> that

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
let light through that skylight so that

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.010 
let light through that skylight so that
we<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.670> natural<00:01:39.240> light<00:01:39.390> coming<00:01:39.420> into<00:01:39.840> our

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
we have natural light coming into our

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.870

home we wanted to make something for the

to<00:02:04.280> be<00:02:04.399> able<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.729> build<00:02:04.940> part<00:02:05.390> of<00:02:05.479> that<00:02:05.600> is

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
to be able to build part of that is

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.389 
to be able to build part of that is
because<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:06.200> goes<00:02:06.350> back<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.710> same<00:02:06.830> concept

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
because it goes back to the same concept

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.309 
because it goes back to the same concept
of<00:02:07.520> homesteading<00:02:07.970> they<00:02:08.929> would<00:02:09.110> have<00:02:09.200> built

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
of homesteading they would have built

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.330 
of homesteading they would have built
things<00:02:09.530> out<00:02:09.739> of<00:02:09.860> what<00:02:09.979> they<00:02:10.100> had<00:02:10.220> available

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
things out of what they had available

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.309 
things out of what they had available
out<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.000> technologies<00:02:11.900> that<00:02:12.020> they<00:02:12.170> already

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
out of technologies that they already

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.750 
out of technologies that they already
knew<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:12.920> one<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.220> ways<00:02:13.250> we<00:02:13.489> dealt<00:02:13.610> with

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
knew so one of the ways we dealt with

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.309 
knew so one of the ways we dealt with
that<00:02:13.880> was<00:02:14.060> doing<00:02:14.510> stark<00:02:14.780> extreme<00:02:15.080> craving

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
that was doing stark extreme craving

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.260 
that was doing stark extreme craving
which<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.860> really<00:02:16.190> great<00:02:16.459> way<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.819> increase

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
which is a really great way to increase

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.210 
which is a really great way to increase
your<00:02:17.360> our<00:02:17.630> value<00:02:17.989> but<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.290> also<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.709> way<00:02:19.040> that

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
your our value but it's also a way that

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.190 
your our value but it's also a way that
anybody<00:02:19.430> can<00:02:19.760> build<00:02:19.940> at<00:02:20.060> home<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.510> close<00:02:20.930> the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
anybody can build at home to close the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.500 
anybody can build at home to close the

thermal envelope we used rigid

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.809 
thermal envelope we used rigid
insulation<00:02:23.810> on<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.319> exterior<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.430> give<00:02:25.580> us<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
insulation on the exterior to give us a

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.690 
insulation on the exterior to give us a
nice<00:02:26.090> tight<00:02:26.870> thermal<00:02:27.380> we<00:02:28.100> really<00:02:28.370> wanted<00:02:28.640> to

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
nice tight thermal we really wanted to

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.400 
nice tight thermal we really wanted to
have<00:02:28.880> at<00:02:29.000> least<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.330> two<00:02:29.480> bedroom<00:02:29.780> house<00:02:30.019> we

feel felt like a one bedroom house is
not<00:02:32.180> realistic<00:02:32.660> for<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.870> way<00:02:33.019> Americans<00:02:33.500> live

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
not realistic for the way Americans live

not realistic for the way Americans live
that's<00:02:33.980> more<00:02:34.160> like<00:02:34.280> an<00:02:34.400> apartment<00:02:34.670> not<00:02:35.030> a

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
that's more like an apartment not a
