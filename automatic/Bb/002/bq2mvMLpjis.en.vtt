00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
very few gonna give them that study in

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.069 
very few gonna give them that study in
this<00:03:10.129> room<00:03:10.340> update<00:03:10.819> it'll<00:03:11.420> basically<00:03:11.569> make<00:03:12.049> it

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
this room update it'll basically make it

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.380 
this room update it'll basically make it
so<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.409> can't<00:03:12.680> move<00:03:12.920> but<00:03:13.760> there<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.150> many

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
so you can't move but there is many

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.119 
so you can't move but there is many
weapons<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:15.110> people<00:03:15.590> have<00:03:15.680> tried<00:03:15.950> to

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
weapons that people have tried to

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.400 
weapons that people have tried to
attempt<00:03:16.610> do<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:17.599> get<00:03:17.750> out<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:18.049> that<00:03:18.140> maze

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
attempt do to get out of that maze

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:30.000 
attempt do to get out of that maze
because<00:03:19.129> they<00:03:19.549> can't<00:03:19.790> middle<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.450> think

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:46.960 

also<00:03:31.010> make<00:03:31.549> sure<00:03:45.340> make<00:03:46.340> sure<00:03:46.370> you<00:03:46.609> get<00:03:46.790> that

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
also make sure make sure you get that

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.620 
also make sure make sure you get that
across

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630
