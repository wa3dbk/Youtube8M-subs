00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
to an antenna right here I have the car

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.040 
to an antenna right here I have the car
acting<00:00:25.260> as<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> ground<00:00:25.740> plane<00:00:26.099> I'm<00:00:26.550> doing<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
acting as a ground plane I'm doing the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.169 
acting as a ground plane I'm doing the
tests<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.859> see<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.310> get<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:29.609> actual

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
over-the-air reception and I found that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.979 
over-the-air reception and I found that
I<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.450> get<00:00:33.870> now<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.540> what<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:36.840> call

know<00:00:58.050> why<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> can't<00:00:58.680> figure<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.980> out<00:00:59.129> because

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
know why I can't figure that out because

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.970 
know why I can't figure that out because
I<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> didn't<00:01:00.600> think<00:01:00.719> was<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> more

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
connector for this this has got a very

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.820 
connector for this this has got a very
unusual<00:02:39.250> it's<00:02:39.970> called<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.510> instead<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.530> I

unusual it's called it a instead of I
want<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.430> say<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:42.580> BMX<00:02:43.150> connector<00:02:43.750> it's<00:02:44.140> that's

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
want to say a BMX connector it's that's

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.280 
want to say a BMX connector it's that's
not<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.709> word<00:02:44.860> for<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.250> I<00:02:45.840> have<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.930> I'll<00:02:47.170> have

not the word for it I have to I'll have

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.720 
not the word for it I have to I'll have
to<00:02:47.410> look<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.650> up<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:47.890> print<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.220> in<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.340> other

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
to look it up and print it in the other

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.490 
to look it up and print it in the other
thing<00:02:48.940> later<00:02:49.150> but<00:02:49.690> it's<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.870> very<00:02:50.049> small

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
thing later but it's a very small

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.979 
thing later but it's a very small
connector<00:02:51.130> an<00:02:51.250> RF<00:02:51.549> connector<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.239> I<00:02:52.720> was<00:02:52.870> able

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
connector an RF connector and I was able

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.970 
connector an RF connector and I was able
to<00:02:53.140> take<00:02:53.440> apart<00:02:53.799> a<00:02:54.069> an<00:02:54.940> old<00:02:55.209> junked<00:02:56.140> XM<00:02:56.620> radio

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
to take apart a an old junked XM radio

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.690 
to take apart a an old junked XM radio
satellite<00:02:58.319> dock<00:02:59.319> station<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.100> get<00:03:00.580> the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
satellite dock station and get the

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.610 
satellite dock station and get the
little<00:03:00.940> fitting<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:01.690> I<00:03:01.810> needed<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.290> then

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
little fitting that I needed and then

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.120 
little fitting that I needed and then
make<00:03:03.340> an<00:03:03.519> RF<00:03:04.180> connector<00:03:04.660> for<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.410> connect

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
make an RF connector for it to connect

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.220 
make an RF connector for it to connect
to<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.340> little<00:03:06.850> sticky<00:03:07.510> antenna<00:03:07.900> that's<00:03:08.110> up

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230

the best pictures I've seen yet and

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.670 
the best pictures I've seen yet and
again<00:03:53.200> that's<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.650> RCA<00:03:54.370> DHT<00:03:55.090> 2:35<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:56.109> it's

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
again that's the RCA DHT 2:35 a it's

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.410 
again that's the RCA DHT 2:35 a it's
according<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.250> rca's<00:03:57.609> website<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.209> course

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
according to rca's website of course

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.300 
according to rca's website of course
it's<00:03:58.630> discontinued<00:03:59.319> like<00:03:59.530> RCA<00:03:59.890> does<00:04:00.130> with

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
it's discontinued like RCA does with

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.490 
it's discontinued like RCA does with
everything<00:04:00.730> they<00:04:01.060> make<00:04:01.380> discontinued<00:04:02.380> it

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
everything they make discontinued it

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.960 
everything they make discontinued it
when<00:04:02.590> they<00:04:02.709> come<00:04:02.859> up<00:04:02.980> with<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.130> good<00:04:03.340> product<00:04:03.609> I

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
when they come up with a good product I

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.490 
when they come up with a good product I
think<00:04:04.239> they're<00:04:04.389> tied<00:04:04.630> in<00:04:04.750> with<00:04:04.780> RadioShack

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
think they're tied in with RadioShack

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.470 
think they're tied in with RadioShack
somehow<00:04:05.920> because<00:04:06.639> they<00:04:06.760> do<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:07.030> same<00:04:07.209> thing

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
somehow because they do the same thing

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.240 
somehow because they do the same thing
but<00:04:07.840> anyway<00:04:07.959> pick<00:04:08.560> one<00:04:08.680> up<00:04:08.799> if<00:04:08.920> you<00:04:08.980> get<00:04:09.100> one

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
but anyway pick one up if you get one

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.830 
but anyway pick one up if you get one
cheap<00:04:09.489> if<00:04:09.700> you're<00:04:10.000> in<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.120> city<00:04:10.329> area<00:04:10.660> they'll

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
cheap if you're in a city area they'll

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.240 
cheap if you're in a city area they'll
be<00:04:10.930> great<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.620> matter<00:04:11.799> of<00:04:11.829> fact<00:04:11.920> in<00:04:12.190> the

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
be great and a matter of fact in the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.030 
be great and a matter of fact in the
city<00:04:12.459> location<00:04:13.090> I<00:04:13.239> know<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.810> ion<00:04:14.139> if<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:14.830> get

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
city location I know the ion if I get

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.599 
city location I know the ion if I get
closer<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.610> transmitter<00:04:16.150> like

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
closer to the transmitter like

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.369 
closer to the transmitter like
the<00:04:16.759> car<00:04:16.939> down<00:04:17.150> there<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.359> can<00:04:17.629> carry<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.079> TV

00:04:18.369 --> 00:04:18.379 
the car down there I can carry the TV

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:19.899 
the car down there I can carry the TV
around<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:18.739> still<00:04:18.949> maintain<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.340> signal<00:04:19.819> the

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:19.909 
around and still maintain the signal the

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:21.909 
around and still maintain the signal the
buffering<00:04:20.389> is<00:04:20.810> strong<00:04:21.229> enough<00:04:21.469> where<00:04:21.829> it

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
buffering is strong enough where it

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.369 
buffering is strong enough where it
keeps<00:04:22.159> the<00:04:22.400> signal<00:04:22.759> without<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:24.080> you<00:04:24.169> can

00:04:24.369 --> 00:04:24.379 
keeps the signal without so you can

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:28.120 
keeps the signal without so you can
carry<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.830> around<00:04:24.860> anyway<00:04:25.759> that's<00:04:25.969> it
