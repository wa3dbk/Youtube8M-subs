00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
up the all of the ingredients together

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.050 
up the all of the ingredients together
and<00:03:32.200> really<00:03:32.769> it<00:03:32.889> just<00:03:32.950> gives<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.489> such<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.790> nice

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060

and really it just gives it such a nice
taste<00:03:34.450> once<00:03:34.780> you've<00:03:34.989> cooked<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.379> so<00:03:36.010> then<00:03:36.190> into

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
your months then you divide this up into

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.099 
your months then you divide this up into
patties<00:03:39.190> which<00:03:39.730> we<00:03:39.909> have<00:03:40.090> here<00:03:40.329> every<00:03:40.780> gonna
