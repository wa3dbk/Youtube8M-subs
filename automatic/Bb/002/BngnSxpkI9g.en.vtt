00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
everything is pretty much the same

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.490 
everything is pretty much the same
except<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:34.400> second<00:02:34.850> pre-chorus<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.630> slightly

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
except the second pre-chorus is slightly

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.230 
except the second pre-chorus is slightly
different<00:02:36.800> than<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.010> first<00:02:37.040> one<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:37.700> the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
different than the first one and the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.090 
different than the first one and the
only<00:02:38.420> difference<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.140> instead<00:02:39.980> of

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
only difference is is that instead of

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.240 
only difference is is that instead of
going<00:02:40.310> one<00:02:40.520> three<00:02:40.880> five<00:02:41.120> eight<00:02:41.450> one<00:02:41.780> three<00:02:42.350> the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
going one three five eight one three the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.740 
going one three five eight one three the
second<00:02:43.640> pre-chorus<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.240> going<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.480> repeat

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
second pre-chorus is going to repeat

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.210 
second pre-chorus is going to repeat
that<00:02:44.780> first<00:02:45.140> part<00:02:45.410> twice<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.070> going<00:02:46.160> to

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
that first part twice so it's going to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.820 
that first part twice so it's going to
go<00:02:46.340> one<00:02:46.580> three<00:02:47.000> five<00:02:47.270> eight<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.750> then<00:02:48.530> one

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
go one three five eight and then one

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.100 
go one three five eight and then one
three<00:02:49.070> five<00:02:49.460> eight<00:02:49.780> okay<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:50.900> that's<00:02:51.020> the

only<00:02:51.290> way<00:02:51.440> it's<00:02:51.590> different<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.100> then<00:02:52.220> at<00:02:52.400> the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
only way it's different and then at the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.830 
only way it's different and then at the
end<00:02:52.640> of<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.790> song<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.120> hear<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.360> bridge<00:02:53.570> come

end of the song you hear the bridge come
in<00:02:53.990> this<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.770> also<00:02:54.920> really<00:02:55.130> simple<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.850> chords

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
in this is also really simple the chords

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.410 
in this is also really simple the chords
are<00:02:56.360> going<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.540> go<00:02:56.660> 1<00:02:56.960> 3<00:02:57.820> 5<00:02:58.820> 7<00:02:59.920> 8<00:03:00.920> open<00:03:01.880> and

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
that's the first part of the bridge so

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:14.140 
that's the first part of the bridge so
the<00:03:04.160> first<00:03:04.340> part<00:03:04.430> we<00:03:04.550> like<00:03:04.670> this

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.330 

so<00:03:15.110> you<00:03:15.200> play<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.379> one<00:03:15.620> in<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.830> three<00:03:16.069> for<00:03:16.310> a

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.520 

okay<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.510> then<00:03:30.599> after<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.110> second<00:03:31.409> part
