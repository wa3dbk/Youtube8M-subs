00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.810
 you still have the idea of ​​going north truth 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.330
 I do not want to leave you alone to fa but something 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.820
 it tells me that my destiny is in the other 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:27.020
 side before 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:31.220
 little corner full of happiness because 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:35.060
 you had 15 like this to have a future you 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.010
 it's always been very poor 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.770
 And I got tired of so many injustices 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.290
 that I lived how my people changed 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.290
 the only thing that does not change that is food 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:54.340
 in the foundation carolina 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.680
 Let me tell you where I'm going or 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.370
 banks of a meadow and near a 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.930
 spring 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.460
 where a lot of people are good here I'll be 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.850
 so that's all they know 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.560
 from the stranger this is not a stranger to 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.320
 those peeled out of here no more than the work 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.690
 they occupy the other side and you already know a 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.200
 typical story but you've always been 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:25.610
 you in my mind 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:28.070
 but what has happened many things with 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.560
 the world is almost support of the whole city 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.740
 a pier is lent to high 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.740
 interest 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:42.240
 of paying off the debt so that I can say 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.500
 nothing interests me if you do not pay on time 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.440
 It comes the Czech and gets you out to hell 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.440
 of your lands 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.690
 I hope that with this it is clear that 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.690
 against the world nobody plays ha ha ha 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.440
 present here as if nothing our 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.130
 cars and feet on the desk 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.480
 and that you come to give a horse 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.500
 let's say it's our way of giving it 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.450
 welcome here to walk 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.690
 and why do not they do something in alberti 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:16.069
 carmen because he fucks more in something I 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:20.599
 I will explain why I do not have anything 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.999
 we are already afraid and well threatened if 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.849
 they talk they take away a little bit that they have 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.920
 they are afraid while I do not have a 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.530
 only complaint I can not do anything in 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.480
 against him 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.330
 over there in a stranger who has me a 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.410
 little restless I think it's the smallest 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.760
 of the gonzález if they remember it 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.140
 Of course the old Gonzalez if I bought him 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.189
 several of the hectares that have a 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.620
 culture 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:51.090
 thank you truth of the purchases of the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.579
 snatch them like everyone else 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.280
 singers as the question has been 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.489
 from now on they are mine I have noticed 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.719
 that there are many injustices in a town 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.719
 cast 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.250
 but cousin 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.100
 it is better to see that on the other side and as 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.459
 nothing happened we did not open things are not 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.110
 well as Zapata said the land is of 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.150
 who works why not 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.840

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.050
 that does not exist here anymore 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.989
 it's time to do something, there's only 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.500
 that motivate the people you will do again 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:35.320

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.820

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.620
 I promise the power of God makes a 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.650
 new mountain 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.349
 you have no idea of ​​the person who 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.379
 blanket me , every month of 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.540
 deposit a large sum of money to 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.920

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.230

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.580

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.459

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.670
 happens to those who denounce me 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.469

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.469

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.060
