I<00:02:58.380> think<00:02:58.680> they<00:02:58.769> still<00:02:59.069> do<00:02:59.310> have<00:02:59.549> them<00:02:59.790> it<00:03:00.540> comes

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
I think they still do have them it comes

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.360 
I think they still do have them it comes
in<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.989> memory<00:03:01.260> card<00:03:01.470> but<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.709> memory<00:03:01.950> cards<00:03:02.220> it

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
in a memory card but the memory cards it

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:18.140 
in a memory card but the memory cards it
by<00:03:02.940> itself<00:03:03.269> it's<00:03:03.930> very<00:03:04.019> expensive<00:03:16.819> so<00:03:17.819> here<00:03:18.030> we

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
by itself it's very expensive so here we

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.420 
by itself it's very expensive so here we
have<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.480> memory<00:03:18.750> card<00:03:19.880> we<00:03:20.880> have<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.090> AT&amp;T

have the memory card we have the AT&amp;T
which<00:03:23.430> are<00:03:23.580> probably<00:03:23.760> not<00:03:23.940> going<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.180> use<00:03:25.370> we

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
which are probably not going to use we

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.819 
which are probably not going to use we
