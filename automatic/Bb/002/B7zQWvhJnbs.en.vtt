just run through the setup you can see
it's<00:03:02.349> very<00:03:02.409> easy<00:03:02.650> all<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.549> got<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.879> do<00:03:04.030> really

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
it's very easy all you got to do really

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.599 
it's very easy all you got to do really
to<00:03:04.359> activate<00:03:04.959> your<00:03:05.049> phone<00:03:05.319> is<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> SIM<00:03:06.129> card<00:03:06.430> so

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
to activate your phone is a SIM card so

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.369 
to activate your phone is a SIM card so
you<00:03:06.699> will<00:03:06.909> need<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.299> handy<00:03:07.780> but<00:03:08.049> if<00:03:08.230> you're

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
you will need that handy but if you're

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:09.330 
you will need that handy but if you're
buying<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.680> locked<00:03:08.889> phone<00:03:09.099> you<00:03:09.189> probably

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
buying a locked phone you probably

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.599 
buying a locked phone you probably
already<00:03:09.609> have<00:03:09.909> a<00:03:10.120> SIM<00:03:10.359> card<00:03:10.389> ready<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:10.989> go<00:03:11.290> and

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
already have a SIM card ready to go and

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.789 
already have a SIM card ready to go and
there<00:03:12.609> you<00:03:12.760> go<00:03:12.909> so<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.389> is<00:03:13.419> running<00:03:13.750> iOS<00:03:13.989> 7<00:03:14.650> I

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
there you go so it is running iOS 7 I

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.259 
there you go so it is running iOS 7 I
think<00:03:14.829> it<00:03:15.099> does<00:03:15.280> go<00:03:15.519> very<00:03:15.819> well<00:03:15.909> with<00:03:16.090> the

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
think it does go very well with the

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.869 
think it does go very well with the
iPhone<00:03:16.599> 5c<00:03:17.139> a<00:03:17.319> very<00:03:17.560> colorful<00:03:18.189> flat<00:03:18.549> interface

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
iPhone 5c a very colorful flat interface

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.030 
iPhone 5c a very colorful flat interface
and<00:03:19.449> personally<00:03:20.139> I<00:03:20.199> am<00:03:20.379> actually<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:20.799> pretty

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
and personally I am actually a pretty

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.179 
and personally I am actually a pretty
fan<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.370> big<00:03:21.819> fan<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:22.060> iOS<00:03:22.479> 7<00:03:22.599> so<00:03:23.049> far<00:03:23.079> but<00:03:23.919> before

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:24.189 
fan a big fan of iOS 7 so far but before

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:25.830 
fan a big fan of iOS 7 so far but before
we<00:03:24.280> go<00:03:24.430> let's<00:03:24.699> take<00:03:24.790> one<00:03:25.090> last<00:03:25.269> look<00:03:25.449> at<00:03:25.659> the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
we go let's take one last look at the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.210 
we go let's take one last look at the
hardware<00:03:26.259> you<00:03:26.439> see<00:03:26.620> all<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.859> buttons<00:03:27.099> are

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
hardware you see all the buttons are

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.490 
hardware you see all the buttons are
very<00:03:27.400> tactile<00:03:27.669> and<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.299> do<00:03:28.359> have<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.840> case<00:03:29.169> and

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
very tactile and I do have the case and

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.140 
very tactile and I do have the case and
I<00:03:29.560> do<00:03:29.620> think<00:03:29.979> it<00:03:30.099> actually<00:03:30.400> goes<00:03:30.549> very<00:03:30.849> well<00:03:31.060> at

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
I do think it actually goes very well at

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.640 
I do think it actually goes very well at
the<00:03:31.239> phone<00:03:31.419> itself<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.079> think<00:03:32.319> pretty<00:03:32.530> much

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
the phone itself and I think pretty much

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.830 
the phone itself and I think pretty much
everyone<00:03:33.099> with<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.639> 5c<00:03:34.090> should<00:03:34.389> probably<00:03:34.599> go

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
everyone with the 5c should probably go

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.539 
everyone with the 5c should probably go
and<00:03:34.959> buy<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.169> case<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.829> add<00:03:35.949> some<00:03:36.129> additional

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
and buy the case to add some additional

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.729 
and buy the case to add some additional
protection<00:03:36.729> and<00:03:37.689> I<00:03:37.870> think<00:03:38.109> the<00:03:38.199> phone<00:03:38.379> itself

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
protection and I think the phone itself

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.770 
protection and I think the phone itself
does<00:03:38.979> feel<00:03:39.220> very<00:03:39.430> smooth<00:03:39.909> and<00:03:40.150> seamless<00:03:40.389> along

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
does feel very smooth and seamless along

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.659 
does feel very smooth and seamless along
the<00:03:40.959> hand<00:03:41.199> but<00:03:41.859> another<00:03:42.129> thing<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.489> probably

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
the hand but another thing I probably

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.039 
the hand but another thing I probably
would<00:03:42.909> have<00:03:42.939> wish<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.389> that<00:03:43.599> they<00:03:43.720> had<00:03:43.900> the

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
would have wish is that they had the

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.259 
would have wish is that they had the
front<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.560> me<00:03:44.739> white<00:03:44.979> but<00:03:45.790> other<00:03:45.939> than<00:03:46.120> that

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
front and me white but other than that

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.330 
front and me white but other than that
like<00:03:46.599> I<00:03:46.629> mentioned<00:03:47.169> this<00:03:47.290> is<00:03:47.349> pretty<00:03:47.949> much<00:03:48.129> an

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
like I mentioned this is pretty much an

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.280 
like I mentioned this is pretty much an
iPhone<00:03:48.729> 5<00:03:48.970> being<00:03:49.389> put<00:03:49.569> into<00:03:49.689> a<00:03:49.840> brand<00:03:50.169> new

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
iPhone 5 being put into a brand new

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.649 
iPhone 5 being put into a brand new
enclosure<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:51.549> price<00:03:51.819> kind<00:03:52.150> of<00:03:52.239> remains<00:03:52.509> the

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
enclosure the price kind of remains the

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.420 
enclosure the price kind of remains the
same<00:03:52.900> as<00:03:53.109> it<00:03:53.319> would<00:03:53.439> have<00:03:53.560> been<00:03:53.590> had<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.219> 5

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
same as it would have been had the 5

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.459 
same as it would have been had the 5
stuck<00:03:54.849> around<00:03:55.180> but<00:03:55.810> other<00:03:55.900> than<00:03:56.049> that<00:03:56.109> I<00:03:56.229> hope

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:56.469 
stuck around but other than that I hope

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.080 
stuck around but other than that I hope
