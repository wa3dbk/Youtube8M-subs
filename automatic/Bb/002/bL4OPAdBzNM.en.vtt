00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.840 
achieve that's my approach man if
anyone's<00:01:42.740> got<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.950> different<00:01:43.340> approach<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:43.820> a

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
anyone's got a different approach and a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.550 
anyone's got a different approach and a
better<00:01:44.030> formula<00:01:44.420> then<00:01:44.720> let<00:01:44.899> me<00:01:44.990> know<00:01:45.020> about<00:01:45.409> it

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
better formula then let me know about it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.679 
better formula then let me know about it
but<00:01:45.680> this<00:01:45.799> is<00:01:45.860> just<00:01:46.340> through<00:01:46.549> you<00:01:47.360> know<00:01:47.479> my

together<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:20.110> ways<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:21.040> people<00:02:21.190> don't<00:02:21.790> think

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
together in ways that people don't think

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.880 
together in ways that people don't think
about<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.570> know<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.140> think<00:02:23.350> that's<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.710> big

was younger and I rode motocross so I've

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.110 
was younger and I rode motocross so I've
always<00:02:46.630> had<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:47.400> different<00:02:48.400> perspective<00:02:48.700> on

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
always had a different perspective on

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.880 
always had a different perspective on
skateboarding<00:02:49.750> from<00:02:50.020> that<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.410> know<00:02:50.530> before

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
skateboarding from that you know before

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.440 
skateboarding from that you know before
I<00:02:50.920> started<00:02:51.310> doing<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.640> mega<00:02:51.820> ramp<00:02:52.030> stuff<00:02:52.300> I

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
I started doing the mega ramp stuff I

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.910 
I started doing the mega ramp stuff I
had<00:02:52.570> already<00:02:52.720> flew<00:02:53.110> through<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.350> air<00:02:53.620> at

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
had already flew through the air at

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.680 
had already flew through the air at
those<00:02:54.220> distances<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.000> Heights<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.540> knew

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
those distances and Heights and knew

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.300 
those distances and Heights and knew
those<00:02:55.900> was<00:02:56.200> feeling<00:02:56.620> familiar<00:02:57.010> with<00:02:57.160> those

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
those was feeling familiar with those

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.130 
those was feeling familiar with those
speeds<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.880> approaching<00:02:58.390> jumps<00:02:58.690> like<00:02:58.900> that

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
speeds of approaching jumps like that

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.650 
speeds of approaching jumps like that
you<00:03:00.010> know<00:03:00.100> from<00:03:00.459> motocross<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.510> from

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
you know from motocross and from

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.180 
you know from motocross and from
snowboarding<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.500> think<00:03:02.739> anything<00:03:02.980> that's

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
snowboarding I think anything that's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.199 
snowboarding I think anything that's
skateable<00:03:03.850> at<00:03:04.390> out<00:03:05.290> of<00:03:05.440> like<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:06.209> standard

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
skateable at out of like a standard

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.890 
skateable at out of like a standard
scale<00:03:07.890> can<00:03:08.890> be<00:03:09.040> glorified<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.790> Omega<00:03:10.060> scale<00:03:10.360> at

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
scale can be glorified to Omega scale at

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.780 
scale can be glorified to Omega scale at
this<00:03:11.080> point<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:11.470> that's<00:03:11.620> really<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.459> know<00:03:12.489> my

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
this point and that's really you know my

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.820 
this point and that's really you know my
mission<00:03:13.150> has<00:03:13.270> been<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:14.020> know<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.380> mega<00:03:14.590> ramp

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
mission has been is you know a mega ramp

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.530 
mission has been is you know a mega ramp
doesn't<00:03:14.980> have<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.370> be<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.489> quarter<00:03:15.880> pipe<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.390> can

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
doesn't have to be a quarter pipe it can

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.430 
doesn't have to be a quarter pipe it can
be<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.690> huge<00:03:17.110> massive<00:03:17.739> ledge<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:18.820> know<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:19.930> you

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
be a huge massive ledge you know so you

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.810 
be a huge massive ledge you know so you
know<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.590> just<00:03:20.860> have<00:03:21.160> come<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.700> conclusion

older but the risk becomes more a lot
more<00:03:56.920> substantial<00:03:57.340> as<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:58.060> bar<00:03:58.269> is<00:03:58.360> being

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
more substantial as that bar is being

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.050 
more substantial as that bar is being

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
raised so as I'm getting older it's

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.030 
raised so as I'm getting older it's
getting<00:04:01.360> more<00:04:01.540> dangerous<00:04:01.720> my<00:04:02.410> ideas<00:04:02.860> they
