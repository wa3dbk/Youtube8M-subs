wall<00:02:14.750> as<00:02:14.930> well<00:02:15.110> which<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.860> just<00:02:16.160> never

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
wall as well which I just never

understood just just didn't get so makes
me<00:02:20.570> wonder<00:02:20.750> with<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.710> visual<00:02:22.190> improvements

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
me wonder with the visual improvements

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.510 
me wonder with the visual improvements
from<00:02:22.850> 2k15<00:02:23.330> what<00:02:24.020> will<00:02:24.530> they<00:02:24.710> do<00:02:24.770> in<00:02:25.100> 2k16

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
from 2k15 what will they do in 2k16

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.350 
from 2k15 what will they do in 2k16
could<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.600> easily<00:02:27.580> be<00:02:28.580> something<00:02:29.060> just<00:02:29.240> add

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
could it easily be something just add

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.540 
could it easily be something just add
the<00:02:29.630> little<00:02:29.810> sort<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.440> chains<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.370> ads

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
cavorting it wasn't the case I've still

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.770 
cavorting it wasn't the case I've still
not<00:04:01.110> had<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.319> chance<00:04:01.379> to<00:04:01.799> do<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.129> in<00:04:02.220> 2k<00:04:02.579> 50<00:04:03.060> but

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
not had a chance to do it in 2k 50 but

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.420 
not had a chance to do it in 2k 50 but
the<00:04:03.810> lift<00:04:04.140> up<00:04:04.349> the<00:04:04.500> option<00:04:04.829> still<00:04:04.980> appears<00:04:05.310> you

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
the lift up the option still appears you

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.069 
the lift up the option still appears you
can<00:04:05.459> still<00:04:05.730> lift<00:04:05.970> them<00:04:06.269> but<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.750> weren't<00:04:06.900> able

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079

to<00:04:07.230> do<00:04:07.439> the<00:04:08.269> finishing<00:04:09.269> but<00:04:09.450> I'm<00:04:09.599> assuming

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
to do the finishing but I'm assuming

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.809 
to do the finishing but I'm assuming
that<00:04:10.110> still<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.440> case<00:04:10.590> now<00:04:10.860> but<00:04:11.549> it<00:04:11.700> would

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
that still the case now but it would

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.899 
that still the case now but it would
look<00:04:11.970> awesome<00:04:12.209> if<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.840> could<00:04:13.079> do<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.909> right

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
look awesome if you could do that right

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.340 
look awesome if you could do that right
the<00:04:15.090> very<00:04:15.239> high<00:04:15.420> point<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:15.989> then<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.169> just

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
the very high point and then you just

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.279 
the very high point and then you just
drop<00:04:16.650> in<00:04:16.829> special<00:04:17.190> an<00:04:17.340> RKO<00:04:17.699> the<00:04:18.329> highest<00:04:18.840> RKO

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289
