00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:11.109
 real masters of their trade 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.109
 nobody can plan better than the Drachenburg 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.830
 after halftime and las in the glass of course 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.570
 Soap bubbles brings these monsters the march bubbles APA 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.840
 most of you probably know the gap of the game Bubble Bobble from 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.410
 Commodore 64 and abolished by Amiga are gambled against on the NDS and it 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.010
 probably also gives no noise or 16 bits to see 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.120
 did not appear on the shared classic but the system plays 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.490
 actually not matter 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.490
 because Bubble Bobble everywhere equals statements 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.400
 100 screen of great nonchalance it from knots and then to rid of it 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.520
 Locked up the villains in soap bubbles to adapt 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.800
 and was allowed to collect delicious fruits 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.989
 sounds easy 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.739
 It was not because the opponents were getting faster and the environments over 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.310
 inaccessible 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.080
 Bahar had to get used to pushing away from their own bladders 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.539
 Icon image to use other screen page 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:08.770
 or pick up extra weapons as fast as you can 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.770
 facilitated 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.210
 the most effective measure to facilitate the task was 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.270
 to join a second tourism with the group playing at the same time 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.800
 allow 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.230
 not only was it more fun that was a really big number if you did 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.440
 Consider that in the lower running multiplayer games in the eighties one 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.820
 Rarity were 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.110
 but it also has its downsides that everyone can remember the bubble 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.710
 Bobble alone through the game city 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.670
 Now imagine you fight your way through a hundred fact of the levels 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.700
 and finally the mighty upstart 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.610
 he is so heavy that he hangs on him for hours 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.710
 This place you have to meet 80 times with last 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.410
 Since dangerous pages warn Stertmann often faster 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.960
 as you can watch 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.230
 again 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.490
 and again 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.709
 again and again 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.310
 and then at the moment of the triumph together felt like two million pounds in 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.840
 the USA 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.769
 it finally managed to move the guy a short text that falls 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.829
 everything was free 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.749
 the end of it met Steve Martin Obermotzing team with a second 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.399
 Player defeated 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:28.579
 the case Opel 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.689
 could not have said that anymore 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.639
 I mean on the NDS it was still there you could then password function directly 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.290
 get in front of the Obermatt 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.250
 but many other systems had to be reimbursed Bubble Bobble in one go 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.759
 I'm inclined to say it was an acid test for the bubble 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:47.840
 but above all, an endurance test for the ears 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.700
 because so nice to come up with the little background melody 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.880
 after hundreds mentioned they have one to 3 3 out 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:58.119
 and I know that because I have the mistake many years ago 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:00.040
 made to relocate my neighbor 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.690
 because i forgot to leave the apartment my in it 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.899
 off 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:08.070
 So my neighbor had to wear some Iniesta Piekser for hours 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.240
 promptly retaliated the next day with six hours of music from Bubble 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.459
 Bobble 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.519
 and I still get nightmares of it today 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.519
 With 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.199
 Euro 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.849
 ca
