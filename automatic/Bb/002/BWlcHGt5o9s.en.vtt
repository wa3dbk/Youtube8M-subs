00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
existence because I hate being a person

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.400 
existence because I hate being a person
that's<00:00:09.450> like<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:09.750> almost<00:00:09.870> done<00:00:10.019> it's<00:00:10.290> almost

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
that's like it's almost done it's almost

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.799 
that's like it's almost done it's almost
done<00:00:10.650> but<00:00:10.980> with<00:00:11.160> with<00:00:11.880> albums<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.509> is

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
done but with with albums it is

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.820 
done but with with albums it is
literally<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.769> get<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:15.049> 75%<00:00:16.049> range

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
literally that you get to this 75% range

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.230 
literally that you get to this 75% range
and<00:00:17.310> then<00:00:18.410> it<00:00:19.410> takes<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.010> long<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.550> get<00:00:20.880> that

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and then it takes so long to get that

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.120 
and then it takes so long to get that
last<00:00:21.810> percent<00:00:22.560> done<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.570> it's<00:00:24.720> so

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
last percent done it is and it's so

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.009 
last percent done it is and it's so

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
and so the characters is based on that

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.700 
and so the characters is based on that
he<00:04:56.760> basically<00:04:57.000> has<00:04:57.660> a<00:04:57.690> lot<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:58.050> money<00:04:58.230> but<00:04:58.560> no
