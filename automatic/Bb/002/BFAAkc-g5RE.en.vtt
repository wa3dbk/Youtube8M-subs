I'm<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> make<00:01:38.670> two<00:01:38.850> pigs

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.450 

let's<00:01:48.970> flip<00:01:49.240> them<00:01:49.479> if<00:01:50.170> you're<00:01:51.070> working<00:01:51.220> on<00:01:51.399> a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
let's flip them if you're working on a

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.340 
let's flip them if you're working on a
nonstick<00:01:52.000> griddle<00:01:52.270> it's<00:01:52.720> important<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.170> use<00:01:53.320> a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
nonstick griddle it's important to use a

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.230 
nonstick griddle it's important to use a
plastic<00:01:53.950> spatula<00:01:54.189> that<00:01:54.850> way<00:01:55.030> you<00:01:55.090> don't

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
plastic spatula that way you don't

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.050 
plastic spatula that way you don't
scratch<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.810> surface<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:57.580> now<00:01:57.729> it's<00:01:57.880> time<00:01:58.030> to

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
scratch the surface so now it's time to
