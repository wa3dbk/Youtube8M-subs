00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.759
 we can proceed to save parentheses 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:10.420
 if it doesn't save you 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.969
 just go to properties by clicking 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.480
 obviously with the right button then up 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.480
 safety 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:26.280
 click on the user we say with which 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:30.130
 is operating on users at the beginning not 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.439
 let's say you'll find the page in this 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.129
 that is, that all these values 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.969
 complete control modification and writing 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:44.140
 there will be no push to do it 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:52.690
 just study full control on 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:55.379
 allow ok again and now we can 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 to save 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.460
 ok 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.100
 well now the next step let's say 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.890
 optional is to install 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.220
 always if you want the original mp3 tracks 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.760
 of the game I personally prefer 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.570
 my judge listless traces 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.520
 midili by default that you find in or so 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:30.060
 also to the equally horrible mp3 tracks 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.090
 of peace then once unloaded 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.840
 this file vice music 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:42.660
 right click we extract ok 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.170
 we get this file by clicking on 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.170
 silk 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:59.600
 we select the language 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:02.090
 of the installation or even German if 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.060
 prefer because you then click on 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:10.200
 next we accept 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.390
 as destination folder we change e 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.590
 we select the true main of 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:20.220
 final fantasy vii and bee team on ok 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.580
 you want on next and finally on wellbeing 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.380
 we're done now back in the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.410
 our portfolio 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.770
 and I knew I don't know why ever 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.980
 these installations not installation 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.670
 never works on the first try 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.810
 in this case the only thing to do is 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.130
 uninstalling is trying to reinstall 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.630
 so we click here on after 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.630
 reopened setup 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.980
 yes we have seen it to the side 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.999
 now 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.870
 we can try to reinstall it e 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.870
 we choose our own language 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.889
 we accept next 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:20.319
 if we decide to later our folder 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:22.930
 ok happy now with we are here 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.609
 now we have the files that interest us 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.290
 so this time catering is 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.299
 successful 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:37.449
 in particular we are interested in this file 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:42.629
 therefore we occupy it and music 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:42.629
 we meet in the facebook chapel here 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.819

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.110
 well that's done then once done 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.600

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:06.400

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:13.000
 this file as we can see in my 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:16.060
 case already the option is marked but if from 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.190

 with the right we go on property then up 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.060

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.160
