00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.790
 new to big car 5 and well I think that 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.949
 this video is a bit obvious but it is not 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.740
 bad to say how to get cars 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:20.939
 especially easy and fast sports without 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.609
 pay no payment but to rich areas 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.730
 of the saints that is this whole area 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.230
 up here practically all these 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.509
 from here and more is up here 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.360
 that are usually more ricky is more 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.100
 chalet and things like that and around here for this 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.140
 area here in this contract there is a 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.910
 bike that I think always comes out in that 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.039
 garage then I will try to find those of 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.469
 but again and maybe the good right now 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.390
 we are here in a small one is a rich 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:50.039
 where I found four or five 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.039
 fast type garages 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.980
 already in case I found myself or I was going 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.300
 with a car crap I found this 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.340
 audi tt that I just got off 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.600
 and here we have this sport weight that 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.269
 at first it was a ferrari but 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.850
 do not go to see cabbages 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.310
 here we have another sports one more appears 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.020
 a jaguar 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.100
 in the truth that is gorgeous to a 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.600
 Martin or one who looks like 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:22.010
 Flipy next perches and everything I 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.050
 love we are going to take the hot car 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.880
 that it is not more or less than 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.440
 a 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.430
 warm up 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.720

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.230
 give a little when leaving but good 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.000
 and nothing here in front is usually also 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.570
 car parked here we already have two other 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.460
 we have not given ten meters and they arrived 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.470
 two others sporting a kind of ford 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.010

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.130

 and here we have two others already 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.090
 the car that I lost orange that seems 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.890
 be that it's a mercedes and it 's next 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.090
 it looks like it's a sling not a kind of 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.690
 facebook or something like that I do not know 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.390

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.540
 the truth is that we do not walk I do not know 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.780
 missing a lot and we found it 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:36.620

 and nothing said or not walk 20 meters 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.260

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.140
 rare to find but good too 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.660
 appears quite I think it's a kind 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.910
 mercedes mclaren does not sound like a 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.280
