00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.779
 how about everyone in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:09.929
 show a cube that I bought makes a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.900
 week and obviously I was waiting for it 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.530
 You went long ago but already the day 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.630
 It has arrived and it is finally clear with 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.210
 the 7 x 7 cube that I actually have here 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.480
 who forgot to present it 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.550
 here the 7 by 7 that obviously is a 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.420
 pretty good bucket of pretty quality 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.369
 and today that Cuba we are going to talk then in 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.430
 the description is obviously already going 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.760
 to talk about the 6 x 6 cube here obviously 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.830
 let's see the state of the box the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.410
 state of the box because it was more or 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.720
 less well here is already a little more 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.240
 taken off it does not matter we're going to talk about 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.470
 the box first that the clear cube is 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.120
 this is the way to ozzy 6 x 6 here 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.060
 we can see all the pieces 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.640
 that contains more or less here we can 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.829
 observe that there is like a plastic 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.360
 transparent you can do so so that 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.510
 you see the cube and in turn you see 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.400
 elegant here some small cuts 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.380
 so that you can see the gaps that 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.550
 has for cutting corners and everything 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.870
 others here obviously we have Felix 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.350
 engel and here it says that here happy 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.940
 Engel broke the world record for cubes 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.930
 solving the rubik cube three by three 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.230
 with a percentage of 566 seconds 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.670
 you know how to fix Japanese no but jesus that 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.620
 suppose he says he is happy here 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.380
 obviously with the super-rare collar 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.800
 and we are going to open the package now 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.170
 same we are going to open it and here we would have 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.510
 the cube the first impressions are 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.060
 pretty good because this cube is 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.280
 pretty good but the only problem that 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.020
 I see it is that it is quite lubricated and 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.800
 what happens when the cube is quite 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.630
 lubricated then the texture is first 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:04.170
 in the hands are quite sticky 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.820
 at the beginning but then the cube rotates 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.310
 pretty good here is not going to be a 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.060
 bit quiet so you can 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.290
 observe the turn 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.290
 and listen to it too 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.680
 so the cube is fairly well let 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.079
 to look at the stickers the stickers are 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.390
 exactly the same as all the mollo 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.819
 obviously here we can see the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.439
 comparison of both may be a 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.040
 little bit clearer because this one already has 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:33.470
 its antiquity obviously and therefore something that 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.829
 I do not like the stickers is the color 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.950
 orange because they see it changes the color of 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:42.470
 the image the color of the video and it's a 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.280
 very bright phosphorescent orange very 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.329
 shrewd here I have indeed a taste 5 for 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.310
 5 drop obviously 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.739
 and then here you can see that the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.190
 image is still the same but 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.500
 here the color changes exactly and therefore 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.570
 these two colors 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.730
 Well I like them but it's pretty 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.310
 striking here with my sound effects 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.780
 and we're going to see the corner cutting the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.780
 direct cut and here we can place 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.470
 and then nothing happens not him not him 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.970
 modify the tensions, much less 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.190
 here we can cut even more but 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.430
 they already know that cubes can be 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.620
 very flexible but they have their limit the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.540
 Inverse cut the reverse cut is very 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.940
 well here is the course the cut 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.460
 inverse is super good that depends on 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.230
 how do you take the bucket because if you 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.610
 can very tight then it is obvious that 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.010
 you can not do it but if you do not take it 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.920
 distance can you achieve it better 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.580
 then the corner cutting the turn 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.680
 is 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.960
 pretty good if it was not so 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.950
 lubricated because I think it would rotate as 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.730
 this this tour super well here you can 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.120
 exemplify an algorithm 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.470
 right now I have cold hands but 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.970
 the algorithm this example pretty well 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.670
 there are times that I do the algorithms very 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.379
 near the camera but it's something that 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.870
 I'll have to get used to it with time 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:20.440
 but here I can not exemplify very well the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:24.550
 algorithm because because I do not know what 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.620
 I did that's also because the lubricant 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.199
 that comes in the cube 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.150
 As I have said before, it is 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.210
 quite the one located then that does 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.360
 that when you want to turn this is 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.460
 piece of here automatically the second 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.270
 as it sticks by the same 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.740
 lubricant and thus not achieve a good 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.070
 algorithm because all the pieces 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:51.190
 they follow the first one and I do not know because I do not know 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:55.840
 good enough so 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.880
 I think this would be the review of the 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.130
 positive opinions opinions 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.860
 negative but the rest cube is 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.919
 pretty well I preferred the mold though 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.960
 be a little more expensive than the census the 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:11.260
 I tried both, or I picked them up in the store 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.360
 I tried them both and I liked this one better 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.750
 I already believe that by custom 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.330
 because obviously he already had 7 for 7 and 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.060
 I already wanted to start with 6 for 6 after 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.600
 with 5 by 5 4 by 4 of 3 by 3 2 by 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.370
 two 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.470
 maybe I bought a 3 for 3 but the 2 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.110
 by 2 and that would be in the collection and 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.210
 well then they would go then doing 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.370
 practically the family so nothing 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.699
 because this was 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.470
 the review and the criticism that I wanted to give 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.570
 to this cube and then the truth that is 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:45.220
 quite well the way to solve it is 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:49.680
 Like a 4x4 the centers are 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:53.110
 the same as solving a 5 by 5 7 by 7 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.199
 that's basically the same then 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.350
 it's quite simple is to solve and it's 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:01.240
 super lightweight the cube is super light 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.330
 demon so no hope there will 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.729
 liked this video I hope you have them 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.120
 liked the cut I recommend it without place 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:12.130
 doubts if they already have many products 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.320
 I would recommend buying the 6 x 6 if 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:18.910
 they have census products and they lack 6 x 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.550
 6 I recommend the extensive 6 x 6 in 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.620
 show for for the collection obviously 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.600
 but if you want quality then the 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.740
 for the novelty and everything else the 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.470
 would bother one step ahead of the 6th 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.840
 earthquake is saint saÃ«ns show that is not 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.800
 talk I hope you liked this 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.590
 video 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.590
 and see you until the next see you later
