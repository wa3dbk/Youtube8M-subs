00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
mine because mine it's about to break I

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
mine because mine it's about to break I
mean<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.730> really<00:00:39.000> had<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.540> review<00:00:40.020> now

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
mean I really had to do this review now

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.190 
mean I really had to do this review now
because<00:00:41.160> these<00:00:41.340> doors<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:42.200> they're

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
because these doors here they're

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.440 
because these doors here they're
translucent<00:00:43.649> plastic<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.910> they<00:00:45.000> connect<00:00:45.300> by

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
translucent plastic and they connect by

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.720 
translucent plastic and they connect by
ball<00:00:45.719> joints<00:00:46.079> into<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.829> one<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.579> these

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
ball joints into here and one of these

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.529 
ball joints into here and one of these
is<00:00:48.059> very<00:00:48.840> close<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.230> cracking<00:00:49.680> off<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.539> since

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
is very close to cracking off and since

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.350 
is very close to cracking off and since
it's<00:00:51.690> clear<00:00:51.989> plastic<00:00:52.370> there's<00:00:53.370> not<00:00:53.850> much<00:00:54.120> I

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
it's clear plastic there's not much I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.910 
it's clear plastic there's not much I
can<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.719> about<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:56.270> now<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.420> figure<00:00:57.920> rolls

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
can do about it now this figure rolls

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.150 
can do about it now this figure rolls
pretty<00:00:59.219> well<00:01:00.050> I'm<00:01:01.050> even<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.500> carpet<00:01:01.800> that

pretty well I'm even on this carpet that
rolls<00:01:02.460> really<00:01:02.670> well<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:04.670> I'll<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.850> carpet<00:01:06.210> by

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
rolls really well and I'll not carpet by

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.929 
rolls really well and I'll not carpet by
that<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> towel<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.710> don't<00:01:08.490> looks<00:01:08.640> pretty

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that the towel and I don't looks pretty

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.020 
that the towel and I don't looks pretty
nice<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:10.290> even<00:01:10.530> has<00:01:10.740> little<00:01:10.979> seats<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.820> there

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
nice it even has little seats in there

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.820 
nice it even has little seats in there
that<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.080> can<00:01:13.350> kind<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:15.590> they<00:01:16.590> aren't<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that you can kind of see they aren't the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.920 
that you can kind of see they aren't the
best<00:01:16.950> seats<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:17.670> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> look<00:01:18.869> like

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.320 
seats there are the bottoms of his feet
now<00:01:22.170> transform<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.830> figure<00:01:23.280> first<00:01:24.150> thing

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
now transform this figure first thing

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.300 
now transform this figure first thing
you'll<00:01:24.450> do<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.630> you'll<00:01:24.750> pop<00:01:25.290> open<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.040> doors

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
sighs you pull the hood up then you can

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.039 
sighs you pull the hood up then you can
pull<00:01:36.150> his<00:01:36.360> feet<00:01:36.780> down<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:41.810> then<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.930> will

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
pull his feet down and then you will

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.350 
pull his feet down and then you will
rotate<00:01:43.409> his<00:01:43.530> feet<00:01:43.740> around<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.460> and

then rotate his shins like that so

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.960 
then rotate his shins like that so
rotate<00:01:50.250> his<00:01:50.340> feet<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:51.110> rotations<00:01:52.110> down<00:01:52.970> then

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
rotate his feet up rotations down then

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.289 
rotate his feet up rotations down then
you'll<00:01:54.149> take<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.509> hook<00:01:54.780> piece<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.040> will

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
you'll take this hook piece and you will

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.389 
you'll take this hook piece and you will
collapse<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.540> up<00:01:57.659> into<00:01:58.170> his<00:01:58.290> back<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.950> then

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
collapse it up into his back and then

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.389 
collapse it up into his back and then
take<00:01:59.670> this<00:02:00.079> shove<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.200> up<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.680> will<00:02:01.829> lock

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
take this shove it up and that will lock

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.090 
take this shove it up and that will lock
it<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.790> into<00:02:03.210> place<00:02:03.450> very<00:02:03.630> nicely<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.469> then

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
it this into place very nicely and then

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.029 
it this into place very nicely and then
fold<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.430> onto<00:02:05.790> his<00:02:05.820> back<00:02:06.500> then<00:02:07.500> you'll<00:02:07.710> take

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
fold that onto his back then you'll take

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.160 
fold that onto his back then you'll take
these<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.759> fold<00:02:09.629> them<00:02:09.750> down<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.530> they'll<00:02:10.709> be

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
these and fold them down and they'll be

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.610 
these and fold them down and they'll be
kind<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.260> side<00:02:13.560> skirt

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.430 

and<00:02:19.819> now<00:02:20.819> we're<00:02:21.120> starting<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.540> stand<00:02:22.170> them<00:02:22.319> up

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
and now we're starting to stand them up

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.390 
and now we're starting to stand them up
and<00:02:23.300> he's<00:02:24.300> not<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.900> small<00:02:25.470> figure<00:02:28.220> next<00:02:29.220> thing

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
and he's not a small figure next thing

you do is you take this piece right here
and<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:32.420> fold<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.660> down<00:02:34.940> fold<00:02:35.940> up<00:02:36.090> these

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
and you fold it down fold up these

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
the rare into the car which form his

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.240 
the rare into the car which form his
shoulders<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.660> arms<00:02:48.959> rotate<00:02:49.680> around<00:02:49.980> his

arm has a bunch of kibble on it and

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.440 
arm has a bunch of kibble on it and
that's<00:03:01.890> actually<00:03:02.099> really<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.640> only<00:03:02.730> flaw

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
that's actually really the only flaw

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.370 
that's actually really the only flaw
this<00:03:03.720> robot<00:03:04.079> mode<00:03:04.260> has<00:03:05.239> so<00:03:06.239> there<00:03:06.810> we<00:03:07.049> go<00:03:09.380> well

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
this robot mode has so there we go well

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.280

back to give him a jetpack and that was

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.400 
back to give him a jetpack and that was
pretty<00:04:14.400> neat<00:04:14.700> but<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.030> don't<00:04:16.019> have<00:04:16.229> those

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
pretty neat but I don't have those

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.159 
pretty neat but I don't have those
anymore<00:04:17.269> lastima<00:04:18.269> I<00:04:18.419> was<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:19.070> kid<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.900> the

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
anymore lastima I was a kid so the

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.380 
anymore lastima I was a kid so the
possibility<00:04:22.680> on<00:04:22.770> this<00:04:22.919> guy<00:04:23.099> is<00:04:23.310> its<00:04:24.120> kind<00:04:24.300> of

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
possibility on this guy is its kind of

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.390 
possibility on this guy is its kind of
non-standard<00:04:24.840> but<00:04:25.200> it's<00:04:25.320> pretty<00:04:25.470> good<00:04:25.710> like

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
non-standard but it's pretty good like

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.860 
non-standard but it's pretty good like
in<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.580> shoulders<00:04:26.940> it's<00:04:27.150> a

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
in the shoulders it's a

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.740 
in the shoulders it's a
ball<00:04:28.080> joint<00:04:28.440> in<00:04:28.620> here<00:04:28.949> so<00:04:29.160> he<00:04:29.280> has<00:04:29.510> full<00:04:30.510> range

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
ball joint in here so he has full range

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.640 
ball joint in here so he has full range
like<00:04:30.990> this<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:31.560> up<00:04:32.400> here<00:04:32.430> like<00:04:33.300> this<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:33.960> then

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
like this and up here like this and then

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.250 
like this and up here like this and then
he<00:04:34.979> has<00:04:35.220> another<00:04:35.669> shoulder<00:04:36.030> joint<00:04:36.510> in<00:04:36.840> here<00:04:37.490> so

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
he has another shoulder joint in here so

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.960 
he has another shoulder joint in here so
you<00:04:40.260> can<00:04:40.350> get<00:04:40.440> some<00:04:40.680> range<00:04:40.919> i'm<00:04:41.100> not<00:04:41.310> sure<00:04:41.490> i'm

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
you can get some range i'm not sure i'm

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.800 
you can get some range i'm not sure i'm
not<00:04:42.120> quite<00:04:42.419> sure<00:04:42.449> how<00:04:42.870> effective<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.500> all<00:04:43.650> is

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
not quite sure how effective it all is

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.900 
not quite sure how effective it all is
but<00:04:45.810> it's<00:04:45.990> there<00:04:46.380> then<00:04:46.919> he<00:04:47.040> has<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.160> ball

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
but it's there then he has a ball

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.730 
but it's there then he has a ball
jointed<00:04:48.270> elbows<00:04:48.389> i<00:04:48.720> can<00:04:48.840> turn<00:04:49.020> like<00:04:49.229> this<00:04:49.440> and

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
jointed elbows i can turn like this and

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.030 
jointed elbows i can turn like this and
a<00:04:50.669> joint<00:04:51.510> here<00:04:51.870> like<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.050> side<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:52.620> inward

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
a joint here like a side and inward

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.040 
a joint here like a side and inward
elbow<00:04:53.760> like<00:04:53.910> that<00:04:56.210> and<00:04:57.210> that's<00:04:57.630> pretty<00:04:57.900> nice

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
elbow like that and that's pretty nice
