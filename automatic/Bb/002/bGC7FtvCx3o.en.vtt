 that's what presents itself without plume 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.420
 snpch on 3 for printers canon 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:15.019
 sump 425 x for 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.019
 filled with pigment ink 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:25.890
 a tuple 426 well, I'm in the center of magenta so 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.250
 chips are also provided 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.300
 separately which is installed one 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.760
 times and for the life of these chips 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.550
 arranged so here there is a small 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.710
 as if so spring-loaded chips 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.379
 installing removing the crankcase same chips themselves 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.120
 moving away from contacts thereby allowing 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.450
 reset the chip when installing a new one 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.450
 cartridge 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.110
 one of the problems with which often 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.460
 users encounter 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.340
 this is refilling cartridges I personally 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.210
 the problem is that the absorber 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.040
 ink impregnates poorly 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.040
 here now on an example show how to 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.780
 correctly refill cartridges that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.760
 properly soaked to the absorber 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.760
 print was the highest quality 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.610
 need to refuel on using back and 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.270
 cardboard must be on stand 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 refuel tuple 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.479
 crankcase refuel approximately not 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.719
 strongly that he was full 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.520
 then it will be possible either second 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.209
 refuel as see absorber 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.259
 soaked it soaked well 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.319
 very very small speed 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.240
 so he can be soaked up much better 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:58.299
 cork on top do not close a little 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.299
 lifting crankcase from the seat 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.030
 And so leave as we see the ink went 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.530
 its absorber deserved ink can 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.530
 Add the amount of black 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.510
 close the lid 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.580
 we rub excess ink 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.060
 such difficulties arise only possible 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.569
 see as a drop of ink just by 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.159
 so many 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.890
 when you first refill cartridges when 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.079
 the next refill cartridges such 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.420
 no effect will be absorber will be 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.959
 fill as it should without 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.959
 of problems
