00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:30.599 
and create sparks this sparks a much

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:31.130 
and create sparks this sparks a much
duller

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
duller

has been prepared properly but if you're
just<00:02:34.230> starting<00:02:34.440> out<00:02:34.680> using<00:02:34.890> flint<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.370> steel

this<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.690> very<00:02:37.200> good<00:02:37.440> very<00:02:37.680> easy<00:02:37.920> method<00:02:38.220> to

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
this is a very good very easy method to

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.750 
this is a very good very easy method to
use<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.690> good<00:02:39.870> place<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.110> start<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:41.580> let's

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
use it's a good place to start so let's

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.089 
use it's a good place to start so let's
see<00:02:41.940> how<00:02:42.060> it's<00:02:42.239> done<00:02:42.739> we'll<00:02:43.739> place<00:02:43.950> the

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
see how it's done we'll place the

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.870 
see how it's done we'll place the
charcloth<00:02:44.550> at<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.660> edge<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.590> flint<00:02:46.890> and

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
charcloth at the edge of the flint and

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.350 
charcloth at the edge of the flint and
then<00:02:48.690> begin<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.680> strike<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.190> flint<00:02:50.489> hoping

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
then begin to strike the flint hoping

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.780 
then begin to strike the flint hoping
that<00:02:51.560> some<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.739> sparks<00:02:55.130> land<00:02:56.130> on<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.580> char

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
that some of the sparks land on the char

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.170 
that some of the sparks land on the char
cloth<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.330> make<00:02:57.360> an<00:02:58.019> ember<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.880> prong<00:03:03.150> right

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
cloth and make an ember the prong right

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.410 
cloth and make an ember the prong right
now<00:03:03.540> we<00:03:03.599> say<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:04.049> wet<00:03:04.489> so<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.580> may<00:03:05.760> go<00:03:05.970> out<00:03:06.180> but

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
now we say it's wet so it may go out but

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.009 
now we say it's wet so it may go out but
let's<00:03:06.599> put<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:07.049> our<00:03:07.140> tinder<00:03:07.470> bundle<00:03:09.019> or

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
let's put it in our tinder bundle or

00:03:10.019 --> 00:04:00.589 
let's put it in our tinder bundle or
actually<00:03:10.500> kindling

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.970 

everything's<00:04:01.599> so<00:04:01.870> wet<00:04:02.049> they<00:04:02.260> see<00:04:02.319> a<00:04:02.500> hard<00:04:02.829> time

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
everything's so wet they see a hard time

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:28.030 
everything's so wet they see a hard time
catching

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:37.540 

and<00:04:28.610> finally<00:04:29.470> flame<00:04:34.540> we<00:04:35.540> can<00:04:35.720> then<00:04:36.520> try<00:04:37.520> to

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
and finally flame we can then try to

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:44.740 
and finally flame we can then try to
turn<00:04:37.880> that<00:04:38.530> small<00:04:39.530> flame<00:04:40.630> into<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.660> fire<00:04:43.750> the

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
turn that small flame into a fire the

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.920 
turn that small flame into a fire the
wood<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:45.050> we've<00:04:45.200> gathered<00:04:46.660> it's<00:04:47.660> dry<00:04:47.900> enough

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
wood that we've gathered it's dry enough

00:04:47.930 --> 00:05:07.950 
wood that we've gathered it's dry enough
and<00:04:48.710> allows<00:04:49.010> it

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.990 

and<00:05:08.500> there<00:05:08.620> you<00:05:08.710> have<00:05:08.740> it<00:05:08.919> you<00:05:09.580> managed<00:05:09.850> to

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
and there you have it you managed to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.650 
and there you have it you managed to
start<00:05:10.180> a<00:05:10.270> fire<00:05:10.539> using<00:05:11.229> this<00:05:11.590> very<00:05:12.430> basic<00:05:13.000> very

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
start a fire using this very basic very

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.469 
start a fire using this very basic very
old<00:05:14.020> method<00:05:14.320> in<00:05:14.979> the<00:05:15.100> flint<00:05:15.370> and<00:05:15.550> steel<00:05:15.580> even

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
old method in the flint and steel even

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.570 
old method in the flint and steel even
under<00:05:16.690> this<00:05:16.840> pretty<00:05:17.560> difficult<00:05:18.009> conditions<00:05:18.490> I

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
under this pretty difficult conditions I

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.129 
under this pretty difficult conditions I
mean<00:05:18.610> the<00:05:18.789> snow<00:05:19.000> is<00:05:19.150> coming<00:05:19.360> down<00:05:19.600> pretty<00:05:19.780> hard

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
mean the snow is coming down pretty hard

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.520 
mean the snow is coming down pretty hard
the<00:05:20.800> temperature<00:05:21.310> is<00:05:21.430> about<00:05:21.870> 10<00:05:22.870> degrees<00:05:23.050> or

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
the temperature is about 10 degrees or

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.120 
the temperature is about 10 degrees or
so<00:05:23.770> Fahrenheit<00:05:24.400> so<00:05:25.030> it's<00:05:25.180> cold<00:05:25.479> it's<00:05:26.110> wet<00:05:26.259> but

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
so Fahrenheit so it's cold it's wet but

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:34.909 
so Fahrenheit so it's cold it's wet but
the<00:05:27.280> method<00:05:27.550> works<00:05:27.789> quite<00:05:28.120> well

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.409 

make<00:05:35.919> sure<00:05:36.130> to<00:05:36.190> carry<00:05:36.580> appropriate<00:05:37.060> tinder

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
make sure to carry appropriate tinder

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.240 
make sure to carry appropriate tinder
right<00:05:37.600> now<00:05:38.139> if<00:05:38.350> I<00:05:38.470> was<00:05:38.590> trying<00:05:38.830> to<00:05:38.919> prepare

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
right now if I was trying to prepare

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.249 
right now if I was trying to prepare
tinder<00:05:39.729> for<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.270> flint<00:05:40.539> and<00:05:40.660> steel<00:05:40.690> method

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
tinder for the flint and steel method

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.290 
tinder for the flint and steel method
under<00:05:41.440> these<00:05:41.650> conditions<00:05:42.160> will<00:05:42.610> be<00:05:42.729> very<00:05:43.090> very

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
under these conditions will be very very

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.089 
under these conditions will be very very
difficult<00:05:43.660> you<00:05:44.410> can<00:05:44.560> use<00:05:44.680> different<00:05:44.889> things

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
difficult you can use different things

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.370 
difficult you can use different things
there<00:05:45.490> are<00:05:45.550> certain<00:05:45.669> plant<00:05:46.060> materials<00:05:46.660> that

there are certain plant materials that

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.650 
there are certain plant materials that
