00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
and put an e key on it so I'm just going

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:40.679 
and put an e key on it so I'm just going
to<00:01:39.490> roll<00:01:39.700> off<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.880> low<00:01:40.179> end<00:01:40.329> because<00:01:40.630> you

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
to roll off the low end because you

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:41.580

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.489 
don't really want any the low end
interfering<00:01:42.749> so<00:01:43.749> enable<00:01:44.079> some<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:44.259> just

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
interfering so enable some I just

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:46.080 
interfering so enable some I just
literally<00:01:45.009> rolled<00:01:45.249> it<00:01:45.340> off<00:01:45.429> there<00:01:45.609> 100<00:01:45.999> notes

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.840 
want to try and find snares that work
well<00:01:53.200> together<00:01:53.409> you'll<00:01:53.740> find<00:01:54.009> there<00:01:54.639> might<00:01:54.819> be

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
well together you'll find there might be

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.059 
well together you'll find there might be
some<00:01:55.179> that<00:01:55.719> have<00:01:55.960> very<00:01:56.319> very<00:01:56.709> slightly

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
some that have very very slightly

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:58.319 
some that have very very slightly
different<00:01:57.429> pitches<00:01:57.639> so<00:01:57.939> they<00:01:58.030> sound<00:01:58.179> a<00:01:58.299> bit

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
different pitches so they sound a bit

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.569 
different pitches so they sound a bit
weird<00:01:58.420> when<00:01:58.810> they<00:01:58.899> put<00:01:59.049> together<00:01:59.459> even<00:02:00.459> with

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
weird when they put together even with

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:01.649 
weird when they put together even with
any<00:02:00.700> e<00:02:00.759> queuing<00:02:01.209> and<00:02:01.299> stuff<00:02:01.479> like<00:02:01.600> that

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
any e queuing and stuff like that

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.690 
any e queuing and stuff like that
they'll<00:02:01.959> still<00:02:02.200> kind<00:02:02.770> of<00:02:02.799> phase<00:02:03.100> weirdly<00:02:03.490> and

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
they'll still kind of phase weirdly and

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.099 
they'll still kind of phase weirdly and
some<00:02:03.909> bit<00:02:04.209> weird<00:02:04.389> so<00:02:04.539> you<00:02:04.630> just<00:02:04.780> had<00:02:04.899> to<00:02:04.990> go

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
some bit weird so you just had to go

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:06.870 
some bit weird so you just had to go
through<00:02:05.380> them<00:02:05.499> and<00:02:05.619> find<00:02:05.679> ones<00:02:06.069> that<00:02:06.159> work

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
through them and find ones that work

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.580 
through them and find ones that work
well<00:02:07.030> together<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.659> takes<00:02:07.929> takes<00:02:08.380> quite<00:02:08.530> a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
well together it takes takes quite a

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.200 
well together it takes takes quite a
long<00:02:08.650> time<00:02:08.740> sometimes<00:02:09.130> defined<00:02:09.580> snares<00:02:10.060> that

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
long time sometimes defined snares that

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.490 
long time sometimes defined snares that
work<00:02:10.330> together<00:02:10.510> and<00:02:10.900> you<00:02:11.020> want<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.230> try<00:02:11.380> and

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
work together and you want to try and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.410 
work together and you want to try and
when<00:02:12.310> you're<00:02:12.400> putting<00:02:12.550> them<00:02:12.700> together<00:02:12.850> try

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
when you're putting them together try

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.800 
when you're putting them together try
and<00:02:13.510> find

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
and find

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.070 
and find
samples<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.739> have<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:16.480> know<00:02:16.510> elements<00:02:16.989> that

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
samples that have you know elements that

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.390 
samples that have you know elements that
you<00:02:17.140> want<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.410> bring<00:02:17.530> out<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.920> snare<00:02:18.130> so

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
you want to bring out in the snare so

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.589 
you want to bring out in the snare so
for<00:02:18.550> example<00:02:18.610> if<00:02:18.940> there's<00:02:19.120> one<00:02:19.270> that's<00:02:19.390> got<00:02:19.569> a

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
for example if there's one that's got a

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.449 
for example if there's one that's got a
really<00:02:19.840> really<00:02:20.140> really<00:02:20.319> fast<00:02:20.590> attack<00:02:20.920> that

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
really really really fast attack that

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.380 
really really really fast attack that
you<00:02:21.550> think<00:02:21.730> will<00:02:21.790> help<00:02:21.910> with<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.090> punch<00:02:22.300> then

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
you think will help with the punch then

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.180 
you think will help with the punch then
you<00:02:22.690> use<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.290> snare<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:23.860> just<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.160> know

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
you use that snare and just you know

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.550 
you use that snare and just you know
Ralph<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.670> low<00:02:24.790> end<00:02:24.910> or<00:02:25.180> use<00:02:26.080> that<00:02:26.319> or<00:02:26.500> if

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
Ralph the low end or use that or if

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.540 
Ralph the low end or use that or if
there's<00:02:26.739> one<00:02:26.830> that's<00:02:26.980> got<00:02:27.160> loads<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.459> loads

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
there's one that's got loads and loads

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.760 
there's one that's got loads and loads
of<00:02:27.790> physically<00:02:28.660> high<00:02:28.840> end<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.349> trails<00:02:29.590> off

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
of physically high end that trails off

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.870 
of physically high end that trails off
and<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.010> want<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.220> use<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.430> then<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.730> just

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
and you want to use that then you just

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.190 
and you want to use that then you just
do<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.269> then<00:02:31.330> roll<00:02:31.540> off<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.750> low<00:02:31.870> end<00:02:31.989> or

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
do that and then roll off the low end or

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.430 
do that and then roll off the low end or
you<00:02:32.470> know<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:34.630> it's<00:02:34.750> all<00:02:34.810> about<00:02:34.870> listening

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
you know so it's all about listening

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.410 
you know so it's all about listening
samples<00:02:36.099> put<00:02:36.580> them<00:02:36.730> together<00:02:36.849> and<00:02:37.030> see<00:02:37.180> it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
samples put them together and see it

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.170 
samples put them together and see it
it's<00:02:37.840> just<00:02:37.959> trying<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.349> narrow<00:02:38.470> really<00:02:39.180> but

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
it's just trying to narrow really but

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.180 
it's just trying to narrow really but
there<00:02:40.300> is<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:40.450> one<00:02:40.930> I'm<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.680> going<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.830> use

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
there is this one I'm just going to use

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.100 
there is this one I'm just going to use
this<00:02:42.400> bottom<00:02:43.209> one<00:02:43.239> here<00:02:43.599> I'm<00:02:43.750> trying<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:43.989> copy

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
this bottom one here I'm trying to copy

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.559 
this bottom one here I'm trying to copy
this<00:02:44.260> down<00:02:44.319> so<00:02:44.769> i'll<00:02:44.860> show<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.239> what<00:02:46.239> this<00:02:46.390> one

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
this down so i'll show you what this one

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:55.229 
this down so i'll show you what this one
sounds<00:02:46.900> like<00:02:50.819> that's<00:02:51.819> this<00:02:51.970> group<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:55.090> this<00:02:55.209> is

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
sounds like that's this group so this is

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.690 
sounds like that's this group so this is
a<00:02:55.360> kind<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.870> punchy<00:02:56.200> one<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:57.370> here<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.760> don't<00:02:59.700> so

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
a kind of punchy one so here it don't so

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.800 
a kind of punchy one so here it don't so
these<00:03:00.790> technically<00:03:01.209> have<00:03:01.330> very<00:03:01.510> different

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
these technically have very different

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.509 
these technically have very different
you<00:03:02.140> know<00:03:02.260> tones<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.769> stuff<00:03:02.980> at<00:03:03.130> that<00:03:03.250> but

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
you know tones and stuff at that but

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.270 
you know tones and stuff at that but
they<00:03:04.360> work<00:03:04.630> when<00:03:05.140> they<00:03:05.230> put<00:03:05.380> together<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:05.920> I'll

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
they work when they put together so I'll

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.860 
they work when they put together so I'll
just<00:03:06.340> keep<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:07.510> together<00:03:12.720> currently<00:03:13.720> hear

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
just keep that together currently hear

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.699 
just keep that together currently hear
any<00:03:14.049> weird<00:03:14.530> phasing<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.010> differences<00:03:16.709> and

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
any weird phasing and differences and

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:18.930 
any weird phasing and differences and
it's<00:03:17.859> maybe<00:03:18.070> some<00:03:18.250> slight<00:03:18.459> differences<00:03:18.609> but

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
it's maybe some slight differences but

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.699 
it's maybe some slight differences but
we're<00:03:19.090> going<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.269> do<00:03:19.420> is<00:03:19.540> like<00:03:20.109> really<00:03:20.380> heavily

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
we're going to do is like really heavily

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.240 
we're going to do is like really heavily
compress<00:03:21.220> one<00:03:21.459> maybe<00:03:21.760> so<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.030> lose<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.450> tone

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
compress one maybe so you lose the tone

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.530 
compress one maybe so you lose the tone
so<00:03:24.250> yeah<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:24.730> might<00:03:25.329> want<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.570> select<00:03:27.510> one<00:03:28.510> of

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
so yeah you might want to select one of

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.120 
so yeah you might want to select one of
these<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.079> compress<00:03:29.350> it<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.530> little<00:03:29.709> bit<00:03:29.920> and

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
these and compress it a little bit and

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.349 
these and compress it a little bit and
then<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.370> other<00:03:30.400> one<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.700> compress<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.120> a<00:03:31.180> lot

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
then the other one and compress it a lot

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.240 
then the other one and compress it a lot
again<00:03:32.019> I'm<00:03:32.410> really<00:03:32.530> sorry<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.890> can't<00:03:33.130> really

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
again I'm really sorry I can't really

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.890 
again I'm really sorry I can't really
show<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:33.760> how<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.000> create<00:03:34.329> like<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.660> really

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
show you how to create like a really

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.020 
show you how to create like a really
definite<00:03:35.470> step<00:03:36.220> by<00:03:36.340> step<00:03:36.640> on<00:03:36.730> how<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:36.880> create

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
definite step by step on how to create

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.220 
definite step by step on how to create
us<00:03:37.269> know<00:03:37.420> because<00:03:37.569> it's<00:03:37.870> just<00:03:38.019> going<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.170> be

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
us know because it's just going to be

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.990 
us know because it's just going to be
different<00:03:38.440> all<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.709> time<00:03:38.799> but<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.790> one

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
different all the time but the one

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.309 
different all the time but the one
feature<00:03:40.359> that<00:03:40.720> I'm<00:03:40.870> going<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.019> get<00:03:41.170> through

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
feature that I'm going to get through

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.370 
feature that I'm going to get through
now<00:03:41.790> which<00:03:42.790> is<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.660> killer<00:03:43.840> feature<00:03:44.079> really

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
now which is the killer feature really

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.690 
now which is the killer feature really
is<00:03:44.639> using<00:03:45.639> a<00:03:45.730> Tom<00:03:45.970> sample<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:47.109> this<00:03:47.980> Tom<00:03:48.250> sample

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
is using a Tom sample so this Tom sample

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.470 
is using a Tom sample so this Tom sample
here<00:03:48.970> which<00:03:49.450> I've<00:03:49.600> used<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:50.880> dragon<00:03:51.880> here

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.129 

script<00:03:55.480> now<00:03:56.579> now<00:03:57.579> you'll<00:03:57.700> see<00:03:57.810> what<00:03:58.810> I've<00:03:58.930> done

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
script now now you'll see what I've done

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.250 
script now now you'll see what I've done
just<00:04:00.040> set<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:00.190> back<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.519> zero<00:04:00.760> in<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.840> master

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
just set that back to zero in the master

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.129 
just set that back to zero in the master
channel<00:04:03.239> others<00:04:04.239> compressor<00:04:04.630> here<00:04:04.840> but<00:04:04.989> I'm

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
channel others compressor here but I'm

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.289 
channel others compressor here but I'm
yeah<00:04:06.130> that's<00:04:06.310> just<00:04:06.459> extra<00:04:06.700> compression<00:04:06.910> I'll

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
yeah that's just extra compression I'll

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.640 
yeah that's just extra compression I'll
turn<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.569> off<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.780> moment<00:04:08.049> you'll<00:04:08.440> see<00:04:08.560> I've

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
turn it off the moment you'll see I've

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.080 
turn it off the moment you'll see I've
got<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.980> spectrum<00:04:09.400> analyzer<00:04:09.700> which<00:04:09.880> you<00:04:09.970> can

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
got the spectrum analyzer which you can

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.830 
got the spectrum analyzer which you can
find<00:04:10.120> here<00:04:11.430> spectrum<00:04:12.430> this<00:04:13.420> basically<00:04:13.660> shows

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
find here spectrum this basically shows

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.710 
find here spectrum this basically shows
you<00:04:14.319> I<00:04:15.090> just<00:04:16.090> solo<00:04:16.450> out<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.900> Tom<00:04:18.389> you<00:04:19.389> can<00:04:19.510> see

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
you I just solo out the Tom you can see

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.440 
you I just solo out the Tom you can see
there<00:04:19.930> that<00:04:19.959> speaking<00:04:20.909> about<00:04:22.169> 166<00:04:23.169> hurts<00:04:24.450> can

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
there that speaking about 166 hurts can

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.020 
there that speaking about 166 hurts can
see<00:04:25.599> that<00:04:25.750> peak<00:04:25.930> there<00:04:26.280> what<00:04:27.280> you<00:04:27.340> want<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.550> do

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
see that peak there what you want to do

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.790 
see that peak there what you want to do
you<00:04:28.120> want<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.330> get<00:04:28.480> that<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.990> about<00:04:29.110> 200

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
you want to get that to about 200

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.890 
you want to get that to about 200
because<00:04:30.130> everyone<00:04:30.490> talks<00:04:30.940> about<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.270> 200<00:04:31.750> the

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
because everyone talks about the 200 the

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.720 
because everyone talks about the 200 the
magic<00:04:32.170> 200<00:04:32.500> number<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.800> snares<00:04:33.040> so<00:04:33.639> we're

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
magic 200 number of snares so we're

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
magic 200 number of snares so we're
gonna<00:04:33.850> do<00:04:33.970> is<00:04:34.060> you<00:04:34.150> want<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.360> go<00:04:34.450> into<00:04:34.600> the

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
gonna do is you want to go into the

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.500 
gonna do is you want to go into the
actual<00:04:35.020> sample<00:04:35.530> of<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:36.280> Tom<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:36.730> you<00:04:37.330> want<00:04:37.450> to

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
actual sample of the Tom and you want to

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.400 
actual sample of the Tom and you want to
pitch<00:04:37.690> it<00:04:37.840> up<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.960> might<00:04:41.080> take<00:04:41.260> a<00:04:41.290> few

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
pitch it up and it might take a few

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.170 
pitch it up and it might take a few
trial<00:04:41.919> and<00:04:42.040> error<00:04:42.130> goes<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.610> pitching<00:04:43.000> it<00:04:43.090> up

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
trial and error goes of pitching it up

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.970 
trial and error goes of pitching it up
and<00:04:43.450> then<00:04:43.600> looking<00:04:43.750> back<00:04:43.870> at<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.260> spectrum

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
and then looking back at the spectrum

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.600 
and then looking back at the spectrum
once<00:04:45.310> you<00:04:45.430> once<00:04:45.669> you're<00:04:45.820> playing<00:04:46.000> again<00:04:47.610> so

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
once you once you're playing again so

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.080 
once you once you're playing again so
pretty<00:04:48.880> much<00:04:48.970> bang<00:04:49.240> on<00:04:49.419> there<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:50.639> don't<00:04:51.639> seven

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
pretty much bang on there I don't seven

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.280 
pretty much bang on there I don't seven
so<00:04:52.240> I'm<00:04:52.300> just<00:04:52.389> going<00:04:52.510> to<00:04:52.570> put<00:04:52.690> it<00:04:52.720> back<00:04:52.840> on<00:04:52.900> 7

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
so I'm just going to put it back on 7

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.290 
so I'm just going to put it back on 7
between<00:04:54.130> 200<00:04:54.669> and<00:04:54.700> 250<00:04:55.000> is<00:04:55.540> really<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.080> key<00:04:57.300> so

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
between 200 and 250 is really the key so

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.370 
between 200 and 250 is really the key so
you<00:04:58.330> get<00:04:58.480> that<00:04:58.570> noise<00:04:58.780> and<00:04:59.020> obviously<00:04:59.290> that

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
you get that noise and obviously that

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.630 
you get that noise and obviously that
noise<00:04:59.650> doesn't<00:04:59.980> really<00:05:00.220> have<00:05:00.370> that<00:05:00.400> much

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
noise doesn't really have that much

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.860 
noise doesn't really have that much
punch<00:05:00.910> but<00:05:01.120> then<00:05:01.210> if<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.390> put<00:05:01.540> that<00:05:01.660> with<00:05:01.810> the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
punch but then if you put that with the

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:09.360 
punch but then if you put that with the
compressed<00:05:02.290> other<00:05:02.530> two<00:05:02.770> layers<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:08.370> exam

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
compressed other two layers and exam

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.530 
compressed other two layers and exam
clipping<00:05:09.669> horribly<00:05:09.880> I'm<00:05:10.030> really<00:05:10.270> sorted<00:05:10.510> out

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
clipping horribly I'm really sorted out

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.240 
clipping horribly I'm really sorted out
the<00:05:10.600> mixing<00:05:10.990> but<00:05:11.200> you<00:05:11.500> can<00:05:11.680> tell<00:05:11.890> it's<00:05:12.070> got

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
the mixing but you can tell it's got

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.960 
the mixing but you can tell it's got
like<00:05:12.520> without<00:05:12.730> without<00:05:13.150> that<00:05:13.419> Tom<00:05:14.970> that's

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
like without without that Tom that's

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.390 
like without without that Tom that's
really<00:05:16.540> punchy<00:05:16.990> but<00:05:17.650> it<00:05:17.740> has<00:05:17.919> its<00:05:17.950> really

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
really punchy but it has its really

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.430 
really punchy but it has its really
lacks<00:05:18.610> body<00:05:18.880> even<00:05:19.120> though<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:19.810> might<00:05:19.960> eq<00:05:20.320> them

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
lacks body even though you might eq them

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.930 
lacks body even though you might eq them
to<00:05:20.560> picture<00:05:20.860> 200<00:05:21.310> they<00:05:21.400> might<00:05:21.550> not<00:05:21.610> be<00:05:21.729> a<00:05:21.760> lot

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
to picture 200 they might not be a lot

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.580 
to picture 200 they might not be a lot
better<00:05:22.120> at<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.330> boost<00:05:22.630> but<00:05:23.260> if<00:05:23.350> you<00:05:23.440> add<00:05:23.560> that

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
better at a boost but if you add that

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.110 
better at a boost but if you add that
Tom<00:05:25.050> really<00:05:26.050> really<00:05:26.380> hits<00:05:26.590> you<00:05:26.680> hard<00:05:27.120> so

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
Tom really really hits you hard so

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.879 
Tom really really hits you hard so
that's<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.540> golden<00:05:28.900> tip<00:05:29.139> really<00:05:29.350> i<00:05:29.620> mean<00:05:29.650> i

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
that's the golden tip really i mean i

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.540 
that's the golden tip really i mean i
can't<00:05:30.100> really<00:05:30.250> tell<00:05:30.490> you<00:05:30.580> a<00:05:30.639> lot<00:05:30.790> about<00:05:32.520> how<00:05:33.520> I

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
can't really tell you a lot about how I

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.740 
can't really tell you a lot about how I
make<00:05:33.820> my<00:05:34.060> snares<00:05:34.300> because<00:05:34.540> they're<00:05:34.660> all

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
make my snares because they're all

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.600 
make my snares because they're all
different<00:05:34.930> I<00:05:35.229> mean<00:05:35.410> there<00:05:35.860> are<00:05:35.979> sample<00:05:36.460> packs

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
different I mean there are sample packs

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.070 
different I mean there are sample packs
with<00:05:36.790> thousands<00:05:37.330> of<00:05:37.390> snares<00:05:37.660> and<00:05:37.750> you<00:05:37.990> just

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
with thousands of snares and you just

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.330 
with thousands of snares and you just
got<00:05:38.229> to<00:05:38.260> find<00:05:38.470> ones<00:05:38.710> that<00:05:38.770> work<00:05:39.010> well<00:05:39.130> together

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
got to find ones that work well together

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.640 
got to find ones that work well together
that<00:05:40.210> suit<00:05:40.840> the<00:05:40.990> track<00:05:41.229> that<00:05:41.260> you're<00:05:41.470> trying

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
that suit the track that you're trying

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.870 
that suit the track that you're trying
to<00:05:41.710> make<00:05:41.860> but<00:05:42.190> if<00:05:42.310> you<00:05:42.400> really<00:05:42.550> want<00:05:42.729> to<00:05:42.760> get

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
to make but if you really want to get

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.540 
to make but if you really want to get
these<00:05:43.060> powerful<00:05:43.419> snares<00:05:43.900> then<00:05:44.590> you<00:05:45.400> know

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
these powerful snares then you know

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.340 
these powerful snares then you know
they're<00:05:45.970> only<00:05:46.090> a<00:05:46.180> few<00:05:46.419> kind<00:05:46.690> of<00:05:46.750> really<00:05:46.960> basic

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
they're only a few kind of really basic

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.810 
they're only a few kind of really basic

this is one of them as pitch tom is one
of<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.370> key<00:05:51.550> things<00:05:51.580> I've<00:05:52.000> learnt<00:05:52.560> to<00:05:53.560> getting

of the key things I've learnt to getting

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.920 
of the key things I've learnt to getting
that<00:05:54.130> really<00:05:54.460> kind<00:05:54.580> of<00:05:54.669> Kern<00:05:55.030> sound<00:05:55.390> Skrillex

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
that really kind of Kern sound Skrillex

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.529 
that really kind of Kern sound Skrillex
type<00:05:56.110> of<00:05:56.260> snare<00:05:56.820> you<00:05:57.820> think<00:05:58.000> that<00:05:58.150> the<00:05:58.300> kind<00:05:58.479> of

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
type of snare you think that the kind of

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.200 
type of snare you think that the kind of
noise<00:05:58.950> you<00:05:59.950> can<00:06:00.130> do<00:06:00.280> this<00:06:00.400> in<00:06:00.640> any<00:06:00.820> other

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
noise you can do this in any other

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.230 
noise you can do this in any other
digital<00:06:01.690> audio<00:06:01.930> workstation<00:06:02.700> it<00:06:03.700> can<00:06:04.090> be

digital audio workstation it can be

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.510 
digital audio workstation it can be
easier<00:06:04.570> for<00:06:04.600> example<00:06:05.050> in<00:06:05.110> logic<00:06:05.440> I<00:06:05.620> don't<00:06:06.430> know

if<00:06:06.580> any<00:06:06.760> of<00:06:06.820> you<00:06:06.910> guys<00:06:07.030> have<00:06:07.300> followed<00:06:07.570> me<00:06:07.660> but

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
if any of you guys have followed me but

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.420 
if any of you guys have followed me but
I've<00:06:07.870> recently<00:06:08.229> purchase<00:06:08.800> logic<00:06:09.100> and<00:06:09.220> i'll<00:06:09.280> be

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
I've recently purchase logic and i'll be

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.460 
I've recently purchase logic and i'll be
using<00:06:09.789> that<00:06:10.090> a<00:06:10.390> lot<00:06:10.660> more<00:06:10.870> now<00:06:11.020> to<00:06:11.080> produce

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
using that a lot more now to produce

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.290 
using that a lot more now to produce
produced<00:06:12.250> my<00:06:12.340> music<00:06:12.610> but<00:06:12.700> they<00:06:12.850> in<00:06:13.060> their

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
produced my music but they in their

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.270 
produced my music but they in their
equaliser<00:06:14.020> they've<00:06:14.380> got<00:06:14.500> a<00:06:14.530> an<00:06:14.770> analyzer

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
equaliser they've got a an analyzer

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.100 
equaliser they've got a an analyzer
within<00:06:15.700> the<00:06:15.940> queue<00:06:16.300> so<00:06:16.479> you<00:06:16.570> can<00:06:16.690> actually<00:06:16.810> see

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
within the queue so you can actually see

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.740 
within the queue so you can actually see
what's<00:06:17.890> happening<00:06:18.520> with<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:19.270> frequencies

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
what's happening with the frequencies

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.000 
what's happening with the frequencies
while<00:06:19.960> you're<00:06:20.200> changing<00:06:20.380> it<00:06:20.650> which<00:06:20.770> is<00:06:20.890> quite

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
while you're changing it which is quite

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.790 
while you're changing it which is quite
useful<00:06:21.400> in<00:06:21.580> Ableton<00:06:22.570> it's<00:06:22.690> a<00:06:22.750> bit<00:06:22.930> kind<00:06:23.260> of<00:06:23.289> you

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
useful in Ableton it's a bit kind of you

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.940 
useful in Ableton it's a bit kind of you
have<00:06:23.919> to<00:06:24.390> transpose<00:06:25.390> it<00:06:25.660> and<00:06:25.810> then<00:06:26.080> go<00:06:26.770> back<00:06:26.890> to

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950 
have to transpose it and then go back to

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.260 
have to transpose it and then go back to
the<00:06:27.100> master<00:06:27.400> and<00:06:27.490> check<00:06:27.700> it<00:06:27.910> and<00:06:28.000> stuff<00:06:28.210> like

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
the master and check it and stuff like

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.630 
the master and check it and stuff like
that<00:06:28.330> but<00:06:29.289> um<00:06:29.470> yeah<00:06:29.830> if<00:06:30.010> you<00:06:30.130> can<00:06:30.250> do<00:06:30.400> it<00:06:30.460> in<00:06:30.520> any

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
that but um yeah if you can do it in any

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.360 
that but um yeah if you can do it in any
but<00:06:30.910> that's<00:06:31.150> the<00:06:31.510> main<00:06:31.930> key<00:06:32.169> so<00:06:32.500> that's<00:06:32.830> when<00:06:33.340> I

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
but that's the main key so that's when I

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.790 
but that's the main key so that's when I
what<00:06:33.700> you<00:06:33.760> can<00:06:33.850> take<00:06:34.000> away<00:06:34.150> you<00:06:34.750> can<00:06:34.900> then<00:06:35.050> mix

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
what you can take away you can then mix

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.790 
what you can take away you can then mix
it<00:06:36.479> I'll<00:06:37.479> show<00:06:37.659> you<00:06:37.720> the<00:06:37.810> compressor<00:06:38.590> the

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
it I'll show you the compressor the

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.330 
it I'll show you the compressor the

used just to because I know something
written<00:06:42.160> I<00:06:42.250> asked<00:06:42.460> yeah<00:06:43.000> this<00:06:43.150> first<00:06:43.360> track

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
written I asked yeah this first track

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.320 
written I asked yeah this first track
I've<00:06:43.750> just<00:06:43.900> rolled<00:06:44.139> off<00:06:45.000> right<00:06:46.000> off<00:06:46.030> the<00:06:46.210> low

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
I've just rolled off right off the low

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.390 
I've just rolled off right off the low

actually<00:06:48.460> at<00:06:48.699> all<00:06:48.820> the<00:06:49.630> Tom<00:06:50.350> I've<00:06:50.740> rolled<00:06:51.430> off

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
actually at all the Tom I've rolled off

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.040 
actually at all the Tom I've rolled off
the<00:06:51.699> land<00:06:51.850> and<00:06:52.030> I've<00:06:52.210> given<00:06:52.479> it<00:06:52.540> an<00:06:52.630> extra

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
the land and I've given it an extra

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.810 
the land and I've given it an extra
boost<00:06:53.169> in<00:06:53.410> the<00:06:53.500> EQ<00:06:53.800> at<00:06:53.889> about<00:06:54.070> 200<00:06:54.460> Hertz<00:06:54.580> and

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
boost in the EQ at about 200 Hertz and

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.909 
boost in the EQ at about 200 Hertz and
then<00:06:55.300> roll<00:06:55.510> off<00:06:55.630> the<00:06:55.660> very<00:06:55.960> high<00:06:56.169> end<00:06:56.199> and<00:06:56.650> then

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919 
then roll off the very high end and then

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.280 
then roll off the very high end and then
the<00:06:57.040> final<00:06:57.190> one<00:06:57.660> there's<00:06:58.660> no<00:06:58.840> compression<00:06:59.110> or

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
the final one there's no compression or

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.350 
the final one there's no compression or
anything<00:06:59.590> in<00:07:00.280> that<00:07:00.490> I<00:07:00.699> know<00:07:01.120> what<00:07:01.210> I've<00:07:01.300> done

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
anything in that I know what I've done

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.469 
anything in that I know what I've done
is<00:07:01.479> I've<00:07:01.570> written<00:07:01.750> together<00:07:02.790> and<00:07:03.790> in<00:07:04.389> the

is I've written together and in the
group<00:07:04.660> I've<00:07:04.930> put<00:07:05.199> a<00:07:05.229> compressor<00:07:05.530> and<00:07:05.949> I've

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:06.729

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:08.580 
group I've put a compressor and I've
compressed<00:07:07.270> it<00:07:07.360> quite<00:07:07.540> a<00:07:07.570> bit<00:07:07.630> about<00:07:08.020> 28

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:08.590 
compressed it quite a bit about 28

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.980 
compressed it quite a bit about 28
decibels<00:07:09.040> or<00:07:10.080> model<00:07:11.080> ff1<00:07:11.850> with<00:07:12.850> a<00:07:12.990> relatively

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
decibels or model ff1 with a relatively

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.750 
decibels or model ff1 with a relatively
short<00:07:14.050> stack<00:07:14.500> and<00:07:15.120> fast<00:07:16.120> release<00:07:16.389> as<00:07:16.570> well

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:17.760 
short stack and fast release as well

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.100 
short stack and fast release as well
just<00:07:18.760> compress<00:07:19.180> quite<00:07:19.419> a<00:07:19.450> lot<00:07:19.630> and<00:07:19.810> then<00:07:20.020> in

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110 
just compress quite a lot and then in

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.540 
just compress quite a lot and then in
the<00:07:20.169> master<00:07:20.590> obviously<00:07:21.070> got<00:07:21.160> that<00:07:21.250> spectrum

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
the master obviously got that spectrum

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.530 
the master obviously got that spectrum
analyzer<00:07:21.850> we're<00:07:21.970> talking<00:07:22.150> about<00:07:22.270> and<00:07:22.450> then

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:22.540 
analyzer we're talking about and then

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.159 
analyzer we're talking about and then
another<00:07:22.750> compressor<00:07:24.150> just<00:07:25.150> limits<00:07:25.450> it<00:07:25.600> so

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:26.169 
another compressor just limits it so

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:29.300 
another compressor just limits it so
it's<00:07:26.290> peaking<00:07:26.919> nicely<00:07:27.280> below<00:07:27.820> the<00:07:28.060> threshold

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 
it's peaking nicely below the threshold

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.340 
it's peaking nicely below the threshold
they<00:07:30.310> get<00:07:30.550> sort<00:07:31.060> of<00:07:31.090> tipping<00:07:31.389> it<00:07:31.479> off<00:07:31.570> you<00:07:31.810> when

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:32.350 
they get sort of tipping it off you when

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.140 
they get sort of tipping it off you when
it<00:07:32.440> comes<00:07:32.590> to<00:07:32.740> making<00:07:32.860> nice<00:07:33.580> powerful<00:07:33.910> snares

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.150 
it comes to making nice powerful snares

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.240 
it comes to making nice powerful snares
