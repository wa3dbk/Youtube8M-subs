being happy now the thing about

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.200 
being happy now the thing about
happiness<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.220> moving<00:01:26.850> target

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
happiness is it's a moving target

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.850 
happiness is it's a moving target
happiness<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.049> not<00:01:28.080> something<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.740> can

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
happiness is not something that we can

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.469 
happiness is not something that we can
just<00:01:28.890> achieve<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:30.000> forever

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
just achieve and then we have forever

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.569 
just achieve and then we have forever
and<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.350> honest<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.920> some<00:01:32.159> ways<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.369> think

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and to be honest in some ways I think

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.819 
and to be honest in some ways I think
that<00:01:32.880> happiness<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.390> sometimes<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
that happiness can sometimes be like a

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.640 
that happiness can sometimes be like a
lie<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.150> know<00:01:36.270> with<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.810> social<00:01:37.320> media<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
lie you know with with social media a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.260 
lie you know with with social media a
lot<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.100> people<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.430> dependent<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:38.939> social

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
lot of people like dependent on social

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.999 
lot of people like dependent on social
media<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.780> well<00:01:40.259> now<00:01:40.409> because<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.770> social

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
