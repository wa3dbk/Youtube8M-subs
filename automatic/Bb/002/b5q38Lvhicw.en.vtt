00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
originality and that's kind of a thing I

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.210 
originality and that's kind of a thing I
kind<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.780> noticed<00:01:24.840> when<00:01:25.680> I've<00:01:25.770> been<00:01:25.890> watching

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
kind of noticed when I've been watching

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.300 
kind of noticed when I've been watching
game<00:01:26.400> plays<00:01:26.640> such<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.479> one<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:29.250> you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
game plays such as this one so you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.679 
game plays such as this one so you
probably<00:01:29.340> finger<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.909> yourselves<00:01:30.210> why<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.509> he

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
probably finger to yourselves why is he

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.480 
probably finger to yourselves why is he
saying<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.049> originality<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.829> important<00:01:32.400> but

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
saying I originality so important but

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.819 
saying I originality so important but
the<00:01:32.579> reason<00:01:32.759> why<00:01:33.240> originality<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.650> so

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the reason why originality is so

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.109 
the reason why originality is so
important<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.430> if<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.670> didn't<00:01:35.880> think<00:01:36.060> about

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
important and if you didn't think about

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.880 
important and if you didn't think about
that<00:01:36.240> at<00:01:36.509> all<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:37.200> now<00:01:37.380> you're<00:01:37.560> thinking

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that at all then now you're thinking

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.800 
that at all then now you're thinking
