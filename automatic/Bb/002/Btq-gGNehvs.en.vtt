00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:13.070 
hey guys um in this video I'm going to
talk<00:00:05.250> about<00:00:05.430> how<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:09.889> sanitize<00:00:11.840> wooden<00:00:12.840> rocks

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
talk about how to sanitize wooden rocks

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.760 
talk about how to sanitize wooden rocks
from<00:00:13.920> outside<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:15.269> first<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.780> all<00:00:15.870> would<00:00:18.770> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
from outside so first of all would the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.080 
from outside so first of all would the
common<00:00:20.130> method<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.520> baking<00:00:21.090> wood<00:00:21.800> for<00:00:22.970> two<00:00:23.970> to

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
common method is baking wood for two to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.839 
common method is baking wood for two to
three<00:00:24.119> hours<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:25.019> 200<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.039> 250

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
three hours on 200 to 250

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.419 
three hours on 200 to 250
um<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.720> don't<00:00:27.810> suggest<00:00:28.140> going<00:00:28.680> over<00:00:28.890> 250

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
um I don't suggest going over 250

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.950 
um I don't suggest going over 250
because<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.970> will<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.359> increase<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
because that will just increase the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.709 
because that will just increase the
chances<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.500> fire<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.219> will<00:00:32.340> not<00:00:32.540> kill<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
chances of fire and it will not kill the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.790 
chances of fire and it will not kill the
bacteria<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.559> parasites<00:00:35.160> faster<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.710> just

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
bacteria and parasites faster so so just

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.540 
bacteria and parasites faster so so just
go<00:00:38.010> 200<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.090> 250<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.780> your<00:00:40.050> oven<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.430> know

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
go 200 to 250 on your oven and you know

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.910 
go 200 to 250 on your oven and you know
bake<00:00:41.820> or<00:00:42.090> whatever<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.640> do<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:45.469> for<00:00:46.469> 2<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> 3

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
bake or whatever and do that for 2 to 3

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.090 
bake or whatever and do that for 2 to 3
hours<00:00:47.300> this<00:00:48.300> piece<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> wood<00:00:48.860> it's<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> lot

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
hours this piece of wood it's a lot

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.580 
hours this piece of wood it's a lot
thinner<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.059> would<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:51.899> 2<00:00:52.140> hours

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
thinner so I would do that for 2 hours

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.740 
thinner so I would do that for 2 hours
this<00:00:53.160> one's<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.430> little<00:00:53.489> bit<00:00:53.699> more<00:00:53.730> thick<00:00:54.210> so

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
this one's a little bit more thick so

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.580 
this one's a little bit more thick so
I'd<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.230> for<00:00:55.469> 3<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> did<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.579> 3<00:00:56.940> hours

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
I'd do it for 3 or I did it 3 hours

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.420 
I'd do it for 3 or I did it 3 hours
ok<00:00:58.590> um<00:00:59.840> if<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.930> don't<00:01:01.079> want<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> do<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.500> or<00:01:01.770> or

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
ok um if you don't want to do that or or

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.710 
ok um if you don't want to do that or or
the<00:01:03.059> wood<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.660> too<00:01:03.870> big<00:01:04.970> now<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> only<00:01:06.240> suggest

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the wood is too big now I only suggest

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.750 
the wood is too big now I only suggest
um<00:01:07.700> doing<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> other<00:01:09.650> option<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.549> woods

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
um doing the other option if the woods

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
um doing the other option if the woods
too<00:01:11.970> big<00:01:12.180> because<00:01:13.280> it<00:01:14.280> definitely<00:01:15.560> takes<00:01:16.560> more

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
too big because it definitely takes more

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.429 
too big because it definitely takes more
time<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.670> second<00:01:17.970> option<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> bleach

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
time so the second option is to bleach

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.840 
time so the second option is to bleach
it<00:01:20.180> well<00:01:21.180> soak<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.990> Bleach<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.460> do<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> 1

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
it well soak it in Bleach and you do a 1

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.410 
it well soak it in Bleach and you do a 1
to<00:01:23.970> 10<00:01:24.150> ratio<00:01:24.330> bleach<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.020> water<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:26.420> yeah

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
to 10 ratio bleach the water and yeah

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.390 
to 10 ratio bleach the water and yeah
you<00:01:27.479> soak<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.140> probably<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.710> about<00:01:28.920> 45

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
you soak it probably for about 45

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.359 
you soak it probably for about 45
minutes<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.119> an<00:01:30.180> hour<00:01:30.829> depending<00:01:32.780> on<00:01:33.780> how<00:01:33.930> big

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
minutes to an hour depending on how big

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.090 
minutes to an hour depending on how big
if<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.670> big<00:01:36.119> piece<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.450> wood<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.100> can't

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
if it's a big piece of wood that can't

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.340 
if it's a big piece of wood that can't
fit<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.570> these<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.900> would<00:01:40.020> only<00:01:40.140> do

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
fit like one of these I would only do

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.700 
fit like one of these I would only do
for<00:01:40.530> 2<00:01:40.890> or<00:01:41.070> 3<00:01:41.100> hours<00:01:44.360> if<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.600> dryer<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.020> it's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
for 2 or 3 hours if it's a dryer if it's

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.870 
for 2 or 3 hours if it's a dryer if it's
a<00:01:46.829> big<00:01:47.070> piece<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.369> wood<00:01:47.670> um<00:01:49.399> you<00:01:50.399> know<00:01:50.520> you're

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.970 
drain the bleach water and put in fresh
water<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.810> change<00:02:34.290> out<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.680> fresh<00:02:34.950> water

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
water and change out that fresh water

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.220 
water and change out that fresh water
every<00:02:35.340> 30<00:02:35.730> minutes<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.060> an<00:02:36.150> hour<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:37.110> you

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
every 30 minutes to an hour so that you

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.130 
every 30 minutes to an hour so that you
take<00:02:37.650> all<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.010> bleach<00:02:38.819> out<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.110> wood<00:02:40.590> and

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
take all that bleach out of the wood and

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.449 
take all that bleach out of the wood and
depending<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.200> how<00:02:43.319> big<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.250> could<00:02:44.430> be

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
depending on how big it is this could be

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.330 
depending on how big it is this could be
a<00:02:44.580> two<00:02:44.879> to<00:02:44.940> three<00:02:45.269> day<00:02:45.299> process<00:02:46.220> because<00:02:47.220> if

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
a two to three day process because if

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
a two to three day process because if
it's<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.519> gigantic<00:02:48.390> piece<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.959> wood<00:02:50.360> you're

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
it's a gigantic piece of wood you're

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.850 
it's a gigantic piece of wood you're
gonna<00:02:51.510> want<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.959> stretch<00:02:52.470> out<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.709> water

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
gonna want to stretch out to water

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.000 
gonna want to stretch out to water
probably<00:02:53.099> every<00:02:53.370> two<00:02:53.760> hours

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
probably every two hours

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.550 
probably every two hours
so<00:02:56.010> yeah<00:02:56.160> it's<00:02:56.370> mainly<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.880> two<00:02:57.599> day<00:02:57.780> two<00:02:58.500> to

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
so yeah it's mainly a two day two to

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.890 
so yeah it's mainly a two day two to
three<00:02:58.769> day<00:02:58.890> process<00:02:59.299> it's<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.360> big<00:03:00.599> piece<00:03:00.840> of

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
three day process it's a big piece of

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.059 
three day process it's a big piece of
wood<00:03:01.170> um<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.769> don't

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
wood um I don't

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.910 
wood um I don't
least<00:03:02.400> just<00:03:02.700> bleaching<00:03:03.329> nice<00:03:03.739> because<00:03:04.739> you

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
least just bleaching nice because you

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.030 
least just bleaching nice because you
can<00:03:05.069> just<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:06.120> know<00:03:06.150> bake<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.750> I'll<00:03:07.349> remember

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
can just you know bake it I'll remember

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.350 
can just you know bake it I'll remember
200<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.000> 250<00:03:10.610> 4<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.730> 3<00:03:11.970> hours

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
200 to 250 4 to 3 hours

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.080 
200 to 250 4 to 3 hours
um<00:03:13.849> fire<00:03:14.849> or<00:03:15.150> wood<00:03:15.510> actually<00:03:15.750> burns<00:03:16.430> at<00:03:17.430> 500

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
um fire or wood actually burns at 500

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.710 
um fire or wood actually burns at 500
degrees<00:03:18.359> Fahrenheit<00:03:18.389> so<00:03:20.209> yeah<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.420> know<00:03:21.450> hot

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
degrees Fahrenheit so yeah you know hot

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.420 
degrees Fahrenheit so yeah you know hot
spots<00:03:22.049> can<00:03:22.319> occur<00:03:22.590> in<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.799> wood<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.190> catch

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
spots can occur in the wood and catch

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.849 
spots can occur in the wood and catch
fire<00:03:23.700> but<00:03:24.690> that's<00:03:25.019> why<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.230> just<00:03:25.410> watch<00:03:25.620> it

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
fire but that's why you just watch it

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.879 
fire but that's why you just watch it
just<00:03:26.370> keep<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.670> close<00:03:26.819> watch<00:03:26.910> on<00:03:27.359> it<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:28.170> yeah

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
just keep a close watch on it and yeah

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.039 
just keep a close watch on it and yeah
that's<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.250> woods<00:03:30.239> pretty<00:03:30.480> easy

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
that's it woods pretty easy

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:38.870 
that's it woods pretty easy
next<00:03:31.560> rock<00:03:32.180> um<00:03:35.269> first<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.569> all<00:03:37.250> don't<00:03:38.250> bake<00:03:38.609> or

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
next rock um first of all don't bake or

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.629 
next rock um first of all don't bake or
boil<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.329> because<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:40.560> have<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.950> chance<00:03:41.220> of

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
boil it because you have the chance of

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:48.530 
boil it because you have the chance of
the<00:03:42.090> rock<00:03:42.269> exploding<00:03:42.989> okay<00:03:44.599> second<00:03:45.599> of<00:03:45.630> all<00:03:47.540> if

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
the rock exploding okay second of all if

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.470 
the rock exploding okay second of all if
it's<00:03:49.079> a<00:03:49.230> very<00:03:49.609> if<00:03:50.609> it's<00:03:50.790> more<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.120> smooth

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
it's a very if it's more of a smooth

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.199 
it's a very if it's more of a smooth
surface<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:53.280> can<00:03:53.489> probably<00:03:53.730> get<00:03:53.970> away<00:03:54.000> with

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
surface you can probably get away with

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.360 
surface you can probably get away with
just<00:03:54.569> so<00:03:55.349> can<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:56.459> know<00:03:56.609> just<00:03:57.049> scrubbing<00:03:58.049> it

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
just so can you know just scrubbing it

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.870 
just so can you know just scrubbing it
make<00:03:59.370> with<00:03:59.880> some<00:03:59.910> hot<00:04:00.450> salt<00:04:00.840> water<00:04:01.079> or<00:04:01.880> yeah

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
make with some hot salt water or yeah

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.550 
make with some hot salt water or yeah
boiling<00:04:03.450> water<00:04:03.690> salt<00:04:04.380> water<00:04:05.599> boiling<00:04:06.599> boiling

either<00:04:09.450> one<00:04:10.579> I've<00:04:11.579> heard<00:04:12.239> people<00:04:12.780> that<00:04:12.930> do

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
either one I've heard people that do

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.740 
either one I've heard people that do
that<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.709> works<00:04:13.859> just<00:04:14.040> fine<00:04:14.130> but<00:04:14.750> don't

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
that and it works just fine but don't

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.080 
that and it works just fine but don't
like<00:04:15.930> just<00:04:16.229> let<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:16.950> let<00:04:17.099> it<00:04:17.190> sit<00:04:17.519> in<00:04:17.549> boiling

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
like just let just let it sit in boiling

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.550 
like just let just let it sit in boiling
water<00:04:18.289> cuz<00:04:19.289> yeah<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.010> could<00:04:20.160> explode<00:04:21.349> if<00:04:22.349> it's

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
water cuz yeah it could explode if it's

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.890 
water cuz yeah it could explode if it's
more<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.890> porous<00:04:23.370> surface<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.360> definitely

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
more of a porous surface you definitely

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.210 
more of a porous surface you definitely
want<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.050> soak<00:04:25.289> in<00:04:25.440> bleach<00:04:25.740> or

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
want to soak in bleach or
