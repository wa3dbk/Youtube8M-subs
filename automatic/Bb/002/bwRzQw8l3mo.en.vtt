put in so easy and I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:44.629> to<00:00:44.720> do<00:00:44.839> it<00:00:44.900> right<00:00:44.989> now

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
how to do it right now

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.180 
how to do it right now
so<00:00:46.870> first<00:00:47.870> step<00:00:48.080> is<00:00:48.260> just<00:00:48.290> to<00:00:48.559> make<00:00:48.769> sure<00:00:48.979> that

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
so first step is just to make sure that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.009 
so first step is just to make sure that
you<00:00:49.339> have<00:00:49.489> no<00:00:49.610> tangles<00:00:50.030> in<00:00:50.120> your<00:00:50.239> hair<00:00:50.479> just

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
you have no tangles in your hair just

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.009 
you have no tangles in your hair just
quickly<00:00:51.680> run<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:51.949> comb<00:00:52.190> through<00:00:52.220> it<00:00:52.519> and<00:00:53.030> then

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
quickly run a comb through it and then

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.180 
quickly run a comb through it and then
maybe<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.100> flat<00:00:55.400> iron<00:00:56.530> just<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.620> make<00:00:57.830> sure<00:00:58.040> that

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
maybe a flat iron just to make sure that

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.920 
maybe a flat iron just to make sure that
it's<00:00:58.339> nice<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:58.519> straight<00:00:59.000> or<00:00:59.420> however<00:00:59.659> you

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
it's nice and straight or however you

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.689 
it's nice and straight or however you
decide<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:00.229> curl<00:01:00.530> it<00:01:00.710> if<00:01:00.920> you<00:01:01.070> wanted<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.460> style

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
decide to curl it if you wanted to style

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.440 
decide to curl it if you wanted to style
it<00:01:02.000> differently

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.570 

so

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
so

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.270 
so
what<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.160> section<00:01:11.160> your

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
what you do is you just section your

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.920 
what you do is you just section your
hair<00:01:11.310> section<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> top<00:01:12.240> part<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:12.720> year

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930

about<00:01:13.560> one<00:01:14.010> inch<00:01:14.250> or<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.640> above<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.480> ear<00:01:15.720> and

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
about one inch or so above the ear and

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.920 
about one inch or so above the ear and
it<00:01:17.430> should<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.850> an<00:01:17.940> even<00:01:18.120> line<00:01:18.450> all<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> way

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
it should be an even line all the way

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.990 
it should be an even line all the way
from<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.620> side<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.980> other<00:01:20.100> temple<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
from one side to the other temple to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.320 
from one side to the other temple to
Temple

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.610 

and<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.500> can<00:01:27.710> clip<00:01:28.010> away<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.370> top<00:01:28.580> part<00:01:28.940> so

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
and you can clip away the top part so

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.969 
and you can clip away the top part so
it's<00:01:30.620> out<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.770> your<00:01:30.890> way

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.460 

make<00:01:36.580> sure<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:36.880> clips<00:01:37.119> are<00:01:38.310> open<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:41.320> you

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
make sure the clips are open and you

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:51.460 
make sure the clips are open and you
just<00:01:41.530> bring<00:01:41.860> it<00:01:42.009> back

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.649 

so<00:01:52.010> they<00:01:52.100> feel<00:01:52.280> nice<00:01:52.400> and<00:01:52.610> secure

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.719 

that<00:01:58.289> and<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:58.829> unclip<00:01:59.249> the<00:01:59.369> top

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:12.050 

now<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:04.390> have<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.659> whole<00:02:04.810> buncha<00:02:05.080> care

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.030 

and<00:02:12.450> then<00:02:12.750> as<00:02:12.870> an<00:02:12.990> extra<00:02:13.260> step<00:02:13.470> if<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.770> wanted

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
and then as an extra step if you wanted

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.520 
and then as an extra step if you wanted
to<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.430> could<00:02:14.640> run<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.330> Flatiron<00:02:15.810> again<00:02:16.080> over

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
to you could run the Flatiron again over

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.030 
to you could run the Flatiron again over
all<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.459> hair<00:02:17.670> blend<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.690> together<00:02:18.810> nicely

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.080 

it's<00:02:23.040> already<00:02:23.340> straight<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.940> don't

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
it's already straight so you don't

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.990 
it's already straight so you don't
really<00:02:24.209> have<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.630> but<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.959> can
