00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
machine which is a banana 550 and other

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.290 
machine which is a banana 550 and other
machines<00:00:17.620> will<00:00:17.830> vary<00:00:18.070> a<00:00:18.220> little<00:00:18.310> bit<00:00:18.490> but<00:00:19.119> how

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
machines will vary a little bit but how

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.929 
machines will vary a little bit but how
to<00:00:19.360> do<00:00:19.570> a<00:00:19.600> buttonhole<00:00:20.200> to<00:00:20.860> suit<00:00:21.070> a<00:00:21.100> button<00:00:21.460> you

like that and I'm going to click on that

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.310 
like that and I'm going to click on that
and<00:01:20.220> then<00:01:21.220> on<00:01:21.370> my<00:01:21.550> foot<00:01:21.790> here<00:01:22.150> this<00:01:23.110> is<00:01:23.230> the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
and then on my foot here this is the

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.540 
and then on my foot here this is the
button<00:01:23.500> I'm<00:01:23.710> going<00:01:23.830> to<00:01:23.920> make<00:01:24.070> a<00:01:24.100> buttonhole

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
button I'm going to make a buttonhole

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.940 
button I'm going to make a buttonhole
for<00:01:24.820> this<00:01:25.600> is<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:26.050> can<00:01:26.230> set<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.530> Machine<00:01:26.800> up

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
for this is you can set the Machine up

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.710 
for this is you can set the Machine up
so<00:01:27.130> that<00:01:27.250> you<00:01:27.400> can<00:01:27.610> do<00:01:27.820> repeat<00:01:28.210> buttonholes

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
so that you can do repeat buttonholes

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.170 
so that you can do repeat buttonholes
the<00:01:28.960> same<00:01:29.200> size<00:01:29.530> so<00:01:30.220> you<00:01:30.280> set<00:01:30.550> it<00:01:30.670> on<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.940> first

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
the same size so you set it on the first

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.250 
the same size so you set it on the first
one<00:01:31.479> or<00:01:32.380> perhaps<00:01:32.710> on<00:01:33.010> a<00:01:33.040> practice<00:01:33.430> one<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.659> you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
one or perhaps on a practice one and you

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.780 
one or perhaps on a practice one and you
can<00:01:35.409> use<00:01:35.620> other<00:01:35.740> measuring<00:01:36.100> techniques<00:01:36.580> but<00:01:36.760> I

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
can use other measuring techniques but I

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.330 
can use other measuring techniques but I
tend<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.150> just<00:01:37.390> use<00:01:37.659> this<00:01:37.840> manual<00:01:38.290> system<00:01:38.710> but

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
tend to just use this manual system but

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.570 
tend to just use this manual system but
there's<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.760> little<00:01:40.000> tiny<00:01:40.270> red<00:01:40.540> marker<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:42.430> the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
there's a little tiny red marker in the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.820 
there's a little tiny red marker in the
foot<00:01:42.760> just<00:01:43.150> bet<00:01:43.390> down<00:01:43.810> here<00:01:44.200> where<00:01:44.590> there's<00:01:44.770> a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
foot just bet down here where there's a

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.649 
foot just bet down here where there's a
zero<00:01:45.159> on<00:01:45.760> this<00:01:46.030> little<00:01:46.270> there's<00:01:46.479> little

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
zero on this little there's little

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.350 
zero on this little there's little
markings<00:01:47.080> along<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.500> metal<00:01:47.740> strip<00:01:48.070> here<00:01:48.360> so

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
markings along the metal strip here so

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.030 
markings along the metal strip here so
you<00:01:49.420> line<00:01:49.720> up<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.440> one<00:01:50.650> edge<00:01:50.799> of<00:01:50.950> your

you line up the it one edge of your

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.370 
you line up the it one edge of your
button<00:01:51.370> with<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.600> zero<00:01:52.840> or<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.200> red

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.960 
marker and this little pointer here
you<00:01:56.560> line<00:01:56.770> up<00:01:57.010> so<00:01:57.220> that<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.430> button<00:01:57.729> fits

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
you line up so that the button fits

you line up so that the button fits
within<00:01:58.210> that<00:01:58.330> space<00:01:58.869> and<00:02:00.240> then<00:02:01.240> I'm<00:02:01.450> going<00:02:01.630> to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
within that space and then I'm going to

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.840 
within that space and then I'm going to
pop<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:01.869> foot<00:02:02.290> on<00:02:02.860> here<00:02:03.159> now<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:03.369> might<00:02:03.640> want

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
pop that foot on here now you might want

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.460 
pop that foot on here now you might want
to<00:02:03.909> do<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.119> lining<00:02:04.690> up<00:02:04.810> when<00:02:04.990> it's<00:02:05.170> already

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
to do that lining up when it's already

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.410 
to do that lining up when it's already
on<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.740> machine<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.549> don't<00:02:06.729> knock

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
on the machine so that you don't knock

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.869 
on the machine so that you don't knock
it<00:02:07.570> out<00:02:07.690> of<00:02:07.869> place<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:09.039> all<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:09.549> can<00:02:09.670> do<00:02:09.789> it

going to
to<00:02:18.379> do<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.860> because<00:02:19.159> that's<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.549> way<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.760> like

to do that because that's the way I like
to<00:02:20.420> do<00:02:20.599> it<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:20.959> make<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> mess<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:21.650> it

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
to do it and I make a mess of it

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.720 
to do it and I make a mess of it
so<00:02:22.939> that<00:02:23.060> my<00:02:23.150> thread<00:02:23.390> is<00:02:23.450> through<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.019> foot

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
so that my thread is through the foot

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.280 
so that my thread is through the foot
then<00:02:25.730> I'm<00:02:25.819> going<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.090> take<00:02:26.299> this<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:27.170> the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
then I'm going to take this to the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.410 
then I'm going to take this to the
machine<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:28.489> first<00:02:28.790> one<00:02:29.000> I'm<00:02:29.120> doing

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
machine so this this first one I'm doing

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.270 
machine so this this first one I'm doing
is<00:02:29.599> setting<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.049> length<00:02:30.379> so<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.709> I<00:02:30.890> can<00:02:31.099> do

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
is setting the length so that I can do

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.930 
is setting the length so that I can do
more<00:02:31.489> buttonholes<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.870> same<00:02:33.140> size<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.760> put

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
more buttonholes the same size so I put

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.729 
more buttonholes the same size so I put
it<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.480> might<00:02:35.930> have<00:02:36.079> made<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> little<00:02:36.379> mark

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
it in I might have made a little mark

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.410 
it in I might have made a little mark
where<00:02:37.040> I<00:02:37.069> want<00:02:37.159> to<00:02:37.370> put<00:02:37.549> my<00:02:37.700> first<00:02:37.940> buttonhole

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
where I want to put my first buttonhole

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.420 
where I want to put my first buttonhole
but<00:02:38.629> as<00:02:39.019> I<00:02:39.200> said<00:02:39.379> I<00:02:39.409> probably<00:02:39.709> would<00:02:40.069> do<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.280> as

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
but as I said I probably would do it as

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.910 
but as I said I probably would do it as
a<00:02:40.459> practice<00:02:40.940> for<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.959> first<00:02:42.170> one<00:02:42.409> anyway<00:02:42.860> so

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
a practice for a first one anyway so

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.059 
a practice for a first one anyway so
that<00:02:43.909> wouldn't<00:02:44.150> matter<00:02:44.269> so<00:02:44.450> much<00:02:44.629> and<00:02:45.349> then

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
that wouldn't matter so much and then

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.229 
that wouldn't matter so much and then
I'm<00:02:46.310> just<00:02:46.340> going<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:47.019> start<00:02:48.019> stitching<00:02:49.239> just

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
I'm just going to start stitching just

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.229 
I'm just going to start stitching just
looking<00:02:50.540> lock<00:02:50.690> stitch<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:51.230> then<00:02:51.349> it<00:02:51.470> does

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
looking lock stitch and then it does

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.360 
looking lock stitch and then it does
SIG's<00:02:53.239> leg<00:02:53.420> up<00:02:53.569> one<00:02:53.900> side

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.759 

then<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.120> will<00:02:57.330> manually<00:02:57.780> stop<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.379> when<00:02:58.590> I've

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
then I will manually stop it when I've

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.380 
then I will manually stop it when I've
got

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
got

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.990 
got
to<00:03:00.840> where<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.050> want<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.470> go<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.490> this<00:03:02.760> little

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
to where I want to go and this little

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.540 
to where I want to go and this little
red<00:03:03.090> marker<00:03:03.600> will<00:03:03.780> line<00:03:04.020> up<00:03:04.050> with<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:05.430> little

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
red marker will line up with that little

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.559 
red marker will line up with that little
pointer<00:03:06.030> there<00:03:07.610> so<00:03:08.610> I've<00:03:08.730> stopped<00:03:09.030> there<00:03:09.300> and

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
pointer there so I've stopped there and

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.090 
pointer there so I've stopped there and
now<00:03:09.720> I'm<00:03:09.840> going<00:03:10.020> to<00:03:10.140> press<00:03:10.319> my<00:03:10.530> little<00:03:10.770> return

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
now I'm going to press my little return

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.750 
now I'm going to press my little return
button<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:12.950> then<00:03:13.950> I've<00:03:14.069> put<00:03:14.100> my<00:03:14.370> foot<00:03:14.580> down<00:03:14.610> on

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
button and then I've put my foot down on

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.420 
button and then I've put my foot down on
the<00:03:14.970> pedal<00:03:15.000> again<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.380> there's<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.280> little

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.550 
the pedal again and it there's a little
backward<00:03:17.910> thing<00:03:18.480> there's<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.990> power<00:03:19.200> at<00:03:19.410> the

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
backward thing there's a power at the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:29.339 
backward thing there's a power at the
end<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.760> comes<00:03:21.000> up<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.330> other<00:03:21.540> side

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.319 

automatically<00:03:30.069> them<00:03:30.310> where<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.760> put<00:03:30.939> that<00:03:31.060> far

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
automatically them where to put that far

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.970 
automatically them where to put that far
and<00:03:31.569> finish<00:03:31.870> off<00:03:32.019> at<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.349> end<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:35.620> there<00:03:35.829> we

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
and finish off at that end and there we

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.440 
and finish off at that end and there we
have<00:03:36.219> a<00:03:36.719> very<00:03:37.719> delicious<00:03:38.049> looking<00:03:40.859> buttonhole

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
the far end turn it round pop it back in

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.810 
the far end turn it round pop it back in
at<00:04:23.199> this<00:04:23.349> end<00:04:23.590> again<00:04:23.889> otherwise<00:04:24.190> you've<00:04:24.460> run

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
at this end again otherwise you've run

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.420 
at this end again otherwise you've run
into<00:04:25.210> danger<00:04:25.389> of<00:04:25.690> cutting<00:04:26.320> those<00:04:27.009> threads

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
into danger of cutting those threads

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.390 
into danger of cutting those threads
that<00:04:27.789> go<00:04:27.849> across<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.660> end<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:28.960> buttonhole

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
that go across the end of the buttonhole

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.219 
that go across the end of the buttonhole
so<00:04:30.400> there<00:04:30.580> we've<00:04:30.729> got<00:04:30.759> our<00:04:31.030> buttonhole<00:04:31.330> we<00:04:32.080> can

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
so there we've got our buttonhole we can

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.980 
so there we've got our buttonhole we can
see<00:04:32.470> if<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.680> button<00:04:32.919> works<00:04:33.370> in<00:04:33.610> it<00:04:33.789> and<00:04:34.599> yes<00:04:34.780> it

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
see if the button works in it and yes it

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.379 
see if the button works in it and yes it
does<00:04:35.190> you<00:04:36.190> might<00:04:36.340> just<00:04:36.520> want<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:36.849> trim<00:04:37.030> off<00:04:37.180> any

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
does you might just want to trim off any

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.969 
does you might just want to trim off any
little<00:04:37.570> loose<00:04:37.870> threads<00:04:38.260> that<00:04:38.500> occur<00:04:38.770> because

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
little loose threads that occur because

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.149 
little loose threads that occur because
that<00:04:39.250> tends<00:04:39.729> to<00:04:39.820> happen<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:41.380> we're<00:04:41.860> away<00:04:42.099> so

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 
that tends to happen and we're away so

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.980 
that tends to happen and we're away so
now<00:04:42.580> we<00:04:42.639> can<00:04:42.909> just<00:04:43.060> go<00:04:43.150> back<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.539> the<00:04:43.659> Machine

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
now we can just go back to the Machine

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.550 
now we can just go back to the Machine
and<00:04:44.849> do<00:04:45.849> more<00:04:46.060> so<00:04:46.419> you<00:04:46.900> might<00:04:47.080> have<00:04:47.169> visited

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
and do more so you might have visited

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.990 
and do more so you might have visited

you might want to two or three

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.420 
you might want to two or three
buttonholes<00:04:49.479> the<00:04:50.080> same<00:04:50.320> size<00:04:50.650> you<00:04:51.099> might<00:04:51.250> want

start your buttonhole pop it in your

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.000 
start your buttonhole pop it in your
machine<00:04:59.639> put<00:05:00.639> down<00:05:01.440> put<00:05:02.440> on<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:02.680> presser<00:05:02.889> foot

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.450 
machine put down put on the presser foot
and<00:05:03.669> then<00:05:04.300> just<00:05:04.750> let<00:05:05.470> it<00:05:05.650> go<00:05:05.830> it<00:05:06.039> would<00:05:06.190> do<00:05:06.340> the

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
and then just let it go it would do the

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.860 
and then just let it go it would do the
whole<00:05:06.639> button
