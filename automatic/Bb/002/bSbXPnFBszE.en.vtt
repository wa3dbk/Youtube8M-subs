pedal<00:00:36.410> tone<00:00:36.620> lick<00:00:36.860> now<00:00:37.430> what<00:00:37.610> a<00:00:37.640> pedal<00:00:37.910> tone<00:00:38.090> is

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
pedal tone lick now what a pedal tone is

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.030 
pedal tone lick now what a pedal tone is
is<00:00:38.660> basically<00:00:39.079> when<00:00:39.230> you're<00:00:39.350> coming<00:00:39.560> back<00:00:39.829> to

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
is basically when you're coming back to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.400 
is basically when you're coming back to
the<00:00:40.130> same<00:00:40.400> tone<00:00:40.700> in<00:00:40.880> the<00:00:40.970> scale<00:00:41.239> over<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.290> over

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
the same tone in the scale over and over

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.840 
the same tone in the scale over and over
again<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:42.739> it<00:00:42.860> creates<00:00:43.190> almost<00:00:43.400> like<00:00:43.730> a

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
again and it creates almost like a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.160 
again and it creates almost like a
harmonic<00:00:44.540> effect<00:00:44.690> like<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.080> harmony<00:00:45.770> effect<00:00:46.190> so

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
harmonic effect like a harmony effect so

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.510 
harmonic effect like a harmony effect so
we're<00:00:48.170> this<00:00:48.500> one's<00:00:48.710> going<00:00:48.830> to<00:00:48.860> be<00:00:48.980> an<00:00:49.070> a<00:00:49.250> minor

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
we're this one's going to be an a minor

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.510 
we're this one's going to be an a minor
which<00:00:49.760> is<00:00:49.790> another<00:00:50.120> key<00:00:50.390> that<00:00:51.100> inve<00:00:52.100> plays<00:00:52.340> in

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
which is another key that inve plays in

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.920 
which is another key that inve plays in
a<00:00:52.580> lot<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:52.970> this<00:00:53.090> is<00:00:53.150> a<00:00:53.300> pedal<00:00:53.540> tone<00:00:53.690> lick

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
a lot and this is a pedal tone lick

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.350 
a lot and this is a pedal tone lick
really<00:00:54.620> kind<00:00:55.370> of<00:00:55.430> reminiscent<00:00:56.000> of<00:00:56.030> a<00:00:56.120> lot<00:00:56.270> of

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
really kind of reminiscent of a lot of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.000 
really kind of reminiscent of a lot of
the<00:00:56.450> stuff<00:00:56.690> that<00:00:56.720> he<00:00:56.930> does<00:00:57.140> this<00:00:57.680> kind<00:00:57.740> of

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
the stuff that he does this kind of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.550 
the stuff that he does this kind of
comes<00:00:58.190> from<00:00:58.340> Baroque<00:00:58.790> music<00:00:59.560> predominantly

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
comes from Baroque music predominantly

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.160 
comes from Baroque music predominantly
Bach<00:01:00.950> and<00:01:01.280> this<00:01:01.820> is<00:01:01.940> also<00:01:02.090> where<00:01:02.450> in<00:01:02.690> bay<00:01:02.930> gets

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
Bach and this is also where in bay gets

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.010 
Bach and this is also where in bay gets
this<00:01:03.350> from<00:01:03.590> so<00:01:03.860> let's<00:01:04.610> look<00:01:05.449> right<00:01:05.689> at<00:01:05.840> this

going to start up here it's going to be

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.520 
going to start up here it's going to be
the<00:01:14.270> same<00:01:14.479> pattern<00:01:14.900> just<00:01:15.110> taking<00:01:15.380> through

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
the same pattern just taking through

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.349 
the same pattern just taking through
different<00:01:15.859> positions<00:01:16.219> of<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.460> scale<00:01:16.700> so

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
different positions of the scale so

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:19.989 
different positions of the scale so
we're<00:01:18.109> going<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.259> start<00:01:18.560> here<00:01:19.100> at<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.640> 15th

Down stroke then an upstroke at the 17th

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.929 
Down stroke then an upstroke at the 17th
fret<00:01:29.679> now<00:01:30.679> we're<00:01:30.979> going<00:01:31.069> to<00:01:31.130> repeatedly<00:01:31.729> go

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
fret now we're going to repeatedly go

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.330 
fret now we're going to repeatedly go
down<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.659> different<00:01:33.229> another<00:01:33.710> note<00:01:34.009> in<00:01:34.189> the

down a different another note in the
scale<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.670> keep<00:01:35.179> coming<00:01:35.509> back<00:01:35.719> to<00:01:36.380> that<00:01:36.409> 17th

fret so the next note down from this

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.999 
fret so the next note down from this
15th<00:01:39.770> fret<00:01:40.009> in<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.310> scale<00:01:40.609> is<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:42.740> key<00:01:42.889> of

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
15th fret in the scale is the the key of

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.800 
15th fret in the scale is the the key of
a-minor<00:01:43.100> that<00:01:43.549> is<00:01:43.700> is<00:01:43.880> this<00:01:44.719> F<00:01:44.929> so<00:01:45.499> we<00:01:45.649> have<00:01:46.810> G

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
a-minor that is is this F so we have G

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.279 
a-minor that is is this F so we have G
to<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.289> a<00:01:48.380> which<00:01:48.950> is<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.689> 15<00:01:50.689> to<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.869> 17th

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
to the a which is the 15 to the 17th

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.399 
to the a which is the 15 to the 17th
then<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.679> 13<00:01:52.100> a<00:01:52.130> down<00:01:52.490> on<00:01:52.639> a<00:01:52.819> downstroke<00:01:53.409> back

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
then the 13 a down on a downstroke back

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.949 
then the 13 a down on a downstroke back
to<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:54.709> a<00:01:54.859> with<00:01:55.069> an<00:01:55.159> upstroke<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.509> this<00:01:56.659> pedal

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
to that a with an upstroke so this pedal

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.149 
to that a with an upstroke so this pedal
tone<00:01:57.170> note<00:01:57.319> is<00:01:57.439> always<00:01:57.679> going<00:01:57.889> to<00:01:57.950> be<00:01:58.009> an

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
tone note is always going to be an

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.190 
tone note is always going to be an
upstroke<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:58.789> all<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.450> other<00:01:59.600> notes<00:01:59.840> in<00:02:00.079> the

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
pedal tone lick are going to be down

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.029 
pedal tone lick are going to be down
strokes<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:02.869> have<00:02:02.959> down<00:02:03.310> up<00:02:04.450> then<00:02:05.450> down<00:02:06.049> up
