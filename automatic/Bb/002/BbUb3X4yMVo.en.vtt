00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
that's that's more beefier than this and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.119 
that's that's more beefier than this and
actually<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.110> kind<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.350> represents<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.950> in

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
actually it kind of represents that in

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.619 
actually it kind of represents that in
the<00:00:41.219> size<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.059> know<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> higher<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
the size of it you know the higher you

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.360 
the size of it you know the higher you
get<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> milli<00:00:42.989> amps<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.739> bigger<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> device

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
get a milli amps the bigger the device

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.860 
get a milli amps the bigger the device
is<00:00:44.489> going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.719> would<00:00:45.840> be

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
is going to be and that would be

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.240 
is going to be and that would be
probably<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.379> only<00:00:46.530> knock<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.129> with

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
probably the only knock that I have with

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.279 
probably the only knock that I have with
in<00:00:47.340> my<00:00:47.430> charge<00:00:47.670> p6000<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.600> fairly<00:00:48.930> thick

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
in my charge p6000 it is fairly thick

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.430 
in my charge p6000 it is fairly thick
and<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:50.399> little<00:00:51.030> hefty<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.140> does<00:00:52.289> have

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and it's little hefty but it does have

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.600 
and it's little hefty but it does have
patch<00:00:52.680> at<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> bottom<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.190> if<00:00:53.399> you're<00:00:53.520> gonna

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
patch at the bottom so if you're gonna

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.160 
patch at the bottom so if you're gonna
put<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.969> down<00:00:54.090> somewhere<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.960> gonna<00:00:55.079> be

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
put it down somewhere it's gonna be

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.290 
put it down somewhere it's gonna be
sturdy<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.680> not<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> move<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
sturdy it's not going to move and it

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.790 
sturdy it's not going to move and it
could<00:00:57.329> probably<00:00:57.539> slip<00:00:57.750> into<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.050> purse<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:58.590> book

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
could probably slip into a purse or book

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.340 
could probably slip into a purse or book
back<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.309> that's<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.910> minor<00:01:00.149> gripe<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:01.079> overall

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
back so that's a minor gripe but overall

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.869 
back so that's a minor gripe but overall
this<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.829> great<00:01:02.100> device<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.760> their

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
this is a great device this is their

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.509 
this is a great device this is their
newer<00:01:03.030> model<00:01:03.449> okay<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.979> with<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> newer

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
adding to the mobility factor it's it's

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.429 
adding to the mobility factor it's it's
a<00:02:02.369> great<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.479> great<00:02:03.509> feature<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.259> the

a great it's a great feature for the
device<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.950> know<00:02:05.070> usually<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.520> you're<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.820> you

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
device you know usually if you're if you

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.399

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
need to charge more than one thing you

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.100 
need to charge more than one thing you
know<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.360> they're<00:02:09.479> actually<00:02:09.569> catering<00:02:10.020> to

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110

that idea also

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.770 
that idea also
one<00:02:12.030> surprising<00:02:13.030> feature<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.569> didn't

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
one surprising feature that I didn't

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.120 
one surprising feature that I didn't
realize<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.200> until<00:02:14.290> probably<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.800> day<00:02:14.980> after

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
realize it until probably a day after

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.040 
realize it until probably a day after
using<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:16.360> fact<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.569> it<00:02:16.690> has<00:02:16.840> voice

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
I was so and another great feature about

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.710 
I was so and another great feature about
the<00:03:08.680> p6000<00:03:09.459> is<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.700> fact<00:03:09.910> that<00:03:09.970> how<00:03:10.150> fast<00:03:10.510> it

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
the p6000 is the fact that how fast it

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.990 
the p6000 is the fact that how fast it
charges<00:03:11.140> those<00:03:11.380> devices<00:03:11.680> if<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.610> was<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.760> slow

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
charges those devices if it was a slow

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.789 
charges those devices if it was a slow
hog<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.480> wouldn't<00:03:13.989> matter<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:14.440> would<00:03:14.590> just<00:03:14.650> be

hog I wouldn't matter it would just be

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.800 
hog I wouldn't matter it would just be
another<00:03:14.890> portable<00:03:15.370> device<00:03:15.700> but<00:03:16.359> this<00:03:16.630> thing

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
in the industry right now and it goes to

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.750 
in the industry right now and it goes to
the<00:03:29.590> fact<00:03:29.799> that<00:03:29.829> this<00:03:29.950> is<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.250> newer<00:03:30.400> model

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
the fact that this is the newer model

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.160 
the fact that this is the newer model
you<00:03:31.030> know<00:03:31.120> they've<00:03:31.359> had<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.510> lot<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.720> technology

into this and then it does have its own
ventilation<00:03:34.359> system<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:34.750> that's<00:03:34.930> great<00:03:35.079> now

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010
