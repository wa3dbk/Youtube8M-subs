00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.000
 Very good, then welcome, one more. 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.090
 series video my computer is slow 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.580
 What can I do well? 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.139
 often the slowness of the computer 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.850
 it happens is in the operation of 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:22.590
 many times the slowness is 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.900
 start happening to you is the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.730
 work fine but until you start 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.789
 can make coffee can make a world of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.920
 things that really take a long time 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.410
 this often happens because of 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.020
 some programs that are initializing 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.910
 no need not 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.879
 We already talked about this in the video. 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.440
 where we used the pina tool 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.129
 to resolve this issue you can 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.750
 Conquer this video on my channel channel 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.280
 or as posted here in the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.170
 facebook itself 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.719
 but it's a lot of thing that can 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.730
 is also related to the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.320
 What we are going to talk about now is to see something. 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.020
 what you can do to leave your 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.820
 computer at startup 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.850
 Come on, you go here on a computer or 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.830
 my computer this option here 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.900
 exists on any operating system 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.869
 of microsoft windows 98 windows 8 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.320
 points 1 Computer My Computer 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.009
 right click goes below and click 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.840
 with the left button on properties 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.650
 sure does not bring this screen 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.540
 general settings very well coming 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.140
 here are you will advanced settings 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.880
 advanced settings 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.720
 of the system 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.350
 you hold the left mouse button 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:50.040
 and here comes the ownership of the system 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:54.950
 where we will , we will only look here at 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.540
 start up and recover your 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.380
 left-click password and go 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.210
 windows 7 is the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.060
 our present operating system does not 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.770
 if you can be happy pp positions 2.1 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.009
 but it will be there if the same 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.380
 settings very well and here the time 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.500
 to display list of operation systems 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.870
 but what is this time to display 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.700
 list of operating systems is that 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.540
 time that you have when you turn on the 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.060
 computer 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.150
 the screen turns black before the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.770
 windows so now just in case on my 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.530
 in case it's five seconds because I 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.440
 I have already moved often name is so 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.350
 try to get together and you need to overcome 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.240
 30 seconds of your computer connected to 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.710
 one thing you can do this is you 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.600
 picks up and puts five seconds right then 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.030
 There you have some time to be precise. 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.750
 enter the setup, or some technician who 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.250
 So you're black, it's one hundred and none. 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.200
 but in your case you need to enter the 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.390
 computer on that blue screen . 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.850
 settings that off the bus 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.090
 You have 55 seconds priest to press 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.700
 the other key right 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.590
 and here was just time to view options 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.940
 recovery if necessary 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.600
 it's just you can do what you can 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.160
 stay here 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.170
 If I was not alone I could not change the 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.320
 time in 30 seconds you have to 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.200
 Also look, you can click here and 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.540
 it's 55 seconds 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.250
 stay option if you want 3 no 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.150
 always in my case I will leave 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.850
 five seconds and so you will reduce your 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.820
 30-second system initialization 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.280
 to go hand in hand for 5 seconds at 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.410
 start your own - since we 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.100
 we are here one does one thing very much 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.140
 cool here too, restart 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.200
 automatically when you see a fault 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.660
 in the system is often happens option 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.510
 There is a problem, but it 's a problem. 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.090
 but because of this option here are 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.550
 still restarting straight then 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.860
 you can take advantage since you're already 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.080
 here you click here 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.120
 So you 're not in this box anymore. 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.680
 also selected if there are any 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.440
 problem that windows can get 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.510
 manage that works for you 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.459
 save your data for your long term 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.709
 Then solve the windows it will not 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.370
 be restarted if this is the case. 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.160
 case 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:25.350
 Ok, you're going to go there, okay, okay too. 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.180
 that from now on the system will 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.000
 your operating system 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.070
 it's faster to start, do not worry 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.220
 forget to check and do 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.860
 checks via linnÃ© software 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.710
 As you see in it you can 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.840
 to know then if there is any system 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.970
 type of software starting in your 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.490
 windows without necessity that cause 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.030
 not only slow the launch of the 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.430
 system as well as the operation of the 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.789
 windows 100% for you 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.919
