00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
just trying to short this try not not

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.090 
just trying to short this try not not
super<00:01:45.979> choppy<00:01:46.280> but<00:01:46.640> just<00:01:47.140> under<00:01:48.140> control<00:01:48.619> yeah

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
super choppy but just under control yeah

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.679 
super choppy but just under control yeah
under<00:01:49.970> control

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
under control

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.660 
under control
and<00:01:51.259> not<00:01:51.470> not<00:01:51.829> really

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.690 

you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.970> run<00:01:57.270> fast<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:58.229> running<00:01:58.470> fast<00:01:58.829> you

you can run fast but running fast you
know<00:01:59.850> under<00:02:00.210> control<00:02:00.630> shorter<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.530> shorter

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
know under control shorter and shorter

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.240 
know under control shorter and shorter
steps<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.880> reduce<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.630> jarring<00:02:04.289> impact<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
steps to reduce that jarring impact the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.990 
that's pouring into the trail where I'm
talk<00:03:06.600> about<00:03:06.810> some<00:03:06.960> of<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.110> hazards<00:03:07.460> like<00:03:08.460> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
talk about some of the hazards like the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.610 
talk about some of the hazards like the
key<00:03:09.210> thing<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:09.630> shortening<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.320> strides

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
key thing is shortening the strides

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.980 
key thing is shortening the strides
that's<00:03:11.010> your<00:03:11.220> safety<00:03:11.670> net<00:03:11.850> moving<00:03:12.360> fast<00:03:12.660> so

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
that's your safety net moving fast so

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.440 
that's your safety net moving fast so
not<00:03:13.740> just<00:03:13.950> thinking<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.310> have<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:14.550> I<00:03:15.000> have<00:03:15.360> two

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
steps I have to run straight down you

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.940 
steps I have to run straight down you
might<00:03:18.060> be<00:03:18.240> thought<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.260> might<00:03:19.410> be<00:03:19.440> here<00:03:19.770> you
