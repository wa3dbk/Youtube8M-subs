so finished finished product I sanded it
down<00:01:46.659> painted<00:01:47.409> it<00:01:47.530> textured<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.219> nice<00:01:48.939> at<00:01:49.299> the

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
down painted it textured it nice at the

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.980 
down painted it textured it nice at the
seams<00:01:50.049> on<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.490> part<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:52.090> be<00:01:52.119> on<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.509> dash<00:01:52.689> also

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
seams on the part to be on the dash also

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.800 
seams on the part to be on the dash also
so<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.380> looks<00:01:53.530> more<00:01:53.590> factory<00:01:54.219> yup<00:01:54.609> and<00:01:55.119> has<00:01:55.659> all

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
so it looks more factory yup and has all

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.730 
so it looks more factory yup and has all
the<00:01:55.899> curves

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
the curves
