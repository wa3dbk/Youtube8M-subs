00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.950
 I got up with your image in my mind 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.240
 along with those memories that she and I 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:23.419
 we passed and they made us smile that has 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.690
 I could take it out even a minute from me 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.260
 mind 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.260
 x 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.360
 I can not forget her 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.130
 and although dispensing treatment fails 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.590
 tear those from my heart I can not 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.320
 forget her 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.800
 and as much as I try to think 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.590
 manages to tear the love in my heart 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.030
 I can get it out of my mind I converted 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.820
 in his insane 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.160
 his gaze is one of his burning interests 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.040
 but loves suddenly when the time 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.830
 from yesterday to happy to be by his side only 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.990
 I could smile I carry the love that I had 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.010
 for you now strong because this 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.640
 source of me I am taught me to look at that 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.610
 the second heard his voice as he remembers 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.710
 Smile also love 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.830
 this had within this noble heart 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.760
 love 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.190
 to fill me with love 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.730
 or 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.730
 do not 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:43.619
 at least I can not forget it 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.390
 and as much as I try to think, it does not 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.930
 tear off beats in my heart I can not 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.100
 forget her 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:57.670
 and as much as I try to tear it out 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.340
 in my heart he who kills me kills me 2 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.410

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.260

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.959
 smile kills me and my voice betrays me and not 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.959
 I can live days more times 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.959
 with your skin 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:30.460
 this that raises us with its image in my 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.780
 mind together with those memories that I already 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.960
 we passed and they made us smile that I have not 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.230
 I could take it out even a minute from me

 manages to pluck my heart will not 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.470
 I can forget her 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.600
