00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.330 
they behave we had a lot of Kuwait boxes
we<00:00:38.610> work<00:00:38.850> me

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.850 

but<00:00:42.340> with<00:00:42.870> preventing<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.079> bigger<00:00:44.290> guys<00:00:44.560> that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
but with preventing the bigger guys that

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.799 
but with preventing the bigger guys that
we<00:00:44.950> have<00:00:45.100> more<00:00:45.280> diversity<00:00:45.820> but<00:00:46.030> all<00:00:46.270> that<00:00:46.510> fits

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
we have more diversity but all that fits

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:47.830 
we have more diversity but all that fits
now

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
now

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.670 
now
so<00:00:48.470> what<00:00:48.620> do<00:00:48.740> you<00:00:48.830> think<00:00:49.130> where<00:00:49.700> is<00:00:50.000> pianeta

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
so what do you think where is pianeta

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.790 
so what do you think where is pianeta
where's<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:51.860> strength<00:00:52.190> versus<00:00:53.060> most<00:00:53.380> well<00:00:54.380> I

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
where's the strength versus most well I

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.479 
where's the strength versus most well I
think<00:00:55.640> as<00:00:55.820> in<00:00:56.000> this<00:00:56.150> fight<00:00:56.360> I<00:00:56.630> think<00:00:56.900> that<00:00:57.050> he's

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
think as in this fight I think that he's

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.780 
think as in this fight I think that he's
stripped<00:00:58.489> would<00:00:58.700> be<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:59.180> survive

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
stripped would be to survive

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.540 
stripped would be to survive
and<00:01:00.910> happy<00:01:01.600> just<00:01:01.840> hit<00:01:02.050> that's<00:01:02.590> expected<00:01:03.010> rise

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
and happy just hit that's expected rise

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.820 
and happy just hit that's expected rise
they<00:01:03.850> want<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.270> do<00:01:04.390> I<00:01:04.690> don't<00:01:05.260> expect<00:01:05.410> for<00:01:05.710> him

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
they want to do I don't expect for him

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.890 
they want to do I don't expect for him
to<00:01:05.980> even<00:01:06.070> be<00:01:06.400> in<00:01:06.430> this<00:01:06.640> fight<00:01:06.880> so<00:01:07.630> you<00:01:07.690> think

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
to even be in this fight so you think

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.470 
to even be in this fight so you think
he's<00:01:08.200> going<00:01:08.440> dropped<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:09.010> run<00:01:09.160> ya<00:01:09.760> think<00:01:10.090> it's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
he's going dropped to run ya think it's

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.750 
he's going dropped to run ya think it's
gonna<00:01:10.720> run<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:12.010> I<00:01:12.040> think<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:12.400> he's<00:01:12.610> gonna

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
gonna run so I think that he's gonna

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.490 
gonna run so I think that he's gonna
stay<00:01:13.000> that<00:01:13.060> way<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:13.690> do<00:01:13.930> you<00:01:13.960> think<00:01:14.050> how<00:01:14.320> many

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
stay that way so do you think how many

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.010 
stay that way so do you think how many
rounds<00:01:14.710> will<00:01:15.070> this<00:01:15.220> fight<00:01:15.460> me<00:01:15.900> depends<00:01:16.900> who's

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
rounds will this fight me depends who's

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.410 
rounds will this fight me depends who's
very<00:01:17.830> very<00:01:18.190> clean<00:01:18.460> Factory<00:01:18.490> it's<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.210> very

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
very very clean Factory it's a very

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.690 
very very clean Factory it's a very
green<00:01:19.660> financial<00:01:20.260> it<00:01:20.500> could<00:01:20.770> go<00:01:20.950> short<00:01:21.370> or<00:01:21.610> if

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
green financial it could go short or if

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.190 
green financial it could go short or if
you<00:01:21.790> go<00:01:21.940> more<00:01:21.970> depends<00:01:22.540> on<00:01:22.690> what<00:01:22.810> he<00:01:22.930> never

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
you go more depends on what he never

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.800 
you go more depends on what he never
does<00:01:23.440> but<00:01:23.979> I<00:01:24.010> don't<00:01:24.760> I<00:01:25.000> think<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:25.570> is<00:01:25.660> too

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
does but I don't I think that is too

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.600 
does but I don't I think that is too
green<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.080> be<00:01:26.290> in<00:01:26.350> this<00:01:26.500> fight<00:01:26.680> I<00:01:26.979> think<00:01:27.460> that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
green to be in this fight I think that

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.450 
green to be in this fight I think that
they<00:01:28.710> underestimated<00:01:29.710> allowed<00:01:29.920> me<00:01:30.100> if<00:01:30.190> we<00:01:30.340> can

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
they underestimated allowed me if we can

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.730 
they underestimated allowed me if we can
get<00:01:30.610> no<00:01:30.820> Lafitte<00:01:31.240> there<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.990> there<00:01:32.170> has<00:01:32.710> a

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
get no Lafitte there and there has a

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.590 
get no Lafitte there and there has a
good<00:01:33.100> chance<00:01:33.310> but<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:34.000> don't<00:01:34.180> think<00:01:34.270> he<00:01:34.420> has<00:01:34.570> a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
good chance but I don't think he has a

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.450 
good chance but I don't think he has a
trainer<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:35.290> don't<00:01:35.800> think<00:01:35.979> that<00:01:36.009> he<00:01:36.220> has<00:01:36.430> a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
trainer I don't think that he has a

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.580 
trainer I don't think that he has a
style<00:01:36.940> I<00:01:37.330> don't<00:01:37.720> think<00:01:37.869> they<00:01:38.050> have<00:01:38.200> any<00:01:38.410> TV

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
style I don't think they have any TV

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.010 
style I don't think they have any TV
