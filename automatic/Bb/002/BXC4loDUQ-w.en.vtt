in a previous video I showed you how to

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.450 
in a previous video I showed you how to
import<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.330> sprite<00:00:06.660> or<00:00:06.690> file<00:00:07.049> into<00:00:07.770> construct<00:00:08.250> 2

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
import a sprite or file into construct 2

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.089 
import a sprite or file into construct 2
in<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:09.510> video<00:00:09.719> I'm<00:00:10.050> going<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.440> show<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.740> how

in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.190 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:11.160> update<00:00:11.790> your<00:00:12.120> sprite<00:00:12.630> or<00:00:12.750> file<00:00:12.990> and

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
to update your sprite or file and

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.709 
to update your sprite or file and
constructive<00:00:13.799> for<00:00:14.429> example<00:00:14.910> if<00:00:15.059> you've<00:00:15.360> added

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
constructive for example if you've added

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.700 
constructive for example if you've added
new<00:00:16.080> animations<00:00:16.680> or<00:00:17.070> tweaked<00:00:17.460> animations<00:00:18.210> or

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
new animations or tweaked animations or

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.740 
new animations or tweaked animations or
added<00:00:19.710> little<00:00:19.859> images<00:00:20.369> for<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.880> spider<00:00:21.420> file

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
added little images for the spider file

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.040 
added little images for the spider file
to<00:00:22.020> use<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:23.340> here<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.580> am<00:00:23.880> inside<00:00:24.090> construct<00:00:24.840> 2

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
to use so here I am inside construct 2

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.779 
to use so here I am inside construct 2
and<00:00:25.439> what<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> highly<00:00:25.980> recommend<00:00:26.519> for<00:00:26.609> your

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
and what I highly recommend for your

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.779 
and what I highly recommend for your
projects<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> actually<00:00:28.260> create<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.980> frame

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
projects is to actually create a frame

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.999 
projects is to actually create a frame
specifically<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:30.960> importing<00:00:31.500> their<00:00:31.679> sprite

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
specifically for importing their sprite

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.400 
specifically for importing their sprite
or<00:00:32.040> files<00:00:32.369> into<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.750> I've<00:00:33.899> done<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.350> here

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
or files into and I've done that here

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.280 
or files into and I've done that here
with<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.280> frame<00:00:35.610> called<00:00:36.059> spriter<00:00:36.630> and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
with this frame called spriter and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.780 
with this frame called spriter and
you'll<00:00:37.410> see<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.710> an<00:00:37.860> empty<00:00:38.129> frame<00:00:38.489> other

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
you'll see it's an empty frame other

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.270 
you'll see it's an empty frame other
than<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.600> sprites<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.829> imports

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
than the the sprites that it imports

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.760 
than the the sprites that it imports
when<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.579> import<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.210> spider<00:00:43.170> file<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:45.770> give

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
when you import the spider file and give

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.420 
when you import the spider file and give
that<00:00:47.370> frame<00:00:48.300> its<00:00:48.690> own<00:00:48.930> event<00:00:49.320> sheet<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:50.340> my

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that frame its own event sheet in my

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.569 
that frame its own event sheet in my
case<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.910> also<00:00:51.149> called<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.690> spriter<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.620> this

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
case I also called that spriter and this

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.459 
case I also called that spriter and this
has<00:00:53.820> two<00:00:54.059> events<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.440> actual

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
has two events in it one is the actual

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.170 
has two events in it one is the actual
event<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.800> generated<00:00:59.340> automatically<00:01:00.030> by

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
event that is generated automatically by

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.299 
event that is generated automatically by
construct<00:01:00.989> when<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> import<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.980> sprite<00:01:02.280> or

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
construct when you import a sprite or

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.420 
construct when you import a sprite or
file<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.930> other<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.379> an<00:01:04.530> event<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
file and the other is an event that I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.320 
file and the other is an event that I
create<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:07.170> my<00:01:07.650> own<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:08.040> I'll<00:01:08.189> explain<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
create on my own which I'll explain in a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.590 
create on my own which I'll explain in a
minute<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:11.549> really<00:01:11.729> important<00:01:12.299> thing<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
minute so one really important thing to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.990 
minute so one really important thing to
understand<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.619> all<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.369> sprites<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
understand is that all the sprites that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.179 
understand is that all the sprites that
are<00:01:15.150> automatically<00:01:15.750> created<00:01:16.020> when<00:01:16.799> you

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
are automatically created when you

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.990 
are automatically created when you
import<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.820> sprite<00:01:18.330> or<00:01:18.360> file<00:01:19.369> only<00:01:20.369> need<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.850> be

eventually<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:13.330> have<00:02:13.540> set<00:02:13.750> up<00:02:13.870> for<00:02:14.200> your

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
eventually you have set up for your

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.110 
eventually you have set up for your
playable<00:02:14.860> levels<00:02:15.220> in<00:02:15.430> your<00:02:15.550> game

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
playable levels in your game

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.050 
playable levels in your game
in<00:02:16.690> my<00:02:17.410> case<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:17.830> called<00:02:18.010> level<00:02:18.400> events<00:02:18.819> and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
in my case it's called level events and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.110 
in my case it's called level events and
you'll<00:02:19.270> see<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.950> right<00:02:21.130> up<00:02:21.280> at<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.430> top<00:02:21.550> I

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
you'll see that right up at the top I

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.600 
you'll see that right up at the top I
have<00:02:22.510> my<00:02:24.360> spriter<00:02:25.360> event<00:02:25.780> she<00:02:26.020> included<00:02:26.950> which

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
have my spriter event she included which

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.550 
have my spriter event she included which
means<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:29.650> runs<00:02:30.209> these<00:02:31.209> events<00:02:31.750> as<00:02:32.140> well

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
means that it runs these events as well

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.610 
means that it runs these events as well
and<00:02:32.920> that's<00:02:33.340> where<00:02:33.580> we<00:02:33.790> get<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.620> event

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
and that's where we get to this event

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.340 
and that's where we get to this event
that<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:35.830> added<00:02:36.130> manually<00:02:36.880> which<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.600> on<00:02:37.870> sort

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
that I added manually which is on sort

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
does I don't have to spread our object

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.720 
does I don't have to spread our object
to<00:02:49.390> begin<00:02:49.690> with<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.230> all<00:02:50.530> of<00:02:50.709> my<00:02:50.920> player<00:02:51.280> levels

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.620 
to begin with in all of my player levels
I<00:02:52.030> only<00:02:52.510> have<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.959> in<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.200> sprite<00:02:53.530> or<00:02:53.680> frame

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
I only have it in the sprite or frame

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.410 
I only have it in the sprite or frame
okay<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.900> by<00:02:56.610> making<00:02:57.610> this<00:03:00.269> making<00:03:01.269> that

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
okay and by making this making that

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.400 
okay and by making this making that
event<00:03:01.780> in<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.760> sprite<00:03:03.760> or<00:03:03.790> event<00:03:04.239> sheet<00:03:04.570> it

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
event in the sprite or event sheet it

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.550 
event in the sprite or event sheet it
while<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.300> frame<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.720> starting<00:03:08.110> up<00:03:08.260> it's

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
while the the frame is starting up it's

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.290 
while the the frame is starting up it's
going<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:08.830> create<00:03:09.130> that<00:03:09.190> needed<00:03:09.610> object<00:03:10.030> for

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
going to create that needed object for

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.060 
going to create that needed object for
me<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:11.500> because<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.700> member<00:03:14.070> because

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
me and because it is a member because

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.360 
me and because it is a member because
all<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.610> sprites<00:03:16.350> are<00:03:17.350> on<00:03:17.739> number<00:03:17.890> of<00:03:18.100> ones

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
all of the sprites are on number of ones

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.430 
all of the sprites are on number of ones
I'm<00:03:18.820> going<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.060> find<00:03:19.299> it

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.789 

you'll<00:03:23.440> see<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:23.829> it's<00:03:24.040> in<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.459> container

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.840 

associated<00:03:29.799> with<00:03:29.980> all<00:03:30.130> of<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.400> sprites<00:03:30.610> it

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
associated with all of the sprites it

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.569 
associated with all of the sprites it
requires<00:03:31.239> so<00:03:31.750> by<00:03:31.900> creating<00:03:32.440> one<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.400> these

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
requires so by creating one of these

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.100 
requires so by creating one of these
things<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:34.060> create<00:03:34.450> all<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.989> other

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
things you create all of the other

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.740 
things you create all of the other
things<00:03:35.470> needed<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:36.010> finish<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.489> off<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:37.420> finish

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
things needed to finish it off to finish

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.370 
things needed to finish it off to finish
that<00:03:38.160> container<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.459> speak<00:03:39.989> so<00:03:40.989> all<00:03:41.230> we

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
that container so to speak so all we

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.170 
that container so to speak so all we
have<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.560> do<00:03:41.799> is<00:03:42.100> have<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.370> one<00:03:42.670> event<00:03:42.970> that

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
have to do is have that one event that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.300 
have to do is have that one event that
creates<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.840> spriter<00:03:44.140> object<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.950> all<00:03:45.070> the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
creates the spriter object and all the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.699 
creates the spriter object and all the
sprites<00:03:45.549> follow<00:03:45.910> suit<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:47.320> really<00:03:47.590> nice

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
sprites follow suit and the really nice

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.780 
sprites follow suit and the really nice
thing<00:03:47.950> about<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.820> it<00:03:49.480> allows<00:03:49.720> us<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.470> edit

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
thing about that is it allows us to edit

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.180 
thing about that is it allows us to edit
all<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.940> our<00:03:52.090> sprites<00:03:52.510> in<00:03:52.840> only<00:03:53.140> one<00:03:53.500> place<00:03:53.530> in

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
all of our sprites in only one place in

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.880 
all of our sprites in only one place in
only<00:03:54.310> one<00:03:54.700> frame<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.540> not<00:03:56.140> having<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.560> worry

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
only one frame and not having to worry

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.670 
only one frame and not having to worry
about<00:03:57.280> these<00:03:57.880> changes<00:03:58.510> being<00:03:58.810> updated<00:03:59.110> or

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
about these changes being updated or

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
updating manually these changes in all

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.860 
updating manually these changes in all
of<00:04:01.989> the<00:04:02.140> other<00:04:02.260> frames<00:04:03.120> okay<00:04:04.120> so<00:04:04.180> back<00:04:04.630> in

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
of the other frames okay so back in

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.479 
of the other frames okay so back in
spriter<00:04:05.290> let's<00:04:05.650> say<00:04:05.829> I've<00:04:05.950> just<00:04:06.220> made

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
spriter let's say I've just made

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.819 
spriter let's say I've just made
additional<00:04:07.180> animations<00:04:07.810> or<00:04:08.140> tweaks<00:04:08.590> to

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
additional animations or tweaks to

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.099 
additional animations or tweaks to
animations<00:04:09.459> or<00:04:09.760> added<00:04:10.239> new<00:04:10.359> art<00:04:10.660> into

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
animations or added new art into

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.440 
animations or added new art into
animations<00:04:11.739> for<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.459> sake<00:04:12.640> of<00:04:12.670> this<00:04:12.910> demo<00:04:13.180> I

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
animations for the sake of this demo I

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.599 
animations for the sake of this demo I
just<00:04:13.690> put<00:04:13.900> some<00:04:14.549> kind<00:04:15.549> of<00:04:15.609> nonsense<00:04:16.109> things

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
just put some kind of nonsense things

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.159 
just put some kind of nonsense things
appear<00:04:18.609> over<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:18.910> idle<00:04:19.359> animation<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:20.049> the

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
appear over the idle animation of the

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.770 
appear over the idle animation of the
player<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:20.859> all<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.130> frames<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:22.510> that<00:04:22.599> you

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
player and all the frames so that you

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.670 
player and all the frames so that you
can<00:04:22.960> see<00:04:23.520> you'll<00:04:24.520> see<00:04:24.610> it<00:04:24.910> wouldn't<00:04:25.180> appear

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
can see you'll see it wouldn't appear

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.040 
can see you'll see it wouldn't appear
when<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.710> updated<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.460> constructive<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.780> and

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
when I updated and constructive and and

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.770 
when I updated and constructive and and
I<00:04:29.140> just<00:04:29.410> saved<00:04:30.390> my<00:04:31.390> project<00:04:31.900> as<00:04:32.200> both<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.970> SMS

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
I just saved my project as both the SMS
