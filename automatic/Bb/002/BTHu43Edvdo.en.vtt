00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello today's tip is very fast for 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.859
 helping boys three ways to fold 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.859
 the sleeves of your shirts 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.630
 the act of spending the sleeves and being 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.490
 associated with some goals or that you 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.619
 will relax after a long day of 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.930
 work leaves the image 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.670
 casual or that you will do some 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.650
 activity that requires effort 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.170
 Are you ready for it? 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.760
 the first fold adopted by the majority 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.800
 of men as it consists of 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.390
 simply wind the sleeves up 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.670
 or less at the elbow 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.670
 using size reference reference 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.110
 There is not much error but it is a more 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.120
 labor intensive than the mass and is also more 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.879
 hard work to be undone then it 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:02.430
 it's more interesting the second one recalls 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.019
 quite the first as it is 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.640
 more convenient for the environment of 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.189
 more formal work 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.140
 the difference is that it is easier to do 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.460
 and it gets a result more videos 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.460
 fabric and provincial 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.110
 besides being easier to do it 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.580
 can also be undone easily 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.620
 since it 's just a fist- pull 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.180
 Amanda does not get too threatened either. 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.250
 when you find out you have been the third 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.320
 more interesting for shirts 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.880
 for events in moments of 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.160
 leisure activities involving a more 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.140
 casual is cool with the shirt that 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.160
 have different patterns or colors of the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.160
 inside the club 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.440
 in this fold the detail group is 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.790
 apparent leaving the result even more 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.340
 relaxed 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.380
 although the other two works may be 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.450
 used both above and below the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.180
 elbow depending on your taste 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.100
 purpose and in its proportions in this 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.590
 specific way is the coolest is to maintain 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.060
 always above the elbow is also 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.060
 undone with some ease 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.150
 continue to send your questions to 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.150
 people see each other in the week that reads
