00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.009 
case you were wondering and I don't know
it<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.430> got<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.060> like<00:02:15.239> five<00:02:15.390> years<00:02:15.540> ago<00:02:15.690> so

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
it just I got it like five years ago so

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.770 
it just I got it like five years ago so
that<00:02:16.560> was<00:02:16.709> like<00:02:16.739> when<00:02:17.130> none<00:02:17.489> of<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.910> nicer<00:02:18.570> one

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
that was like when none of the nicer one

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.890 
that was like when none of the nicer one
came<00:02:19.080> out<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.760> it's<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.970> last<00:02:21.180> until<00:02:21.540> now<00:02:21.720> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
came out and it's the last until now and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.570 
came out and it's the last until now and
there's<00:02:22.110> no<00:02:22.260> reason<00:02:22.470> for<00:02:22.769> me<00:02:22.799> to<00:02:22.890> get<00:02:23.160> no<00:02:23.370> one

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
there's no reason for me to get no one

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.150 
there's no reason for me to get no one
unless<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:25.170> one<00:02:25.320> broke<00:02:25.530> down<00:02:25.739> but<00:02:25.980> it's

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
unless I this one broke down but it's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.430 
unless I this one broke down but it's
been<00:02:26.340> five<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.970> six<00:02:27.209> years<00:02:27.269> so<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.690> think<00:02:28.170> that's

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
been five to six years so I think that's

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.370 
been five to six years so I think that's
just<00:02:28.709> amazing<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.390> think<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.750> worth<00:02:31.019> the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
just amazing and I think it worth the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.580 
just amazing and I think it worth the
investment<00:02:31.530> because<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.340> used<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:32.850> spend<00:02:33.590> like

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
investment because I used to spend like

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.410 
investment because I used to spend like
