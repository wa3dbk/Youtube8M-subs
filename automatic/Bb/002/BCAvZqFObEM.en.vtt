 first of all i will introduce you to garm 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.290
 of diamonds which is the most powerful of 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.770
 this mode for the moment so first of all 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.200
 you have the storm hammerhead so for 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.740
 kraft and you will need a crystal soul 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.700
 5 dimon christol and a diamond 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.010
 hammerhead so for the stum storm dam 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.170
 for the storm hammerhead you will need 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.850
 a diamond amr is so I'm going to you 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.410
 present right away better dimon 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.330
 hammerhead for kraft and that you will need 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.270
 a diamond and if dimon christol then 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.390
 dimon haendel so for kraft and he 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.640
 will need three dimon christol that you 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.850
 will progress like this with an oxide 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.500
 yann stick in the middle and now you 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.180
 you will be able to capture your dimon hammer 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.500
 so which is the second most 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.410
 powerful mode since it will make you 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.150
 10 damage so for the kraft and he 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.710
 will simply need the diamond 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:37.110
 hammerhead and e dimon haendel so here we go 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.850
 how to kraft and the diamond hammer and 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.760
 then you have the final weapons 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.890
 hammer of storm so he prograf t he 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.810
 you will need the storm hammerhead and e 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.340
 dimon hammer so you too want 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.880
 Crafter this weapon you will have to do 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.900
 two dimon hammerhead since you have 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.230
 need it from the storm hammerhead which 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.030
 requires a dimon hammerhead this is for 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.290
 look at me from the hammer of thorns so I 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.370
 will show you the skin right away 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.230
 it's already dark 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:10.170
 my god is stein 7 0 here you are 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.850
 see the skin is still super nice 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.640
 it's a small hammer but that makes 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.950
 a lot of damage was done 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.500
 you 14 saw you killed a horse 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.020
 in just two shots this weapon is 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.940
 just overpowered really went 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.490
 nice but we'll go right now 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.320
 at my favorite skin level since she 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.400
 is really super nice it makes me 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.500
 think about 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.669
 to a sword in dofus so I'm going to you 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.699
 present right away so he you 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.699
 need the outs blade name so it's a 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:42.960
 little buggy apparently blenheim so for 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:46.410
 the graff t you will need six gold 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.940
 christophe and a gold soultz christophe 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.270
 excuse me it's complicated to say and 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.380
 so you will have taken place at Hadj Brahim 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.280
 then he would like you to 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.020
 smile sword 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.580
 so if she is a sword you 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.139
 can also use it makes the 5 of 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.690
 damage so to craft that you 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.880
 will need the same you will need storks 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.280
 christol and there you add an obsidian 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.949
 stick and then you will be able 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.830
 kraft and the sword of what so for to 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:14.400
 crafter you will need a water to double 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.350
 name and a smite sword so you'll 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.770
 a weapon once kraft and that will make you 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.470
 of the nano tray 5 and smite 5 so who will 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.060
 very strong on mobs so I'm going to 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.690
 to do right now since when we get 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.370
 give it like that it is not enchanted 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.969
 here we go to craft right away 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.199
 we'll take this and that 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.809
 besides, I will show you first 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.489
 the sword greeted I show it to you for 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:41.889
 show what does it look like 

00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:45.489
 see huh it's a pretty basic sword 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.139
 1 it's a diamond sword but but 

00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:50.769
 orange that's just 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:53.679
 so you 're going to put it like this and that 

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:57.009
 like that and you'll have the sword of what 

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:59.589
 which is just too much what is being watched 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.849
 she is not that tiger and that ep good there 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:02.829
 it's a pity he did not put in 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.929
 the other way but really go too much 

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:06.189

 visit with our smite 5 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:11.769
 in my opinion he wants to learn a lot of 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:14.039
 damage not because this corn 5 c on the 

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:16.389
