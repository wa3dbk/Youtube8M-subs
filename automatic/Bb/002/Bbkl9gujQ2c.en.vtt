00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.269
 what is creating the portal at the end and what 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.250
 we can activate and well 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.869
 teleport to the entity and good before 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.989
 to start the tutorial I wanted them 

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:48.989
 comment that this portal is only 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.420
 can activate on new maps what I 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.970
 I mean new maps, that is when 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.129
 have downloaded your update 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.820
 will have to create a new world for 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.309
 make the portal and activate it and they will say 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.260
 what because in old maps or maps 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.110
 that they had long ago in which 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.170
 are playing I do not know in those maps I do not know 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.540
 will be able to activate the portal ok this 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.210
 been doing tests on me in my 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.580
 old maps and the truth 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.979
 I do not do it but it does not activate 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.820
 it does not activate and I can not teleport 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.950
 me to art if this one please leave me in 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.680
 your comments if it's true that you do not 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.380
 can be done in old maps this 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.080
 check what you can do 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.670
 a comment saying if it can be done 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.040
 but I was doing tests and I do not know 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.860
 can do who knows if it's for 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.640
 minecraft I do not know you check and good 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.399
 this is the portal can not be done either 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.770
 in survival because you can not do it in 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.070
 survival because this little thing leaves them 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.250
 teach here is 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.610
 in the final portal structure is 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.760
 this item can not be captured gentlemen no 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.070
 there's been a search on the table now 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.610
 if the creation table does not appear 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.930
 this item to change it I do not know why 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.600
 what but it does not appear in survival mode 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.450
 it can be done that it made a shame the 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.390
 true because everything I wanted to play in 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.760
 survival and kraft and I'll do the the 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.160
 little portal of the fart to be able to go kill 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.890
 to the dragon but no you can not gentlemen 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.320
 this if I'm wrong also also leave 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.030
 in the comments state checking if 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.910
 can capture and all that I asked and there's no 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.010
 sight that can be captured and well this one 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.110
 it can not be shared and since it does not 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.090
 can do that we can not do it in 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.760
 survival mode only in creative mode 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.790
 because here he gives us the material and good 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.489
 this is the only thing I wanted to tell you 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.650
 please leave in the comments if I 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.690
 I do not mistaken mistaken their 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.510
 own tests and well let's start 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.700
 to make the portal what we need is 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.520
 obviously this elite 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.550
 structure of sport at the end 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:10.110
 we need one and obviously we need 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.819
 eyes of ender ok we need those two and 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.099
 the only thing we have to do is very 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.130
 very simple the truth but for which 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.690
 do not know , you'll see it ok first thing 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.450
 what we have to do is put three of 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.000
 is this way one two three or that 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.580
 once done this we leave the east 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.080
 space I broke it nothing else this one leaving it 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:33.360
 to tampa we leave that space and we put 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.140
 here another three one two three 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.750
 we leave the space and here one two three 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.569
 we left the space 123 ok so 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.790
 simple see it so it is very very 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.370
 simple the truth ok 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.920
 Once this is done we will make a 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.319
 deep floor like that a floor of 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.769
 depth let's remove this what 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:59.010
 we removed all this leaving you from this 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.140
 ok way we will stay like this and now 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.079
 what we have to put are the eyes of 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.870
 Ender in each space of the squares 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.120
 that we have like this in this way 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.190
 with left click we are putting 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.209
 with left click forgiveness with trigger 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:17.530
 left we're putting in each slot 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:20.720
 we fill all the slots and wii 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.220
 we fill all the slots and when 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:28.100
 let's go put the last check for the 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.710
 tip activates the portal at the end ok 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.040
 As you can see everything is strange it looks like a 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.120
 universe 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.910
 it looks very father is how the 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.760
 portal is that as star types or 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.860
 It would not look good parents 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.530
 true and good this and the only thing that 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.780
 they have to do is go to the portal 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:55.150
 he added to take a dive he was nailed 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:57.610
 olympic wow a young man is this this one 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.150
 teleports us immediately 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.340
 we are inside the world of the entity and this one 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.340
 we will not be able to leave here if not 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.650
 we kill the dragon we are damned 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.290
 so to speak I'm going to end up because 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.840
 strange people appeared I do not know why there 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.900
 is and well here this is the world of 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.600
 to which we already wanted to wait so much 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.380
 time we have it here gentlemen up 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.020
 they get sick and here is the in 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.390
 dragon and I do not know why his translations 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.150
 rare of the xbox 360 minecraft must 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.580
 central contender should actually 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.380
 decide between dragon but in short no longer 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.889
 They know how are the 4 j this 10 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:42.759
 well there is the dragon this is already with 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:45.909
 thing to break these things so that 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:48.310
 the dragon regenerates and good and nothing 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:50.830
 the more they kill him here I could kill him the 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.439
 I already killed him once and first 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.050
 this destroy these little things so that 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:57.999
 life goes on destroying them and everything 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.979
 the hair here I am instructing and 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:01.990
 Well, I'm not going to kill him. I 'm going to 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.960
 let you kill him so they can see 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.680
 how is the fart going on and all that 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.409
 but what a disgrace that the portal is not 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.029
 can not be done in survivor so that 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.520
 come here to be by and see what you kill with 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:16.870
 the ark kevin hardcore but I do not know I want 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.180
 that you can only kill it in mode 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.490

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.620

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.419

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.889
 arrows as they want to kill this poor 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.789
 dragon are going to do bullying in the 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:35.979
 extreme and good there when they kill him there
