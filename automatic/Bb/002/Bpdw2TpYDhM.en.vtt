00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello people today I want you guys 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.610
 show how to use the new Schmalix 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.230
 theory that cuts the brake hoses and 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.150
 Although it is so disconnected now 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.460
 in there and brake hoses 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.529
 are much longer and that is 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.600
 of course a stupid thing now if 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.300
 you buy the new ones and his 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.529
 want to mount bike later 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.869
 I just do it very fast 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.150
 show how easy it is now 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.880
 easy this rubber cover here 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.920
 just from then you have one here 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.200
 Eighth screw screwed yes just 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.829
 out I've already prepared then 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.590
 he pushes the very back and so on 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.390
 then comes the thing so you 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.840
 put the brake a bit bit 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.969
 higher 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.270
 best and then you pull this 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:57.149
 Just look out and see how I do it 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:01.289
 has it and then you look how long you should 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.460
 the only one is not too short than that 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.330
 handlebars on the other side once 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:11.490
 suggests pictures do not break off 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.439
 because you just have to sometimes look at so 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.670
 I think it is a good 20 centimeters 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.820
 I'll say that now 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:30.360
 that looks good, too , that has to be 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:35.369
 I would look a little bit like what 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.320
 say so you can I have yes 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.240
 for example here such a scissors from 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.930
 ready for my dogs guidance you see it 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.750
 sharpened on both sides can see is 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.829
 a fine thing 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.390
 so the cable does not prohibit normal 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.979
 That's why I'm doing with the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.979
 here just here 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.829
 sever 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.820
 then come the new ones 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:23.780
 I have the new sleeve which is the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.340
 is already in the carton 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.310
 when he bought the shimano my name is 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:34.100
 get up quickly and he will not be so long 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.170
 to wait is a very simple thing 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.459
 you donate on that too 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.069
 I have to show you yet 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.200
 So first of all, first of all 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:52.220
 this sleeve is about to sleep 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:54.800
 put it back so easy then 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.750
 the problematic is this piece 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.180
 you have to put in there 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.080
 that is, so to speak, this one 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.780
 Sealing ring so to speak yes that is 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:10.790
 not easy now 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:13.900
 I 'll try one like that 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:20.720
 tongs just hold here so 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:23.450
 whether now in the valley go you know the 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.750
 yes, just try it a bit 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:34.820
 turn the hole and then 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:38.859
 just try the plug in like 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.859
 You see, that's not so easy 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:55.810
 so I'm already halfway in there then get 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:04:12.430
 me my hammer hit that far 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:18.130
 rhine until it sits flush on then take 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:20.950
 I pull the piece and pulls it into it 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.500
 this sealing ring in reality the 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.910
 sleeve the one bruise that makes 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.040
 but it will be you first again 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:32.370
 line I take that is the piece 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.370
 here until it is right trainer 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:52.030
 the sleeve in it must be really tight 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.639
 be separated in any case not the 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.750
 brake, otherwise you have 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.860
 lost a little bit so refill it 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.160
 is not as good as I think so 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.160
 imagine 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.530
 for whatever reason 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.530
 I want to try it again 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:24.280
 the screw purely as far as possible the 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:31.640
 corresponding eighth wrench or 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:42.710
 just as I do not cope 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:45.140
 It's always done that way 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.980
 tight burning seat otherwise have the air 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:57.470
 Afterwards nice and quiet with with pressure 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:06:02.240
 work inside and the quince is pretty tight 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:04.780
 You can also participate again now 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.780
 reingeht 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:18.090
 as I have half my bread with 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:21.900
 deserves to be pulled tight and 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.510
 then praise the whole thing again 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.980
 a regular length of 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.100
 have brake line and maybe should 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:34.580
 but better on the night exclude that 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.580
 you can not do the screw 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.790
 not too firm but not too relaxed 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:55.620
 but it does not have to be 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:56.460
 you know that feels so to me 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.970
 opinion after good 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:02.520
 test now Mama pressure point is here 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.830
 I do not need to refill the brake 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.930
 that was already people so I hope 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.290
 I could help you even if that 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.520
 is a bit confused but here was 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:14.130
 It was fun once again 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.810
 to show that and do not forget thumbs 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.810
 high how much fun people watch
