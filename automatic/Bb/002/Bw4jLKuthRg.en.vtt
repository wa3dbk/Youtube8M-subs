he's<00:00:46.670> definitely<00:00:46.940> bigger<00:00:47.329> as<00:00:47.570> you<00:00:47.690> can<00:00:47.839> see<00:00:48.050> I

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
he's definitely bigger as you can see I

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.189 
he's definitely bigger as you can see I
think<00:00:49.280> I'm<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.519> bit<00:00:49.730> faster<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.870> won't<00:00:51.050> say

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
think I'm a bit faster you won't say

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.810 
think I'm a bit faster you won't say
that<00:00:51.379> he<00:00:51.470> won't<00:00:51.650> admit<00:00:51.739> it<00:00:51.890> but<00:00:52.129> and<00:00:52.640> then<00:00:52.730> I

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
that he won't admit it but and then I

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.430 
that he won't admit it but and then I
think<00:00:53.000> I'm<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.150> bit<00:00:53.329> stronger<00:00:53.659> than<00:00:53.809> Germany<00:00:54.230> I

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
think I'm a bit stronger than Germany I

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.079 
think I'm a bit stronger than Germany I
think<00:00:54.680> Jesse's<00:00:55.159> more<00:00:55.339> the<00:00:55.430> serious<00:00:55.790> one<00:00:55.970> of

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
think Jesse's more the serious one of

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.299 
think Jesse's more the serious one of
the<00:00:56.269> two<00:00:56.449> of<00:00:56.570> us<00:00:56.659> it<00:00:57.290> is<00:00:57.379> three<00:00:57.710> minutes<00:00:57.830> older

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
the two of us it is three minutes older

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.619 
the two of us it is three minutes older
so<00:00:58.519> he<00:00:58.790> does<00:00:58.939> take<00:00:59.150> things<00:00:59.360> a<00:00:59.479> bit<00:00:59.600> more

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
so he does take things a bit more

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.259 
so he does take things a bit more
serious<00:01:00.049> and<00:01:00.110> I<00:01:00.229> do

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.360 

with<00:02:40.640> one<00:02:40.790> very<00:02:41.030> big<00:02:41.180> team<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:42.110> think

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
with one very big team and I think

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.350 
with one very big team and I think
depending<00:02:43.370> on<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.520> conditions<00:02:43.940> we<00:02:44.060> can<00:02:44.210> play

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
depending on the conditions we can play

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.930 
depending on the conditions we can play
a<00:02:44.630> very<00:02:44.990> physical<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.740> direct<00:02:46.100> game<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.490> if

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
a very physical and direct game and if

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.250 
a very physical and direct game and if
we<00:02:47.030> let<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.270> ball<00:02:47.420> flow<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:47.690> think<00:02:47.930> we<00:02:48.020> can<00:02:48.140> also

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
we let the ball flow I think we can also

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.200 
we let the ball flow I think we can also
very<00:02:48.500> very<00:02:48.620> wide<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.040> expensive<00:02:49.520> game<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:49.970> I

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
very very wide and expensive game so I

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.850 
very very wide and expensive game so I
think<00:02:50.540> we've<00:02:50.810> prepared<00:02:51.170> for<00:02:51.260> both<00:02:51.500> and

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
think we've prepared for both and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.560 
think we've prepared for both and
whatever<00:02:52.400> gets<00:02:52.730> thrown<00:02:52.790> at<00:02:52.940> us<00:02:53.150> will<00:02:53.450> the
