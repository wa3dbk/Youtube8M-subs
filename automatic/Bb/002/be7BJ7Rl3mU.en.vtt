00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.799
 this story is about common adversaries about 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.680
 who spoils life and car 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.570
 the engineer and the boxer are overweight as 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.340
 extra pounds prevent athlete so 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.049
 and in the car overweight leads to 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.330
 greater fuel consumption and overall 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.340
 decrease in efficiency but unlike 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.529
 boxer car will not put on a diet 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.090
 body must be strong and tough 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.430
 because strength is safety 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.109
 stiffness pledge better handling when 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.730
 developing technology skyactiv we 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.289
 sought to increase body rigidity 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.699
 at 30 percent and maximum 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.630
 security at eight percent 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.090
 weight loss 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.430
 for this we used high strength 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.530
 steel which is much tougher and lighter 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.239
 conventional and optimized geometry 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.160
 bodywork with affective shockproof 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.780
 guides that use 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.030
 the rigidity of the whole body 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.800
 designing chassis we sought Nikita 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.230
 and weight gain characteristic for mazda 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.090
 maneuverability and stability making the steering wheel 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.980
 sharper we added manageability on 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.320
 low speeds and improved front 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.809
 suspension added stability on 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.420
 high so you rode soft as 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.609
 autobahn behind we changed the angles 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.650
 wheels and pivot points in the suspension to 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.570
 improve overall maximum stability 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.430
 smooth out bumps in the road and reduce 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.840
 slowdown innovation 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.850
 of this magnitude are only possible when 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.740
 developing from scratch usually 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.990
 chassis and bodywork are developed different 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.030
 designers even different companies in 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.590
 different times with this approach every 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.180
 part of the car has to be customized 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.950
 under the others that means impossibility 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.689
 bring them to perfection as 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.610
 separately so together our 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.530
 body builders and chassis work 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.659
 together so we don't have to look 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.400
 compromises another example why not 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.350
 take advantage of enhanced crash 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.150
 body zones and do not mount the suspension on 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.369
 them instead of amplifying under 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.100
 mounting other body parts result 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.710
 14 percent drop in weight 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.640
 bios reduced controllability we achieved 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.130
 amazing numbers in terms of lower 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.120
 not weight and fuel economy but the numbers are 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.400
 just numbers 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.830
 mazda owners want to receive from 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.950
 car fun and we do everything 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.990
 so you really feel it 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.780
 another point in favor of engineers mazda 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.990
 for a sharp mind and an unexpected decision 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.280
 boxers you really like technology yourself 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.990
 skyactiv 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.990
 from mazda dare
