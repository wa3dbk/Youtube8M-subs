60 right now and i've been rare and i'm

60 right now and i've been rare and i'm
recording<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:24.960> fraps<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:26.130> i<00:01:26.540> can<00:01:27.540> see<00:01:27.720> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
recording with fraps so i can see a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.390 
recording with fraps so i can see a
difference<00:01:27.869> already<00:01:28.439> which<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.159> good<00:01:29.340> thing

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
difference already which is a good thing

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.270 
difference already which is a good thing
I'm<00:01:29.820> oh<00:01:30.150> okay<00:01:30.600> there's<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.229> drop<00:01:31.500> there<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
I'm oh okay there's a drop there but I

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.859 
I'm oh okay there's a drop there but I
knew<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.850> wasn't<00:01:33.000> gonna<00:01:33.150> fix<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.689> hundred

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
knew it wasn't gonna fix it a hundred

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.219 
knew it wasn't gonna fix it a hundred
percent<00:01:34.079> because<00:01:34.970> props<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.570> hard<00:01:36.960> drive

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
percent because props is so hard drive

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.010 
percent because props is so hard drive
intensive<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.130> that's<00:01:38.820> why<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.060> lags<00:01:39.630> for

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
intensive and that's why it lags for

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.069 
intensive and that's why it lags for
like<00:01:40.170> everybody<00:01:40.729> but<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.540> better

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
like everybody but you know it's better

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.410 
like everybody but you know it's better

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
I'm not dipping as nearly as much and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.510 
I'm not dipping as nearly as much and
it's<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.720> better<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:45.990> if<00:01:46.799> you're<00:01:47.009> looking<00:01:47.369> to

Intel processor that's what I'm rocking
right<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.960> an<00:02:03.960> i7<00:02:05.450> 4770k<00:02:06.450> i<00:02:06.750> believe

right now I have an i7 4770k i believe

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.830 
right now I have an i7 4770k i believe
and<00:02:07.429> then<00:02:08.429> i<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.550> my<00:02:08.700> nvidia<00:02:09.179> geforce<00:02:09.929> GT

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
and then i have my nvidia geforce GT

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.610 
and then i have my nvidia geforce GT
I<00:02:11.840> think<00:02:12.409> it's<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.939> 960<00:02:13.939> or<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.209> 970<00:02:14.870> all<00:02:15.560> I

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
I think it's the 960 or the 970 all I

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.259 
I think it's the 960 or the 970 all I
know<00:02:15.829> is<00:02:15.980> it's<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.489> version<00:02:16.909> that<00:02:17.030> they<00:02:17.120> only

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
know is it's this version that they only

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.670 
know is it's this version that they only
had<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.629> that's<00:02:17.750> why<00:02:17.930> it's<00:02:18.049> the<00:02:18.170> fort<00:02:18.439> irwin

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
had it that's why it's the fort irwin

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.589 
had it that's why it's the fort irwin
edition<00:02:19.189> it's<00:02:19.819> just<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.090> little<00:02:20.299> bit<00:02:20.390> faster

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
edition it's just a little bit faster

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.199 
edition it's just a little bit faster
than<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.079> previous<00:02:21.500> one<00:02:21.769> so<00:02:22.610> it's<00:02:22.819> not<00:02:22.970> like<00:02:23.180> a

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
than the previous one so it's not like a

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.000 
than the previous one so it's not like a
major<00:02:23.689> difference<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.260> mean<00:02:24.470> it's<00:02:24.769> still

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
major difference I mean it's still

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.069 
major difference I mean it's still
faster<00:02:25.730> that's<00:02:26.090> what<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.390> says<00:02:26.870> it's<00:02:27.019> supposed

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
faster that's what it says it's supposed

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.610 
faster that's what it says it's supposed
to<00:02:27.409> do<00:02:27.620> but<00:02:28.489> I<00:02:29.150> don't<00:02:29.599> know<00:02:29.870> how<00:02:30.230> much<00:02:30.440> it

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
to do but I don't know how much it

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.119 
to do but I don't know how much it
actually<00:02:30.799> is<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:32.420> anyway<00:02:32.870> let's<00:02:33.290> go<00:02:33.440> find<00:02:33.890> act

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
actually is so anyway let's go find act

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.039 
actually is so anyway let's go find act
to<00:02:34.459> what<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.790> hell<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.480> think<00:02:35.540> it's<00:02:35.810> over

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
to what the hell is it I think it's over

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.710 
to what the hell is it I think it's over
here<00:02:36.340> attacked<00:02:37.340> 3x<00:02:37.909> you<00:02:38.060> must<00:02:38.269> be<00:02:38.359> right<00:02:38.510> here

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
here attacked 3x you must be right here

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.319 
here attacked 3x you must be right here
whoops<00:02:40.299> this<00:02:41.299> act<00:02:41.510> too<00:02:41.689> ding<00:02:42.379> dong<00:02:42.590> ok<00:02:43.329> uh-oh

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
whoops this act too ding dong ok uh-oh

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.789 
whoops this act too ding dong ok uh-oh
this<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.109> what<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.290> think<00:02:45.530> Sonic<00:02:45.769> Generations

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
this is what I think Sonic Generations

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.069 
this is what I think Sonic Generations
should<00:02:46.430> have<00:02:46.549> had<00:02:46.670> but<00:02:46.909> it<00:02:47.120> was<00:02:47.299> rushed<00:02:47.720> very

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
should have had but it was rushed very

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.160 
should have had but it was rushed very
badly<00:02:48.349> like<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.459> fully<00:02:49.819> explorable<00:02:50.480> 3d<00:02:50.959> hub

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
badly like a fully explorable 3d hub

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.809 
badly like a fully explorable 3d hub
like<00:02:51.349> this<00:02:51.560> that's<00:02:51.769> styled<00:02:52.310> for<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.519> level

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
like this that's styled for the level

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.190 
like this that's styled for the level
that<00:02:52.909> you're<00:02:53.090> in<00:02:53.150> like<00:02:53.269> imagine<00:02:53.659> it's<00:02:53.900> doing

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
that you're in like imagine it's doing

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.599 
that you're in like imagine it's doing
something<00:02:54.290> like<00:02:54.470> this<00:02:54.530> but<00:02:54.950> like<00:02:55.010> for<00:02:55.370> green

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
something like this but like for green

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.819 
something like this but like for green
hill<00:02:55.819> zone<00:02:55.849> or<00:02:56.150> something<00:02:56.379> it<00:02:57.379> could<00:02:57.739> have

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
hill zone or something it could have

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.890 
hill zone or something it could have
been<00:02:57.859> to<00:02:58.129> d4<00:02:58.489> Classic<00:02:58.849> Sonic<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.359> like<00:02:59.569> this

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
been to d4 Classic Sonic and like this

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.930 
been to d4 Classic Sonic and like this
for<00:03:00.200> modern<00:03:00.470> but<00:03:00.739> you<00:03:01.129> know<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.459> mean<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:01.909> guess

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
for modern but you know I mean I guess

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.580 
for modern but you know I mean I guess
that's<00:03:02.299> a<00:03:02.389> good<00:03:02.540> idea<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:03.139> I<00:03:03.170> don't<00:03:03.379> know<00:03:03.470> why

that's a good idea so I don't know why

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.740

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.950 
and obviously those have lacked recently
but<00:04:56.200> I<00:04:56.790> don't<00:04:57.790> think<00:04:58.000> a<00:04:58.180> game<00:04:58.390> it<00:04:58.540> needs<00:04:58.780> a

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
but I don't think a game it needs a

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.290 
but I don't think a game it needs a
great<00:04:59.230> story<00:04:59.590> to<00:04:59.680> be<00:04:59.890> good<00:05:00.130> it's<00:05:01.030> just

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
great story to be good it's just

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.550 
great story to be good it's just
something<00:05:01.420> extra<00:05:02.020> that's<00:05:02.200> like<00:05:02.410> really

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
something extra that's like really

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.840 
something extra that's like really
rewarding<00:05:03.040> because<00:05:03.100> it<00:05:03.280> shows<00:05:03.460> you<00:05:03.580> that<00:05:03.700> they

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
rewarding because it shows you that they

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.610 
rewarding because it shows you that they
really<00:05:04.060> thought<00:05:04.600> about<00:05:04.660> it<00:05:04.930> and<00:05:05.140> took<00:05:05.320> time

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
really thought about it and took time

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.880 
really thought about it and took time
with<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.950> game<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.190> that's<00:05:07.120> just<00:05:07.450> me<00:05:07.720> so<00:05:08.590> if

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
with the game and that's just me so if

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.360 
with the game and that's just me so if
if<00:05:09.190> a<00:05:09.580> game<00:05:09.790> is<00:05:09.820> super<00:05:10.510> super<00:05:10.870> fun<00:05:11.320> then<00:05:12.100> I<00:05:12.130> can

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
if a game is super super fun then I can

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.090 
if a game is super super fun then I can
look<00:05:12.520> past<00:05:12.730> like<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.240> plot<00:05:13.800> let's<00:05:14.800> see<00:05:14.950> that's
