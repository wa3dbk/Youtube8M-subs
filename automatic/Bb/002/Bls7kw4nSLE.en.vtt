this<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.280> lesson<00:00:08.610> 26<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.450> series<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.780> short

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
this is lesson 26 in a series of short

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.409 
this is lesson 26 in a series of short
lessons<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.129> video<00:00:11.519> will<00:00:11.849> focus<00:00:11.910> on<00:00:12.360> how

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:12.419 
lessons and this video will focus on how

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.480 
lessons and this video will focus on how
to<00:00:12.599> transpose<00:00:13.259> we're<00:00:13.740> gonna<00:00:13.860> start<00:00:14.190> by

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
to transpose we're gonna start by

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.890 
to transpose we're gonna start by
looking<00:00:14.519> at<00:00:14.969> how<00:00:15.119> to<00:00:15.179> use<00:00:15.269> numbers<00:00:15.869> to

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
looking at how to use numbers to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.380 
looking at how to use numbers to
transpose<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> melody<00:00:17.160> first<00:00:17.640> let's<00:00:18.180> take<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
transpose a melody first let's take a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.030 
transpose a melody first let's take a
look<00:00:18.630> at<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> C<00:00:19.050> scale<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.740> we're<00:00:19.950> gonna

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
look at the C scale and we're gonna

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.980 
look at the C scale and we're gonna
associate<00:00:20.370> a<00:00:20.610> number<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:21.390> each<00:00:21.510> note<00:00:21.780> within

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
associate a number to each note within

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.200 
associate a number to each note within
the<00:00:22.230> scale<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:22.950> call<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.550> scale<00:00:23.820> degree

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the scale we call this the scale degree

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.510 
the scale we call this the scale degree
so<00:00:24.690> C<00:00:24.870> is<00:00:25.020> the<00:00:25.050> first<00:00:25.380> scale<00:00:25.620> degree<00:00:25.650> D<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.340> the

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
so C is the first scale degree D is the

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.910 
so C is the first scale degree D is the
second<00:00:26.940> is<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.390> third<00:00:27.630> F<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> fourth<00:00:28.680> and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
second is the third F is the fourth and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.500 
second is the third F is the fourth and
so<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.100> now<00:00:29.490> if<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.670> think<00:00:29.790> about<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.180> melody

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
so on now if we think about the melody

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.359 
so on now if we think about the melody
of<00:00:30.540> a<00:00:30.660> song<00:00:30.690> based<00:00:31.230> off<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:31.710> scale<00:00:31.980> degree

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
of a song based off what scale degree

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.160 
of a song based off what scale degree
you're<00:00:32.550> playing<00:00:32.789> you<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.360> transpose<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
you're playing you can transpose it to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.750 
you're playing you can transpose it to
any<00:00:34.350> key<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.010> we're<00:00:35.130> gonna<00:00:35.250> play<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.490> simple

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
any key so we're gonna play a simple

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.760 
any key so we're gonna play a simple
melody<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.420> key<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.780> C<00:00:36.990> and<00:00:37.230> look<00:00:37.500> at<00:00:37.620> what

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
melody in the key of C and look at what

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.590 
melody in the key of C and look at what
numbers<00:00:38.190> or<00:00:38.430> what<00:00:38.579> scale<00:00:38.880> degrees<00:00:39.300> are<00:00:39.570> being

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
numbers or what scale degrees are being

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.510 
numbers or what scale degrees are being
used<00:00:40.050> we're<00:00:40.470> gonna<00:00:40.590> look<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> song<00:00:41.190> mary

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
used we're gonna look at the song mary

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.190 
used we're gonna look at the song mary
had<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> little<00:00:41.880> lamb<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.600> gonna<00:00:42.720> start<00:00:43.050> on

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.810 
had a little lamb it's gonna start on
the<00:00:43.320> third<00:00:43.530> scale<00:00:43.800> degree<00:00:44.190> which<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> key

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the third scale degree which in the key

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.819 
the third scale degree which in the key
of<00:00:44.850> c<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.450> note<00:00:45.630> e<00:00:45.810> and<00:00:45.900> we're<00:00:46.560> going<00:00:46.739> to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
of c is the note e and we're going to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.370 
of c is the note e and we're going to
basically<00:00:46.980> play<00:00:47.460> three<00:00:48.000> two<00:00:48.270> one<00:00:48.630> two<00:00:48.960> three

three three and continue on from there

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.720 
three three and continue on from there
pay<00:00:52.110> attention<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:52.890> scale<00:00:53.190> degrees<00:00:53.550> we

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
pay attention to what scale degrees we

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.160 
pay attention to what scale degrees we
play<00:00:53.970> throughout<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.390> melody<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.110> song

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170

play throughout the melody of this song
it<00:00:55.649> goes<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.070> this

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.560 

so<00:01:13.259> now<00:01:13.409> we're<00:01:13.560> gonna<00:01:13.710> jump<00:01:14.039> up<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.729> key<00:01:15.450> of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
so now we're gonna jump up to the key of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.450 
so now we're gonna jump up to the key of
G<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.109> again<00:01:16.530> we're<00:01:16.649> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.859> attribute<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
G and again we're going to attribute the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.789 
G and again we're going to attribute the
numbers<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.210> scale<00:01:18.479> degrees<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.289> key<00:01:19.500> and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
numbers the scale degrees to the key and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.590 
numbers the scale degrees to the key and
we're<00:01:19.890> gonna<00:01:19.979> play<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.399> song<00:01:20.609> again<00:01:20.939> notice

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
we're gonna play the song again notice

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.539 
we're gonna play the song again notice
how<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> number<00:01:22.140> combination<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.979> exactly

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
how the number combination is exactly

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:41.300 
how the number combination is exactly
the<00:01:23.789> same<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.360> goes<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.810> this

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.280 

so<00:01:41.940> if<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.240> were<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.540> play<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.020> number

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
so if we were to play that number

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.260 
so if we were to play that number
combination<00:01:44.100> 3<00:01:44.400> 2<00:01:44.610> 1<00:01:44.850> 2<00:01:45.119> 3<00:01:45.360> 3<00:01:45.630> 3<00:01:45.750> 2<00:01:46.350> 2<00:01:46.380> 2<00:01:46.799> 3<00:01:46.830> 5<00:01:47.430> 5<00:01:47.670> 3

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
combination 3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 2 3 5 5 3

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.249 
combination 3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 2 3 5 5 3
2<00:01:48.450> 1<00:01:48.690> 2<00:01:48.900> 3<00:01:49.110> 3<00:01:49.380> 3<00:01:49.680> 2<00:01:50.070> 2<00:01:50.100> 3<00:01:50.340> 2<00:01:50.790> 1<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.720> basically

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 3 2 1 it's basically

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.050 
2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 3 2 1 it's basically
gonna<00:01:52.590> give<00:01:52.890> us<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.070> song<00:01:53.520> mary<00:01:53.820> had<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> little

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
do that with any melody we can actually

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.649 
do that with any melody we can actually
also<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.369> chords<00:01:59.850> right<00:02:00.390> now<00:02:00.479> we're

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
also do it with chords right now we're

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.210 
also do it with chords right now we're
in<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> key<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.020> G<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.350> let's<00:02:01.710> take<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> look<00:02:02.159> at

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
in the key of G so let's take a look at

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.859 
in the key of G so let's take a look at
a<00:02:02.280> common<00:02:02.640> chord<00:02:02.880> progression<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.570> key<00:02:03.600> of

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
a common chord progression in the key of

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.249 
a common chord progression in the key of
G<00:02:04.080> we're<00:02:04.590> gonna<00:02:04.680> play<00:02:04.920> G<00:02:05.280> E<00:02:05.549> minor<00:02:05.640> C<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.750> D<00:02:06.990> now

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
G we're gonna play G E minor C and D now

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.109 
G we're gonna play G E minor C and D now
if<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.979> think<00:02:08.160> about<00:02:08.340> what<00:02:08.520> scale<00:02:08.819> degree

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
if you think about what scale degree

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.669 
if you think about what scale degree
those<00:02:09.300> chords<00:02:09.630> are<00:02:09.720> built<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.289> have<00:02:10.410> G

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
those chords are built on you have G

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.000 
those chords are built on you have G
which<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:10.920> 1a<00:02:11.550> which<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.120> 6c<00:02:12.930> which<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.290> 4<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.590> D

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
which is 1a which is 6c which is 4 and D

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.520 
which is 1a which is 6c which is 4 and D
which<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.280> 5<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.600> progression<00:02:15.989> sounds

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
which is 5 so that progression sounds

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.709 
which is 5 so that progression sounds
like<00:02:16.650> this

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.390 

so<00:02:25.719> now<00:02:25.870> if<00:02:25.959> we<00:02:26.049> move<00:02:26.290> back<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.859> key<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.069> C

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
so now if we move back to the key of C

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.520 
so now if we move back to the key of C
and<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:27.849> use<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.269> same<00:02:28.569> number<00:02:28.750> combination

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
and we use that same number combination

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.479 
and we use that same number combination
one<00:02:29.920> six<00:02:30.790> four<00:02:31.480> five<00:02:32.140> we<00:02:32.950> have<00:02:33.099> that<00:02:33.219> same

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
one six four five we have that same

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.699 
one six four five we have that same
progression<00:02:33.700> but<00:02:34.359> in<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.599> key<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.810> C<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.409> that

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
progression but in the key of C and that

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.330 
progression but in the key of C and that
gives<00:02:35.950> us<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.250> courts<00:02:36.579> C<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.329> minor<00:02:37.659> F<00:02:38.409> major<00:02:38.950> G

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
gives us the courts C a minor F major G

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:48.150 
gives us the courts C a minor F major G
major<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:41.079> sounds<00:02:41.349> like<00:02:41.409> this

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.570
