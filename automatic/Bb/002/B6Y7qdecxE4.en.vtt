00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.769
 good kids jon try we are here 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.120
 in a new video and this time it's a video 

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:07.399
 quite special and I hope you like it 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.110
 for me it is very special and good because it is 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.610
 a video of call of duty black ops' that 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.440
 I think it's never been uploaded basically 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.809
 because I was selling it before I started 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.520
 channel but hey it was my first call of 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.430
 duty the first one that I bought myself and good 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.289
 Since then I started playing 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.960
 visit me to look in youtube videos 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.000
 I found videos of willy networks such and 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.490
 Well, it was a bit the way in 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.289
 which I started on YouTube but not because 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.360
 after this I bought warfare 3 and 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.980
 the whole thing and well then in the end in 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.930
 instead of on youtube after the gta iv 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.730
 all basically already with everything 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.100
 started not this is good because it is a 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.570
 game that I had to sell to buy me 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.070
 modern warfare 3 because before 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.860
 I had almost money I bought myself in plan 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.110
 a game a year or things like that and well then 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.230
 I bought the blackout 2 that I was from 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.880
 second hand in a store and I said I do not know 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.740
 what the hell am I feeling because I do not even know what 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.960
 that was the call of duty but well what 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.790
 I bought to prove I saw what that was 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.680
 the online and such and one had a 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.180
 incredible skill and good because 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.100
 there was modern warfare 3 and you already 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.870
 It was for sale a long time ago 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.680
 then when I realized then what 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.540
 what I did was 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.940
 a month or so of having the call of duty 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.590
 black ops' I had no money 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.060
 obviously to buy me the modern 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.830
 warfare 3 is all I had to do 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.990
 was to sell the black ops to be able 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.940
 buy me the modern warfare 3 and then 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.710
 from there I started to clean up afterwards 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.360
 blackout 2 because that's how it was all 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.710
 history not then is a game that 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.180
 for me it's pretty special 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.700
 the background game you're going to see 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.130
 it's simply a duel per team is a 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.520
 32 to 4 or something so good but that's 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.200
 a normal game and since I do in 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.600
 seeing it by teams as you see how 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.000
 you will see his prestige zero level 20 or something 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.160
 so in that game I bought the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.229
 game yesterday and yes, well, the 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.670
 I'm really learning 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.380
 because I learned to play a little 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.030
 but come on, I had a month, either 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.700
 I know memory maps or anything like that 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.140
 but hey it was something special that 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.729
 I liked it a lot when I played it and had 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.619
 really want to have it again and 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.080
 to be able to play it then then 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.270
 nothing because I hope that you mole and then 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.009
 surely you see some game in the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.990
 channel well during these days and good 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.060
 Well , I hope that for later 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.590
 it's the same as subo advance warfare 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.030
 just as the cope goes up all since then 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.010
 when to put some video of black ops 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.490
 If it does not seem wrong, tell me by the 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.110
 commentary 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.220
 if you agree that it should go up once 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.230
 in when some black box video 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.760
 burst button also like it 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.620
 has caught brack be week and has it and 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.120
 it is so we will surely be 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.640
 some weapons games and things like that 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.050
 fun and one is a game that the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.300
 It's true that I'm pretty cool 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.670
 very well done and I do not know I love it 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.440
 the way to kill is like they sound like hit 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.750
 marker and everything is something that is pretty 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.390
 fun this game and had many 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.460
 I wanted to have it because I had and like that 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.260
 fuck I did not like to have sold it 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.300
 and I wanted to get it back and so, well, 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.310
 I've caught again to tell you that 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.620
 surely today I bought myself the mortal 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.410
 kombat 10 because good that is a game 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.660
 that also has always been very cool for me 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.330
 one then I'll get it 'for play 4 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.770
 surely and then I'll start playing 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.630
 give it and you will surely have video in the 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.850
 channel and one then many of you 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.620
 you will say you will be thinking fuck not for 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.510
 to catch games that happens like 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.310
 you do well then I've said some 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.230
 Once on twitter I do not even know if I've 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.300
 mentioned sometime in the channel but 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.860
 What I do is buy all the 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.210
 games at half price is worth then 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.490
 for while you do not buy 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.740
 a game I can buy two is like that 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.180
 then I hope and comfortable this well what 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.700
 I'm going to explain why now that you're 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.260
 many games and such is going to come very 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.489
 ok but not all half price and 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.079
 I want you to know because this is not 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.640
 no mystery or anything like that but 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.079
 Many people do not know it, so I'm going to 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.700
 explain how I do it to get 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.379
 all games at half price and 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.629
 good to be able to catch you box instead of 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.069
 give you some of pillars 2 or whatever you want 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.859
 basically cheaper days 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.319
 So what I do is buy the 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.519
 on a page that I'm going to leave in the 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.319
 description of the video that is called 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.150
 digital games in which then 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.010
 there are simply all the games to 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.349
 half price and what he does buying 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.239
 the here is basically shopping 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.560
 in digital form that is to say you do not have to 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.389
 go buy it at any store or anything 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.950
 you simply buy it from your home and 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.260
 if you download in the console and such is 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.150
 that simple then it's good then 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.829
 this page has it all in the middle of 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.480
 price and the truth is that it is a 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.189
 authentic luxury I always bought it 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.189
 here in a litter of no problem and 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:12.019
 well, it 's a way to save yourself a 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.909
 pretty important pastureland or power 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.889
 have more play for the same price as 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.419
 as one already because from time to time I 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.370
 I buy one and how much do they cost me? 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.440
 half the price so I can buy the 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.599
 double of games basically does not have no 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.159
 has a turn of the page so good yo 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.000
 I recommend that you take a look what 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.310
 I will leave in the 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.110
 description the page just who 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.520
 want to use it, take a look at what 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.410
 do as you will see are all the games 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.390
 half the price and it's something that I 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.880
 I recommend because I use it is going well 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.560
 Always I use and has never given me any 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.940
 problem on the page before they were just 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.800
 playstation games but there are also 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.230
 of xbox so you have all of luxury 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.610
 the consoles and the two generations 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.050
 besides, do not think it's nothing strange that 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.490
 you are going to have to play with another account 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.350
 or anything like that because you're always going to 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.330
 be able to play with your main account 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.860
 so there is no super move 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.900
 rare to do or anything like that 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.340
 simply because this one downloads and already 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.320
 you can play in your account forever 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.060
 I will explain how it is a bit 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.800
 process in case it is not clear in case 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.500
 you notice or what is basically you 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.820
 when you buy the game they will give you a 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.680
 email and a password 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.020
 you go to between the accounts and you'll see that it's 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.310
 the game you are going to download you are going to 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.800
 activate that account in your system 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.240
 playstation and once you've 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.740
 downloaded in that one simply with 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.720
 that you have given to downloads you become 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.310
 to your account and you already forget about that 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.800
 account you do not need to enter anymore 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.660
 ok and you already from your account simply 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.919
 there it will download and you can play in 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.240
 all the accounts that you have in your 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.729
 console so you can use it 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.660
 with your main account as any 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.750
 another game then 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.070
 it's something that does not have much mystery is 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.870
 pretty cool 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.520
 I always buy it as I said and the 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.720
 moment is going great and the truth is that 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.010
 Well, I recommend it for everyone 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.290
 you so I do not spend so much money 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.970
 in these things then nothing else 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.560
 simply in the decision would have the 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.330
 page in case you want to use it who 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.950
 want to use the one that uses it, not that 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.960
 I use it, I do not care, I'm telling you how 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.130
 advice and nothing because kids I hope so 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.380
 that you liked the video itself 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.570
