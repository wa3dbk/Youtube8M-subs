actually meaningful the upside to this

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.869 
actually meaningful the upside to this
is<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.410> infuse<00:03:21.769> now<00:03:21.920> restores<00:03:22.340> more<00:03:22.640> mana

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
is that infuse now restores more mana
