generic panel um we just we mean

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.040 
generic panel um we just we mean
underneath<00:00:36.969> them<00:00:37.530> you'll<00:00:38.530> notice<00:00:38.920> that

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
underneath them you'll notice that

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.590 
underneath them you'll notice that
controller<00:00:41.050> boxes<00:00:41.609> or<00:00:42.609> junction<00:00:43.030> boxes<00:00:43.359> for

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
controller boxes or junction boxes for

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.500 
controller boxes or junction boxes for
them<00:00:44.309> before<00:00:45.309> if<00:00:45.699> you<00:00:45.789> mounting<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.180> panels

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
them before if you mounting the panels

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.910 
them before if you mounting the panels
on<00:00:46.629> the<00:00:46.719> roof<00:00:46.899> actually<00:00:47.350> wired<00:00:47.559> them<00:00:47.769> up

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
on the roof actually wired them up

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.979 
on the roof actually wired them up
because<00:00:48.730> as<00:00:49.149> you<00:00:49.269> can<00:00:49.300> see<00:00:49.420> there's<00:00:49.690> not<00:00:49.840> much

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
because as you can see there's not much

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.560 
because as you can see there's not much
room<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.260> work<00:00:50.469> with<00:00:50.530> under<00:00:51.010> there<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.420> it

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
room to work with under there so it

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.240 
room to work with under there so it
makes<00:00:52.750> sense<00:00:52.870> to<00:00:53.140> wire<00:00:53.379> than<00:00:53.559> that<00:00:53.680> person

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
makes sense to wire than that person

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.389 
makes sense to wire than that person
then<00:00:54.340> connect<00:00:54.640> them<00:00:54.929> connect<00:00:55.929> them<00:00:56.399> I've

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
then connect them connect them I've

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.819 
then connect them connect them I've
actually<00:00:57.579> used<00:00:57.789> on<00:00:58.300> pop<00:00:58.780> rivets<00:00:59.140> in<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.590> side

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
actually used on pop rivets in the side

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.759 
actually used on pop rivets in the side
of<00:00:59.859> them<00:01:00.219> and<00:01:00.670> these<00:01:00.789> little<00:01:01.379> angle<00:01:02.379> brackets

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
of them and these little angle brackets

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.300 
of them and these little angle brackets
and<00:01:03.600> cheap<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.750> easy<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:05.019> use<00:01:05.220> addition<00:01:06.220> to

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
and cheap and easy to use addition to

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.010 
and cheap and easy to use addition to
pop<00:01:06.520> rivets<00:01:06.850> you<00:01:06.970> can<00:01:07.090> actually<00:01:07.180> use<00:01:07.510> roofing

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
pop rivets you can actually use roofing

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.330 
pop rivets you can actually use roofing
nails<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.970> particular<00:01:10.240> roofing<00:01:10.720> nails<00:01:11.340> got

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
nails this particular roofing nails got

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.770 
nails this particular roofing nails got
a<00:01:12.370> little<00:01:12.610> rubber<00:01:12.820> jointing<00:01:13.090> their<00:01:13.510> major

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
a little rubber jointing their major

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.350 
a little rubber jointing their major
screw<00:01:14.200> in<00:01:14.410> reason<00:01:15.370> why<00:01:15.490> roofing<00:01:15.820> nails<00:01:16.030> is

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
screw in reason why roofing nails is

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.520 
screw in reason why roofing nails is
because<00:01:16.600> they're<00:01:16.810> designed<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.350> go<00:01:17.500> into

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
because they're designed to go into

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.350 
because they're designed to go into
metal<00:01:18.370> roof<00:01:20.670> when<00:01:21.670> it<00:01:21.760> comes<00:01:21.940> to<00:01:22.060> getting<00:01:22.240> the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
metal roof when it comes to getting the

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.600 
metal roof when it comes to getting the
wires<00:01:22.600> through<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:24.010> actual<00:01:24.490> roof<00:01:24.880> I<00:01:26.430> use<00:01:27.430> the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
wires through the actual roof I use the

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.370 
wires through the actual roof I use the
whole<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:29.610> gel<00:01:30.610> distr<00:01:31.090> absolute<00:01:31.870> in<00:01:31.960> jail<00:01:32.170> just

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
whole of gel distr absolute in jail just

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.370 
whole of gel distr absolute in jail just
to<00:01:32.500> seal<00:01:32.830> this<00:01:32.980> will<00:01:33.190> box<00:01:33.400> on<00:01:33.580> here<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
to seal this will box on here and that

through<00:02:39.739> here<00:02:40.040> into<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.239> fuse<00:02:41.569> box<00:02:41.840> where<00:02:42.470> we

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
through here into this fuse box where we

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.089 
through here into this fuse box where we
have<00:02:42.860> some<00:02:43.250> Demi<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:44.030> wat<00:02:45.489> about<00:02:46.489> 25<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:48.099> fuse

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
have some Demi to wat about 25 and fuse

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.610 
have some Demi to wat about 25 and fuse
and<00:02:49.459> then<00:02:50.420> they<00:02:50.510> go<00:02:50.690> into<00:02:51.109> the<00:02:51.319> back<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.470> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
and then they go into the back of the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.750 
and then they go into the back of the
controller<00:02:51.950> come<00:02:52.190> out<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.489> back<00:02:52.609> of<00:02:52.640> the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
controller come out of the back of the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.199 
controller come out of the back of the
controller<00:02:53.120> into<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.630> mind<00:02:53.930> switch<00:02:54.109> here

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
controller into this mind switch here

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.809 
controller into this mind switch here
but<00:02:56.209> no<00:02:56.299> legs<00:02:56.600> going<00:02:56.840> on<00:02:56.930> my<00:02:57.140> little<00:02:57.290> light

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
but no legs going on my little light

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.699 
but no legs going on my little light
okay<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:59.120> then<00:02:59.600> they<00:02:59.690> go<00:02:59.840> to<00:02:59.900> distribution

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
okay and then they go to distribution

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.039 
okay and then they go to distribution
that<00:03:00.859> look<00:03:01.069> all<00:03:01.310> looks<00:03:01.519> very<00:03:01.639> complicated<00:03:02.049> but

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
that look all looks very complicated but

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.050 
that look all looks very complicated but
um<00:03:03.319> also<00:03:03.859> has<00:03:03.980> some<00:03:04.160> wiser<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.549> go<00:03:04.730> down<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.030> the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
um also has some wiser to go down to the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.990 
um also has some wiser to go down to the
main<00:03:05.239> batteries<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:07.100> main<00:03:07.280> batteries<00:03:07.760> are

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
main batteries the main batteries are

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.300 
main batteries the main batteries are
located<00:03:08.769> under<00:03:09.769> a<00:03:09.799> bed<00:03:10.069> here<00:03:11.920> so<00:03:12.920> we<00:03:13.010> had<00:03:13.160> the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
located under a bed here so we had the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.099 
located under a bed here so we had the
boys<00:03:13.519> which<00:03:13.819> come<00:03:14.060> out<00:03:14.209> here<00:03:15.400> they<00:03:16.400> go<00:03:17.109> through

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
boys which come out here they go through

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.970 
boys which come out here they go through
this<00:03:18.470> fuse<00:03:19.100> here<00:03:19.720> into<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:20.810> main<00:03:21.139> switch<00:03:21.590> and

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
this fuse here into this main switch and

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.930 
this fuse here into this main switch and
then<00:03:22.910> into<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.569> batteries<00:03:24.500> now<00:03:25.430> these<00:03:25.549> wires

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
then into the batteries now these wires

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.400 
then into the batteries now these wires
actually<00:03:26.269> redundant<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:26.900> don't<00:03:27.109> go<00:03:27.230> anywhere

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
actually redundant I don't go anywhere

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.410 
actually redundant I don't go anywhere
anymore<00:03:28.150> but<00:03:29.150> in<00:03:29.269> addition<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:31.420> two

main battery at the front of the vehicle
you'll<00:04:00.900> notice<00:04:01.140> that<00:04:01.260> all<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.840> the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
you'll notice that all of the the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.960 
you'll notice that all of the the
connectors<00:04:04.350> use<00:04:05.930> quality<00:04:06.930> well<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:08.160> like<00:04:08.940> to

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
connectors use quality well I like to

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.590 
connectors use quality well I like to
clean<00:04:09.270> quality<00:04:09.870> like<00:04:10.740> this<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:11.360> notice<00:04:12.360> the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
clean quality like this I notice the

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.550 
clean quality like this I notice the
term<00:04:12.980> these<00:04:13.980> connectors<00:04:14.490> here<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:16.410> can

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
term these connectors here you can

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.420 
term these connectors here you can
actually<00:04:18.440> make<00:04:19.440> them<00:04:19.650> yourself<00:04:19.799> that's

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
actually make them yourself that's

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.750 
actually make them yourself that's
reasonably<00:04:20.880> cheap<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.540> make<00:04:22.070> you<00:04:23.070> also<00:04:23.460> notice

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
reasonably cheap to make you also notice

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.500 
reasonably cheap to make you also notice
that<00:04:24.500> I've<00:04:25.500> got<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:26.100> fan<00:04:26.850> yet<00:04:27.180> where<00:04:28.190> which<00:04:29.190> will

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
that I've got a fan yet where which will

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.340 
that I've got a fan yet where which will
actually<00:04:30.510> suck<00:04:31.230> out<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:32.600> hydrogen<00:04:33.600> from<00:04:34.170> this

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
actually suck out the hydrogen from this

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.890 
actually suck out the hydrogen from this
compartment<00:04:34.740> underneath<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.430> bed<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:35.910> as

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
compartment underneath the bed and as

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.540 
compartment underneath the bed and as
batteries<00:04:37.350> charged<00:04:37.710> they<00:04:37.980> tend<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.340> produce

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
batteries charged they tend to produce

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.050 
batteries charged they tend to produce
hydrogen<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:40.590> it's<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:40.860> good<00:04:40.980> idea<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.370> make

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
hydrogen so it's a good idea to make

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.360 
hydrogen so it's a good idea to make
sure<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:42.420> have<00:04:42.630> a<00:04:42.870> ventilated<00:04:43.650> space<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:44.220> put

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
sure you have a ventilated space to put

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.210 
sure you have a ventilated space to put
them<00:04:44.520> in<00:04:44.630> I've<00:04:45.630> got<00:04:45.780> another<00:04:45.990> couple<00:04:46.260> of<00:04:46.500> these

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
them in I've got another couple of these

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.990 
them in I've got another couple of these
fans<00:04:47.520> they<00:04:47.670> just<00:04:47.910> computer<00:04:48.300> fans<00:04:49.400> and<00:04:50.400> all<00:04:50.970> I

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
fans they just computer fans and all I

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.430 
fans they just computer fans and all I
really<00:04:51.360> do<00:04:51.540> is<00:04:51.690> just<00:04:51.900> make<00:04:52.760> sure<00:04:53.760> that<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:55.050> bus

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
really do is just make sure that the bus

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.490 
really do is just make sure that the bus
is<00:04:55.470> well<00:04:56.040> ventilated<00:04:56.360> um<00:04:58.400> now<00:04:59.400> a<00:05:00.500> distribution

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
is well ventilated um now a distribution

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.430 
is well ventilated um now a distribution
panel<00:05:01.860> looks<00:05:01.950> kind<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.630> scary<00:05:03.630> I've<00:05:04.050> got<00:05:04.230> wise

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
panel looks kind of scary I've got wise

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.370 
panel looks kind of scary I've got wise
going<00:05:04.890> over<00:05:05.220> all<00:05:05.400> over<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.790> place<00:05:06.200> it's<00:05:07.200> not

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
going over all over the place it's not

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.930 
going over all over the place it's not
really<00:05:08.510> I've<00:05:09.510> got<00:05:09.750> stitches<00:05:10.020> for<00:05:10.410> each

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
really I've got stitches for each

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.200 
really I've got stitches for each
circuit<00:05:11.990> so<00:05:12.990> for<00:05:13.560> example<00:05:13.590> I<00:05:14.190> can<00:05:14.640> switch<00:05:15.060> off

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
circuit so for example I can switch off

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.640 
circuit so for example I can switch off
the<00:05:16.160> cabin<00:05:17.160> lights<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:18.200> the<00:05:19.200> cabin<00:05:19.500> lights

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
the cabin lights and the cabin lights

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.870 
the cabin lights and the cabin lights
will<00:05:19.800> go<00:05:19.919> off<00:05:19.950> and<00:05:20.220> set<00:05:20.370> for<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.550> ones<00:05:20.700> which

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
will go off and set for the ones which

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.950 
will go off and set for the ones which
have<00:05:21.110> reserved<00:05:22.110> batteries<00:05:22.560> in<00:05:22.710> them<00:05:26.780> plus<00:05:27.780> is

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
have reserved batteries in them plus is

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.880 
have reserved batteries in them plus is
a<00:05:28.080> bit<00:05:28.260> of<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.410> mess<00:05:28.620> here<00:05:28.890> as<00:05:29.850> we<00:05:30.150> can<00:05:30.330> see<00:05:30.890> but

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
a bit of a mess here as we can see but

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.610 
a bit of a mess here as we can see but
that's<00:05:32.490> the<00:05:32.700> main<00:05:32.910> three<00:05:33.690> components<00:05:34.320> are

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
that's the main three components are

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.980 
that's the main three components are
well<00:05:35.490> for<00:05:35.880> component<00:05:36.330> once<00:05:36.510> again<00:05:36.720> of<00:05:36.840> the

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
well for component once again of the

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.020 
well for component once again of the
system<00:05:37.350> we<00:05:37.980> have<00:05:38.010> our<00:05:38.250> solar<00:05:38.430> panels<00:05:38.760> on<00:05:38.910> the

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
system we have our solar panels on the

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.710 
system we have our solar panels on the
roof<00:05:39.710> we<00:05:40.710> have<00:05:41.720> our<00:05:42.720> charge<00:05:43.110> controller<00:05:44.720> we

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
roof we have our charge controller we

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.870 
roof we have our charge controller we
have<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.650> batteries<00:05:47.390> and<00:05:49.400> coming<00:05:50.400> out<00:05:50.490> of<00:05:50.669> all

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
have the batteries and coming out of all

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.440 
have the batteries and coming out of all
these<00:05:51.150> other<00:05:51.840> various<00:05:52.200> loads<00:05:52.470> including

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
these other various loads including

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.430 
these other various loads including
you'll<00:05:54.450> notice<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:56.960> inverter<00:05:57.960> which

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
you'll notice the inverter which

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.620 
you'll notice the inverter which
produces<00:05:58.980> 240-watt<00:05:59.910> are<00:06:00.440> 240<00:06:01.440> volts<00:06:02.480> this<00:06:03.480> is

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
produces 240-watt are 240 volts this is

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.399 
produces 240-watt are 240 volts this is
only<00:06:03.810> I<00:06:03.900> think<00:06:04.140> it's<00:06:04.440> a<00:06:05.660> 60

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:07.409 
only I think it's a 60

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:13.559 
only I think it's a 60
and<00:06:08.409> then<00:06:08.770> a<00:06:08.800> 300<00:06:10.500> amp<00:06:11.970> inverter<00:06:12.970> because<00:06:13.330> most

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:13.569 
and then a 300 amp inverter because most

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:15.990 
and then a 300 amp inverter because most
everything<00:06:13.870> on<00:06:14.169> the<00:06:14.229> bus<00:06:14.409> runs<00:06:14.740> on<00:06:15.000> twelve

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
everything on the bus runs on twelve

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.379 
everything on the bus runs on twelve
volts<00:06:16.330> anyway<00:06:17.669> so<00:06:18.669> I'll<00:06:18.759> just<00:06:18.789> switch<00:06:19.120> off<00:06:19.240> his

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
volts anyway so I'll just switch off his

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:26.040 
volts anyway so I'll just switch off his
brother<00:06:19.659> bright<00:06:20.530> light<00:06:20.919> of<00:06:21.879> theories<00:06:24.719> so<00:06:25.719> yeah

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
brother bright light of theories so yeah

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.339 
brother bright light of theories so yeah
let's<00:06:27.009> say<00:06:27.310> I'm<00:06:27.569> the<00:06:28.569> practical<00:06:28.990> side<00:06:29.020> of<00:06:29.199> the

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
let's say I'm the practical side of the

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:32.939 
let's say I'm the practical side of the
solar<00:06:29.560> panel<00:06:30.009> Cal<00:06:30.520> system
