to weaken the United States that's right
the<00:04:17.019> United<00:04:17.320> States<00:04:17.620> stands<00:04:18.159> in<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.459> way<00:04:18.489> just

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
the United States stands in the way just

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.640 
the United States stands in the way just
by<00:04:19.359> being<00:04:19.630> an<00:04:19.750> independent<00:04:20.289> nation

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
by being an independent nation

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.469 
by being an independent nation
I'm<00:04:20.799> not<00:04:21.010> hailing<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.940> praises<00:04:22.300> of<00:04:22.389> the

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
I'm not hailing the praises of the

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.680 
I'm not hailing the praises of the
United<00:04:22.810> States<00:04:22.990> I'm<00:04:23.110> just<00:04:23.289> saying<00:04:23.500> that

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
United States I'm just saying that

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.630 
United States I'm just saying that
as<00:04:23.750> an<00:04:23.990> independent<00:04:24.260> nation<00:04:24.590> it<00:04:25.010> stands<00:04:25.400> in

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
as an independent nation it stands in

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.000 
as an independent nation it stands in
the<00:04:25.760> way<00:04:25.790> of<00:04:26.210> global<00:04:26.720> unity<00:04:27.010> because

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
the way of global unity because

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.350 
the way of global unity because
everything's<00:04:28.430> supposed<00:04:28.580> to<00:04:28.730> be<00:04:28.790> centralized

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
everything's supposed to be centralized

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.420 
everything's supposed to be centralized
in<00:04:29.480> Europe<00:04:29.780> in<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:29.930> end<00:04:30.140> and<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.830> whole<00:04:30.950> Kyoto

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
in Europe in the end and the whole Kyoto

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.450 
in Europe in the end and the whole Kyoto
Protocol<00:04:31.970> that<00:04:32.030> Bush<00:04:32.480> wouldn't<00:04:32.810> sign<00:04:33.050> the

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
Protocol that Bush wouldn't sign the

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.410 
Protocol that Bush wouldn't sign the
reason<00:04:34.460> he<00:04:34.550> wouldn't<00:04:34.820> sign<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.030> is<00:04:35.270> not

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
reason he wouldn't sign it is not

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.180 
reason he wouldn't sign it is not
because<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.080> world<00:04:36.260> is<00:04:36.470> not<00:04:36.560> getting<00:04:36.800> warmer

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
because the world is not getting warmer

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.880 
because the world is not getting warmer
because<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.670> is<00:04:37.960> but<00:04:38.960> it's<00:04:39.140> not<00:04:39.200> human<00:04:39.620> beings

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
because it is but it's not human beings

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.980 
because it is but it's not human beings
that<00:04:40.010> are<00:04:40.070> causing<00:04:40.550> it<00:04:40.670> it's<00:04:40.970> just<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.240> fact<00:04:41.480> the

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
that are causing it it's just a fact the

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.620 
that are causing it it's just a fact the
reason<00:04:42.440> is<00:04:42.620> because<00:04:43.160> Kyoto<00:04:43.880> calls<00:04:44.180> for<00:04:44.510> the

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
reason is because Kyoto calls for the

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.450 
reason is because Kyoto calls for the
punishment<00:04:45.440> of<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.560> United<00:04:45.980> States<00:04:46.250> with

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
punishment of the United States with

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.270 
punishment of the United States with
heavy<00:04:46.820> penalties<00:04:47.450> for<00:04:47.690> emissions<00:04:48.230> but<00:04:49.160> it

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
heavy penalties for emissions but it

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.220 
heavy penalties for emissions but it
exempts<00:04:49.700> China<00:04:50.120> which<00:04:50.690> will<00:04:50.900> have<00:04:51.050> more

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
exempts China which will have more

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.020 
exempts China which will have more
emissions<00:04:51.470> than<00:04:51.860> the<00:04:51.950> US<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:52.490> two<00:04:52.610> years<00:04:52.850> it

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
emissions than the US and two years it

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.240 
emissions than the US and two years it
exempts<00:04:53.540> them<00:04:53.690> completely<00:04:54.110> it<00:04:54.410> exempts

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
exempts them completely it exempts

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.000 
exempts them completely it exempts
Brazil<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.330> India<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:57.260> other<00:04:57.380> nations<00:04:57.650> that

Brazil and India and other nations that

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.040 
Brazil and India and other nations that
are<00:04:58.100> pumping<00:04:58.520> co2<00:04:58.940> in<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.210> environment<00:04:59.690> but

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
are pumping co2 in the environment but

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.390 
are pumping co2 in the environment but
that's<00:05:00.260> not<00:05:00.410> really<00:05:00.620> even<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.860> issue<00:05:01.100> as<00:05:01.340> far

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
that's not really even the issue as far

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.760 
that's not really even the issue as far
as<00:05:01.580> a<00:05:01.850> scientific<00:05:02.540> standpoint<00:05:02.960> goes<00:05:03.290> in

as a scientific standpoint goes in

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.680 
as a scientific standpoint goes in
effect<00:05:03.980> what<00:05:04.430> would<00:05:04.550> happen<00:05:04.910> is<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.210> United

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
effect what would happen is the United

the United Nations would collect
