00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.120 
about this is that the USB cable is
actually<00:01:41.689> integrated<00:01:42.290> into<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.619> device<00:01:42.829> so

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
actually integrated into the device so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.710 
actually integrated into the device so
the<00:01:43.189> customer<00:01:43.460> when<00:01:44.149> they<00:01:44.180> receive<00:01:44.600> the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
the customer when they receive the

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.999 
the customer when they receive the
solution<00:01:45.170> they<00:01:45.259> don't<00:01:45.409> have<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.649> worry<00:01:45.829> about

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
solution they don't have to worry about

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.310 
solution they don't have to worry about
carrying<00:01:46.579> an<00:01:46.939> extra<00:01:47.060> USB<00:01:47.360> cable<00:01:47.990> it's<00:01:48.110> already

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
carrying an extra USB cable it's already

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.020 
carrying an extra USB cable it's already
integrated<00:01:48.530> into<00:01:48.950> this<00:01:49.070> solution<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:49.939> they

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
integrated into this solution so they

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.700 
integrated into this solution so they
just<00:01:50.060> pop<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:50.570> out<00:01:50.659> here<00:01:50.930> plug<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:51.380> in<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:51.619> they

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
just pop it out here plug it in and they

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.279 
just pop it out here plug it in and they
go<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.580> capacities<00:01:53.299> on<00:01:53.479> this<00:01:53.659> solution<00:01:53.990> are

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
go the capacities on this solution are

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.070 
go the capacities on this solution are
currently<00:01:54.649> in<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:54.920> 320<00:01:55.520> gigabyte<00:01:55.939> and<00:01:56.149> 500

currently in a 320 gigabyte and 500
gigabyte<00:01:57.409> capacity<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.549> is<00:01:59.270> really<00:01:59.299> neat

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
gigabyte capacity so that is really neat

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.870 
gigabyte capacity so that is really neat
well<00:02:00.049> one<00:02:00.439> other<00:02:00.619> piece<00:02:00.860> on<00:02:01.039> this<00:02:01.189> is<00:02:01.429> it's<00:02:01.820> a

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
well one other piece on this is it's a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.029 
well one other piece on this is it's a
little<00:02:02.179> bit<00:02:02.270> hard<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.590> difficult<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.710> get<00:02:03.860> out

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
little bit hard to difficult to get out

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.469 
little bit hard to difficult to get out
and<00:02:04.399> when<00:02:04.549> you<00:02:04.640> want<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.030> be<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.299> way<00:02:05.329> but

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
and when you want it to be that way but

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.770 
and when you want it to be that way but
if<00:02:06.110> this<00:02:06.350> cable<00:02:07.130> ever<00:02:07.310> does<00:02:07.549> pop<00:02:07.880> out<00:02:08.119> there<00:02:08.600> is

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
if this cable ever does pop out there is

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.680

than the other but it's also felt a

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.380 
than the other but it's also felt a
little<00:03:04.330> bit<00:03:04.510> lower<00:03:04.690> price<00:03:04.990> point<00:03:06.030> over<00:03:07.030> here<00:03:07.060> I

little bit lower price point over here I

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.210 
little bit lower price point over here I
want<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.720> show<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.260> optical<00:03:08.800> drive<00:03:09.040> that

this is don't know no special name for
it<00:03:17.020> but<00:03:17.320> it<00:03:17.440> is<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.590> USB<00:03:18.130> bus-powered<00:03:18.430> device<00:03:19.030> it

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
it but it is a USB bus-powered device it

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.830 
it but it is a USB bus-powered device it
also<00:03:19.720> has<00:03:20.230> lightscribe<00:03:20.800> features<00:03:21.490> on<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.210> so

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
also has lightscribe features on it so

it is possible where you could actually

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.200 
it is possible where you could actually
end<00:05:25.800> up<00:05:25.889> this<00:05:26.370> could<00:05:26.610> go<00:05:26.729> through<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.030> wash

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
end up this could go through the wash

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.170 
end up this could go through the wash
and<00:05:27.539> still<00:05:28.229> work<00:05:28.669> because<00:05:29.669> we<00:05:29.820> do<00:05:29.970> have<00:05:30.090> a

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
and still work because we do have a

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.270 
and still work because we do have a
picture<00:05:30.630> where<00:05:31.380> someone<00:05:31.740> has<00:05:31.860> actually

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
picture where someone has actually

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.570 
picture where someone has actually
dropped<00:05:32.490> this<00:05:32.789> into<00:05:33.270> a<00:05:33.300> cup<00:05:33.630> of<00:05:33.840> water<00:05:34.580> taking

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
dropped this into a cup of water taking

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.640 
dropped this into a cup of water taking
it<00:05:35.699> out<00:05:35.820> you<00:05:36.510> know<00:05:36.630> shake<00:05:36.930> it<00:05:37.050> off<00:05:37.169> dry<00:05:37.440> it<00:05:37.500> off

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
it out you know shake it off dry it off

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.689 
it out you know shake it off dry it off
and<00:05:37.919> it<00:05:38.400> still<00:05:38.639> works<00:05:38.900> so<00:05:39.900> that<00:05:40.199> is<00:05:40.860> some<00:05:41.580> of

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
and it still works so that is some of

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.180 
and it still works so that is some of
the<00:05:41.820> solutions<00:05:42.330> from<00:05:42.510> we'll<00:05:42.750> see<00:05:42.930> and<00:05:43.199> if

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
the solutions from we'll see and if

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.800 
the solutions from we'll see and if
there's<00:05:44.430> any<00:05:44.520> questions<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.240> know<00:05:45.360> Betty's<00:05:45.690> got

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
there's any questions I know Betty's got
