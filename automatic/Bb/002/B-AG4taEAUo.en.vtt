clear<00:00:08.460> ballistics-gel<00:00:09.059> head<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.719> thing

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
clear ballistics-gel head this thing

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.720 
clear ballistics-gel head this thing
weighed<00:00:10.080> about<00:00:10.200> 12<00:00:10.620> pounds<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:11.250> think<00:00:11.429> it's

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
weighed about 12 pounds I think it's

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.950 
weighed about 12 pounds I think it's
going<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.880> be<00:00:12.000> pretty<00:00:12.240> awesome<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.690> send<00:00:12.900> a

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
going to be pretty awesome to send a

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.180 
going to be pretty awesome to send a
couple<00:00:13.200> rounds<00:00:13.380> through<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:13.830> see<00:00:13.950> what<00:00:14.099> it

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
couple rounds through and see what it

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.310 
couple rounds through and see what it
looks<00:00:14.340> like<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:15.150> hopefully<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:16.020> buddy

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
one's going to be a 335 grain

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.090 
one's going to be a 335 grain
hollow-point<00:00:22.080> just<00:00:22.289> going<00:00:22.529> front<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> back

hopefully we get some good footage of

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.080 
hopefully we get some good footage of
that<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.470> as<00:00:25.680> long<00:00:25.830> as<00:00:25.949> he<00:00:26.039> survives<00:00:26.430> then

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
that and as long as he survives then

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.130 
that and as long as he survives then
we're<00:00:27.210> going<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.359> go<00:00:27.510> ahead<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.869> strap<00:00:28.109> a

Jacket round so let's go get Bob
strapped<00:00:37.860> down<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.399> see<00:00:39.120> what<00:00:39.270> happens<00:00:39.950> so

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
strapped down and see what happens so

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.440 
strapped down and see what happens so

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.660 
right to the nose and as you can see he
survived<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.770> let's<00:00:47.070> take<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> look<00:00:47.460> from<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
survived but let's take a look from the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.610 
survived but let's take a look from the
side<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.300> frame<00:00:48.629> by<00:00:48.780> frame<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.500> what

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
side here frame by frame and see what

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.680 
side here frame by frame and see what
really<00:00:49.770> happened<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.430> them<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.600> can

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
really happened to them and here you can

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.270 
really happened to them and here you can
see<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> bullet<00:00:52.350> passes<00:00:52.590> through<00:00:53.039> just

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
see as the bullet passes through just

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.029 
see as the bullet passes through just
how<00:00:53.399> much<00:00:53.550> energy<00:00:54.090> was<00:00:55.050> left<00:00:55.350> inside<00:00:55.590> that

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
how much energy was left inside that

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.799 
how much energy was left inside that
head<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.210> pressure<00:00:57.510> and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
head and you can see the pressure and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.680 
head and you can see the pressure and
how<00:00:58.350> its<00:00:58.559> contorting<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.760> trying<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.180> do

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
how its contorting and just trying to do

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.479 
how its contorting and just trying to do
everything<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.530> blow<00:01:01.890> apart<00:01:02.250> that

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
everything it can do to blow apart that

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.520 
everything it can do to blow apart that
ballistics<00:01:02.730> gel<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.449> that's<00:01:04.170> another<00:01:04.350> reason

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
ballistics gel and that's another reason

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.050 
ballistics gel and that's another reason
why<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:05.070> love<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.339> clear<00:01:05.610> ballistics

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
why I just love this clear ballistics

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.310 
why I just love this clear ballistics
gel<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:06.900> everything<00:01:07.290> going

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
gel because you can see everything going

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.250 
gel because you can see everything going
on<00:01:07.740> inside<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.369> target<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.030> soon<00:01:09.900> as<00:01:10.020> Bob's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
on inside that target and soon as Bob's

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.020 
on inside that target and soon as Bob's
done<00:01:10.530> doing<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.979> Funky<00:01:11.280> Chicken<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.880> my

pieces<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> jacket<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.680> started<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> come

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
pieces of the jacket and started to come

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.190 
pieces of the jacket and started to come
apart<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.759> fragment<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.600> little<00:01:30.869> bit<00:01:31.020> but

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
apart and fragment just a little bit but

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.469 
apart and fragment just a little bit but
this<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> real<00:01:31.770> small<00:01:32.549> amount<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.970> material

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
this is a real small amount of material

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.660 
this is a real small amount of material
for<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.840> particular<00:01:34.380> bullet<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.130> actually

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
for that particular bullet to actually

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.330 
for that particular bullet to actually
break<00:01:36.180> apart<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> couple<00:01:38.189> pieces

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
break apart but there is a couple pieces

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.100 
break apart but there is a couple pieces
of<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.909> jacket<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.329> fragmented<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
of the jacket that fragmented and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.390 
of the jacket that fragmented and
started<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> come<00:01:40.590> off<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.100> pretty<00:01:41.250> much

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
started to come off but it pretty much

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.139 
started to come off but it pretty much
whizzed<00:01:41.820> right<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.299> through<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> now<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.030> was

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
whizzed right on through so now it was

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.760 
whizzed right on through so now it was
time<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.360> go<00:01:45.600> ahead<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.869> strap<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.290> helmet<00:01:46.649> on

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
time to go ahead and strap the helmet on

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.109 
time to go ahead and strap the helmet on

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
round would go right on through and sure

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.499 
round would go right on through and sure
enough<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.290> did<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:53.820> take<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> look<00:01:54.270> here

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and frame by frame you could actually

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.870 
and frame by frame you could actually
see<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> round

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
