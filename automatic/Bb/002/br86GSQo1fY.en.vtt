00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:06.540
 simÃ£o snows the singer this road vocal preparer 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.460
 these people in the training and in the areas that work with the participation of the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.189
 parents 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.309
 and in Argentina - ice too 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.970
 You have to stop giving some tips to help you. 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.869
 it is in the interpretation of music you are that while if you have a 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.580
 lightweight instrumentalist as long as something has to do a deck 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.379
 it's worth talking about some how about some aspects of vocal technique that 

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:31.990
 may have to help 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.490
 today we will talk about the articulation and why it is 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.680
 important 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.860
 the stronger I have my articulation would be to work as if 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.080
 to a gym with the mouth and tongue of the 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.550
 carpentry I will facilitate the projection of my voice and I will have to do less 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.570
 force 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.070
 so that it is my voice has more clarity more projection and more power 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.130
 this will also make me have more control over my team in a 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.200
 second moment 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.520
 so now let's do an exercise that pretty simple 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.670
 is that it is part of the morning to strengthen the muscles of the mouth 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.870
 so you are going to pay a page from a book a magazine to any text I 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.450
 I chose here a subject that talks about vocal technique that I wrote I go 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.340
 to take a popsicle stick that is there was thirsty in Bethlehem in the letters of 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.470
 packaging on the market 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.220
 you can use attended per day every time to do an exercise 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.800
 then the idea would be to put ideas together to make them read the 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.810
 text trying to move the mouth as much as possible 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.970
 joining slowly 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.640
 this will strengthen the muscles so I'll start the series and I'll tell you 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.650
 residents since the middle 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.650
 I will respect you 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.490
 when the canopy had to have teresina not so 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.570
 popular musicians gave him to know the local technique 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.690
 for its improvement and quality in high school, because it is not 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.849
 shops practicing the act 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.040
 were also applied the technique 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.220
 is beauty is an allusion to mental performance allowing personal control of the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.449
 own balance 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:20.940
 of the foundation 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.510
 amplify vocal extension lack of work - practical cnh more needles burning 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.259
 of branches 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.379
 implement is not simple easy and he has to go home 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:35.259
 on the other hand the use of thermals prefers not to fix contacted 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:39.519
 also of the competition and superintendent the vocal folds are 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.780
 I do not care what I would do 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.140
 but which seem to perform better the correct device than 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.819
 stopped 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.449
 with perseverance of a part of the text would be important you do 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:55.039
 to complete a page of a third later if it is going to take the relative in Atibaia 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.790
 half the text jumping very soft 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.919
 so it will be like this 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.389
 because all the popular singers 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.799
 should know the vocal technique 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.979
 to put better acuity is an instrument is the only one that is not 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.539
 buys in the shops his own voice 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.769
 simply not to stay with marcela worked 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.999
 he believes that after being perfect this reading in the buried outside 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.560
 percentage had more experience 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.229
 if you start starting the wrong 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.340
 it's part 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.949
 you pay attention because so 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:32.309
 in front and it will start until slipping celina is important part you stir 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.349
 as much as possible and try to fight to the end 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:40.019
 if you have a chance to repeat that interest every day 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.369
 you will get the physical and technical conditioning very nice 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:45.959
 beto articulation of your mouth 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.629
 I hope you have taken advantage of the selection and even the square
