00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
areas within 50 miles away and so we we

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.090 
areas within 50 miles away and so we we
had<00:00:13.980> an<00:00:14.610> older<00:00:15.000> car<00:00:15.209> that<00:00:15.539> my<00:00:16.379> wife<00:00:16.560> was<00:00:16.740> using

had an older car that my wife was using
that<00:00:17.220> we<00:00:17.340> thought<00:00:17.550> could<00:00:17.730> easily<00:00:18.030> be<00:00:18.270> replaced

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
that we thought could easily be replaced

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.900 
that we thought could easily be replaced
by<00:00:18.810> one<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:19.110> these<00:00:19.250> we<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.369> another<00:00:20.609> car<00:00:20.880> that

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
by one of these we have another car that

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.870 
by one of these we have another car that
we<00:00:21.179> can<00:00:21.210> use<00:00:21.449> for<00:00:21.660> longer<00:00:21.990> trips<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:23.130> for<00:00:23.550> most

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
we can use for longer trips so for most

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.230 
we can use for longer trips so for most
of<00:00:24.150> our<00:00:24.269> activity<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.080> just<00:00:25.560> fine<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.609> have

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
vehicles at my job at Nissan long time

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.070 
vehicles at my job at Nissan long time
ago<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.640> drove<00:00:32.759> one<00:00:33.060> for<00:00:33.240> six<00:00:33.420> months<00:00:33.750> alive

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080

they<00:00:34.560> had<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.740> pretty<00:00:34.950> good<00:00:35.190> feel<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:35.580> how<00:00:35.970> this

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
they had a pretty good feel for how this

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.479 
they had a pretty good feel for how this
vehicle<00:00:36.600> wouldn't<00:00:36.870> would<00:00:36.989> work<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:38.370> were

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
vehicle wouldn't would work so we were

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.040 
vehicle wouldn't would work so we were
pretty<00:00:38.760> confident<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.960> would

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
pretty confident going in that it would

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.560 
pretty confident going in that it would
be<00:00:40.200> good<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.410> us

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
be good for us

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.660 
be good for us
actually<00:00:43.290> as<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> proximity<00:00:43.890> key<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.550> my

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
actually as a proximity key it's in my

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.240 
actually as a proximity key it's in my
pocket<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:46.200> sends<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.770> little<00:00:46.920> signal

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
pocket and it sends out a little signal

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.340 
pocket and it sends out a little signal
and<00:00:47.820> when<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.300> within<00:00:48.450> about<00:00:48.600> 4<00:00:48.989> feet<00:00:49.170> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
and when I get within about 4 feet of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.770 
and when I get within about 4 feet of
the<00:00:49.410> car<00:00:49.650> it<00:00:49.950> recognizes<00:00:50.700> me<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.540> don't

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.229 
the car it recognizes me and I don't
there's<00:00:51.989> no<00:00:52.110> key<00:00:52.350> beyond<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.580> I<00:00:54.000> just

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
there's no key beyond that so I just

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.130 
there's no key beyond that so I just
touch<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.809> little<00:00:54.930> button<00:00:59.510> but<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.660> the
