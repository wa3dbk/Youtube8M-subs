00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello friends of spirits v we are here to do 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.120
 a fishing trip 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.000
 but she does winter offices the most 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.170
 cold we have already applied some 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.740
 fish clearly the key to success 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.439
 and net fishing very slow but we'll go 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.679
 to use lead management with 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.300
 heaviness say sealing around 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.769
 g agrama and a half that allow us to 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.019
 always stay in contact with the bottom 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.170
 because the predator must be 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.970
 entice then we use vibrating baits 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.610
 and writes however they can induce 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.530
 the attack the predator can however 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.300
 tease the fame of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.610
 predator that is aching 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.620
 very low temperature today 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.260
 really cold so I don't know anything 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.090
 we were able to catch almost now 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.390
 let the sun go down we hope to continue 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.970
 with some catches and have been had 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.020
 results with the GM produced by 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.770
 nipponica reigns and with the ring shrimp da 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.739
 2 inches 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.509
 both are very mobile lures 1 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.100
 thanks to the fluctuating demands and the other 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.310
 thanks to the really thin tail e 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.619
 floating and writes as I have said a lot 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.109
 furniture that allows to be made 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.759
 work closely with the fund 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.619
 but above all in front of the den of 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.859
 predator or near the spots that 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.259
 we believe they are inhabited by the predator in 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.810
 what precisely by constitution they have 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.969
 vibrant vibrating appendages that 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.799
 they are set in motion by both 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.380
 water current so they are already 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.020
 firm on the cost are to es es e 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.999
 they are recalling towards predator but 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.850
 especially once called with 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:43.860
 then small tip tips 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.320
 small recalls small movements of the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.330
 tip make these appendages 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.970
 fluctuate call and induce 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.729
 the attack the predator that due 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.500
 indeed of the temperatures is certainly 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.440
 slow certainly slow slows down 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.119
 metabolism compared to more seasons 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.869
 propitious I could be spring e 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.200
 autumn, however, is despite the summer 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.450
 cold 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.729
 have confidence because some beautiful 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.459
 capture can be can be done 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.590
 quietly enough to fish slow and 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.300
 above all let us remember that in this 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.780
 period in theory the big fish 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.430
 should tend to eat more more 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.870
 willingly more effectively 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.550
 compared to those that are fish 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.069
 small as big fish 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.840
 should slow down the metabolism but 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.980
 however remain more active than 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.170
 those that there are small fishes that 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.970
 however they stop almost completely 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.560
 aside once or twice yes 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.560
 meet during the scajola tail 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.220
 you are passionate about the other 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.630
 phishing and even the cold cannot 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.610
 stop because the urge to go to 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.490
 fishing is great and you want to discover maybe 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.870
 some tricks some kind of esko 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.490
 especially weighing action that can 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.990
 induce the predator to attack 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.370
 really wrong from the temperatures 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.140
 very low 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.090
 don't miss the January issue of 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.160
 fishing spini in which we will go to 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.760
 face what was fishing in the 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.430
 cold period 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.610
 hello everyone is luca ruggeri a 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.610
 next 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.629
 my mom how cold you guys my mom 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.239
 we had too many monkeys to fish if he has 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.470
 had to go out the same 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.480
 unfortunately fishing is like that but you know it 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.480
 better than me when one has to go
