00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
you don't understand this I'm going to

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
you don't understand this I'm going to
explain<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> minute<00:00:58.410> three<00:00:59.250> malicious

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
so the way this works is basically you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.820 
so the way this works is basically you
special<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.000> The<00:01:03.510> Heretic<00:01:03.870> dragon<00:01:04.409> temper<00:01:04.739> no
