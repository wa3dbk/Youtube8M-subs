 Hello dear friends with you about 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.840
 joker and today we are on the map 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.880
 northwest 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.010
 this proud appeared in our graham at all 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.650
 recently she is not already so many 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.869
 bugs enough for issues 5 so 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.750
 Today, the next flight bug is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.000
 squared b 0 we are sitting on the Christmas tree and 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.980
 this flight will be completely unexpected he 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.140
 will be under the logs and so let's 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.780
 let's see something gets under the logs 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.910
 our herringbone accelerates crashes under 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.400
 logs unfortunately on myself not climb 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.840
 may therefore we call for help 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.720
 slow but strong vocals again this 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.870
 the bank fought somewhere and as it is called 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.030
 legs and so here we are waiting to in he takes 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.670
 Now a small overclocking and with all the power 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.140
 we are repelled under logs now we already 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.060
 We see that our Christmas tree is a little bit 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.790
 flattened and now something should 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:12.509
 happen us starts a little bit 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.140
 sausage force all accumulates and 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.450
 accumulates what happens now 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.110
 but I know what will happen 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.770
 and so a little bit 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.440
 and so here not high we take off 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.690
 I hope you get much better 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.400
 than me of course if you will 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.710
 Try to get you I hope 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.810
 much better but meanwhile
