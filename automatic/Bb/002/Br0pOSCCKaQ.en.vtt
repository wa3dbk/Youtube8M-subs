so I thought that she could do a nice
little<00:00:27.090> cameo<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.140> video<00:00:28.470> because<00:00:28.769> from

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
what I understand the quality is the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.330 
what I understand the quality is the
same<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> basically<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.840> same<00:00:34.079> line<00:00:34.440> so

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
same this is basically the same line so

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.990

sweets version the phone over here is a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.270 
sweets version the phone over here is a
little<00:01:27.330> bit<00:01:27.450> loose<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.380> when<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:28.920> sit<00:01:29.160> it

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
little bit loose but when you sit it

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.790 
little bit loose but when you sit it
down<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.760> should<00:01:30.120> be<00:01:30.330> able<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.960> put<00:01:31.680> it

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
down you should be able to put it

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.370 
down you should be able to put it
somewhere<00:01:32.190> I<00:01:32.370> hope<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.090> cord<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.690> long<00:01:33.990> enough

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
somewhere I hope the cord is long enough

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.530 
somewhere I hope the cord is long enough
that<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.310> will<00:01:35.490> sit<00:01:35.730> somewhere<00:01:36.060> nicely

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that it will sit somewhere nicely

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.060 
that it will sit somewhere nicely
because<00:01:36.900> otherwise<00:01:37.290> there's<00:01:37.680> nowhere<00:01:38.010> else

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
because otherwise there's nowhere else

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.400 
because otherwise there's nowhere else
really<00:01:38.550> for<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.480> to<00:01:39.660> sit<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.110> kind<00:01:40.320> of

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
really for it to sit just kind of

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.550 
really for it to sit just kind of
dangles<00:01:40.800> there<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> guess<00:01:43.260> we'll<00:01:43.410> have<00:01:43.440> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
dangles there so I guess we'll have to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.660 
dangles there so I guess we'll have to
see<00:01:43.800> when<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.950> put<00:01:44.130> her<00:01:44.190> down

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
see when I put her down

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.880 
see when I put her down
but<00:01:45.090> other<00:01:45.360> than<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.690> she<00:01:46.260> has<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.470> really

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
but other than that she has a really

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.600 
but other than that she has a really
nice<00:01:47.130> weight<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.550> her<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.560> she<00:01:49.560> feels<00:01:50.010> just

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
nice weight to her and she feels just

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.490

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
version so if that's something that

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.470
