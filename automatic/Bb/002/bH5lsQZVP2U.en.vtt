00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:04.519
 what do you want and many new ideas 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.720
 we have the whole arm 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.209
 the game left Merkel calm 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.130
 50 years 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.130
 "The Tin Drum" by GÃ¼nter Grass like so many 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.380
 I always say we have only a tiny bit of another here 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.660
 We also offer the public three famous scenes from the home 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.760
 Â«Tin drumÂ» we bring her alive here 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.070
 Zenzi vote here in the audience best I would say scene1 the settlement 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.070
 Let's see from the "Tin Drum" the scene with the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.990
 scarce and yet a dead animal head in Iran swinging with all that turning 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.840
 If you want to see that, vote right Katrin Bauerfeind is one 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.160
 naive 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.500
 the second set to action is as Mario Erb on connection 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.089
 and in fact gets caught and he swallows the party badge 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.420
 that could be artistically tempered that would be in the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.560
 Basically the most famous CD is probably the one in the 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.740
 small Oskar Matzerath percent children are played with her by Katharina 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.140
 Thalbach effervescent powder from the navel Act that would be the offer this would be a 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.370
 Spectators here in the studio 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.280
 we got off the label and entered the thing 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.640
 Mario Adorf with the party has his team 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.640
 if desired Klaus Ballmann swallows a swastika 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.570
 both neighbors as a small racer is sensitive to say later is short defense 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.570
 for the a 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.780
 Emperor agreed 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.780
 he's already the effervescent powder 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.720
 that Klaus Weinmann swallowed the party badge 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.690
 Well, it is clearly in the direction of effervescent powder 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.810
 Pauli the right one 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.370
 then I would say 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.630
 Always ask here in the audience how catheters for the Aal Mayersche way 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.000
 Landes-cdu many still scare when she becomes a citizen 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.969
 ADAC in the audience a lady who would be ready to earn Goldsmiths 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.059
 before the covenant over 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.839
 which show many gentlemen on the placed reported 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.279
 would they do it 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:31.599
 the honorary gate 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.599
 he had started Hello Karoly Balzsay 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:40.569
 Pfeiffer continues 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.709
 Klaus Weinmann Hanau they can but we have a plan and its partners 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.439
 Marcus Ehning Borken and Ludger Niemeier Euro blocked 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.099
 jammed and if necessary 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.360
 then I would just say percent he practiced here for the sake of simplicity 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.239
 Short on the table she belonged 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.569
 Prelate Dr 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.389
 Percent was her on the back so Lanker Katharina Thalbach eight 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.519
 but it does not matter dot matrix printer it is literature 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.299
 yes under the label the browser 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.909
 continue so Erhard the dog way April yes one is outside waiting from the hardware store 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.559
 Can she watch the movie? They pull themselves onto their bases 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.899
 like that and that's always so easy 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:23.759
 he leaves 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.549
 Werder Bremen procured 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.729
 this is a literary adaptation but there 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:33.689
 that is with the Bart de Wever white coats them but the registration fee CHF per 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:34.349
 8th 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.129
 so maybe I do not have any if they have any 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.309
 Klaus Ballmann they see that he causes so to speak in the direction 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.869
 in the picture the state on 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:45.159
 because all this is good to see 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.449
 Prague ORF at 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.449
 already done 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.569
 he's brewing messages so serve 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.949
 not the shower 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.949
 private sector 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:14.249
 It was like that, they all make them stay 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:18.039
 we did it 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.719
 the situation is not a one a dreamland he has decided 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.699
 not to use anymore 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.159
 but still the DAX put his 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.490
 a victory 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.419
 OK 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.919
 this is how it happens 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.849
 this team technically emotional take a tough and me fast 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.849
 most of you want to know that next to the salary structures 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.779
 it will 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:51.779
 SN what happens 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.960
 the register should have said 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.620
 it fits 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.620
 Coalitions are he wants a break in her 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.849
 you want the colorful and 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.419
 but uncover everything or earlier more Batam in the Tin Drum also with the 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:43.719
 dogsled 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.080
 it would be just a small place 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.550
 Hats off to donations 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.550
 I do not know the end of the world will change 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:57.849
 yes we have never met 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.360
 he fights off he went 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.650
 I think it's great 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.839
 the CMS for this little literary 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.309
 Action sure to wishes the all around 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:10.779
 Walter Konrad or Conrad wakes them up Hamann is doing all the same, but also fear
