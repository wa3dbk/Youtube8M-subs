00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.230 

well<00:03:00.900> subpoena<00:03:01.230> game

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.470 

130<00:03:07.170> are<00:03:07.380> just<00:03:07.770> give<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.950> good<00:03:08.160> speed<00:03:08.430> it's<00:03:09.300> the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
130 are just give a good speed it's the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.390 
130 are just give a good speed it's the

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
if you look at my running general yes

we're<00:03:50.750> easily<00:03:51.050> risk<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.500> apex<00:03:51.860> is<00:03:52.040> here<00:03:52.220> and

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
we're easily risk you apex is here and

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.870 
we're easily risk you apex is here and
there<00:03:52.520> but<00:03:52.790> it's<00:03:53.660> not<00:03:53.690> necessarily<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.320> bad<00:03:54.500> one

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
there but it's not necessarily a bad one

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.720 
there but it's not necessarily a bad one
it<00:03:55.880> just<00:03:56.150> surprised<00:03:56.570> it<00:03:56.810> set<00:03:56.990> up<00:03:57.370> properly<00:03:58.370> in

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
it just surprised it set up properly in

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.110 
it just surprised it set up properly in
the<00:03:58.760> circuit<00:03:59.180> so<00:04:00.250> when<00:04:01.250> I'm<00:04:01.370> some<00:04:01.580> setup<00:04:01.940> would

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
the circuit so when I'm some setup would

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.140 
the circuit so when I'm some setup would
probably<00:04:02.990> bring<00:04:03.170> an<00:04:03.320> extra<00:04:03.590> two<00:04:04.580> seconds<00:04:05.000> out

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
probably bring an extra two seconds out

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.540 
probably bring an extra two seconds out
of<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.270> car<00:04:05.510> for<00:04:06.170> last<00:04:06.350> edit<00:04:07.040> you<00:04:07.250> know<00:04:07.340> more

you can see I've actually created a

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.490 
you can see I've actually created a
little<00:04:46.000> train<00:04:46.210> behind<00:04:46.480> me<00:04:46.750> there<00:04:46.900> those<00:04:47.290> guys

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
little train behind me there those guys

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.260 
little train behind me there those guys
all<00:04:47.800> want<00:04:48.010> to<00:04:48.070> get<00:04:48.160> fascinate

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.820 

that<00:04:52.810> was<00:04:52.900> assists<00:04:53.290> off<00:04:53.410> it'd<00:04:53.590> be<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.740> different

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
that was assists off it'd be a different

up<00:06:09.830> time<00:06:10.099> now<00:06:10.279> is<00:06:10.490> to<00:06:10.639> see<00:06:10.849> that<00:06:11.060> in<00:06:11.270> slow

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629 
up time now is to see that in slow

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:16.110 
up time now is to see that in slow
motion<00:06:12.669> so<00:06:13.669> then<00:06:13.849> there<00:06:14.029> you<00:06:14.150> go<00:06:14.180> it's<00:06:14.930> the<00:06:15.080> car
