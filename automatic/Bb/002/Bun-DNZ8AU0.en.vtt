 try to be a little more romantic 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.100

 seize you 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.740
 and this makes the relationship 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.100

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.810
 have a more fluid communication and 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.400
 above all to lower that sense of war 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.400
 by the power to see who sends whom
