 equestrian online dotcom greeting for you 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.670
 Juan, we talked a little about the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.039
 selective events that are going to be contested 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.570
 on Sunday we begin in what will be 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.550
 the second with the classic eduardo a 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.860
 larrazabal presented to the two mares 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.020
 practically from the sainz race to 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.489
 robertina that comes from winning via 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.590
 Gallop owned by brothers 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.980
 subcategory came to another melody that the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.780
 comes to escort we will bind the 12th 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.190
 for the yellow block that you can 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.770
 say how it keeps everything coming and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.390
 welcome there peaks online only duero 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.809
 for you not only all the fans that 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.190
 Visit your frequently your page 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.950
 it can already be said that it is prestigious 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.280
 rather than everywhere 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.440
 we see it with respect to the classic 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.210
 eduard ravaged where he runs robert has 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.370
 another melody really tells you that 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.970
 both became true they want is 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.220
 run 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.650
 after the previous race both 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.710
 the works of both 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.030
 they were good robertina seemingly 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.640
 he can lend him a little more career 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.380
 because there is not much speed as 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.990
 runs very like in front surely with 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.710
 princess changes the side and the auction 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.780
 will have the robertina mare along with 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.750
 another melody with talking just wants 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.540
 be able to be full that both arrive 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.360
 also to cheating in the air and in 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.330
 tulas in the afternoons eat everything they want 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.450
 run and with a normal touch they reach 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.800
 be surely deciding the race 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.330
 I repeat I would lean a little more for 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.700
 robert and not because the race train 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.170
 just for that reason I think he has a 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.479
 little bit more chance than the other agenda 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.550
 very well when we move to what will be the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.220
 classic socopó where presented to the 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.759
 battling the warrior or lord coins a 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.700
 animal 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.500
 perhaps favored in this case in the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.420
 Handicap , however, no animal soil 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.220
 it comes to reappear lost in the line 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.480
 where it hurts keeps well we have 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.310
 seen with richard bracho during the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.640
 week that this example can tell us 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.569
 and effectively what the factor 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.579
 main defeats 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.730
 although it always runs well are the anti k 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.590
 the kilos that we always have the same 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.120
 difference of weight with respect to ife 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.340
 they are always four and a half kilos I do not know 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.889
 why that does not change I never talked to the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.359
 handicap was my good friend Miller and I 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:36.030
 explained the reasons he has for 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:38.700
 leave it like that thing that I respect and accepted 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.989
 fully despite the difference that 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.389
 is between these two horses is 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.980
 simply the kilos because the 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.900
 difference between her there's not much with 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.879
 when it reaches the line only the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.310
 weight difference that runs this 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.290
 horse to the 14th that the most 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.819
 they know the type of how I am and follow 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.819
 in this mile distance it really is 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.639
 and winnable this one as this one is very strong and 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.549
 you have to respect the 14th against these 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.650
 animals run here when the rest 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.239
 of your commitments outside of events 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.889
 selective commitments extremely 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.750
 important is the case to name 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.310
 some since the pirate that comes from 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.989
 win by galloping the case of the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.030
 colt isaiah forever we've seen it 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.919
 evolve quite well among others 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.780
 committed that you can tell us about the rest 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.730
 of your submitted what you know 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.370
 a lot of this you and I talk about you 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.870
 said those that really hindered that 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.500
 I won them in these three animals that 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.920
 we had 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.780
 so much that the pirate as style for every 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.530
 everything is presented to them 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.230
 win they have condition they have careers 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.640
 who adapt to them fully and from 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.040
 true that made it difficult for some others 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.740
 animals lose the rest I stayed in the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.840
 ponderosa natalicia amar no con o con 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.090
 enough possibilities are animals that 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.830
 They carry with chance are not races 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.320
 like the ones that you pose teddy arrives the 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.280
 pirate from outside that I committed in but 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.320
 they could also be presented the one 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.180
 report they will also take advantage of 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.860
 opportunity to talk a little about 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.510
 the arrival of Jorge a mare the 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.610
 sprinter champion here at the racecourse 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.220
 the rinconada property of jorge pimentel 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.989
 when we will see in action the apple of 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.459
 jorge fate and others that the week that 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.050
 comes because he has already registered as 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.600
 five times and has never been able to do 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.030
 race and try by all means 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.859
 generate those careers we could not and 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.400
 next week plays a selective 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.040
 in 1300 meters of it 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.630
 this will reappear is difficult 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.820
 indicate it and that did much the lord 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.560
 Jorge its owner who is difficult 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.090
 indicate that they are also wrong 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.759
 the logical capacity that is not known by 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.229
 what has only been put in a punt 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.690
 saw once in the week that up in 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.580
 the track in others a thousand meters and a 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.220
 millimeter that is not a normal job of 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.930
 lower to higher to a job that she leaves 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.669
 runaway running to where it reaches 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.490
 get here to get to the line in point 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.800
 floral sometimes comes quite tired the 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.350
 Stable situation that has been improving 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.240
 mean that the weeks have passed and 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.940
 expect an excellent comeback not 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.620
 But it is a dilemma of something that nobody 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.870
 You can know how good condition to 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.360
 logic has to endure a meat of 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.740
 1,600 meters good to play again in 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.270
 team name and spicy line 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.710
 grateful brother for that valuable 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.630
 time you spend in our day 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.669
 interview wishing you success in both 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.229
 Selective events outside events 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.150
 selective already with the three animals that 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.070
 we mentioned earlier and that they continue 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.479
 arriving copies and victories to the 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.669
 yellow stable of Juan Carlos 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:24.610
 Ávila remembers that he keeps giving 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.610
 luck plus luck
