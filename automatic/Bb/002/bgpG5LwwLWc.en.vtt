do you call a blonde

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.310
with two brain cells?

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.360

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.050
They make her to look like a
drag queen, a little bit.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.650
Maybe next time, if they toned
it down and she was a little

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.900
lighter on her toes.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.940

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.910
what a boy partner is supposed
to do, and he did great.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.330
LISA SCHWARTZ: How do you get a

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.660
