on<00:01:56.270> there<00:01:56.450> I<00:01:56.630> think<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:57.170> end<00:01:57.560> up<00:01:57.710> sticking<00:01:57.950> with

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
on there I think I end up sticking with

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.649 
on there I think I end up sticking with
a<00:01:58.189> stock<00:01:58.460> one<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:58.909> get<00:01:59.090> when<00:01:59.299> you<00:01:59.420> first

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
a stock one that you get when you first

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.319 
a stock one that you get when you first
sprayed<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.200> on<00:02:00.229> a<00:02:00.350> date<00:02:01.100> obviously<00:02:01.249> the<00:02:02.149> back

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
sprayed it on a date obviously the back

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:03.700 
sprayed it on a date obviously the back
bumper<00:02:02.719> obviously<00:02:03.140> this<00:02:03.289> changes<00:02:03.679> the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
bumper obviously this changes the

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.160 
bumper obviously this changes the
headlight<00:02:04.070> as<00:02:04.159> well<00:02:04.429> so<00:02:04.999> it's<00:02:05.659> not<00:02:05.780> really

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
headlight as well so it's not really

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.359 
headlight as well so it's not really
individual<00:02:06.679> headlights<00:02:06.920> right<00:02:07.039> thing<00:02:07.249> but

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
individual headlights right thing but

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.190 
individual headlights right thing but
you<00:02:07.520> do<00:02:07.670> change<00:02:07.939> the<00:02:08.330> headlights<00:02:08.810> do<00:02:08.960> change

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
you do change the headlights do change

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.139

whole<00:03:10.409> customization<00:03:11.409> kind<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.709> protest<00:03:12.129> in

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
whole customization kind of protest in

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.650 
whole customization kind of protest in
this<00:03:12.310> game<00:03:12.930> it's<00:03:13.930> very<00:03:14.079> untidy<00:03:14.950> um<00:03:15.450> it's<00:03:16.450> very

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
this game it's very untidy um it's very

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.990 
this game it's very untidy um it's very
good<00:03:16.840> it's<00:03:17.349> definitely<00:03:17.709> very<00:03:17.829> good<00:03:18.130> but<00:03:18.849> it's

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
good it's definitely very good but it's

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.059 
good it's definitely very good but it's
very<00:03:19.090> anti<00:03:19.419> I<00:03:19.450> think<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:20.230> one<00:03:20.410> thing<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.650> you

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
very anti I think the one thing that you

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.530 
very anti I think the one thing that you
know<00:03:21.190> would<00:03:21.400> make<00:03:21.549> this<00:03:21.639> game<00:03:21.819> great<00:03:22.060> is<00:03:22.299> kind

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
know would make this game great is kind

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.839 
know would make this game great is kind
of<00:03:22.569> this<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:23.410> know<00:03:23.530> at<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.459> moment<00:03:24.730> it's<00:03:24.819> just

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
of this you know at the moment it's just

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.729 
of this you know at the moment it's just
long<00:03:25.150> long<00:03:25.359> menus<00:03:25.780> if<00:03:25.959> they<00:03:26.200> kind<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.470> got<00:03:26.590> rid

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
long long menus if they kind of got rid

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.930 
long long menus if they kind of got rid
these<00:03:26.919> long<00:03:27.069> long<00:03:27.160> menus<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.579> think<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:27.849> would

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
these long long menus I think that would

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.030 
these long long menus I think that would
be<00:03:27.970> wonders<00:03:28.480> for<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.810> game<00:03:28.989> and<00:03:29.319> kind<00:03:29.889> of<00:03:29.950> make

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
be wonders for the game and kind of make

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.559 
be wonders for the game and kind of make
it<00:03:30.069> look<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.400> bit<00:03:30.579> more<00:03:30.730> neat<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.299> a<00:03:31.329> bit<00:03:31.450> more

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
it look a bit more neat and a bit more

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.180 
it look a bit more neat and a bit more
presentable<00:03:31.750> because<00:03:32.319> at<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.859> moment<00:03:32.889> it's

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
presentable because at the moment it's

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.530 
presentable because at the moment it's
so<00:03:33.340> hard<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.700> kind<00:03:33.849> of<00:03:33.879> find<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.180> rim<00:03:34.419> you

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
so hard to kind of find that rim you

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.270 
so hard to kind of find that rim you
want<00:03:34.780> because<00:03:35.049> you<00:03:35.590> know<00:03:35.709> there's<00:03:35.889> like<00:03:36.010> four

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
want because you know there's like four

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.979 
want because you know there's like four
different<00:03:36.609> varieties<00:03:36.879> of<00:03:37.150> rim<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.629> know<00:03:37.750> and

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
different varieties of rim you know and

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.020 
different varieties of rim you know and
I<00:03:38.500> don't<00:03:39.400> know<00:03:39.459> I<00:03:39.519> think<00:03:39.639> this<00:03:39.760> is<00:03:39.879> something

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
I don't know I think this is something

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.490 
I don't know I think this is something
can<00:03:40.209> easily<00:03:40.449> solve<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:40.840> mean<00:03:40.989> I'm<00:03:41.079> gonna<00:03:41.230> try<00:03:41.440> to

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
can easily solve I mean I'm gonna try to

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.379 
can easily solve I mean I'm gonna try to
