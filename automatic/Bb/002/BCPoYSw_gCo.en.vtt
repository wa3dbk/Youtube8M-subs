00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 friends hello we continue the series of lessons 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.890
 on the rule of advice of posing for 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.960
 a photo 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.150
 This series is a lesson in support of our 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.280
 mobile application gitup posing 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.049
 Now own lesson for those who 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.289
 Interestingly, I will tell you about ours at the end. 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.630
 mobile application in more detail and so 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.090
 we continue our first lesson of the basics 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.029
 building poses now on respectively 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.920
 part 2 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.570
 while we look at the basics 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.640
 it may not seem pretty to you 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.600
 simple may not be very interesting 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.510
 but still need to know why we start 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.180
 rule number one we avoid symmetry in 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.670
 pose is the main mistake of many beginners 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.570
 straight models are absolutely symmetrical and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.300
 body picture 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.399
 friends remember all that symmetrical 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.050
 parallel it is bad for posing and 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.120
 in most cases it looks 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.860
 uninteresting 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.750
 here is an example of not very successful posing 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.270
 let's see how you can easily 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.980
 to diversify these poses 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.170
 As for hand to hand need 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.589
 have on the rampage and at different levels 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.830
 if we have one on the thigh then 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.100
 the second is better just lower relax 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.060
 or let's put it on the shoulder or 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.189
 near the hair 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.220
 don't be afraid to experiment with 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.939
 hand position further we certainly still 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.040
 individually make great lesson on 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.070
 hand position but for now you can remember 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.320
 this simple rules with feet ta 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.460
 same story to be interesting after 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.560
 one leg 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.880
 need to bend slightly at the knee and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.960
 put it on a sock 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.900
 so your hips and legs will look 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.270
 the most advantageous rule number two 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.360
 more rights of flowing lines in the pose 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.369
 emphasize body bends after looks 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.320
 interesting and attractive and if in it 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.500
 clearly visible viewed 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.299
 smooth lines and bends of your body on 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.270
 in our example, you can clearly see 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:01.250
 how easy it is to change a pretty boring pose 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.750
 just putting your hips aside is 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.579
 simple action will allow you 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.170
 emphasize the curves of your figure and 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.129
 make you in the photo much 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.940
 more attractive rule number three 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.610
 avoid ugly angularity 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.680
 first legs on the first two examples 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.090
 shows how ugly legs look 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.990
 if not pay due attention 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.010
 sock may appear 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.350
 unattractive angularity which 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.510
 spoil the whole pose to your 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.820
 legs looked attractive and more 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.450
 long always need to pull sock 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.340
 as in the example on the right, remember always about 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.820
 this is not a difficult action at all 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.160
 can significantly improve your posture 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.470
 Now a few words about the hands of a favorite mistake 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.690
 the girls in the photo is a broken arm 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.560
 try not to bend your wrist under 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.920
 right angle 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.400
 Kei should be a smooth continuation. 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.970
 your hand also do not forget about 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.100
 bast shoes 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.060
 make sure that they are not too 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.760
 with sharp and bulging replace unnecessary 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.700
 corners and smoother lines for example 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.500
 like we have in the photo on the right and then your 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.520
 posture will look natural and more 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.340
 feminine now here is one example 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.250
 we have combined all the errors that can 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.050
 arise with angular 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.220
 of course a little exaggerated 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.280
 alternative after all 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.540
 look at the photo on the left again discuss 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.650
 dangerous moments that need 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.860
 pay attention first is sock 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.400
 the second 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.490
 wrists and third elbows and now 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.320
 look at the photo on the right where is also such 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:45.230
 same posture but without these errors here 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.600
 sock we pull the brush with us smoothly and 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.530
 hand continuation and missing sharp 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.190
 elbow angles 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:56.330
 Well, it's immediately obvious that to the girls 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.030
 attractive about theory 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.330
