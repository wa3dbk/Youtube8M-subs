00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
let it sit for the better I'm just going

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.009 
let it sit for the better I'm just going
to<00:02:18.840> dump<00:02:19.260> my<00:02:19.620> gram<00:02:20.010> flour<00:02:20.189> and<00:02:20.610> all<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.750> spices

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
to dump my gram flour and all the spices

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.220 
to dump my gram flour and all the spices
which<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.680> showed<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.720> directly<00:02:24.720> into<00:02:25.079> this

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
which I showed you directly into this

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.520 
which I showed you directly into this
and<00:02:26.329> if<00:02:27.329> required<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.930> can<00:02:28.019> add<00:02:28.260> more<00:02:28.470> salt

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
and if required you can add more salt

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.619 
and if required you can add more salt
but<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.220> think<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.549> have<00:02:29.700> added<00:02:29.879> already<00:02:30.420> and

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
but I think I have added already and

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.099 
but I think I have added already and
then<00:02:31.409> I'm<00:02:32.159> going<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.400> add<00:02:32.640> some<00:02:33.030> water<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:33.750> we

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
then I'm going to add some water and we

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.949 
then I'm going to add some water and we
have<00:02:34.349> to<00:02:34.590> again<00:02:35.519> use<00:02:35.760> clean<00:02:36.030> hands<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.540> make

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
have to again use clean hands and make

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.780 
have to again use clean hands and make
it<00:02:37.079> better<00:02:37.260> out<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.709> we<00:02:37.920> don't<00:02:38.099> want<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.640> to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
it better out of it we don't want it to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.970 
it better out of it we don't want it to
be<00:02:38.879> very<00:02:39.090> thin<00:02:39.359> better<00:02:39.599> we<00:02:40.260> want<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.829> be<00:02:40.950> a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
be very thin better we want it to be a

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.000 
be very thin better we want it to be a
creamy<00:02:41.430> better<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.510> no<00:02:42.959> lumps<00:02:43.379> work<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:43.890> out

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
creamy better so no lumps work it out

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.069 
creamy better so no lumps work it out
very<00:02:44.310> well<00:02:46.159> so<00:02:47.159> I<00:02:47.190> had<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.700> add<00:02:47.879> two<00:02:48.629> more<00:02:48.659> tea

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
very well so I had to add two more tea

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.289 
very well so I had to add two more tea
spoons<00:02:49.409> of<00:02:49.620> gram<00:02:49.920> flour<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.579> get<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.000> creamy

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
spoons of gram flour to get the creamy

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.020 
spoons of gram flour to get the creamy
consistency<00:02:52.280> this<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.340> what<00:02:53.579> we<00:02:53.700> are<00:02:53.790> looking

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
consistency this is what we are looking

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.770 
consistency this is what we are looking
for<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.620> now<00:02:55.620> our<00:02:56.280> batter<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:57.000> ready<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.599> I

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
for and now our batter is ready and I

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.750 
for and now our batter is ready and I
have<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:58.079> wait<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.980> fish<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.459> get

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
have to wait for the fish to get

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.660 
have to wait for the fish to get
marinated<00:03:00.359> before<00:03:00.659> we<00:03:00.780> fry<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.049> so<00:03:01.459> fish<00:03:02.459> has

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
marinated before we fry it so fish has

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.759 
marinated before we fry it so fish has
been<00:03:02.819> resting<00:03:03.060> for<00:03:03.239> good<00:03:03.690> thirty<00:03:03.989> minutes<00:03:04.440> and

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
been resting for good thirty minutes and

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.830 
been resting for good thirty minutes and
now<00:03:05.159> I'm<00:03:05.280> going<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.639> add<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.599> fish

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
species I don't want all the juices of

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.270 
species I don't want all the juices of
the<00:03:09.420> marination<00:03:09.840> because<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:10.889> will<00:03:11.069> drop

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
the marination because this will drop

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.680 
the marination because this will drop
the<00:03:11.489> consistency<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.209> my<00:03:13.430> better<00:03:14.449> so<00:03:15.449> here

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
the consistency of my better so here

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.740 
the consistency of my better so here
goes<00:03:15.959> my<00:03:16.199> fish<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:17.790> can<00:03:17.970> use<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.299> marination

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
goes my fish you can use this marination

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.530 
goes my fish you can use this marination
in<00:03:19.019> some<00:03:19.230> curry<00:03:19.500> or<00:03:19.940> form<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.209> net<00:03:21.419> it's

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
in some curry or form a net it's

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
add a bus just spin the whole oil flip

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.940 
add a bus just spin the whole oil flip
it<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.299> batches

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
it in batches

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.580 
it in batches
we<00:04:14.370> want<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.180> be<00:04:15.300> really<00:04:15.780> really<00:04:15.990> golden
