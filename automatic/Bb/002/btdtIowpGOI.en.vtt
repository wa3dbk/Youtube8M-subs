00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello everyone a big hello this 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.150
 it will be a very controversial video and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.790
 pitifully maybe in the process of 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.349
 this video ruin your whole childhood like this 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.200
 that if you're not ready to see 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.780
 discover and know the truth of all 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.270
 delicious cereals that we enjoyed with 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.279
 both little ones better novelty this video 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.900
 but I know that you discovered I'm valuing it from 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.060
 all ways so the big question 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 the cereals are good or bad and the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.750
 second I've heard of diets that 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.460
 You can lose weight just by eating 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.289
 cereal and if you can lose weight just 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.840
 eating would be good as they would say for me 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.219
 earth to the bull by the antlers 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.250
 pitifully when they go to this section 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.719
 from the supermarket that fascinates you 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.020
 delicious that you think that health you live 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.910
 all that million boxes of cereal very 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.969
 pitifully because I also 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.950
 fascinated cereal when I was young 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.620
 80% all those boxes and everything you see 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.140
 in this section it is not as healthy as 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.390
 think ally pitifully you're not going to 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.980
 help a lot to lose weight let me 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.840
 explain why I am telling you 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.300
 this now you have on screen the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.280
 label of nutrition factors of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.409
 a cereal box 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.150
 and current that you can find in that 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.860
 section of your supermarket and no no you 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.810
 I'm playing trick of the same tag 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.820
 from this box that simply took a 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.650
 photo he put on the screen but for 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.930
 obvious reasons I will not show the face 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.580
 of the cereal was good following with the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.880
 subject and stevie of our attention what 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.909
 the label tells us for a portion 120 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.369
 calories sounds perfect not so far 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.770
 we go well now each serving weighs 30 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.409
 grams is not so bad gives you a portion 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.740
 very decent on the plate we still follow 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.720
 ok but now look at the amount of 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.840
 carbohydrates that have each serving 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.940
 Each position has 25 grams of 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.409
 carbohydrates and let's be realistic when 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.899
 you serve yourself a portion of cereal is 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.759
 very difficult for you to eat a portion of 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.619
 those that is small average usually goes 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.750
 to end up eating two servings or 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.460
 up to three portions especially in the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.399
 breakfast that means you're 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.300
 eating 50 grams of carbohydrates and 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.729
 up to 75 grams of carbohydrates in one 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.890
 single food now you think that's bad 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.110
 news look more below look at the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.860
 amount of sugar that has this has 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.430
 6 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.710
 of sugar per serving and that this 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.510
 cereal is one of the most decent 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.520
 you can find look very well 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.500
 next that will be super look that 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.030
 label and after realizing that the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.790
 most popular cereals has a 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.770
 ridiculous amount of sugar and finished 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.050
 pitifully and now to complete and 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.360
 top off let's look at the amount of protein 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.850
 for each serving just 2 grams of 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.140
 protein per serving now with everything 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.140
 what you have learned so far in the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.690
 It analyzes this channel a little percent 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.959
 20 calories you're just eating 2 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.720
 grams of protein and gentlemen 25 grams 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.360
 of carbohydrates of which 6 grams 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.190
 of those is sugar or carbohydrates 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.020
 totally empty that do not help you 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.640
 nothing now think about those diets that you 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.560
 they say you just have to eat cereal 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.390
 throughout the day and you lose a lot 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.040
 of weight we use this same will be the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.690
 day we eat 6 times a day 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.600
 At the end of the day you will have accumulated 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.209
 an incredible amount of carbohydrates 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.220
 and almost no protein which is going to 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.280
 produce that you simply lose muscle 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.120
 so that weight that you're losing 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.659
 unfortunately it is muscle 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.030
 and not fat so you already know this 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.340
 video is going to rid you of many mistakes and 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.380
 of many super uncomfortable situations 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:32.280
 what happen in daily life 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:36.000
 to see what happens in the model of hunger 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.000
 and what are you going to eat 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.020
 a can of tuna I think something that has 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:49.370
 given or I'm going to eat something light 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.989
 like a cereal or an apple or something 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.030
 the claim at any price in 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.290
 personality as virtue and exxon friend 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.819
 of raw sisters or moms is pure 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.080
 coincidence Carlos does not take responsibility 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.549
 with psychological stretches caused by 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.190
 I repeat the eyes how they speak maybe 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.500
 certain tics but enough still 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.239
 I hope you enjoyed the video already 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.340
 you know now in the reality of the 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.590
 cereals so do not be fooled and 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.140
 Whatever you never do but never 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.629
 eat cereal at night before sleep 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.880
