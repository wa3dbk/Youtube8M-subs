00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.009 

when<00:00:07.410> we<00:00:07.529> look<00:00:07.740> at<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.010> mental<00:00:08.429> piece<00:00:08.809> it<00:00:09.809> is

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
when we look at the mental piece it is

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.650 
when we look at the mental piece it is
truly<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.530> limiting<00:00:11.309> factor<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.059> performance

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
truly the limiting factor to performance

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.709 
truly the limiting factor to performance
and<00:00:13.250> where<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.400> really<00:00:14.549> starts<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.150> my<00:00:15.330> end<00:00:15.599> is

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
and where it really starts on my end is

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.750 
and where it really starts on my end is
the<00:00:15.870> coaching<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:17.070> one<00:00:17.279> thing<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.609> like

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the coaching and one thing that I like

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.450 
the coaching and one thing that I like
to<00:00:17.880> talk<00:00:18.090> about<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.449> if<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.779> was<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.050> take<00:00:19.460> ten

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
to talk about is if I was to take ten

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.330 
to talk about is if I was to take ten
different<00:00:21.029> coaches<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.590> was<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.890> magically

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
different coaches but I was to magically

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.750 
different coaches but I was to magically
clone<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.210> athlete<00:00:24.689> ten<00:00:25.199> times<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.890> give<00:00:26.490> all

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
clone the athlete ten times and give all

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.790 
clone the athlete ten times and give all
of<00:00:26.880> those<00:00:26.970> coaches<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.570> same<00:00:27.779> program<00:00:28.320> so

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
of those coaches the same program so

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.359 
of those coaches the same program so
same<00:00:29.130> program<00:00:29.730> same<00:00:30.420> athlete<00:00:31.019> ten<00:00:31.920> different

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
same program same athlete ten different

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.819 
same program same athlete ten different
coaches<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.000> would<00:00:33.600> bet<00:00:33.780> my<00:00:33.960> career<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.710> we

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
coaches I would bet my career that we

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.240 
coaches I would bet my career that we
get<00:00:35.040> ten<00:00:35.370> different<00:00:36.360> results<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.739> reason

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
get ten different results and the reason

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.270 
get ten different results and the reason
is<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.030> way<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.450> coach<00:00:40.100> engages<00:00:41.100> and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
is the way the coach engages and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.010 
is the way the coach engages and
interacts<00:00:41.730> with<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> athlete<00:00:42.450> from<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
interacts with the athlete from a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.319 
interacts with the athlete from a
mindset<00:00:43.649> perspective<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.940> limiting

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
mindset perspective is the limiting

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.750 
mindset perspective is the limiting
factor<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.170> example<00:00:46.559> therefore<00:00:47.550> how<00:00:47.730> we

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
factor in that example therefore how we

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.270 
factor in that example therefore how we
develop<00:00:48.329> extrinsic<00:00:48.930> versus<00:00:49.649> intrinsic

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
develop extrinsic versus intrinsic

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.900 
develop extrinsic versus intrinsic
motivation<00:00:50.850> how<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.600> corral<00:00:52.520> focus<00:00:53.520> within<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
motivation how we corral focus within a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.360 
motivation how we corral focus within a
training<00:00:54.180> session<00:00:54.510> how<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.770> engage<00:00:55.920> an

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
training session how we can engage an

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.709 
training session how we can engage an
athlete<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> point<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.390> they<00:00:57.539> don't

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
athlete to the point that they don't

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.810 
athlete to the point that they don't
even<00:00:57.899> need<00:00:58.289> us<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.520> say<00:00:59.670> we

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
even need us that as I like to say we

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.700 
even need us that as I like to say we
can<00:01:00.000> hand<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> keys<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> car<00:01:01.020> back<00:01:01.469> over

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
can hand the keys to the car back over

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.979 
can hand the keys to the car back over
them<00:01:02.010> whether<00:01:02.609> we're<00:01:02.760> talking<00:01:02.910> NFL<00:01:03.480> Combine

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
them whether we're talking NFL Combine

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.719 
them whether we're talking NFL Combine
or<00:01:04.409> an<00:01:04.500> athlete<00:01:04.799> preparing<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.339> play<00:01:05.519> their

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
or an athlete preparing to play their

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.280 
or an athlete preparing to play their
sport<00:01:05.850> I'm<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.540> necessarily<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
sport I'm not necessarily on the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.260 
sport I'm not necessarily on the
sidelines<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:07.920> them<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.549> everything<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.210> do

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
sidelines with them so everything I do

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.990 
sidelines with them so everything I do
key<00:01:09.720> word<00:01:09.930> here<00:01:10.020> needs<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.830> transfer<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
key word here needs to transfer and

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.760 
key word here needs to transfer and
oftentimes<00:01:12.420> transfer<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.229> training<00:01:13.470> is

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
oftentimes transfer of training is

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.399 
oftentimes transfer of training is
limited<00:01:14.520> by<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.670> athletes<00:01:15.240> ability<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.049> do<00:01:16.259> it

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
limited by the athletes ability to do it

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.600 
limited by the athletes ability to do it
on<00:01:16.530> their<00:01:16.979> own<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.060> my<00:01:18.270> ability<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.810> engage

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
on their own so my ability to engage

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.120 
on their own so my ability to engage
empower<00:01:21.229> specifically<00:01:22.229> through<00:01:22.470> intrinsic

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
empower specifically through intrinsic

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.100 
empower specifically through intrinsic
motivation<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.880> how<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> go<00:01:24.390> about<00:01:24.420> coaching

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
motivation and how I go about coaching

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.230 
motivation and how I go about coaching
them<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.500> also<00:01:26.040> how<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.430> go<00:01:26.580> about<00:01:26.610> coaching

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
them and also how they go about coaching

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.730 
them and also how they go about coaching
themselves<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:28.200> they<00:01:28.320> bring<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
themselves and what they bring to the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.249 
themselves and what they bring to the
table<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> consummate<00:01:29.700> professional

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
table as a consummate professional

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.450 
table as a consummate professional
absolutely<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> limiting<00:01:31.860> factor<00:01:31.890> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
absolutely is a limiting factor and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.880 
absolutely is a limiting factor and
oftentimes<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> coaching<00:01:34.140> strategy

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
oftentimes it's the coaching strategy

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.640 
oftentimes it's the coaching strategy
that<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.490> use<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:36.540> teach<00:01:36.780> an<00:01:36.990> athlete<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.500> own

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
that I use to teach an athlete to own

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.789 
that I use to teach an athlete to own
how<00:01:38.310> they<00:01:38.549> move<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.720> sport<00:01:40.079> absolutely

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
how they move the the sport absolutely

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.999 
how they move the the sport absolutely
is<00:01:40.920> an<00:01:41.070> underlying<00:01:41.579> theme<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.590> many

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
is an underlying theme right but many

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.160 
is an underlying theme right but many
people<00:01:44.460> think<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.880> everything<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:45.840> has

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
people think that everything we do has

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.319 
people think that everything we do has
to<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:46.470> sports<00:01:46.860> specific<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
to be sports specific and that's not the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.719 
to be sports specific and that's not the
case<00:01:48.570> oftentimes<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.829> limiting<00:01:50.250> factor<00:01:50.670> is

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
case oftentimes the limiting factor is

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.850 
case oftentimes the limiting factor is
the<00:01:50.880> athlete<00:01:51.240> has<00:01:51.390> don't<00:01:52.110> always<00:01:52.350> relate

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the athlete has don't always relate

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.280 
the athlete has don't always relate
specifically<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.820> their<00:01:54.450> sport<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.170> sport

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
specifically to their sport the sport

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.350 
specifically to their sport the sport
probably<00:01:55.770> caused<00:01:56.040> them<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:56.820> what<00:01:57.030> they<00:01:57.060> need

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
probably caused them but what they need

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.539 
probably caused them but what they need
to<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.600> from<00:01:57.780> an<00:01:57.960> exercise<00:01:58.500> perspective<00:01:59.189> may

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
to do from an exercise perspective may

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.920 
to do from an exercise perspective may
be<00:01:59.610> far<00:01:59.939> different<00:01:59.969> than<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.659> sport

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
be far different than the sport

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.990 
be far different than the sport
themselves<00:02:01.469> what<00:02:02.369> people<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.909> remember

still every single session we're gonna

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.390 
still every single session we're gonna
reintegrate<00:02:42.960> even<00:02:43.650> if<00:02:43.710> it's<00:02:43.860> just<00:02:43.920> during<00:02:44.370> the
