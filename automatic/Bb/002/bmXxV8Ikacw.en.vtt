 This one has a glow here. 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.810

 So, this is professional makeup here. 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:57.790
 the situation is see it on a mat 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:03:00.160

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.269
 this happens if you want it can be natural 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.900
 was marked by one of the makeup artists now 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:25.209

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.040
 that less necromaquia species then it is 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.730
 always cool to still get under the dark circles 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:38.799
 which takes especially what in a month 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.359
 Children advances did not hesitate and do 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.750

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:39.990
 How do you apply this to light? 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:41.880
