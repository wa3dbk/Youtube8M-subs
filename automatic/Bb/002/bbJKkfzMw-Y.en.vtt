decks I can beat you as a mono red deck
that's<00:04:18.750> just<00:04:19.020> faster<00:04:19.500> than<00:04:19.709> you<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:20.070> mean<00:04:20.310> it's

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
that's just faster than you I mean it's

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.850 
that's just faster than you I mean it's
just<00:04:20.670> a<00:04:20.790> lot<00:04:21.090> faster<00:04:21.630> than<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.260> drown<00:04:22.620> is

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
just a lot faster than you and drown is

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.350 
just a lot faster than you and drown is
pretty<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:23.400> mean<00:04:23.580> it's<00:04:23.670> pretty<00:04:23.820> good<00:04:24.000> for<00:04:24.060> its

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
pretty I mean it's pretty good for its

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.290 
pretty I mean it's pretty good for its
value<00:04:25.310> because<00:04:26.310> if<00:04:26.580> you're<00:04:26.790> going<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.030> drown

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
value because if you're going to drown

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.210 
value because if you're going to drown

with this more of you strike leader is

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.860 
with this more of you strike leader is
very<00:05:18.539> very<00:05:18.960> good<00:05:19.580> that<00:05:20.580> being<00:05:20.849> said<00:05:21.150> I<00:05:21.419> don't

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
very very good that being said I don't

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
feel like I want to actually play in a

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.330 
feel like I want to actually play in a
main<00:05:23.820> deck<00:05:24.000> but<00:05:24.389> to<00:05:24.870> create<00:05:25.139> tokens<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:26.190> to

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
main deck but to create tokens and to

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.330 
main deck but to create tokens and to
create<00:05:26.550> attacking<00:05:27.120> abilities<00:05:27.570> I<00:05:28.560> don't<00:05:29.099> know

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
create attacking abilities I don't know

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.879 
create attacking abilities I don't know
if<00:05:29.580> the<00:05:29.789> gas<00:05:30.090> ability<00:05:30.720> is<00:05:30.780> actually<00:05:31.560> relevant

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
if the gas ability is actually relevant

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.580 
if the gas ability is actually relevant
I<00:05:32.130> think<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.699> you<00:05:33.120> play<00:05:33.449> on<00:05:33.750> turn<00:05:34.139> free<00:05:34.380> and

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
I think the you play on turn free and

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.510 
I think the you play on turn free and
then<00:05:35.310> your<00:05:35.460> attack<00:05:35.729> of<00:05:35.910> it<00:05:36.030> and<00:05:37.160> you<00:05:38.160> know<00:05:38.220> if

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
then your attack of it and you know if

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.029 
then your attack of it and you know if
they<00:05:38.729> exchange<00:05:39.300> with<00:05:39.479> him<00:05:39.659> and<00:05:40.560> hopefully<00:05:40.740> you

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
they exchange with him and hopefully you

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.710 
they exchange with him and hopefully you
can<00:05:41.159> kill<00:05:41.340> something<00:05:41.669> then<00:05:42.030> you<00:05:42.120> get<00:05:42.270> a<00:05:42.300> 2<00:05:42.479> 1

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
can kill something then you get a 2 1

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.480 
can kill something then you get a 2 1
which<00:05:43.020> is<00:05:43.320> really<00:05:43.590> really<00:05:43.800> good<00:05:43.949> for<00:05:44.130> dragon

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
which is really really good for dragon

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.570 
which is really really good for dragon
and<00:05:44.639> now<00:05:45.419> this<00:05:45.630> card<00:05:45.930> this<00:05:46.710> card<00:05:46.770> is<00:05:47.280> pretty

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
and now this card this card is pretty

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.339 
and now this card this card is pretty
much<00:05:47.699> to<00:05:47.970> take<00:05:48.210> away<00:05:48.449> on<00:05:48.690> the<00:05:48.810> cards<00:05:49.110> that<00:05:49.169> can

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
much to take away on the cards that can

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.170 
much to take away on the cards that can
blow<00:05:49.590> you<00:05:49.650> out<00:05:49.830> and<00:05:50.340> you<00:05:50.550> can<00:05:50.580> get<00:05:50.820> blown<00:05:51.060> out

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
blow you out and you can get blown out

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.939 
blow you out and you can get blown out
