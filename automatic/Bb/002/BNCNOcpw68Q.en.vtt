this<00:00:37.890> world<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.399> show<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.670> have

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
this world just to show you have

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.990 
this world just to show you have
everything<00:00:39.690> I'm<00:00:40.020> accessible<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.430> easy

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000

everything I'm accessible and and easy
without<00:00:42.270> any<00:00:42.600> attacks<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.550> basically<00:00:44.550> this

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
without any attacks but basically this

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.479 
without any attacks but basically this
is<00:00:45.469> the<00:00:46.469> first<00:00:46.770> step<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.280> pretty

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
is the first step it's pretty

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.479 
is the first step it's pretty
straightforward<00:00:47.760> actually<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:49.010> there<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.190> I

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
straightforward actually and there is I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.400 
straightforward actually and there is I
just<00:00:50.820> did<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.210> if<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.050> brick<00:00:52.260> it

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
just did this if this was just brick it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.779 
just did this if this was just brick it
would<00:00:52.530> work<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.070> same<00:00:53.100> way<00:00:53.460> no<00:00:53.640> matter

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
would work just the same way no matter

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.670 
would work just the same way no matter
what<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.090> was<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> secret<00:00:55.260> room

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
what it was but I have a secret room

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.700 
what it was but I have a secret room
under<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.289> all<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> same

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
under here and if this was all the same

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.319 
under here and if this was all the same
like<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.980> said<00:00:59.190> you'd<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.489> fine<00:00:59.609> it<00:01:00.000> would<00:01:00.120> blend

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
like I said you'd be fine it would blend

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.910 
like I said you'd be fine it would blend
right<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:01.050> did<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.410> could<00:01:01.680> see

could<00:03:01.350> probably<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:01.860> leave<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.160> hole<00:03:02.430> because

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
could probably just leave a hole because

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.020 
could probably just leave a hole because
every<00:03:02.940> time<00:03:03.060> someone<00:03:03.510> gets<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:05.030> they're
