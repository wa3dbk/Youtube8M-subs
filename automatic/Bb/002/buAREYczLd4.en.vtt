00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.480
 a friendly hello to the video 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.700
 tutorial to guide game today 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.320
 I have two updates for you the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.000
 you both certainly help 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.730
 and I have mine 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.019
 Rescue guard 1 1 f stand for this 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.359
 Unfortunately, I do not have any network yet 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:25.510
 crew yes, it is still standing 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.730
 on status two not in the 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.619
 Alert list will go to me too 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.860
 always suggested this network because 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.390
 it stands on status 2 at automat so also 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.770
 I could tell you that, if I did 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.360
 Click now by hand then works 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.460
 it still does not amuse much now 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.960
 automatically the automatic alarm and 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.090
 AusrÃ¼ckeordnung then you see 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.399
 already the net is always dialed with 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.500
 and that's always annoying yes 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.789
 what can you do now completely 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.430
 new you can just do that 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:55.930
 could call appropriate vehicle 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.370
 it ms ms status six sets of fms 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.210
 status of him saves you see that 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.370
 already here in the view and now 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.140
 in a use of this vehicle 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.780
 no longer proposed that is even 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.950
 no longer in the list in it that is 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.120
 You can not provide this 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.930
 Alert even if you car 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.520
 did not want to alert 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.840
 if you have this vehicle again 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.960
 Just wanted to make it easy 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.460
 Just click the vehicle again 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.270
 back to status two sentences 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.770
 and yes, happy everything is great 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.600
 for the people who have at least one 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.610
 Group leaders are now available 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.520
 make things of interest check things 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.700
 can and just a new point 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.880
 Click Set slightly to 95 point of 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.980
 Click interest check and then you can 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.580
 you'll see again these points 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.860
 of interest right or wrong or he 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.860
 says I have no idea 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.960
 that could be me but not her 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.860
 Of course you should do this here 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.410
 Do not use satellite view 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.360
 or the map view ever 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.120
 after all, there's something there 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.670
 what is there for a point of 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.750
 interest 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.340
 you have the opportunity to say that 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.110
 point of interest so right at this 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.090
 Place is a lake or at this point 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.510
 is not here I am already on the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.069
 map 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.920
 Of course, there is no lake to afford 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.720
 so building is obviously this one 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.040
 post tightly wrong if you guys 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.690
 unsure then click on none 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.020
 other 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.520
 the new point of interest why does 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.770
 you just the whole thing 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.200
 There should be points of interest for everyone 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.010
 be taken over 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.780
 of course I need a few 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.070
 data whether these points of interest of 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.660
 any player has been used 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.670
 are right or wrong 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.490
 you have the opportunity now 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.630
 to help board game and tell him ok 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.660
 soffin's what's right 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.940
 or wrong around there that 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.650
 to prevent cheating , I say 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.510
 to enter because any rubbish 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.870
 Of course you need at least the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.000
 grade group leaders yes that was it 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.310
 I would be happy if you could 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.970
 very diligent points of interest 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.550
 proven if you could already 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.560
 or quite diligently here the status six 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.210
 does not use if your vehicle 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.450
 wanted to use or not currently 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.950
 Can it be that it was me 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.920
 I wish you a lot of fun while playing 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.640
 and will say for the days until then 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.640
 Thank you
