 everyone the copper cones were 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.700
 in the fish 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.110
 we started with what you see 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.949
 otherwise not explained things 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.949
 so strange 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.300
 as a control command that can 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:32.330
 sing screen and over ugly 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.330
 Apparently the thing is wrong 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.340
 although the following was a tablet more 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 normal 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:45.390
 it's life I feel 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.579
 perfect if you hate the stable 8 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.140
 inches of good screen and speakers 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.140
 front that will fight 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.750
 this junk has powerful will bore 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.310
 another great hdmi point 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.250
 two or three thanks to forget where to put 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.380
 the buttons like these buttons 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:24.530
 and also has the pencil that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.130
 the pencil is the envy sit 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.690
 as with animals only you can not 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.409
 discover why streaming from your 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.830
 own gaming pc is the envy certain 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.540
 time 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.910
 it can not be what it's worth 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.090
 Of course I recommend it to you the only one 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.120
 better maybe that there is the wii of 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.120
 Nintendo 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.280
 it's the only thing that rhymes 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.860
 thanks for watching this video I hope that you 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.230
 have seemed the least curious these 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.780
 of the sing analysis I do not promise to do it 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.340
 very often but it has occurred to me 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.960
 there the idea and I think it can be 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.090
 interesting tell me in comments 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.830
 Leave me the ones I like the ones I do not like 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.840
 It depends on whether you liked it or if you have 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.550

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.550
