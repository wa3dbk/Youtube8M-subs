 it draws attention and also seen in 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.380
 my life a beginning of year like this 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.600
 [Music] 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.600
 but we are not used to us 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.829
 compared to other years in 2000 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.350
 when the millennium there were celebrations 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.970

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.490
 zealand with australia are the ones that had 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.490
 by to see here the news and taiwan 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.380

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.510
 origin where they are manufactured also today is 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.890
 same 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.430
 basically these costs are manufactured very 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.240
 low and they will use them to the maximum 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.240
