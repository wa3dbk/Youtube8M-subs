Weill<00:00:10.879> Odom<00:00:11.240> this<00:00:11.869> is<00:00:12.020> a<00:00:12.049> good-sized<00:00:12.529> machine

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
Weill Odom this is a good-sized machine

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.960 
Weill Odom this is a good-sized machine
it's<00:00:13.190> not<00:00:13.340> quite<00:00:13.730> as<00:00:13.940> big<00:00:14.180> as<00:00:14.480> a<00:00:15.100> 980<00:00:16.100> H<00:00:16.520> which

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
it's not quite as big as a 980 H which

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.110 
it's not quite as big as a 980 H which
is<00:00:21.310> right<00:00:22.310> down<00:00:22.490> there<00:00:22.610> at<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:22.789> end<00:00:22.850> of<00:00:23.060> the

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.120 
is right down there at the end of the

line<00:00:25.030> which<00:00:26.030> I<00:00:26.270> already<00:00:26.420> have<00:00:26.539> a<00:00:26.750> video<00:00:27.140> of<00:00:27.590> and

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
line which I already have a video of and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.210 
line which I already have a video of and
I'll<00:00:28.310> probably<00:00:28.700> make<00:00:28.940> another<00:00:29.000> one<00:00:29.420> because

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
I'll probably make another one because

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.889 
I'll probably make another one because
988<00:00:31.220> are<00:00:31.460> often<00:00:31.789> more<00:00:32.300> common<00:00:32.660> than<00:00:32.750> you<00:00:32.809> would
