00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.810
 everybody bump me it does 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.220
 really good to be finally in the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.490
 Swiss because I spent a lot 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.780
 from time to time over the swiss mme i 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.389
 used your company often 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.010
 aviation swiss hours and I feel 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.400
 like a really interesting thing with 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.820
 swissair these are the only planes in 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.930
 which I vomited and if if it's a 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.340
 something you do not forget every year 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.619
 worth you vomit you remember it in 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.240
 general it changes the dynamics 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.650
 in general it is but I would say that it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.160
 leave traces are in your memory 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.570
 and elsewhere and I learned a lot of 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.480
 things too when I vomited in a 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.270
 japex plane has changed the dynamics to 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.800
 inside the plane for example if 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.370
 your goal was to flirt with the girl 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.370
 next to you 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.070
 when you pick up the bag 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.890
 vomit it becomes very very difficult 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.690
 to arrive at ends and at the moment you 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.090
 their amps there it's over you put 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.280
 you put means it's hard to stay fit 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.390
 because the flight attendants and 7 td 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.770
 you go and see you by saying 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.049
 sir is what you want us to 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.220
 rids you of your little bag 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.060
 done to the point where we are at I think that 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.470
 you can tu me and you want to say no 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.330
 because you are a man was worthy 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.610
 but different 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.140
 it's a very interesting offer 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.480
 to get rid of a bag of vomit in 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.160
 all circumstances it's good 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.720
 as does the sound I just 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.730
 very very far to be with you this 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.030
 evening I come from Brussels it's far if 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.160
 far 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.420
 a little before I was in Canada when I 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.860
 prefer to say it because the accent I 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.300
 do not know why it fascinates the crowds 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.850
 good now I know what is that 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.530
 having big bells waiting 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.240
 this moment people lie by stopping there 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.710
 to listen for a minute will take it 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.060
 not speak the same by the Pope denied by 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.830
 pop art and he speaks not like it 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.330
 do not speak the same, so the accents are 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.570
 exactly like the breasts anymore it's 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:53.430
 big plus we notice them 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.660
 but more it's big less hot I listen 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.040
 you can not see it but it makes 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.770
 pleasure to see that big box 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.500
 in the room I hear it laughs I 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.430
 know where to go after after no I get 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.780
 remember the first time I took 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.760
 the plane to come to europe francophone 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.140
 I was so jolly and it's easy 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.160
 to see that they have never flown 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.020
 in an airport 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.820
 it's the only one who does not get the hang of it 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.740
 everyone is in a bad mood 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.850
 businessmans they shit employees 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.020
 are shit people who leave in 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.730
 couple holidays they are shunned 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.100
 because it's like mandatory a 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.080
 brutal repression and with all my joy 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.200
 did he play that breaks the balls to 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.570
 you see happiness is a little 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.690
 like alcohol a little is good but you 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.890
 road bent everyone next to you 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.600
 to me I come to the counter I do 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.860
 hello and the lady meets passion for 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.360
 the job I take my tickets I'm going 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.890
 at the security checks I'm doing 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.440
 hello legault responds to the hours when 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.030
 you know he engages in the same 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.250
 family and I arrive inside of 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.870
 the plane and starts with all the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.720
 security checks then me I 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.080
 thought it was safe an airplane 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.239
 balls 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.680
 because he says Attention please 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.720
 fasten your seatbelt 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.510
 it's going to be a big disneyland thing 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.760
 a summer helmet is a bullshit of 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.820
 cloth belt the 5 feelings and no 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.220
 I even in my Peugeot 207 is over 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.780
 security urge for ten years but 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.960
 it is important to keep watch and there you 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.740
 know how good it will save my life 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.690
 because at the end of what I know of 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.580

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.020

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.030
 what once in the history of 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.000
 modern aviation that the belt of 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.010
 security saved a life just a kind 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.960
 a plane that catches fire sinks into 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:39.460
 turns it explodes then the evening at jt 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:41.350
 at the March field where I know it serves 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.180
 nothing here is the shit a plane we're going 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.600
 all die it's all there is no other 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.240
 option 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.620
 and I would like to one day find a 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.090
 airline company that the balls of 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.550

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.830
 to pass if it's the crap that does its 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.720
 message that looks like madam sir 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.340
 in case of depressurization of the device 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.680
 an oxygen mask will stretch in front of you 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.270
 come and install it so you can 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.700
 breathe comfortably while we are all 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.020
 right to certain death 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.520
 the seat belt will serve you to 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.090
 nothing except maybe you select the 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.580
 Koran 2 and keep the corpses in 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.200
 place if they are calcined which 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.320
 facilitate identification for 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.400
 thank you families and good wolf and no to the 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.440
 place they give us instructions to 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.310
 Bills safety tonnage granted to 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.630
 this being the non- smoking theft were in 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.120
 non-smoking route compared to which 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.830
 other type of flight that exist they are 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.380
 all times king non-smoking flights from 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.300
 anyway if they believe in class 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.080
 economy making it a movie in hand 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.210
 no smoking I do not know 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.819
 you believe in doubt I turn on a 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.050
 little cunt easily if it happens you 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.539
 take this claude you have him train in 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.069
 the eye in a way that will come to 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.629
 to pity his friends if he is stupid as 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:51.500
 that there are no friends we do not care 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:52.610
 surround all the controls set 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.930
 these critics are debugged there I 'm going 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.400
 not judge but it's mostly in the 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.340
 American airline companies we see 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.840
 that there is a logo if you are near the 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.000
 porthole you can see a little logo 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.759
 on the wings of the plane and is written 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.800
 please do not step on the wings of 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:14.180
 the plane but remove the logo if 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.270
 someone really wants to walk on the 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.090
 wings of the plane which unfortunately they 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.469
 will miss anyone this guy this is 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.639
 collectively we are all at the 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:24.940
 search for cure for cancer 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.129
 for him who sees the find the birds 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.599
 it's not a heavy loss according to darwin 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:32.120
 says we're never so smart 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.830
 that the most stupid specimen and I 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.449
 understand that for ethical reasons 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.900
 we can not murder people in 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:42.110
 function of qi it's a shame but I 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:46.580
 understand but also six cars eliminates 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.289
 let them sign not survive 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.940
 in fact I still managed to 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.710
 land in brussels at the end of it all 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.969
 and a lot of little messages about 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.069
 airline companies and something that 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.089
 always made me navy little arrogance 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.650
 when you work in the middle of 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.089
