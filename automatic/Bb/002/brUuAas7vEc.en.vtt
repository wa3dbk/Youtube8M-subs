00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.769
Hey guys MWC 2015 and you are looking at the
brand new Motorola Mote E 2nd Generation.

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:13.940
And we thought we would never see 2nd Generation
of Moto E after the Moto X and the Moto G

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.970
came out.
But there was news of Mote E but finally the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.150
Moto E arrives.
It's already available in the US and you know

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.450
in multiple countries of Europe.
So in US the 3G version costs about 119 Dollars

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.350
and the 4G version about 149 Dollars.
In the Europe it costs about in the Europe

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.670
actually only the LTE version is available.
And that costs 129 Euros I do not know the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.829
pricing and the availability dates for India
and some of the other south East Asian Countries.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.769
But you have the 4.5inch screen small QHD
Resolution.

00:00:52.769 --> 00:01:02.460
245ppi of color density and it looks fairly
similar to the earlier Moto E little rounder

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:11.380
on the sides here.
And also I gonna show you this one the back

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.040
actually looks like this it has very nice
you know rubbery feeling that we have seen

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.540
on the 1st Generation Moto E also.
And sorry for the disco lights here.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.140
Anyway you can change the Band here I am not
sure how do you exactly remove that.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.310
But you can go ahead and you can remove the
bands here it's stuck over there.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.990
And you will get a band like this so see I
have Purple band or Indigo if you will.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.070
So you can replace the band with some different
color bands.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:53.460
The back will stay here the battery is non-removable.
However you can also employ protective covers

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.180
like this.
Like this one and you can say this is very

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.680
very tough here.
But for that to apply this protective cover

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.390
on the back you need to replace the default
Band here as well.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:15.980
So this will this basically encalpes the whole
you know back housing here yeah.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:25.040
Apart from that you know what else you have
2390 mAh battery and Snapdragon 1.2Ghz Quadcore

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.160
processor.
You have a VGA camera and on the front and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.810
on the back here 5MP camera but that does
not have LED does not seem to have an LED

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.209
flash there.
You have your ear piece over there and the

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.459
shortcut keys not on the screen effectively
making it less than 4.5inch device.

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.480
You do not have much when you have the protective
cover on.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.439
I will show you on this one nothing much here
micro USB 2.0 Port and that's how you can

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.579
you know take out the band I just found out
yeah.

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:07.469
And then you have the volume rocker the power
button 3.5mm jack and then your 5MP camera

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:14.019
plus noise cancelling mic.
So the Moto E I think it's more you know gear

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.680
towards everyday usage.
Everyday everywhere you know using kind of

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.689
a phone because of the very very tough back
and this material is also.

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.090
It's not gonna retain greases and water for
very long.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.439
And I suppose you can you know wipe those
off very easily.

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:38.390
Similar is the case with the screen out here
yeah.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.879
So that's guys is the Motorola Mote E 2nd
Generation 2015.

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:45.229
Thank you.
