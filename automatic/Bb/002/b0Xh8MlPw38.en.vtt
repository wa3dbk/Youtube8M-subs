before<00:02:14.870> he<00:02:14.960> hit<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.140> ground<00:02:17.350> what<00:02:18.350> an<00:02:18.470> effort

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.760 

one<00:02:26.340> more<00:02:26.550> look<00:02:26.960> he<00:02:27.960> catches<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.530> with<00:02:28.650> his

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
one more look he catches it with his

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.030 
one more look he catches it with his
right<00:02:28.800> hand<00:02:29.160> watch<00:02:29.430> his<00:02:29.670> left<00:02:29.910> elbow<00:02:30.830> hits<00:02:31.830> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
right hand watch his left elbow hits the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.020 
right hand watch his left elbow hits the
ground<00:02:32.250> before<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:33.000> ball<00:02:33.210> does<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:35.030> think

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
ground before the ball does I think

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.410 
ground before the ball does I think
that's<00:02:36.150> gonna<00:02:36.300> stay<00:02:36.600> as<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> touchdown<00:02:37.260> catch<00:02:37.530> I

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
that's gonna stay as a touchdown catch I

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.000 
that's gonna stay as a touchdown catch I
think<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.510> would<00:02:39.630> be<00:02:39.750> tough<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.320> overturn

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
think it would be tough to overturn

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:49.130 
think it would be tough to overturn
that's<00:02:41.370> for<00:02:41.550> sure<00:02:42.680> there's<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.890> elbow
