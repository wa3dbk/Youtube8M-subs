00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:14.219
 so now we have here where much material and that of the very best guest which 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.339
 Using tricks is on the way 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:20.679
 on this part the gmx 5 that I've already tested percent 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.759
 even slightly higher model, the Cayenne x7 these two wheels 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.279
 differ above all things 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.499
 by percent of a times after seatpost in the x5 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.120
 and at the 7 9 gives him an integrated seat post otherwise is 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.060
 the bike a monocoque construction 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.230
 very stiff very light and also over a year mixed with Georgina trains 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.910
 straight behind Nadia Raoui is sitting Rebound the chains are already Arero 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.520
 dynamically optimized 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.010
 Under the great feature so a bit fair-play to the customer 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.500
 Eddy Merckx fir as finally in the catalog, so to speak 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.100
 with the bike and the features also the Middle Eastern s2 Red Fekter al-sor 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.530
 the factor between stiffness and weight of a Gert Hoffmann 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.540
 said Performer's feature is 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.760
 we have here 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.670
 for a wheel, for example, Silverstein lacks the pros of 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700
 Team Quickstep had the opportunity 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.420
 in training camp this model or that he can ride with him 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.660
 Hermann Alber gradually 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.300
 Arc conservatively opted for the percent 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.510
 Ride with the seat post which is classically therefore 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.990
 Tom Boonen, for example, who we can not do any different from the culprit 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.570
 Seatpost in he with 7 otherwise, these two wheels are very similar 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.439
 are percent high-end products 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.369
 and from the manufacturer this year is clearly stated we have in the West 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.150
 Stephanus 2 Red Fekter on our wheels 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.340
 So much for the very sporty variant that here with the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.420
 WÃ¼rttemberg office with the campanologist euro there have it different 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.110
 his 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.690
 but maybe there are also important enemies for the people 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.710
 also want to come from the popular something dignified 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.730
 another variant 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.050
 the gmx 3 this is the 2012 new model so brand new it has not changed much 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.700
 Altered to the proven construction there is now 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.109
 inside is laid for 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:19.819
 which let the frame come out a little finale and a few protectors a 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.699
 This wheel is delivered in 2 variants on the front of the head tube in Belgium 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:29.289
 in Germany, the German customer can look forward to a complete construction costs system 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:33.819
 say Campanologist still strange and how you want it so that he comes 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:34.879
 with three, therefore 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.599
 a feature 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.200
 Good for the people would not just be quite professional on the road 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.939
 are the slightly higher control tube here in front so he is already without it 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:45.529
 better 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:47.200
 Percent very well on the way 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.739
 now, in a big overcoming, Blocher can very much turn himself off 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.459
 so enjoy riding on this bike 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.540
 at the 1 3 5 7 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.240
 choose a number and percent make them something out of it
