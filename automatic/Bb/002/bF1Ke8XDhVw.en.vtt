00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.899 

okay<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.560> just<00:00:01.949> made<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.100> video<00:00:02.250> showing<00:00:02.700> how

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
okay so I just made a video showing how

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.059 
okay so I just made a video showing how
to<00:00:02.939> pop<00:00:03.629> off<00:00:03.780> one<00:00:03.959> of<00:00:03.990> these<00:00:04.110> keys<00:00:04.350> and<00:00:04.770> pop<00:00:04.950> it

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
to pop off one of these keys and pop it

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.829 
to pop off one of these keys and pop it
back<00:00:05.100> on<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.670> possibly<00:00:06.270> end<00:00:06.450> up<00:00:06.600> with

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
back on to possibly end up with

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.080 
back on to possibly end up with
something<00:00:07.200> like<00:00:07.379> this<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.790> didn't<00:00:08.790> take<00:00:08.910> into

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
something like this I didn't take into

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.700 
something like this I didn't take into
account<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.599> fact<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.050> things<00:00:10.230> don't

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
account the fact that things don't

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.470 
account the fact that things don't
always<00:00:10.830> go<00:00:10.980> right<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:12.000> what<00:00:12.120> I'm<00:00:12.179> going<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.330> do

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
always go right so what I'm going to do

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.580 
always go right so what I'm going to do
is<00:00:12.660> I'm<00:00:12.840> going<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.990> pop<00:00:13.170> off<00:00:13.320> one<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.500> these

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
is I'm going to pop off one of these

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.950 
is I'm going to pop off one of these
keys<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.099> we're<00:00:14.730> going<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.059> show<00:00:15.719> how<00:00:15.900> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
keys and we're going to show how the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.490 
keys and we're going to show how the
plastic<00:00:16.470> tabs<00:00:16.680> underneath<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.279> work<00:00:17.490> and

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
plastic tabs underneath it work and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.540 
plastic tabs underneath it work and
hopefully<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.830> case<00:00:20.070> something<00:00:20.369> does<00:00:20.520> go

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
hopefully in case something does go

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.310 
hopefully in case something does go
wrong<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:21.000> might<00:00:21.300> be<00:00:21.420> able<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.630> fix<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.230> from

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
wrong you might be able to fix it from

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.609 
wrong you might be able to fix it from
there

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
there

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.220 
there
so<00:00:22.980> I'm<00:00:23.160> gently<00:00:23.640> pop<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.970> key<00:00:24.119> off<00:00:24.269> there<00:00:24.480> and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
so I'm gently pop the key off there and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.099 
so I'm gently pop the key off there and
we<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:26.160> these<00:00:26.599> really<00:00:27.599> irritating<00:00:28.050> little

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
we have these really irritating little

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.919 
we have these really irritating little
plastic<00:00:29.010> fixtures<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.720> see

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
plastic fixtures you can you can see

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.659 
plastic fixtures you can you can see
that<00:00:30.960> they<00:00:31.170> kind<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.590> flicks<00:00:31.920> up<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.610> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
that they kind of flicks up just a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.370 
that they kind of flicks up just a
little<00:00:32.700> bit<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.180> allow<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.480> key<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.930> pop<00:00:34.170> up

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
little bit to allow the key to pop up

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.850 
little bit to allow the key to pop up
after<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.770> press<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:36.500> I'll<00:00:37.500> see<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:37.800> I

folds over this way and holds on to the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.150 
folds over this way and holds on to the
plastic<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.170> side<00:00:55.379> I'm<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
plastic so on this side I'm going to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.389 
plastic so on this side I'm going to
just<00:00:59.930> pop<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.170> plastic<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.070> there<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.250> go

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
just pop the plastic out and there we go

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.889 
just pop the plastic out and there we go
right<00:01:02.730> outside<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.090> little<00:01:03.300> tiny<00:01:03.510> bracket

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
right outside that little tiny bracket

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.980 
right outside that little tiny bracket
there<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> one<00:01:05.729> side<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.060> up<00:01:06.240> go<00:01:06.810> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
there and so the one side is up go and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.140 
there and so the one side is up go and
pop<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> other<00:01:07.770> side<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> only

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
pop the other side up and now the only

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.460 
pop the other side up and now the only
thing<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.390> holding<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.140> that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
thing is holding it is that little that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.350 
thing is holding it is that little that
will<00:01:10.590> hook<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:10.860> there<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.000> check

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
will hook right there and we can check

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.030 
will hook right there and we can check
and<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.600> lift<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:15.110> plastic<00:01:16.110> tabby

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
and just lift it up so a plastic tabby

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.100 
and just lift it up so a plastic tabby
thing<00:01:17.400> very<00:01:18.150> annoying<00:01:20.570> two<00:01:21.570> separate<00:01:21.960> pieces

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
thing very annoying two separate pieces

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.730 
thing very annoying two separate pieces
that<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.820> case<00:01:24.030> actually<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.500> it's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that in this case actually it's it's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.219 
that in this case actually it's it's
fairly<00:01:26.220> easy<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.790> them<00:01:26.909> apart<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.509> back

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
fairly easy to get them apart and back

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.270 
fairly easy to get them apart and back
together<00:01:28.640> but<00:01:30.530> all<00:01:31.530> we're<00:01:31.799> basically<00:01:32.040> looking

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
together but all we're basically looking

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.100 
together but all we're basically looking
at<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.970> between<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> two<00:01:33.509> pieces

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
at is in between the two pieces

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.800 
at is in between the two pieces
the<00:01:34.439> center<00:01:34.799> piece<00:01:34.920> has<00:01:35.310> two<00:01:35.579> little<00:01:35.810> prongs

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the center piece has two little prongs

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.740 
the center piece has two little prongs
that<00:01:36.960> stick<00:01:37.170> out<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.400> spins<00:01:39.390> on

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
that stick out and so it just spins on

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.990 
that stick out and so it just spins on
the<00:01:40.079> center<00:01:40.350> axis<00:01:40.700> inside<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.880> other

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the center axis inside of the other

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.450 
the center axis inside of the other
piece<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> once<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.040> get<00:01:44.159> those<00:01:44.280> two<00:01:44.430> back

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
piece so once you get those two back

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.210 
piece so once you get those two back
fitting<00:01:45.180> together<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:46.619> way<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:46.950> goes

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
fitting together the way that this goes

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.130 
fitting together the way that this goes
you<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:48.119> basically<00:01:48.360> want<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.780> get<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:48.990> so

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
you just basically want to get it so

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.530 
you just basically want to get it so
that<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:49.530> will<00:01:49.740> sit<00:01:50.460> flat<00:01:52.250> like<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.420> if<00:01:54.420> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
that they will sit flat like that if you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.760 
that they will sit flat like that if you
put<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:54.810> wrong<00:01:54.990> it'll<00:01:55.290> it'll<00:01:55.409> it'll<00:01:55.649> be

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
put it on wrong it'll it'll it'll be

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.130 
put it on wrong it'll it'll it'll be
pretty<00:01:55.890> obvious<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.750> once<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
pretty obvious so once you get the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.319 
pretty obvious so once you get the
plastic<00:01:58.740> things<00:01:58.950> back<00:01:59.369> together<00:01:59.520> you<00:02:00.149> want<00:02:00.299> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
plastic things back together you want to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.510 
plastic things back together you want to
have<00:02:00.450> them<00:02:00.570> these<00:02:00.899> together<00:02:01.290> key<00:02:02.040> separate

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
have them these together key separate

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.109 
have them these together key separate
and<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:03.600> empty<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.890> we'll<00:02:05.009> come<00:02:05.189> across<00:02:05.280> this

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
and this empty so we'll come across this

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.960 
and this empty so we'll come across this
as<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.649> can<00:02:07.799> see<00:02:07.950> we've<00:02:08.129> got<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.459> little

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
as you can see we've got the little

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.490 
as you can see we've got the little
metal<00:02:09.750> hook<00:02:09.899> thing<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.110> was<00:02:10.229> pointing<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
metal hook thing I was pointing to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.020 
metal hook thing I was pointing to
earlier<00:02:10.860> here<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> two<00:02:11.550> separate

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
earlier here and the two separate

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.550 
earlier here and the two separate
brackets<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.720> side

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
brackets on this side

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.640 
brackets on this side
on<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.880> side<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.300> little<00:02:15.510> hook<00:02:15.750> we<00:02:16.470> want

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
on the side with the little hook we want

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.510 
on the side with the little hook we want
to<00:02:16.740> hook<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:18.020> this<00:02:20.900> smaller<00:02:21.950> inside<00:02:22.950> piece<00:02:23.250> of

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
to hook in this smaller inside piece of

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.120 
to hook in this smaller inside piece of
the<00:02:23.820> bracket<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:25.080> sits<00:02:25.380> inside<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.010> other

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
the bracket it sits inside of the other

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.530 
the bracket it sits inside of the other
one<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:28.670> I'll<00:02:29.670> take<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.500> hook<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.680> onto

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
one and I'll take that and hook it onto

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.980 
one and I'll take that and hook it onto
that<00:02:34.130> little<00:02:35.130> hook<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.520> way<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.810> then<00:02:36.959> it

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
that little hook this way and then it

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.699 
that little hook this way and then it
just<00:02:37.170> kind<00:02:37.350> of<00:02:37.380> lays<00:02:37.560> down<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:40.470> get<00:02:40.620> it

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
just kind of lays down and to get it

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.790 
just kind of lays down and to get it
hooked<00:02:40.950> back<00:02:41.520> in<00:02:41.730> again<00:02:42.560> just<00:02:43.560> kind<00:02:43.740> of

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
hooked back in again just kind of

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.430 
hooked back in again just kind of
carefully<00:02:44.240> point<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:45.360> one<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.080> right

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
carefully point this one in the right

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.620 
carefully point this one in the right
direction<00:02:46.590> here<00:02:47.100> might<00:02:47.790> be<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:47.940> little<00:02:48.090> tricky

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
direction here might be a little tricky

00:02:48.630 --> 00:03:03.670 
direction here might be a little tricky
with<00:02:48.750> one<00:02:48.930> hand

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.330 

okay

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.630 

let's<00:03:09.940> see<00:03:10.330> alright<00:03:11.200> one<00:03:11.980> hand<00:03:12.220> makes<00:03:12.430> this

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
let's see alright one hand makes this

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:22.400 
let's see alright one hand makes this
hard

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.050 

hook<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.160> one<00:03:23.310> side

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.850 

pop<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.810> one<00:03:29.930> little<00:03:30.170> hook<00:03:30.290> in<00:03:30.470> right<00:03:30.650> there

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
pop the one little hook in right there

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.260 
pop the one little hook in right there
and<00:03:33.860> this<00:03:34.070> one<00:03:34.250> is<00:03:34.460> right<00:03:34.610> there<00:03:34.790> if<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.150> had

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
and this one is right there if I had

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.490 
and this one is right there if I had
another<00:03:35.510> finger<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.900> just<00:03:36.110> hold<00:03:36.260> this<00:03:36.350> down

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
another finger to just hold this down

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.230 
another finger to just hold this down
that<00:03:36.680> would<00:03:36.800> have<00:03:36.890> been<00:03:36.980> a<00:03:37.010> breeze<00:03:37.250> but<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.090> have

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
that would have been a breeze but I have

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.940 
that would have been a breeze but I have
to<00:03:38.360> use<00:03:38.480> my<00:03:38.660> hand<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.930> hold<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.350> video<00:03:39.620> camera

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
to use my hand to hold the video camera

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.900 
to use my hand to hold the video camera
anyway

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
anyway

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.030 
anyway
that<00:03:41.360> should<00:03:41.780> be<00:03:41.900> really<00:03:42.140> about<00:03:42.320> it<00:03:42.500> once<00:03:42.950> you

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
that should be really about it once you

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.410 
that should be really about it once you
get<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.250> key<00:03:43.400> back<00:03:43.550> on<00:03:43.820> you're<00:03:44.060> looking<00:03:44.330> at

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
get the key back on you're looking at

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.030 
get the key back on you're looking at
the<00:03:44.540> end<00:03:44.570> of<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.020> last<00:03:45.470> video<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.830> I<00:03:45.980> just

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
the end of the last video that I just

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.540 
the end of the last video that I just
shot<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:47.240> we<00:03:47.959> we<00:03:48.560> just<00:03:48.740> want<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:48.950> look<00:03:49.040> again

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
shot and we we just want to look again

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.820 
shot and we we just want to look again
at<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.820> we<00:03:50.270> have<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.480> wide<00:03:50.690> hooks<00:03:51.080> on<00:03:51.380> this

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
at the we have the wide hooks on this

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.240 
at the we have the wide hooks on this
side<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:53.630> that's<00:03:54.200> what<00:03:54.350> we've<00:03:54.470> got<00:03:54.620> on<00:03:54.860> this

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
side and that's what we've got on this

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.160 
side and that's what we've got on this
side<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.580> wide<00:03:55.730> hooks<00:03:55.940> correspond<00:03:56.510> with<00:03:56.630> the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
side the wide hooks correspond with the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.930 
side the wide hooks correspond with the
actual<00:03:57.470> little<00:03:58.010> hook<00:03:58.220> part<00:03:58.459> that<00:03:58.700> was<00:03:58.790> on

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
actual little hook part that was on

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.090 
actual little hook part that was on
there<00:03:59.230> some<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.380> MacBooks<00:04:00.709> are<00:04:00.800> different

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
there some of the MacBooks are different

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.470 
there some of the MacBooks are different
like<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.280> said<00:04:01.430> in<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.580> first<00:04:01.700> video<00:04:01.910> some<00:04:02.450> of

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
like I said in the first video some of

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.970 
like I said in the first video some of
the<00:04:02.540> other<00:04:02.720> keys<00:04:02.900> are<00:04:03.050> different<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.770> same

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
the other keys are different so the same

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.979 
the other keys are different so the same
general<00:04:04.310> idea<00:04:04.520> applies<00:04:05.030> here<00:04:05.300> but<00:04:05.480> it's<00:04:05.840> going

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
general idea applies here but it's going

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.110 
general idea applies here but it's going
to<00:04:06.050> be<00:04:06.170> slightly<00:04:06.410> different<00:04:06.790> anyway<00:04:07.790> look<00:04:08.030> at

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
to be slightly different anyway look at

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.110 
to be slightly different anyway look at
the<00:04:08.239> inside<00:04:08.480> of<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.630> keys<00:04:09.100> and<00:04:10.100> you<00:04:10.790> see<00:04:11.000> that

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
the inside of the keys and you see that

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.810 
the inside of the keys and you see that
the<00:04:11.270> thing-thing<00:04:11.510> hooks<00:04:12.140> on<00:04:12.350> like<00:04:12.920> that<00:04:13.160> so<00:04:13.700> we

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
the thing-thing hooks on like that so we

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:23.330 
the thing-thing hooks on like that so we
want<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.060> put<00:04:14.180> it<00:04:14.270> here<00:04:14.800> slide<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:15.890> on
