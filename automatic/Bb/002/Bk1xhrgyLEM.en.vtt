00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.170
the

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.480
them

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.650
them

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.530
heart Jon Stewart all the things you've
done

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.790
throughout your career you just did
something that's

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.779
a first and that is lives through a
press junket for a movie

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.340
this is the first one mother and I both
went through the press junket on

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.150
Friday Friday different days

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.509
including different days including
Friday beds thats

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.410
that's a key part of the experience is
not knowing what day it took place on

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.260
I'm can you tell us a little bit about
how it was for you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.739
by thing to give you our an idea the
experience of going to the pressure on

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:45.079
it

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.550
like to read something from others book
about being imprisoned in Iran report

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.000
are you getting same questions over and
over and over again

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.059
that's no not at all its fascinating how

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.269
really novel yes they've been

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.390
know it's funny though you do see that
some

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.640
some people among people freelance very
very thoughtful

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.530
is a others have been a little bit more
wrote but as an interviewer

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.920
really has taught me that I should read

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.210
the books it or

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.850
look at the film's because a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.659
I'm starting to think maybe I don't know
how to do this

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.400
I do people ask you what the films about
even though they're supposed to have

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.030
seen

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.259
some people who we get a lot of

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.509
did you do this because you got him
arrested you lot worse that's usually

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.610
the first question is did you do this
cuz you got arrested and I said no I I

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.399
did it for my d-ga card

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.130
I

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.460
the best question we got was that
someone asked us whether the film was

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.390
based on the

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.090
hard copy it was good hardcover or on
the paperback

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.650
could of course our answer was that no
it was either

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.500
based on the Kindle version

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.180
that one was we book and I was like the
opening question ever Press Council will

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.270
collect data like

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.470
stimuli afternoon the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.180
them
