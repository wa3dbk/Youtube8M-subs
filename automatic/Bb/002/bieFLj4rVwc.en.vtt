00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.759
 Hello 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.559
 today it shows you two outfits that are a lot 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.590
 similar to each other but at the same time 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.960
 they are also the opposite of the other in fact 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.939
 the first white dress the second in black 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.849
 the first to the studs the second instead 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.810
 lace is a common element 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.929
 surely the fact that it is 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.919
 two dresses two outfits quite sexy 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:35.430
 both have this throat that goes by 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.110
 fashion for a while now these 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.290
 clothes come from the lobby site 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.060
 wholesale point com that surely between 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.390
 my favorites among the questions they have i 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:51.030
 garments with a higher quality than 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.670
 to others it is certainly among those who 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.860
 they didn't disappoint me at all until 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.900
 now the only flaw of this site is that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.710
 shipping costs unfortunately not 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.140
 they are free therefore definitely 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.719
 we will have to go and spend something in 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:13.799
 in short, everything depends on everything 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:17.369
 how much from the weight the first dress is that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.299
 white that I would never have said but not 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.810
 It is transparent and has a fabric that suits me 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.030
 very reminiscent of the costumes 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.340
 so it's a little bit stretchy though 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.680
 here is not as polished as that of 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.290
 morals 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.660
 I don't know how to explain it but it is a fabric 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.430
 full-bodied beautiful quality in the cups is there 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.900
 also a padding and how you can 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.030
 see are embellished by all these 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.590
 golden studs shown here in 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.660
 details that are real 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.150
 spikes that surely give up a 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.090
 white dress that is very delicate 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.880
 point but give them that aggressive touch 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.649
 here is where I was talking about before 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.390
 and he ordered this dress these 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.580
 shoes that have been sent to me e 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.250
 always from oblivion if they are 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.170
 shoes will have to replace a lot 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.540
 on the site are also available in black 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.190
 this zipper is suede year 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.070
 behind to close the helmet is not 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.940
 very high and I really like this one 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.530
 workmanship that there is on the theme steve 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.489
 ordered to the look of golden accessories 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.410
 and this bracelet in the form of a snake 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.540
 same as the necklace you can wear 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.540
 in different ways because one snakes 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.519
 magnet as it shows you now I am from 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.769
 oviesse if I'm not mistaken bought them in 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.450
 yamaha so I don't know exactly but there 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.890
 seems to remember stino di oviesse has them 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.430
 bought just recently so if you 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.299
 like 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.970
 try here they were also little is mine 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.710
 usual christian watch she make 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.860
 up 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.810
 simple but still the effect with one 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.820
 rather thick dayal row is a 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:09.930
 caught lipstick that I really like 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:14.260
 and here the second look the black dress is 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.810
 certainly more romantic than the first is the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.780
 flywheel has the particularity of being more 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.670
 long behind with this admitted dress 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.410
 to perfection I find I already say to do 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.050
 more attention to size because 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.440
 this one is not elasticized at all 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.960
 so if you don't feel good, it's a mess 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.100
 as you can see behind , read this 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.980
 this ours is the back remains 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.280
 discovery with this applies is the part 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.000
 front on the breast and embellished by this 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.800
 that really wonderful lace is not 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.890
 it is not the usual lace work 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.250
 chiffon that is usually found around is 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.380
 really amazing it looks like 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.380
 having a doily are more powers 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.350
 beautiful lace I can not describe 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.090
 how much I like it and I have this dress 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.210
 seen on other sites too 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.630
 sincerely with the part below the 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.370
 skirt includes flywheel in red 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.680
 while the upper part always in black 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.530
 so if you are looking for some you will find 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.710
 I definitely matched my sandals 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.290
 favorite of a first woman that I think 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:25.810
 are you know that I like it so much I am 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:29.200
 very elegant and perfectly suited 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.310
 with that gorgeous lace of the dress 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.000
 and then this giant bracelet on 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:40.070
 showy is extravagant of christian lei 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.220
 this little ring I took on the beach 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.840
 I have absolutely no value and i 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.750
 earrings always christian lei that yes 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.600
 combine perfectly to trace and 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.070
 certainly also recall embroidery 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.140
 of the dress 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.270
 the trick is always the same because 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.090
 in short it is a passepartout is fine 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.190
 surely with all I hope these 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.740
 two boards that you like and want 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.740
 absolutely know which one you prefer 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.680
 white or black the memory you find 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.080

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.740
