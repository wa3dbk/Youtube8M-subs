my order tanks and I will just

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.870 
my order tanks and I will just
then<00:01:28.580> I'll<00:01:28.760> add<00:01:29.000> it<00:01:29.150> to<00:01:29.180> my<00:01:29.300> new<00:01:29.660> tank

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.760 
then I'll add it to my new tank
beneficial<00:01:31.880> bacteria<00:01:32.080> most<00:01:33.080> of<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.350> time<00:01:33.560> and

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
beneficial bacteria most of the time and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.850 
beneficial bacteria most of the time and
they<00:01:33.830> hang<00:01:34.040> on<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.400> on<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.780> filter<00:01:36.080> but<00:01:36.710> they

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
they hang on it on the filter but they

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.230 
they hang on it on the filter but they
also<00:01:37.040> hang<00:01:37.460> on<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.670> rock<00:01:38.030> strip<00:01:38.450> wood<00:01:38.720> glass

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
also hang on a rock strip wood glass

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.080 
also hang on a rock strip wood glass
substrate<00:01:41.500> when<00:01:42.500> I'm<00:01:42.620> moving<00:01:43.190> you<00:01:43.940> know

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
substrate when I'm moving you know

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.290 
substrate when I'm moving you know
things<00:01:44.810> around<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.440> adding<00:01:45.620> it<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:46.010> my<00:01:46.300> new

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
things around and adding it to my new

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.090 
things around and adding it to my new
tank

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
tank

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.700 
tank
it<00:01:49.100> helps<00:01:49.400> cycle<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.910> tank<00:01:50.090> faster<00:01:50.660> but<00:01:51.500> the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
it helps cycle the tank faster but the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.150 
it helps cycle the tank faster but the
main<00:01:51.920> thing<00:01:52.190> is<00:01:52.490> having<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:54.160> established

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
main thing is having that established

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
main thing is having that established
filter<00:01:56.320> that<00:01:57.320> filter<00:01:57.770> from<00:01:58.040> my<00:01:58.250> established

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
filter that filter from my established

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.900 
filter that filter from my established
tank<00:01:59.450> run<00:02:00.320> for<00:02:00.560> about<00:02:00.740> three<00:02:01.010> days<00:02:01.160> it<00:02:01.640> works

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
tank run for about three days it works

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.530 
tank run for about three days it works
for<00:02:02.180> me<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:02.570> it<00:02:03.440> cycles<00:02:03.710> my<00:02:04.070> tank<00:02:04.369> I've<00:02:05.180> never

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
for me and it cycles my tank I've never

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.350 
for me and it cycles my tank I've never
had<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:05.810> problem<00:02:06.140> with<00:02:06.500> fish<00:02:06.740> dying<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:08.090> it

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
had a problem with fish dying that it

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.900 
had a problem with fish dying that it
works<00:02:08.570> for<00:02:08.750> me<00:02:08.899> so<00:02:09.260> that's<00:02:10.100> how<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:10.310> cycle<00:02:10.820> my

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
works for me so that's how I cycle my

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.760 
works for me so that's how I cycle my
tanks<00:02:11.270> faster<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:11.959> don't<00:02:12.320> have<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.530> make<00:02:12.740> two

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
tanks faster I don't have to make two

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.610 
tanks faster I don't have to make two
