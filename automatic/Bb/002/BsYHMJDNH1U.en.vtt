theories or now some people think that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.640

volt<00:00:27.240> ended<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.869> was<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> first<00:00:28.109> three<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
volt ended that was the first three the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.679 
volt ended that was the first three the
second<00:00:28.980> theory<00:00:29.099> was<00:00:29.429> which<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.910> got<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.480> from

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
second theory was which I got this from

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.359 
second theory was which I got this from
a<00:00:30.960> lot<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.500> other<00:00:31.619> members<00:00:31.980> who<00:00:32.070> ended<00:00:32.250> up

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
a lot of other members who ended up

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.580 
a lot of other members who ended up
leaving<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.850> clan<00:00:33.090> again<00:00:33.930> there<00:00:34.320> was<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> lot

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
leaving the clan again there was a lot

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
leaving the clan again there was a lot
of<00:00:34.620> confusion<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.309> don't<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.969> don't<00:00:36.030> want<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
of confusion so I don't I don't want to

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.000 
of confusion so I don't I don't want to
you<00:00:36.840> know<00:00:36.930> put<00:00:37.110> anything<00:00:37.350> all<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.590> were<00:00:37.800> say

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
you know put anything all that were say

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.170 
you know put anything all that were say
that<00:00:38.160> they<00:00:38.280> were<00:00:38.370> stupid<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.760> take<00:00:39.000> that

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
that they were stupid and take that

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.760 
that they were stupid and take that
because<00:00:39.510> honestly<00:00:40.170> there<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.590> was<00:00:40.680> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
because honestly there was it was a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.110 
because honestly there was it was a
really<00:00:40.890> confusing<00:00:41.100> time<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> lot<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:41.969> more

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
really confusing time a lot of the more

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.040 
really confusing time a lot of the more
a<00:00:42.149> little<00:00:42.270> bit<00:00:42.360> worried<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:42.840> probably

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
a little bit worried and they probably

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.290 
a little bit worried and they probably
left<00:00:43.579> just<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:44.760> they<00:00:44.850> were<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> little<00:00:45.059> bit

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
left just because they were a little bit

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.970 
left just because they were a little bit
worried<00:00:45.510> about<00:00:45.539> what<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:45.930> going<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.860> next

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
worried about what was going on the next

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.950 
worried about what was going on the next
theory<00:00:47.280> was<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.360> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.690> taking

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
theory was that I was going to be taking

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.510 
theory was that I was going to be taking
over<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> channel<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.620> uploading<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.129> ball<00:00:50.309> a

whole bunch of weird random videos and I

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.600

even<00:00:52.410> made<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> joke<00:00:52.890> about<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.309> Twitter

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610

better montage or mini Taj Messiah that

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.760 
better montage or mini Taj Messiah that
would<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.759> really<00:01:48.420> sick<00:01:48.840> idea<00:01:49.170> for<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> series

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
would be a really sick idea for a series

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.350 
would be a really sick idea for a series
so<00:01:49.860> not<00:01:50.040> only<00:01:50.159> would<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.119> pub

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
so not only would you get the pub

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.120 
so not only would you get the pub
stopping<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.960> know<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.229> double<00:01:52.560> DNA<00:01:52.890> bombs

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130

the<00:01:53.310> DNA<00:01:53.640> bombs<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:54.060> really<00:01:54.329> weird<00:01:54.840> weapons

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the DNA bombs with really weird weapons

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.660 
the DNA bombs with really weird weapons
that<00:01:55.470> people<00:01:55.770> aren't<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.100> seeing<00:01:56.340> DNA

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that people aren't really seeing DNA

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.700 
that people aren't really seeing DNA
bombs<00:01:56.909> with<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.689> you're<00:01:57.840> also<00:01:58.079> going<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.530> get

bombs with but you're also going to get
stuff<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.219> which<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.670> stuff<00:02:00.000> that's

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
stuff like that which is stuff that's

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.760 
stuff like that which is stuff that's
outside<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.780> box<00:02:00.990> instead<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.560> being

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
outside of the box instead of just being

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.639 
outside of the box instead of just being

the regular pumps topic videos 24-7
every<00:02:05.040> single<00:02:05.219> day<00:02:05.369> all<00:02:05.549> year<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.570> would<00:02:06.719> be

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
every single day all year it would be

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.969 
every single day all year it would be
something<00:02:07.079> that's<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.409> little<00:02:07.500> bit<00:02:07.710> different

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
something that's a little bit different

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.559 
something that's a little bit different
to<00:02:08.039> kind<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.250> hype<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.700> more<00:02:08.970> call<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.330> duty

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
to kind of hype up more call of duty

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.059 
to kind of hype up more call of duty
apart<00:02:09.929> from<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.200> one<00:02:10.410> really<00:02:10.560> quickly<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:10.950> we

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
apart from this one really quickly so we

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.960 
apart from this one really quickly so we
mentioned

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
mentioned

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.490 
mentioned
you<00:02:12.060> mentioned<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.510> one<00:02:12.690> right<00:02:12.810> there<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
you mentioned that one right there the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.560 
you mentioned that one right there the
idea<00:02:13.830> for<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> dual<00:02:14.700> Tosh<00:02:15.000> type<00:02:15.300> thing<00:02:15.540> where

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
idea for a dual Tosh type thing where

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.660 
idea for a dual Tosh type thing where
they<00:02:15.810> compete<00:02:15.990> for<00:02:16.350> clips<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:17.100> members<00:02:17.490> which

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
they compete for clips to members which

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.370 
they compete for clips to members which
would<00:02:17.820> be<00:02:17.910> completely<00:02:18.240> random<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:19.200> would<00:02:19.320> also

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
would be completely random it would also

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.380 
would be completely random it would also
be<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.680> series<00:02:20.130> that's<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.430> top<00:02:20.700> five<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.210> would

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
be a series that's a top five but would

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.650 
be a series that's a top five but would
be<00:02:21.420> exclusive<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.410> members<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.480> bolts<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.570> it'd

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
be exclusive to members of bolts so it'd

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.030 
be exclusive to members of bolts so it'd
be<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> pretty<00:02:24.990> cool<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:25.500> again<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.950> would

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
be a pretty cool and so again it would

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.070 
be a pretty cool and so again it would
be<00:02:26.130> like<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.310> challenge<00:02:26.640> type<00:02:27.120> series<00:02:27.420> where

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
be like a challenge type series where

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.540 
be like a challenge type series where
the<00:02:28.320> team<00:02:28.500> would<00:02:28.620> go<00:02:28.800> for<00:02:29.040> clip<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.460> would

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
the team would go for clip so it would

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.520 
the team would go for clip so it would
be<00:02:29.700> like<00:02:29.850> top<00:02:30.270> five<00:02:30.300> shotgun<00:02:31.020> clips<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
be like top five shotgun clips of the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.770 
be like top five shotgun clips of the
week<00:02:31.710> or<00:02:31.950> top<00:02:32.520> five<00:02:32.730> shotgun<00:02:33.240> cliffs<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.630> know

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.210 
week or top five shotgun cliffs you know
it<00:02:33.960> might<00:02:34.080> not<00:02:34.110> be<00:02:34.260> weekly<00:02:34.740> since<00:02:34.980> these<00:02:35.100> are

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
it might not be weekly since these are

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.260 
it might not be weekly since these are
going<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.370> be<00:02:35.430> challenges<00:02:35.880> might<00:02:36.030> be<00:02:36.120> like

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
going to be challenges might be like

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.480 
going to be challenges might be like
bi-weekly<00:02:36.810> maybe<00:02:37.410> once<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.830> month<00:02:37.860> now

want<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.640> see<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.060> then<00:02:48.360> we<00:02:48.450> would<00:02:48.570> make<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.900> top

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
want to see and then we would make a top

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.650 
want to see and then we would make a top
five<00:02:49.440> or<00:02:49.680> maybe<00:02:49.800> even<00:02:49.950> top<00:02:50.430> 10<00:02:50.670> plays<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.510> show

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
five or maybe even top 10 plays to show

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.300 
five or maybe even top 10 plays to show
you<00:02:51.720> guys<00:02:51.840> what<00:02:52.200> are<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.500> best<00:02:52.740> clips<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.190> we

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
you guys what are the best clips that we

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.220 
you guys what are the best clips that we
got<00:02:53.520> throwing<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.000> life<00:02:54.209> span<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.900> thought

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
got throwing that life span so I thought

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.140 
got throwing that life span so I thought
that'd<00:02:55.440> be<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> really<00:02:55.890> cool<00:02:56.190> idea<00:02:56.340> along<00:02:56.910> from

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
that'd be a really cool idea along from

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.460 
that'd be a really cool idea along from
doing<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.540> we'd<00:02:57.750> be<00:02:57.870> doing<00:02:57.990> like<00:02:58.200> live

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
doing that we'd be doing like live

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.050 
doing that we'd be doing like live
streams<00:02:58.860> where<00:02:59.010> we're<00:02:59.190> going<00:02:59.459> for<00:02:59.610> clips<00:02:59.880> and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
streams where we're going for clips and

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.060 
streams where we're going for clips and
stuff<00:03:00.209> members<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.750> clan<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.740> figured

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
stuff members of the clan and I figured

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.470 
stuff members of the clan and I figured
that<00:03:02.250> doing<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:02.760> kind<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.090> stuff<00:03:03.209> that's

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
that doing this kind of stuff that's

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.180 
that doing this kind of stuff that's
outside<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.170> box<00:03:04.380> outside<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.010> mold

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
outside of the box outside of the mold

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.190 
outside of the box outside of the mold
and<00:03:05.430> again<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.150> would<00:03:06.270> not<00:03:06.540> be<00:03:06.570> taken<00:03:07.020> over

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
and again that would not be taken over

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.930 
and again that would not be taken over
the<00:03:07.320> channel<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.800> would<00:03:07.920> not<00:03:08.070> be<00:03:08.250> like<00:03:08.490> you

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
the channel it would not be like you

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.640 
the channel it would not be like you
know<00:03:08.970> every<00:03:09.390> single<00:03:09.750> day<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.140> top<00:03:10.410> five

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
below I just you know have ideas that

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.030 
below I just you know have ideas that
we've<00:03:54.630> been<00:03:54.750> tossing<00:03:54.959> around<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.620> we<00:03:55.709> figured

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
we've been tossing around and we figured

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.590 
we've been tossing around and we figured
that<00:03:56.070> you<00:03:56.610> know<00:03:56.670> if<00:03:56.820> we<00:03:56.940> do<00:03:57.120> something<00:03:57.330> that's

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
that you know if we do something that's

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.699 
that you know if we do something that's
out<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.989> norm<00:03:58.230> that's<00:03:58.440> still

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
out of the norm that's still

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.170 
out of the norm that's still
entertaining<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.519> is<00:03:59.640> still<00:03:59.880> something

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
entertaining that is still something

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.940 
entertaining that is still something
that<00:04:00.330> would<00:04:00.570> make<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.870> guys<00:04:00.989> maybe<00:04:01.290> even<00:04:01.590> feel

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
that would make you guys maybe even feel

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.039

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
other clans the reason being that I feel

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.250 
other clans the reason being that I feel
like<00:04:33.460> we<00:04:33.640> as<00:04:33.850> clans<00:04:34.360> are<00:04:34.540> always<00:04:34.840> limiting

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
like we as clans are always limiting

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.020

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
carnage you know even though it's not a

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.090 
carnage you know even though it's not a
set<00:04:40.660> rule<00:04:40.930> that<00:04:41.110> kind<00:04:41.260> of<00:04:41.350> feels<00:04:41.500> like<00:04:41.650> people

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
set rule that kind of feels like people

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.650 
set rule that kind of feels like people
just<00:04:42.370> kind<00:04:42.460> of<00:04:42.550> divide<00:04:42.940> each<00:04:43.090> other<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.510> put

just kind of divide each other and put

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.360 
just kind of divide each other and put

walls between each other and it kind of

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.060 
walls between each other and it kind of
prevents<00:04:45.910> growth<00:04:46.240> all<00:04:46.750> across<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.320> board<00:04:47.350> so

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
prevents growth all across the board so

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.710 
prevents growth all across the board so
I<00:04:48.370> feel<00:04:48.610> like<00:04:48.640> it's<00:04:48.820> gonna<00:04:48.940> be<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.120> really<00:04:49.360> smart
