I<00:00:03.390> want<00:00:04.390> to<00:00:04.480> show<00:00:04.630> you<00:00:04.770> how<00:00:05.770> many<00:00:05.830> frames<00:00:06.310> per

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:06.640 
I want to show you how many frames per

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
I want to show you how many frames per
second<00:00:07.029> this<00:00:08.019> new<00:00:08.410> the<00:00:08.740> mark<00:00:08.950> four<00:00:09.250> does<00:00:09.940> so

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660 
second this new the mark four does so

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.780 
second this new the mark four does so
what<00:00:11.049> I've<00:00:11.200> done<00:00:11.410> is<00:00:11.469> basically<00:00:11.860> I've<00:00:12.400> put<00:00:12.670> it

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
what I've done is basically I've put it

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.150 
what I've done is basically I've put it
I've<00:00:13.089> removed<00:00:13.450> the<00:00:13.599> cards<00:00:14.049> so<00:00:14.379> it's<00:00:14.889> better

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
I've removed the cards so it's better

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.410 
I've removed the cards so it's better
well<00:00:15.459> suited<00:00:16.270> for<00:00:16.299> for<00:00:17.260> the<00:00:17.350> test<00:00:17.650> and<00:00:17.920> then

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
well suited for for the test and then

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.519 
well suited for for the test and then
I'm<00:00:19.420> going<00:00:19.689> to<00:00:19.720> put<00:00:20.619> the<00:00:20.859> the<00:00:21.310> ISO<00:00:21.760> at<00:00:21.970> six

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
I'm going to put the the ISO at six

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.410 
I'm going to put the the ISO at six
thousand<00:00:23.529> four<00:00:23.680> hundred<00:00:23.830> and<00:00:24.220> two<00:00:24.849> thousand

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
thousand four hundred and two thousand

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:35.490 
thousand four hundred and two thousand
by<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:27.039> the<00:00:27.630> shutter<00:00:28.630> speed<00:00:28.840> the<00:00:34.050> next<00:00:35.050> thing

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
by the the shutter speed the next thing

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.790 
by the the shutter speed the next thing
I<00:00:35.710> wanted<00:00:35.950> to<00:00:36.010> test<00:00:36.309> it<00:00:36.489> was<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:41.230> speed<00:00:41.590> of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
I wanted to test it was the the speed of

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.330 
I wanted to test it was the the speed of
the<00:00:41.920> camera<00:00:42.100> so<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:44.110> you<00:00:44.289> may<00:00:44.469> recall<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.890> mark

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
the camera so as you may recall the mark

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.639 
the camera so as you may recall the mark
three<00:00:45.670> or<00:00:46.090> in<00:00:46.629> case<00:00:46.870> you<00:00:46.989> do<00:00:47.140> you<00:00:47.289> don't<00:00:47.410> know

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
three or in case you do you don't know

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.350 
three or in case you do you don't know
at<00:00:48.579> high<00:00:48.910> ISO<00:00:49.920> what<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:51.070> does<00:00:51.340> it<00:00:51.699> gets<00:00:52.030> very

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
at high ISO what it does it gets very

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.229 
at high ISO what it does it gets very
slow<00:00:52.989> so<00:00:53.379> basically<00:00:54.280> what<00:00:54.520> I'm<00:00:54.670> going<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:55.000> do

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
slow so basically what I'm going to do

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.290 
slow so basically what I'm going to do
is<00:00:55.420> I'm<00:00:55.750> going<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:56.079> put<00:00:56.350> it<00:00:56.440> on<00:00:56.770> two<00:00:57.730> thousand

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
is I'm going to put it on two thousand

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.319 
is I'm going to put it on two thousand
speed<00:00:59.050> with<00:00:59.410> a<00:00:59.440> higher<00:00:59.920> source<00:01:00.250> thousand<00:01:01.149> four

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
speed with a higher source thousand four

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:13.580 
speed with a higher source thousand four
hundred<00:01:01.480> let's<00:01:01.960> hear<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.829> mark<00:01:03.430> four

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.880 

well<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> mark<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.149> now<00:01:16.110> let's<00:01:16.680> get

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
well this is the mark for now let's get

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.560 
well this is the mark for now let's get
the<00:01:17.130> mark<00:01:17.700> three<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> same<00:01:19.350> okay<00:01:19.770> so

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
the mark three and do the same okay so

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:37.999 
the mark three and do the same okay so
it<00:01:21.570> has<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:23.479> 6400<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.560> I've<00:01:37.710> done<00:01:37.950> is

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
it has the 6400 so what I've done is

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.120 
it has the 6400 so what I've done is
that<00:01:38.250> I've<00:01:38.520> removed<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.600> card<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.530> we

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
that I've removed the card so that we

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.359 
that I've removed the card so that we
don't<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.939> some<00:01:42.570> misleads<00:01:43.369> information

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
don't have some misleads information

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.719 
don't have some misleads information
here<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.789> card<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.319> this<00:01:46.679> would<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.920> a

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
here on the card so this this would be a

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.889 
here on the card so this this would be a
much<00:01:48.030> better<00:01:48.060> way<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.250> telling<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.600> speed<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
much better way of telling the speed and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.559 
much better way of telling the speed and
the<00:01:52.350> processor<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.159> two-digit<00:01:54.119> force

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
the processor of the two-digit force

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.980 
the processor of the two-digit force
they<00:01:54.869> are<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.409> under<00:01:55.890> mark<00:01:56.100> four<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.840> as

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
they are on the under mark four so as

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.190 
they are on the under mark four so as
you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.319> see<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.709> is<00:01:58.950> very<00:01:58.979> very<00:01:59.549> very<00:01:59.789> fast

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
you can see this is very very very fast

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.589 
you can see this is very very very fast
let's<00:02:01.280> put<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.580> test<00:02:02.819> on<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> field<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:03.599 
let's put it the test on the field and

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.760 
let's put it the test on the field and
I'll<00:02:03.810> let<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.289> know<00:02:04.319> later<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:06.409> lot<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.530> things

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
I'll let you know later a lot of things

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.160 
I'll let you know later a lot of things
that<00:02:07.950> has<00:02:08.280> been<00:02:08.489> said<00:02:08.789> about<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.299> the<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.840> is

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170
