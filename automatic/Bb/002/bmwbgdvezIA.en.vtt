taken on hockey Empire in which they

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.740 
taken on hockey Empire in which they
first<00:01:23.490> backed<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.970> when<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.240> was<00:01:24.270> five<00:01:24.570> on

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
first backed out when it was five on

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.660 
first backed out when it was five on
five<00:01:25.049> because<00:01:25.680> they<00:01:25.830> didn't<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.159> our<00:01:26.340> stats

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
five because they didn't like our stats

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.730 
five because they didn't like our stats
and<00:01:27.000> then<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.540> played<00:01:27.840> us<00:01:27.990> when<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.320> had<00:01:28.470> four

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
and then they played us when we had four

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.770 
and then they played us when we had four
and<00:01:28.979> they<00:01:29.130> had<00:01:29.280> five<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:30.180> whooped<00:01:30.540> them

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and they had five and we whooped them

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.810 
and they had five and we whooped them
and<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.439> they<00:01:31.619> disbanded<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.369> club<00:01:32.549> because

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and then they disbanded the club because

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.460 
and then they disbanded the club because
I<00:01:32.880> guess<00:01:33.180> they<00:01:33.329> were<00:01:33.390> fed<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:33.869> losses<00:01:34.320> all

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
I guess they were fed up with losses all
