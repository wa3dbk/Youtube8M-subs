Oh

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.409 

I'm<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:46.039> reason<00:04:46.190> why<00:04:46.490> I<00:04:46.520> want<00:04:46.850> to<00:04:46.940> use<00:04:47.060> guitar

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
I'm the reason why I want to use guitar

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.140 
I'm the reason why I want to use guitar
is<00:04:47.660> because<00:04:48.669> guitar<00:04:49.669> is<00:04:49.789> a<00:04:49.850> well-known

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
is because guitar is a well-known

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.050 
is because guitar is a well-known
instrument<00:04:50.930> out<00:04:51.080> there<00:04:51.289> in<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.440> whole<00:04:51.650> world

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
instrument out there in the whole world

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.480 
instrument out there in the whole world
so<00:04:53.060> a<00:04:53.419> guy<00:04:53.660> would<00:04:53.720> immediately<00:04:54.440> recognize<00:04:55.310> it

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
so a guy would immediately recognize it

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.140 
so a guy would immediately recognize it
if<00:04:55.759> a<00:04:55.880> guy<00:04:56.030> sees<00:04:56.210> a<00:04:56.270> girl<00:04:56.449> playing<00:04:56.750> guitar<00:04:58.150> it's

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
if a guy sees a girl playing guitar it's

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.180 
if a guy sees a girl playing guitar it's
sometimes<00:04:59.389> very<00:04:59.690> very<00:05:00.050> rare<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.800> see<00:05:00.830> a<00:05:01.009> girl

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
sometimes very very rare to see a girl

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.680 
sometimes very very rare to see a girl
playing<00:05:01.460> guitar<00:05:01.759> so<00:05:01.940> so<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.330> guy<00:05:02.479> would

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
playing guitar so so the guy would

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.270 
playing guitar so so the guy would
immediately<00:05:02.930> start<00:05:03.440> talking<00:05:03.889> to<00:05:03.979> you<00:05:04.069> and
