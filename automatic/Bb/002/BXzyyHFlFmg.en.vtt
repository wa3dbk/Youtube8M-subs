U<00:03:38.209> has<00:03:38.329> got<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:38.599> technology<00:03:38.810> built<00:03:39.410> into<00:03:39.709> the

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
U has got that technology built into the

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.770 
U has got that technology built into the
gamepad<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.669> all<00:03:40.940> you<00:03:41.030> do<00:03:41.120> these<00:03:41.299> is<00:03:41.569> touch

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
gamepad so all you do these is touch

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.509 
gamepad so all you do these is touch
them<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.109> controller<00:03:42.470> with<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.220> screen

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
them to the controller with the screen

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.610 
them to the controller with the screen
on<00:03:43.669> it<00:03:43.819> okay<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.569> know<00:03:44.930> in<00:03:45.049> the<00:03:45.139> game<00:03:45.319> you<00:03:45.440> don't

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
on it okay I know in the game you don't

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.900 
on it okay I know in the game you don't
have<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.799> buy<00:03:45.919> separately<00:03:46.250> for<00:03:46.609> so<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:46.760> makes

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
have to buy separately for so it makes

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.490 
have to buy separately for so it makes
it<00:03:47.000> cheaper<00:03:47.120> but<00:03:47.510> also<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.049> needs<00:03:48.079> this<00:03:48.260> less

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
it cheaper but also it needs this less

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.379 
it cheaper but also it needs this less
plastic<00:03:49.130> junk<00:03:49.340> having<00:03:49.849> to<00:03:49.910> be<00:03:50.000> plugged<00:03:50.120> in

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
plastic junk having to be plugged in

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.909 
plastic junk having to be plugged in
around<00:03:50.569> sitting<00:03:50.840> yeah<00:03:51.169> you<00:03:51.440> don't<00:03:51.590> want<00:03:51.799> to

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
around sitting yeah you don't want to

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.729 
around sitting yeah you don't want to
that<00:03:52.310> was<00:03:52.459> one<00:03:52.669> of<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.910> things<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:54.380> have<00:03:54.590> to

have<00:03:54.859> that<00:03:55.010> separate<00:03:55.609> peripherals<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.180> put<00:03:56.419> it

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
have that separate peripherals to put it

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.930 
have that separate peripherals to put it
on<00:03:56.629> to<00:03:57.410> be<00:03:57.560> able<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.829> read<00:03:58.069> and<00:03:58.459> then<00:03:58.579> get<00:03:58.819> the

little game testers had little play with

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.870 
little game testers had little play with
these<00:05:21.990> so<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.770> what<00:05:23.160> and<00:05:23.310> what<00:05:23.340> are<00:05:23.520> they<00:05:23.639> was

these so and what and what are they was

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.610 
these so and what and what are they was
their<00:05:24.060> verdict<00:05:24.360> so<00:05:24.510> far<00:05:24.750> they<00:05:25.169> liked<00:05:25.349> it<00:05:25.500> they

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
their verdict so far they liked it they

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.129 
their verdict so far they liked it they
really<00:05:26.010> got<00:05:26.160> into<00:05:26.310> playing<00:05:27.180> more<00:05:27.570> with<00:05:27.930> him

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
really got into playing more with him

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.150 
really got into playing more with him
right<00:05:28.289> they<00:05:28.380> wouldn't<00:05:28.560> start<00:05:28.830> a<00:05:28.860> game<00:05:29.010> that

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
right they wouldn't start a game that

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.980 
right they wouldn't start a game that
went<00:05:29.250> by<00:05:29.460> Mary<00:05:29.639> is<00:05:29.789> not<00:05:29.940> in<00:05:30.090> they<00:05:30.539> wanted<00:05:30.840> him

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
went by Mary is not in they wanted him

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.659 
went by Mary is not in they wanted him
to<00:05:31.020> fight<00:05:31.349> so<00:05:31.800> that<00:05:31.950> he<00:05:32.039> could<00:05:32.160> get<00:05:32.250> leveled<00:05:32.580> up

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
to fight so that he could get leveled up

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.400 
to fight so that he could get leveled up
and<00:05:32.789> silly<00:05:33.270> because<00:05:33.450> they<00:05:33.780> could<00:05:33.930> develop<00:05:34.080> him

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
and silly because they could develop him

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.440 
and silly because they could develop him
so<00:05:34.650> I<00:05:34.710> think<00:05:34.800> this<00:05:34.979> is<00:05:35.190> quite<00:05:35.820> different<00:05:36.270> but

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
so I think this is quite different but

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.779 
so I think this is quite different but
once<00:05:36.630> there<00:05:36.810> looks<00:05:36.960> it<00:05:37.050> clicked<00:05:37.380> now<00:05:38.070> it<00:05:38.520> able

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
once there looks it clicked now it able

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.010 
once there looks it clicked now it able
to<00:05:38.849> mend<00:05:39.030> these<00:05:39.150> characters<00:05:39.630> are<00:05:39.750> ones<00:05:39.900> they

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
to mend these characters are ones they

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.690 
to mend these characters are ones they
carry<00:05:40.260> around<00:05:40.349> with<00:05:40.530> them<00:05:40.740> I<00:05:40.830> have<00:05:40.950> turn<00:05:41.160> there

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
carry around with them I have turn there

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.100 
carry around with them I have turn there

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
keep these clothes in the way that they

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.000 
keep these clothes in the way that they
haven't<00:05:48.870> I<00:05:49.050> haven't<00:05:49.199> seen<00:05:49.380> really<00:05:49.500> do<00:05:49.680> that<00:05:49.830> as

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
haven't I haven't seen really do that as

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.589 
haven't I haven't seen really do that as
much<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.699> Skylanders<00:05:51.090> of<00:05:51.270> Disney<00:05:51.510> infinity

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
much the Skylanders of Disney infinity

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.200 
much the Skylanders of Disney infinity
actually<00:05:52.410> you<00:05:52.860> find<00:05:53.310> that<00:05:53.490> back<00:05:53.669> you<00:05:53.940> want<00:05:54.120> to

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
actually you find that back you want to

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.909 
actually you find that back you want to
keep<00:05:54.449> them<00:05:54.599> on<00:05:54.660> their<00:05:54.840> person<00:05:55.199> more<00:05:55.380> know

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
keep them on their person more know

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.560 
keep them on their person more know
where<00:05:56.099> they<00:05:56.190> are<00:05:56.220> carry<00:05:56.880> them<00:05:57.000> around<00:05:57.120> a<00:05:57.419> bit

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
where they are carry them around a bit

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.180 
where they are carry them around a bit
more<00:05:57.720> with<00:05:57.840> them<00:05:57.990> okay<00:05:58.289> why<00:05:58.889> do<00:05:58.949> you<00:05:59.070> think

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
more with them okay why do you think

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.580 
more with them okay why do you think
that<00:05:59.280> is<00:05:59.490> over<00:05:59.910> over<00:06:00.330> something<00:06:00.720> like<00:06:01.020> is<00:06:01.470> me

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
that is over over something like is me

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.860 
that is over over something like is me
opening<00:06:01.889> to<00:06:01.979> your<00:06:02.099> experiment<00:06:03.030> I<00:06:03.270> think<00:06:03.419> it

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
opening to your experiment I think it

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.270 
opening to your experiment I think it
partly<00:06:04.260> is<00:06:04.410> the<00:06:04.530> fact<00:06:04.740> that<00:06:04.830> they<00:06:04.979> know<00:06:05.160> that

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
partly is the fact that they know that

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.100 
partly is the fact that they know that
they're<00:06:05.400> gonna<00:06:05.490> go<00:06:05.669> on<00:06:05.699> living<00:06:06.210> game<00:06:06.780> to<00:06:06.930> game

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
they're gonna go on living game to game

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.230 
they're gonna go on living game to game
and<00:06:07.349> there's<00:06:08.310> not<00:06:08.490> going<00:06:08.639> to<00:06:08.699> be<00:06:08.760> you<00:06:09.030> buy<00:06:09.180> this

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
and there's not going to be you buy this

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.120 
and there's not going to be you buy this
novelty<00:06:09.780> toy<00:06:10.050> for<00:06:10.289> one<00:06:10.440> game<00:06:10.620> then<00:06:10.889> you<00:06:10.979> move

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
novelty toy for one game then you move

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.500 
novelty toy for one game then you move
on<00:06:11.370> they've<00:06:11.580> seen<00:06:11.760> a<00:06:11.820> number<00:06:11.970> of<00:06:12.150> rounds<00:06:12.389> of

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
on they've seen a number of rounds of

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.540 
on they've seen a number of rounds of
subscribers<00:06:13.139> they<00:06:13.380> used<00:06:13.590> to<00:06:13.860> get<00:06:14.310> your<00:06:14.460> new

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
subscribers they used to get your new

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.040 
subscribers they used to get your new
figure<00:06:14.820> playing<00:06:15.210> a<00:06:15.270> bit<00:06:15.419> enjoying<00:06:15.690> it<00:06:15.870> and

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
figure playing a bit enjoying it and

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.900 
figure playing a bit enjoying it and
then<00:06:16.260> moving<00:06:16.470> on<00:06:16.710> but<00:06:17.340> also<00:06:17.520> I<00:06:17.639> think<00:06:17.729> that

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
then moving on but also I think that

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.270 
then moving on but also I think that
they<00:06:18.120> know<00:06:18.330> these<00:06:18.539> characters<00:06:18.860> from<00:06:19.860> a<00:06:20.070> long

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
they know these characters from a long

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.950 
they know these characters from a long
time<00:06:20.490> ago<00:06:20.699> so<00:06:20.970> in<00:06:21.060> a<00:06:21.090> similar<00:06:21.330> way<00:06:21.360> to<00:06:21.479> Disney

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
time ago so in a similar way to Disney

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.300 
time ago so in a similar way to Disney
that<00:06:22.349> these<00:06:22.590> are<00:06:22.770> characters<00:06:23.070> that<00:06:23.190> they've

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
that these are characters that they've

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.740 
that these are characters that they've
got<00:06:23.520> a<00:06:23.550> relationship<00:06:23.820> of<00:06:24.180> already<00:06:24.419> and<00:06:24.630> now

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
got a relationship of already and now

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.810 
got a relationship of already and now
that's<00:06:24.990> the<00:06:25.169> first<00:06:25.410> time<00:06:25.710> they've<00:06:26.460> got<00:06:26.700> the

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
that's the first time they've got the

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.800 
that's the first time they've got the
help<00:06:27.060> figure

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
help figure

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.450 
help figure
and<00:06:28.810> so<00:06:29.380> there's<00:06:29.530> that<00:06:29.590> strong<00:06:29.890> bond<00:06:30.070> so

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
and so there's that strong bond so

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.920 
and so there's that strong bond so
they're<00:06:30.610> identifying<00:06:31.330> with<00:06:31.570> it<00:06:31.630> because

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
they're identifying with it because

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.720 
they're identifying with it because
