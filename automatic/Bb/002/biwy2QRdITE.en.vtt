00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.879
 good afternoon dear friends with you i am 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.980
 Irina wine berger and site knit on Neva 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.950
 today I will show you how to knit double 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.590
 a hat with earflaps on a knitting machine 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.859
 two on other knitting machines and her 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.789
 You can also knit the hat 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.160
 one piece then stitches time 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.760
 required to perform this model 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.310
 two hours for knitting and the same for 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.790
 stitching 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:36.090
 yarn consumption for caps 56 size 250 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.570
 grams of them 200 grams of wool blend 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.010
 210 meters of yarn in 50 grams 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:48.420
 it is used in 2 additions with me and 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:51.000
 50 grams of fine knit yarn 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.899
 This cap is not recommended as in 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 In this case, the cap will not keep the shape 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.070
 The main viscous cap is either 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.100
 front or back surface 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.670
 depending on which way you are 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 planning to decorate the cuffs on the cap 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.030
 Of these methods, the set all depends on 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.090
 of your taste and desire it may be 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.820
 just yarn of a different color here you are 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.409
 You can see that the main viscous cap 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.520
 is the facial surface it can be 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.159
 imitation fur 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.560
 as the fur is visible only from the purl 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.979
 hand knitting then and the main knitting 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.890
 caps in this case will be 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.110
 wrong surface or as in my 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.850
 the case is just weed here as well 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.659
 the main viscous will be 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.060
 seamy surface usually when knitting 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.060
 weed hairiness is distributed 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.460
 evenly on both sides of knitting but it 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.799
 only if knit through 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.380
 one needle that is to do the canvas 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.799
 enough ryh but since the canvas in 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.090
 this model is loose to have the right 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.030
 have to knit on all needles 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.760
 and lose hairiness on the face 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.800
 the side is why the main account 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.350
 mating in this case use 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.060
 wrong side 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.090
 if someone wants to have a plain hat 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.670
 then decorate the cuffs can be embossed 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.340
 patterns whose examples can be easily 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.330
 find on the internet in particular and on my 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.300
 site on the page relief patterns for 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.950
 calculating the scheme you will need two measurements 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:35.040
 head circumference in my case is 56 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.790
 centimeters and distance from eyebrow line 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.020
 to the top or the back of my head this 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.940
 respectively 19 cm 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.300
 scheme caps you can download from my 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.730
 site is a clean template that you 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.070
 you can print and write your own in it 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.320
 measurements 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.959
 horizontally set aside 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.540
 head circumference minus 46 centimeters 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.790
 for a snug fit there look 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.060
 yourself how tight and your mating will be 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.220
 and distribute vertically 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.860
 distance from the eyebrows to the crown 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.680
 about half the height 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.620
 the main part of the cap and the height of the wedge 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.700
 the length of the cuffs is calculated as follows 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.090
 way divided and the length of the cap into 3 parts 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.060
 one third is set aside half the back 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.120
 lapel with left ear one third to 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.340
 lapel for forehead and one third 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.610
 half rear cuff with right 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.489
 ear flap width 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.950
 centimeters less than the height of the main part 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.730
 caps number of rows 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.269
 hats ear should be equal to the sum of rows 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.030
 the main part of the cap and the wedge that is 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.600
 if the height of the main part of the cap and 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.790
 wedge make up 70 rows then and ear 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.430
 must 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.980
 knitted on 70 rows otherwise ears on 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.860
 the top of the head will not be able to tie the cord 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.900
 points and this is an auxiliary table 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.930
 will help me not to get confused when 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.100
 vyvyazyvanii wedges 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.510
 here in the posts first client 2 3 4 i 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.280
 pencil or pen will celebrate 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.970
 which item 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.480
 made in the column with grandma loops I 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.330
 having calculated in advance how much 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.580
 loops on which row I will add 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.700
 Well, it seems, and everything goes to 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.700
 knitting
