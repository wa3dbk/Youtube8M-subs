00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.359
 entry 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:12.489
 for recall exhibition tried at the store is an object to present itself 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:16.980
 a series of assignments I still have so much mirrors 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.599
 the giant has arrived 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.730
 % 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.150
 inside the landscape in front of work of m there are almost 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.300
 so three years 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.300
 before i arrive this blog 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.620
 I am very interested in building structures 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.230
 architectural 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.270
 while he was doing structures then I was building structures 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.980
 architectural super complex 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.080
 with hidden spaces inside the corridors of the little ones 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.360
 corridors of the islands 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.550
 stairs 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.489
 and I used this structure as a presentation structure 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.359
 for all classified the objects is at stake that seemed 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.930
 but I never imagined these objects as m 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.670
 n I called energy generators so it was about 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.320
 simple as 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.320
 organs inside a skeleton 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.970
 la rochelle overwhelmed by the idea that the structure 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.840
 architectural 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.830
 to become a body 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.030
 so I thought right now gpj I got the idea that 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.840
 the circle reversing this logic 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.180
 that is, rather than passing 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.490
 of the architect this reverse the body the giant but would allow to pass the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.900
 body to the architect sure 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.730
 investigators 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.010
 I liked the idea that the crash 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.380
 the Ile de France is big enough to pay for Corsican tickets for 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.510
 understand 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.170
 walk-in spaces could 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.780
 dig holes 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.200
 entr build small stairs air corridors this body judged in 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.749
 same time 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:57.700
 for 100 m I'm interested in her at the idea that the body the subject could 

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:59.070
 become inhabited 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.330
 parent these animals 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.290
 it is as if for these reasons that has lodged a call that has earned 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.100
 inside my work 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.340
 the mirror also a few years now present in my work 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.420
 it's still the first time I came to see his sentence 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.159
 for practical reasons 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.159
 simply for proof m 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.169
 in fact it was really beautiful 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.669
 simply to create a device effect 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:27.209
 this helps give the spectator role to the visitors the opportunity to see a 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.559
 goal that was hidden so been revised since 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.960
 usual ballroom dance the mirror 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.960
 and should not exceed this species by 2 2% 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:38.029
 we must 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:41.629
 in the role of prince who has become a formal element with a moment 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.889
 work I used as 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.430
 communal an alternative to crystals I always used crystals 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:48.650
 moment are working for her 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.650
 this subject a second phase of growth 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.379
 of energy life 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.540
 the mirror is very present in the work 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.090
 so I decided to combine the two seasons to combine the giant 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.109
 and the mirror 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.809
 and percent 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:09.140
 to make a series of giant disposals 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.879
 when we ask the Bernese government 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.280
 and what I present site
