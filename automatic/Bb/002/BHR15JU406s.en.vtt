00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.700
 Russian bodybuilding is not like 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.860
 Western order that it is not set 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.110
 some kind of flow before we have some 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.969
 a certain amount let us 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.869
 a little bit yes there like some other 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.140
 athletes 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.970
 but we all keep everything so separate 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.279
 we can say this with us as Kachkovsky 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.589
 brotherhood so everyone knows each other at all 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.039
 there are some interesting funny stories 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:31.829
 I got there with Vanka Kochetkov there 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.810
 prefix hack here and well, cool 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.910
 when such a relationship there yes here we are 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:41.160
 performing on stage and backstage we are there 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.800
 friends they are rivals this is distinctive 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.730
 The Russian bodybuilding trait 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.910
 everyone knows each other if you are concerned 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.000
 good for her to you good doctors 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.540
 diagnose that I had cancer 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 somewhere 22 and a half years that is 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.100
 it turns out I performed with metastases in 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.909
 lung kidney and liver they got 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.990
 doubly the load because of the drying diet and 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.890
 still fought disease immunity 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:19.109
 struggled with the disease and i began to notice 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.479
 what immunity began to fall if some 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:26.600
 the infection got then I immediately fell ill 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:31.229
 there us more throat uhonos it right away 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.380
 crawled out all some sores began 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.830
 feel some sort of indisposition somewhere 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:43.140
 probably still 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.820
 2013 when I was preparing for spring 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.860
 began to feel it is not related 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.480
 diet was still feels the body 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.370
 when it 's some kind of weakness 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.530
 carbohydrate deficiency and when weakness 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.210
 some kind of immune character 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.620
 some discomfort constantly been 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.230
 I wanted time to sit 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.600
 although in training laid out on 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.150
 complete but after that of course as old 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.800
 grandfather I felt living a normal life 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:15.130
 time there for a long time you think yes there, well , somehow 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.260
 some sort of inference comes with 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.030
 time and here I do not know how that 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.120
 here at the click of the fingers and everything in my head 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.570
 very much everything changes dramatically here I 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.810
 used to put everything there for later 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:33.280
 Tomorrow, tomorrow I will do it again 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.530
 already having experienced so let's say one 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.880
 foot on the other world having been no longer going 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.430
 postpone there some things for tomorrow 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.250
 are there always some excuses with friends 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.709
 I was looking for something that work there are far away 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.440
 from each other or vice versa what 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.630
 there at any time we can meet here 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.390

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.640

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.860
