00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.780
 ok and greet boarders here jurassic 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.580
 I hope you are well and 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.070
 today we finally find ourselves and yes 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.490
 for the fourth and final episode of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.840
 tup and roddick do not live that you see there 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.430
 while it is true that it is really 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.140
 wait for this episode but it's 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.730
 because I was not very motivated to 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.920
 the finish this boat because of his 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.269
 mostly messiah jelly size finished blow 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.399
 I'll introduce it right now 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.380
 on this cinematic realize again 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.950
 once by dar kraft thanks to him go 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.950
 Let's go 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.120
 the navy knock so it's a supertanker 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.360
 flying his Norwegian flag which was 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.280
 launched in 1975 is demolished in 2009 10 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.719
 but it's mostly actually the biggest 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.379
 ship ever built since it measures 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.699
 is 458 meters long by 60 7 m 2 but 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.039
 too beautiful so wide so that's 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.199
 Just huge 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.210
 he asked me 35 or 40 hours of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.859
 work in minecraft wholesale and I 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.420
 specifies that the link to download it 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.960
 in the description for those who 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.960
 interested 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.340
 so here is a plan a bit more detailed 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.960
 from the boat a here the gateway that I 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.549
 you had shown at the last 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.020
 episode 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.940
 then and especially what I just want 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.680
 that I wanted to show you the 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.640
 main deck finishes that are 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.580
 relatively the same 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.220
 so you have pipes everywhere 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.810
 a the six to read home risk this 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.649
 are pipes there are full full 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.509
 full on the mole 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.979
 you also have small gray dots 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.590
 Clear they are at the top of the porn tower 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.690
 loaded oil in holds and teens 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.340
 will tend you have valves that are a 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.600
 a little bit bigger than the ones that 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.369
 the terminals I made a doubling of 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.740
 the terminals for which are actually made 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.820
 to unload the oil is calm that 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.280
 it's a plan that I really like 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.170
 a view from the wheelhouse the station of 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.880
 steering the boat where we see the bow 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.380
 in the distance and it gives a little a 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.119
 idea I find from what could see it 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.830
 the sailors when he was at the 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.580
 navigation and I find that I find it 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.580
 rather nice 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.060
 to finish a simple plan of the 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.680
 footbridge 1 where we see at the facade the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.020
 main air vents both 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.990
 big pipes count toward the sky the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.430
 wheelhouse the antennas from above and the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.680
 fireplace this is this video is now 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.510
 finished I hope my tire and aim 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.890

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.360
