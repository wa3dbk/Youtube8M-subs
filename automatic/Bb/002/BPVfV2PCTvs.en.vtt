00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.590
 great documentaries of our times 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.170
 in today's chapter we will see the origin 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.000
 of the keyboard order this is a 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.340
 computer also known as 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.170
 computer or the computer is one of the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.540
 most important inventions of our era 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.489
 that being connected to the internet serves 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.439
 to do research watch videos 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.919
 send emails browse various 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.790
 contents and finally if it is the case 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.149
 clear browsing history of 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.399
 said contents in this is a keyboard 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.379
 the keyboard is attached to the computer or 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.879
 implanted the cell phone the tablet is the 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.780
 element that allows us to insert text 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.179
 inside the computer screen 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.769
 to be able to form words the 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.570
 pre-medical use of the keyboard 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.219
 cellular generates the so-called syndrome 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.140
 crime in which teenagers 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.699
 addicted to cellular messaging should 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.620
 be treated by giving them bubble paper 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.629
 so that they relax and calm their addiction 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.129
 this clear consists of keys the 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.930
 which contain characters such as letters 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.000
 and generally alphabet symbols 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.170
 western but the keyboard has a 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.579
 so particular distribution of 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.070
 letters because it is not distributed 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.229
 properly in alphabetical order 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.729
 let's see it the first keyboard that is known 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.830
 It was created by the Mayans who 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.180
 they connected a kind of nail clipper to the 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.280
 head of different prisoners and 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.259
 slaves and they were awarded a letter or 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.759
 special character why when the 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.619
 supreme priest pressed each symbol 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.180
 the slave got a pinch and he had to 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.310
 scream at the top of his lungs the letter that 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.870
 it corresponded was not very useful but go 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.450
 that was entertaining 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.580
 to children later about one thousand 436 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.350
 twenty-six monks of the order velocity 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.490
 they decided to withdraw from the order and 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.050
 join to take advantage of their 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.820
 writing skills with what 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.290
 they sold their letters one by one for 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.120
 who were looking for their letters to remain 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.070
 will buy them and stick them in 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.630
 the order that they decided on another invention that 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.490
 it's not useful either but it was 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.990
 lucrative years later 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.060
 pacheco would be inspired by this ancient 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.220
 art to conceive the program of 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.620
 million with his unmistakable pacheco de 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.480
 candle pitifully Mr. Guttenberg 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.130
 and their invention of the printing press damaged their 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.020
 business to the monks barely four years 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.760
 later and they ended up taking advantage of their 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.380
 artistic skills being the first 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.300
 carca tourists from book fairs of the 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.420
 history and subsequently the creators 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.830
 of bingo with its acclaimed cards 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.810
 but returning to the topic of the origin of 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.940
 modern keyboard popularly there is the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.680
 false rumor that hans and letterman one 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.970
 of the modern keyboard parents had 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.590
 the idea of inventing the keyboard when 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.630
 he was watching his little girl eat a soup 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.370
 of letters because of this organized the 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.540
 keyboard as I was pulling one by one 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.250
 of the letters of the soup of the poor 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.480
 little girl that night did nothing but 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.040
 cry because his father ruined his 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.080
 fun dinner but this is 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.239
 completely false according to testimony from 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.020
 letterman's own daughter likewise 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.670
 some study 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.550
 of the matter led by Stephen 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.590
 mayorga indicate that since 1895 they 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.300
 illustrious an ultra secret sect of 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.070
 northeast French recognized for being 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.750
 great patrons and promoters of the 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.340
 science they communicated with members of 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.210
 zoology through hidden codes in 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.530
 keyboard 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.000
 these paranoid studies but 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.950
 distorted after explaining kindly 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.720
 to the mayor who is hardly obvious that 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.400
 a keyboard have hidden words of 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.990
 fact has all the words of the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.850
 hidden dictionary so you just have to 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.890
 connect the letters but none of 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.390
 these theories is fortunate the reason why 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.250
 which the keyboard that is attached to 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.630
 computer and it serves to form words 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.580
 that are entered into the system of 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.530
 computer has this provision of 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.270
 lyrics is due to alex's assistant 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.120
 ferguson who patented the first 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.130
 keyboard prototype in 1836 this 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.750
 assistant was called enrique rocket and 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.580
 biggest helper was the one who really 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.500
 he made the advances but upon realizing 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.570
 that his contribution was not going to be recognized 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.650
 subtly reorganized the lyrics to 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.690
 that all the keyboards of the world 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.580
 they will bear his name is as well as without 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.960
 know it every time we press one of 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.580
 the keys of the keyboard we are 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.160
 making it a simple but anonymous and 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.130
 meaning homage to the great eric body and 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.380
 forgotten father of the modern keyboard 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.240
 of the keyboard another useless mystery 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.550
 solved thanks to the research and 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.090
 analysis of large documentaries of 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.090
 Our times
