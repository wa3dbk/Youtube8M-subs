00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
 8 this x art youth art 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.690
 spraying graffiti is not there though it has been around since I was fifteen years old I can 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.480
 just put a lot of creativity in it and do fun things with it 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.289
 and that was very important 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.929
 but much colder do not understand these creative outbursts 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.849
 ask the 67 year old way you just hear something on that wall 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.849
 I have you there clearly read further I think 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.859
 well the 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.060
 they stand 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.759
 but that also the pitcher can but where the 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.160
 a Coke thanks 14 also prosecuted but on 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.060
 or something 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.180
 9 graffiti is not really popular for the elderly on the road afterwards 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.110
 the storage football is 7 but brought 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.460
 then that is extremely annoying hence the nfl 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.680
 and some negative 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.590
 planks 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.600
 well and how do you get young and old in one line 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.270
 by learning from each other so mister gets beautiful graffiti lessons today 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.040
 the fed ponytail i got you 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.090
 it up 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.200
 she wants to rise 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.080
 the eu wants it for one 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.410
 you have to do a little did taylor already cubes 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.910
 that's a block this way too 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.910
 and then another block comes 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.670
 in the course itself and then you have limited 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.320
 and then sir nicer can get to work himself 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.810
 it was a difficult program 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.540
 yes that the second time trial to get in the right place or drop 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.310
 that's a hot weather issue that's why we did and that's one 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.310
 also a bit of a matter of throwing up 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.070
 just turn on I am going to like it 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.710
 who also makes an effort, albeit on paper, is alderman of the field 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.710
 it is very difficult yes that is actually best of 7 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.979
 The province is part of the youthful campaign 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.890
 intended to give us a more positive image of young people to give the campaign 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.640
 must have yielded that if people walk on the street in amersfoort and see them 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.299
 a group of young people after the first thoughts 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.719
 a nice thing is that young people get together and that is not the first thought no that 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.759
 I would not buy out 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.119
 a lot of importance for my experience 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:15.459
 the actor 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.459
 elderly 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.029
 among the young 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:20.109
 trying to understand each other 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:25.529
 and as far as the vvd is concerned, the floodplains and the ideal day are doing quite well 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:26.939
 to move 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.369
 well i am doing very well there 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.219
 and this is the end result 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:36.149
 on the wall pi erik reaches watté guess so you actually have a performer here 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:39.149
 to calculate the area of ​​sale 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.559
 this is a work sentence of thirty hours before 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.109
 so this gap between young and old has been closed
