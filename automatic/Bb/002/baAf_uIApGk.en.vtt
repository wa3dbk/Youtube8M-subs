about this the next active weather

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.779 
about this the next active weather
pattern<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.880> where<00:01:08.749> this<00:01:08.929> front<00:01:09.259> ends<00:01:09.740> up<00:01:09.979> the

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
pattern and where this front ends up the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:12.069 
pattern and where this front ends up the
phone<00:01:10.999> I'm<00:01:11.240> going<00:01:11.329> to<00:01:11.420> show<00:01:11.539> you<00:01:11.600> how<00:01:11.719> the<00:01:11.840> flow

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
phone I'm going to show you how the flow

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.440 
phone I'm going to show you how the flow
is<00:01:12.259> parallel<00:01:12.289> to<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.130> front<00:01:13.399> it's<00:01:14.030> basically

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
is parallel to the front it's basically

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.270 
is parallel to the front it's basically
going<00:01:14.659> to<00:01:14.719> wing<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:14.990> be<00:01:15.109> zonal<00:01:15.499> for<00:01:15.710> time<00:01:15.979> from

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
going to wing to be zonal for time from

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.649 
going to wing to be zonal for time from
what<00:01:16.490> that<00:01:16.520> just<00:01:16.789> means<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.179> upper<00:01:17.389> level

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
what that just means the upper level

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.940 
what that just means the upper level
flows<00:01:17.840> from<00:01:17.990> Westies<00:01:18.350> there's<00:01:18.530> nothing<00:01:18.829> to

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
flows from Westies there's nothing to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.590 
flows from Westies there's nothing to
push<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:19.340> front<00:01:19.549> south<00:01:19.789> or<00:01:19.999> push<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.389> front

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
push the front south or push the front

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.539 
push the front south or push the front
north<00:01:20.810> there's<00:01:21.229> no<00:01:21.380> Ridge<00:01:21.679> to<00:01:22.009> you<00:01:22.280> know<00:01:22.369> move

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
north there's no Ridge to you know move

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.429 
north there's no Ridge to you know move
that<00:01:22.759> storm<00:01:23.479> track<00:01:23.719> to<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.899> north<00:01:23.959> and<00:01:24.289> no

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
that storm track to the north and no

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.379 
that storm track to the north and no
trough<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:24.950> push<00:01:25.399> it<00:01:25.579> away<00:01:25.670> towards<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.209> south

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:26.389 
trough to push it away towards the south

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:27.639 
trough to push it away towards the south
so<00:01:26.569> it's<00:01:26.719> going<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.869> be<00:01:26.929> stuck<00:01:27.170> right<00:01:27.409> over

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
so it's going to be stuck right over

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.010 
so it's going to be stuck right over
Arkansas<00:01:28.189> where<00:01:28.490> exactly<00:01:28.909> is<00:01:29.240> tough<00:01:29.840> to

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
Arkansas where exactly is tough to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.099 
Arkansas where exactly is tough to
pinpoint<00:01:30.609> but<00:01:31.609> the<00:01:31.759> thing<00:01:31.999> that<00:01:32.029> you<00:01:32.899> know<00:01:33.020> you

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
pinpoint but the thing that you know you

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:35.169 
pinpoint but the thing that you know you
see<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:33.649> lot<00:01:33.859> of<00:01:33.889> times<00:01:34.189> in<00:01:34.310> these<00:01:34.429> situations

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
see a lot of times in these situations

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:36.699 
see a lot of times in these situations
where<00:01:35.359> these<00:01:35.479> these<00:01:36.020> clusters<00:01:36.679> of

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
where these these clusters of

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:38.379 
where these these clusters of
thunderstorms<00:01:37.459> that<00:01:37.579> we're<00:01:37.729> forecasting<00:01:37.939> to

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:38.389 
thunderstorms that we're forecasting to

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:39.789 
thunderstorms that we're forecasting to
come<00:01:38.539> through<00:01:38.749> here<00:01:38.929> put<00:01:39.139> out<00:01:39.259> outflow

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
come through here put out outflow

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.739 
come through here put out outflow
boundaries<00:01:40.219> so<00:01:40.789> you<00:01:40.909> see<00:01:41.149> a<00:01:41.179> big<00:01:41.479> cluster

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
boundaries so you see a big cluster

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.050 
boundaries so you see a big cluster
rolling<00:01:42.259> across<00:01:42.380> Kansas<00:01:43.189> Missouri<00:01:43.399> northern

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
rolling across Kansas Missouri northern

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.730 
rolling across Kansas Missouri northern
Arkansas<00:01:44.389> sends<00:01:44.749> out<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.869> big<00:01:45.200> gush<00:01:45.409> of<00:01:45.560> air

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
Arkansas sends out a big gush of air

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.620 
Arkansas sends out a big gush of air
like<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.369> miniature<00:01:46.729> cold<00:01:47.090> front<00:01:47.329> towards<00:01:47.569> the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
like a miniature cold front towards the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
it looks like a wave low pressure zips

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.140 
it looks like a wave low pressure zips

this is Sunday so the front is still in
the<00:03:09.760> state<00:03:09.940> but<00:03:10.090> look<00:03:10.180> at<00:03:10.270> this<00:03:10.330> Monday<00:03:10.830> the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830

front makes it into Central Arkansas

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.050 
front makes it into Central Arkansas
here<00:03:13.930> comes<00:03:14.110> another<00:03:14.260> wave<00:03:14.590> of<00:03:14.650> low<00:03:14.890> pressure

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
here comes another wave of low pressure

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.430 
here comes another wave of low pressure
again<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.330> we're<00:03:16.480> talking<00:03:16.600> about<00:03:16.810> multiple

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
again so we're talking about multiple

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.229 
again so we're talking about multiple
days<00:03:17.650> with<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.400> threat<00:03:18.700> for<00:03:18.730> some<00:03:19.030> heavy

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
days with the threat for some heavy

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.420 
days with the threat for some heavy
rainfall<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.500> severe<00:03:20.920> weather<00:03:20.950> as<00:03:21.310> well

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
rainfall and the severe weather as well

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.720 
rainfall and the severe weather as well
when<00:03:21.730> inhale<00:03:22.030> would<00:03:22.150> be<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.420> main<00:03:22.570> threat<00:03:22.650> so

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
when inhale would be the main threat so

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.850 
when inhale would be the main threat so

to<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.630> GFS<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:47.620> think<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.040> European<00:03:48.670> might

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
to the GFS I think the European might

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.850 
to the GFS I think the European might
have<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.180> little<00:03:49.360> better<00:03:49.600> handle<00:03:50.110> on<00:03:50.260> this<00:03:50.590> as

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
have a little better handle on this as

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.759 
have a little better handle on this as
it<00:03:51.390> forecasts<00:03:52.390> heavier<00:03:52.900> rains<00:03:53.140> further<00:03:53.500> south
