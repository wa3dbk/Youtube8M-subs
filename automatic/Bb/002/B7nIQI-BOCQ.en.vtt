00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.040
 also not 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.050
 there was a mess in all networks 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.630
 social philip before in forums and everything 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.870
 because you did not know when I was going to start 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.930
 to give the gestures of the game not because 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.030
 they were selling under low manga 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.620
 I was selling in establishments 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.300
 small and good have rushed to the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.170
 last day of release to sell it 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.940
 OK 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.730
 and well I have it already I have it after 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:58.670
 earn two hours of tail on firm foot 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.409
 I think I remember that memory and it was me 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.960
 that I have more back, I have the 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:05.899
 tremendous backs 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.940
 I come killed killed, I'm going to 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.039
 record this and obviously lay down 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.289
 play to try it but sitting down lying 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:15.549
 as it is but I can not anymore so without 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:19.479
 more procrastination we are going to open the unboxing 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:22.090
 Well, I do not think it's necessary, it's worth 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.270
 sample articket 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.770
 but just in case there is a need to give, let's say 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.719
 that is not necessary although I do not know if 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.549
 they are in all the gaining open vale and 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:37.240
 I do not know how you see here the box 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.170
 huge I do not know if and if in all that 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.319
 they are selling us because for example 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.819
 mickey ok I do not know at this time yes yes 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.319
 the truth comes a message but when 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.109
 I've been collecting lots, I had not 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.119
 come up it's funny the subject is not that 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:52.030
 in some games they sell them and in others they do not 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.950
 I know how the theme goes this game but 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.270
 but good to me have called me gone what 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.970
 quickest possible to enable me the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.819
 tail and still good when it's gone I 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.860
 tail was one to one hundred and scientific 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.750
 personal is worth when I'm gone now 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.909
 same was in the game it was worth and I did not see 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.179
 the amount of people that was out 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.700
 waiting for a minimum queue of 600 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.000
 people and I say it without exaggerating 600 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.180
 damn people awful he has been 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.599
 tremendous 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.480
 and well the box is like this this is like 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.760
 you do not see it is without fashion 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.230
 it's a bit like mine sounds like it sounds 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.629
 great I'm going to take away the protection 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.519
 this and this is the original voucher box 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.710
 although good cool more with another with the 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.920
 letters 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.390
 the coffee is 2 that I believe in some mushrooms and 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.250
 I've seen that the box opens like this 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.510
 a bit strange way 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.820
 well there it is 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.680
 Uncle what more cost fucking shit 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.720
 subsist a game cast it cost me bonus 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:02.390
 of withdrawal and the ticket and you see it is worth 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:04.640
 cane 74 95 74 90 endorse 79 79 better 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.250
 five euros that he had given from the 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.420
 reserve good to tell you that I have to 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.060
 dream less in this one 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.830
 in this collector's edition because there's 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.100
 less things are worth almost all are codes 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.560
 but let's go to what's important 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.920
 the metal box 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:27.370
 metal box is worth what the fuck is that 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.960
 84 47 3 sp1 go you to know what is it is a 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.780
 character in zombie mode is worth and 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.910
 evidently the character black ops 2 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.770
 the main one waits for a moment 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.040
 point to very nice window like 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:42.040
 It is always in case there is some code that 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.710
 it looks instantly but not good 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.990
 Well here is open 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.330
 the cache of white photos is not necessary 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.420
 with you see it right there white cd 2 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.310
 and here are the instructions and below 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.650
 yes there is there of the excess again to the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.000
 window I'm sorry 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:04.060
 at least explained here there is content 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.400
 unlockable and that is looking at the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:12.359
 extra map box of knock down 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.849
 zombies knock down multiplayer 2.025 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.199
 unlockable content soundtrack 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.720
 camouflage player card backgrounds 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:23.230
 of the soul that is almost everything almost everything is 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.940
 A code is worth almost everything 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.480
 and that's the role there but I do not 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.640
 the code 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.860
 all are downloadable worth nearly everything 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.460
 that comes to you as you see the metal box 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.590
 very good her and here is another 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.800
 fuck 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:46.449
 wait the moment is there it did not take long 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.449
 and it comes 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.290
 and here it is worth they are two currencies 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.570
 collectors like those of prestige 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.800
 but so in a real way the truth that 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.480
 they are quite funny we are going to 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.480
 take them out of the box 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.280
 my mother this for the inbox inÃ©s that 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.100
 it is very difficult 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.680
 for one of obstacles I'm going to load the 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.680
 Cardboard cargo box 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:21.440
 boxing face again my mother already or the 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.750
 wrinkle the box 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.409
 for me the real games and liza 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.969
 they are going to kill us to see this 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.969
 good for sativa 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:37.780
 you see 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.780
 my mother but this is so hard for you 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.770
 of that generation 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.940
 ju 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.340
 ok it's already 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.640
 there they look good they are not two currencies 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.640
 metallic 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:58.729
 and her 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.729
 of the last two 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.110
 they are like two coins things the interval 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:06.139
 Like the medallion that I had from Asia, 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.270
 write of that 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.729
 but obviously 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.990
 they are smaller this is 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:17.180
 and well now I do not know how to put schemes 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:21.590
 key is another 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.960
 with a picture lathe mola mola mola 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.800
 this call of duty black ops' 2 is a 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.800
 picture everything is worth 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.120

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.090
 she is very cute 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.780
 but good 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:43.000

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.050
 of white I'm going to put it here 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.870
 obviously there is a condition much 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.690
 the more you play there you have a condition 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.850
 much more tocha but but today is what 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.820
