00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.080
 hello everyone welcome to sandra if 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.450
 sharp I'm a little bit tired because 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.369
 this trip teo en train and after 5 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.410
 train hours of course tiredness 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.600
 it is reflected in the face about everything is 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.269
 but like now and then we're going to 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.589
 know portofino then look for the 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.960
 Spanish translation should be 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.130
 fine posts because I wanted to touch up a 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.689
 little makeup because this 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.910
 makeup I did it at 10 o'clock 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.320
 tomorrow and it's 3:30 in the afternoon 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.150
 I wanted a little tweaking in 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.160
 makeup and I turned on the camera to 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.690
 signing them the tutorial could be a 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.610
 useful video for those that by 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.289
 example they come back from work and they need 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.910
 go on stage and do not want to be 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.800
 taking off makeup to turn to 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.809
 make up in this makeup not 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.789
 makeup that I have in fact had 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.500
 put on the eyelid the shade of 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.359
 l'orÃ©al the same time always the one 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.590
 used to illuminate then what 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.840
 first thing I'm going to do is touch up a 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.329
 little bit that same shadow reviewed it a 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.579
 little to intensify the and so I'm going 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.579
 to leave a fresh result 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.320
 besides placing the umbrellas by the 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.450
 tomorrow I got what I had done was 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.330
 place mascara but now 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.799
 As we are going for the evening, if I go 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.509
 to intensify a little in makeup 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.610
 of the eyes then I'm going to add the 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.830
 outlined and as you have seen me in a 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.050
 million videos as I have the eyes 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.700
 a little bit dropped the delineated I like 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.409
 do it from the back half which is 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.979
 the outline that will enhance the eyes 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:33.210
 fallen because it will counteract between 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.210
 quote this defect 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.970
 finally my pencils have tips 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.310
 because I recovered the pencil sharpener I'm going to 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.020
 leave villeros well pegadito the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.020
 eyelashes as much as possible 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.850
 and then what I do is here at the end 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.940
 when I pull out the tail is to make type 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.960
 a triangle back to back and 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.049
 then fill that triangle 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.760
 and the delineated in the initial part of 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.229
 eyelid I'm the one that next me that 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.869
 time they only know by heart because it is 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.840
 what I do, he always touched it but for 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.550
 inside 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.709
 to give it a more almond- shaped appearance 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.810
 eyes will do the same from here not 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.000
 I know if they are seeing well there because not 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.670
 take me big tripod that always 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.959
 I use to buy me a little one after 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.430
 the designs that I have in the camera 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.500
 put on top but I thought super 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.140
 peculiar because you have practice seems 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.569
 an extraterrestrial this little thing from here 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.580
 that with me it truly captured how you have 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.370
 You are so pathetic that you can 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.890
 manipulate you can change the position 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.420
 of the camera at height and the other that 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.280
 I like it is that as it has the tips 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.130
 as well as gummies, it is quite 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.989
 stable because it is as if it will stick 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.000
 I tried it even on the lawn 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.370
 above the ground above the 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.959
 stones that stretch I'm super happy 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.880
 with the purchase and the other thing that I like is 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.940
 how is it so so little good look 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.950
 my hand fits in the bag is more comfortable 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.049
 to transport now I'm going to blur a 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.730
 little the stroke and this little one the good 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.099
 it is that brings the other end of the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.140
 gummy to blur this is going to be that 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.730
 is aligned will last us longer and if 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.340
 they still want it to last longer 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.110
 follow it with a little bit of dust 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.210
 shadows that are made in delineated 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.920
 they only use some shadows or if they perform 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.570
 a delineated as in my case black it 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.520
 place a little shadow on top 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.040
 black powder now the other thing that I'm going to 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.420
 to do is take a dark shadow 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.860
 I'm going to use a brown shady 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.290
 but they can do it with a gray shadow 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.390
 with a black shadow with a shadow only 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.220
 dark the color of your preference to 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.260
 use these kiko shady that I 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.870
 love it is a brown but with my minimum 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.900
 and if you're inside glitter shines a 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.569
 little bit well leaves a finish or semi 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.310
 multicolored but the color that predominated 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.319
 in brown I'm going to do it with my finger 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.269
 but you can also do it with a brush 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.760
 I'm going to make an eye with my finger and 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.760
 the other with a brush for you to see 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.010
 they remove my hair from the middle so that 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.990
 can see that more or less you get a 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.610
 similar result the brushes are not 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.680
 essential as I have already told you in 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.980
 other videos what matters is the 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.280
 handcraft here I'm intensifying a 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.540
 little bit more the little corner well a small 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.640
 step as it changes the look and the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.130
 way even the eye see that it gives me 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:24.800
 a lifting effect to the eye like that I 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.800
 to here 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.100
 It gives it a more almond-shaped appearance and gives a 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.220
 Lifting effect to the eye lifts it up 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.990
 little bit so this is a tip a trick 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.120
 optimal for those with eyes 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.560
 fallen as I open the left what 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.419
 I will do quickly with the brush 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.550
 to see that more or less result 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.660
 It's the same and I have to hurry because 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.660
 aaron to come to pick 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.070
 and supports me with the brush 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.620
 and develops I love it because in 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.660
 followed by a blurred application 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.130
 of color so you lose less time 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.130
 to get a result 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.210
 look 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.280
 in fast quick eyelash mask 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.750
 I'm going to touch up the blush too 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.370
 quickly the labial and we're already 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.500
 lists 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.000
 I'm putting the mirror in the middle 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.639
 amount of this tutorial to stay 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.560
 mother as we say with a laugh 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.960
 I'm going to give it a little touch with the 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.969
 pea papado by the game within the 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.849
 water line but the upper one nothing more 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:28.860
 to give a feeling of quantity of ve 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.840
 this morning is an optical illusion but 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.870
 so it looks like we have more eyelashes 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.909
 to retouch to retouch to retouch the blush and 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.919
 I'm going to use the orange color of 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.499
 this trio I love this palette of 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.389
 sleep because they are super pigmented and 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.370
 last these rumors good 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.960
 You can still see that I'm wearing it and 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.520
 I put it at 10 in the morning as I 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.129
 I told them but I'm going to intensify a 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.860
 little I love to walk with 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:55.379
 well-colored cheeks I'll place in 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.789
 abyan this revlon orange review

 always the information box before 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.300
 to ask little girl that I always 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.460
 Today they are linked by the products that 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.710
 I show you used in the tutorial well 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.330
 You can see the products as they are called 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.330
 how much do they cost etc. 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.450
 my god this area was never 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.080
 Professor, I think we already came to 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.439
 collect 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.569
 to finish the hair I wear the 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:22.580

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:26.090
 clothes that I brought as they change the 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.650
 shoes because it comes with so critical that
