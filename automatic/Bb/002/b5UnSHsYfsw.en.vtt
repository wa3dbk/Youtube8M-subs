00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
peel this back tape off as well that's

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
peel this back tape off as well that's
very<00:01:26.729> satisfying<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.810> guess<00:01:27.960> at<00:01:28.110> this

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
very satisfying and I guess at this

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.420 
very satisfying and I guess at this
point<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.680> go<00:01:28.710> ahead<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.040> put<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
point we can go ahead and put the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.219 
point we can go ahead and put the
battery<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.090> we'll<00:01:30.210> peel<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.540> back<00:01:30.630> off<00:01:30.900> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
battery in so we'll peel it back off and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.630 
battery in so we'll peel it back off and
we'll<00:01:31.799> go<00:01:31.860> ahead<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.070> take<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> battery<00:01:32.520> in

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
we'll go ahead and take the battery in

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.190 
we'll go ahead and take the battery in
there<00:01:32.759> interestingly<00:01:33.150> enough<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> did<00:01:33.960> come

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
there interestingly enough it did come

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.080 
there interestingly enough it did come
with<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.380> verizon<00:01:34.920> sim<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.579> already<00:01:35.850> I

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
with a verizon sim in it already I

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.520 
with a verizon sim in it already I
haven't<00:01:36.450> bought<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> verizon<00:01:36.990> prepaid<00:01:37.350> phone

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
haven't bought a verizon prepaid phone

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.840 
haven't bought a verizon prepaid phone
before<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:37.979> wasn't<00:01:38.310> really<00:01:38.400> sure<00:01:38.640> what<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
before so I wasn't really sure what to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.219 
before so I wasn't really sure what to
expect<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.360> we'll<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.750> ahead<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.900> get<00:01:40.020> rid<00:01:40.140> of

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
expect but we'll go ahead and get rid of

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.690 
expect but we'll go ahead and get rid of
that<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.560> good<00:01:40.710> thing<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.920> all<00:01:41.070> Verizon<00:01:41.490> 4G

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
that the good thing is all Verizon 4G

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.880 
that the good thing is all Verizon 4G
LTE<00:01:41.970> phones<00:01:42.390> are<00:01:42.570> required<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.200> work<00:01:43.350> unlocked

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
LTE phones are required to work unlocked

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
LTE phones are required to work unlocked
so<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.520> should<00:01:44.670> work<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:44.880> fine<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.420> put

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
so this should work just fine if I put

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.480 
so this should work just fine if I put
my<00:01:45.630> 18<00:01:45.930> TS<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.290> minute<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.680> believe<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.250> let's<00:01:47.399> go

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
my 18 TS a minute I believe but let's go

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.530 
my 18 TS a minute I believe but let's go
ahead<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.700> power<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.970> up<00:01:48.119> now<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.420> got

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
ahead and power it up now that we got

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.280 
ahead and power it up now that we got
the<00:01:48.600> battery<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.990> there

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the battery in there

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.530 
the battery in there
there<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.560> go<00:01:49.649> samsung<00:01:50.189> galaxy<00:01:50.610> j1<00:01:51.149> powered

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
there you go samsung galaxy j1 powered

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.480 
there you go samsung galaxy j1 powered
by<00:01:51.689> android<00:01:52.200> looking<00:01:52.920> around<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.310> very

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
by android looking around it was very

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.340 
by android looking around it was very
difficult<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.939> find<00:01:54.240> exactly<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:55.020> version

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
difficult to find exactly what version

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.200 
difficult to find exactly what version
of<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> OS<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.860> has<00:01:56.100> some<00:01:56.520> places<00:01:56.880> said<00:01:57.060> that

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
of the OS this has some places said that

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.969 
of the OS this has some places said that
it<00:01:57.299> still<00:01:57.479> comes<00:01:57.719> running<00:01:57.990> KitKat<00:01:58.229> Samsung

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it still comes running KitKat Samsung

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.410 
it still comes running KitKat Samsung
itself<00:01:59.310> mentions<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.969> actually<00:02:00.119> has

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
itself mentions that it actually has

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.109 
itself mentions that it actually has
lollipop<00:02:01.049> version<00:02:01.350> 5.0<00:02:01.860> point<00:02:02.130> 2<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:03.090> I

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
lollipop version 5.0 point 2 so I

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.609 
lollipop version 5.0 point 2 so I
suppose<00:02:03.450> we'll<00:02:03.659> see<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.320> minute

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
suppose we'll see here in just a minute

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.780 
suppose we'll see here in just a minute
realistically<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.280> was<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.640> kind<00:02:05.759> of

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
realistically I was just kind of

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.219 
realistically I was just kind of
surprised<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.270> see<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.600> Samsung<00:02:07.020> had<00:02:07.200> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
surprised to see that Samsung had a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.979 
surprised to see that Samsung had a
phone<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> $700<00:02:08.729> category<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.690> let's<00:02:09.869> go

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
phone in the $700 category so let's go

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.479 
phone in the $700 category so let's go
ahead<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.140> go<00:02:10.289> through<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.530> wizard<00:02:10.800> says

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
ahead and go through this wizard says

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.520 
ahead and go through this wizard says
English<00:02:11.790> wins<00:02:12.569> are<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> sim<00:02:13.110> we<00:02:13.290> don't

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
English wins are the sim we don't

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.480 
English wins are the sim we don't
really<00:02:13.650> want<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> do<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:14.280> we'll<00:02:14.370> use

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
really want to do that so we'll use

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.220 
really want to do that so we'll use
Wi-Fi<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:15.330> doesn't<00:02:15.600> do<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.780> five<00:02:15.930> gigahertz

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
Wi-Fi this doesn't do the five gigahertz

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.080 
Wi-Fi this doesn't do the five gigahertz
Wi-Fi<00:02:16.530> which<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.190> guess<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.610> be<00:02:17.730> expected

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
Wi-Fi which I guess is to be expected

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.150 
Wi-Fi which I guess is to be expected
now<00:02:18.630> we're<00:02:18.780> connected<00:02:18.959> we<00:02:19.709> can<00:02:19.740> go<00:02:20.010> through

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
now we're connected we can go through

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.650 
now we're connected we can go through
and<00:02:20.280> set<00:02:20.430> up<00:02:20.520> accounts<00:02:21.030> here<00:02:21.240> I'm<00:02:21.420> not<00:02:21.510> going

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
and set up accounts here I'm not going

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.300 
and set up accounts here I'm not going
to<00:02:21.720> do<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.020> says<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.650> checking<00:02:22.830> connection

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
to do that says it's checking connection

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.620 
to do that says it's checking connection
and<00:02:23.459> actually<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.940> looks<00:02:24.240> like<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
and actually this looks like the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.540 
and actually this looks like the
lollipop<00:02:24.780> startup<00:02:25.440> stuff<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:25.950> looks<00:02:26.310> good

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
lollipop startup stuff so looks good

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.980

has<00:02:33.030> been<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.239> little<00:02:33.420> bit<00:02:33.600> difficult<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.230> far

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
has been a little bit difficult so far

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.410 
has been a little bit difficult so far
the<00:02:34.650> keyboard<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.130> very<00:02:35.580> very<00:02:35.790> small<00:02:36.090> and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
the keyboard is just very very small and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.670 
the keyboard is just very very small and
it<00:02:36.569> gives<00:02:36.720> us<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.840> option<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.319> restore<00:02:37.530> from

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
it gives us that option to restore from
