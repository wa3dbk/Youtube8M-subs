00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
problem is I need to move this and this

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.510 
problem is I need to move this and this
this<00:06:03.640> is<00:06:03.880> obviously<00:06:04.480> a<00:06:04.570> DIN<00:06:05.230> I<00:06:05.470> can<00:06:06.070> move<00:06:06.220> both

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
this is obviously a DIN I can move both

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.710 
this is obviously a DIN I can move both
these<00:06:06.900> down<00:06:07.900> here<00:06:09.060> but<00:06:10.060> then<00:06:10.240> I<00:06:10.270> need<00:06:10.480> to<00:06:10.570> move

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
these down here but then I need to move

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.970 
these down here but then I need to move
that<00:06:10.780> up<00:06:11.640> there<00:06:12.840> just<00:06:13.840> so<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:14.140> galaxy<00:06:14.590> tablet

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
that up there just so the galaxy tablet

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.780 
that up there just so the galaxy tablet
will<00:06:15.070> fit<00:06:15.540> down<00:06:16.540> to<00:06:16.720> it<00:06:16.780> here<00:06:17.640> seems<00:06:18.640> like<00:06:18.760> a

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
will fit down to it here seems like a

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.510 
will fit down to it here seems like a
lot<00:06:19.060> of<00:06:19.090> work<00:06:19.620> when<00:06:20.620> I<00:06:20.650> could<00:06:20.890> just<00:06:21.040> go<00:06:21.220> ahead

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
lot of work when I could just go ahead

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:28.590 
lot of work when I could just go ahead
and<00:06:21.810> modify<00:06:22.810> it<00:06:23.170> this<00:06:23.740> piece<00:06:24.100> right<00:06:24.340> there<00:06:25.830> and

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
and modify it this piece right there and

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:36.450 
and modify it this piece right there and
it<00:06:29.350> pretty<00:06:29.620> much<00:06:32.760> fits<00:06:33.760> pretty<00:06:33.970> good<00:06:34.320> so<00:06:35.460> that

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
it pretty much fits pretty good so that

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.400 
it pretty much fits pretty good so that
might<00:06:36.640> be<00:06:36.760> the<00:06:36.880> easier<00:06:37.210> way<00:06:40.110> who<00:06:41.110> needs<00:06:41.320> to

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
might be the easier way who needs to

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.190 
might be the easier way who needs to
know<00:06:41.470> if<00:06:41.650> you<00:06:41.710> got<00:06:41.800> low<00:06:42.010> fuel<00:06:42.810> you<00:06:43.810> got<00:06:43.930> a<00:06:43.960> gas

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
know if you got low fuel you got a gas

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.580 
know if you got low fuel you got a gas
gauge<00:06:45.660> so<00:06:46.660> yeah<00:06:46.780> let<00:06:46.960> me<00:06:47.050> know<00:06:47.140> what<00:06:47.320> you<00:06:47.440> guys

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
gauge so yeah let me know what you guys

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.590 
gauge so yeah let me know what you guys
would<00:06:47.770> think<00:06:48.010> would<00:06:48.130> be<00:06:48.160> better<00:06:48.480> right<00:06:49.480> now

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 
would think would be better right now

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.290 
would think would be better right now
