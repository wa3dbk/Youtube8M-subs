an<00:00:59.090> F<00:00:59.450> natural<00:01:01.690> so<00:01:02.690> I<00:01:02.780> get<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.050> diminished

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:14.790 
an F natural so I get that diminished
sound<00:01:07.060> so<00:01:08.060> that<00:01:08.240> sounds<00:01:08.630> like

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.220 

and<00:01:15.800> then<00:01:16.460> back<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.760> standard<00:01:17.150> nullable<00:01:17.480> okay

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
and then back to standard nullable okay

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.490 
and then back to standard nullable okay
so<00:01:18.620> here's<00:01:18.800> our<00:01:18.950> second<00:01:19.400> part<00:01:19.940> of<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.470> when<00:01:21.470> I

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
so here's our second part of that when I

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.240 
so here's our second part of that when I
do<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.710> again<00:01:26.560> kind<00:01:27.560> of<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.710> standard<00:01:28.130> double

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
do it again kind of a standard double

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.580 
do it again kind of a standard double
stop<00:01:28.610> but<00:01:29.210> then<00:01:29.300> if<00:01:29.420> I<00:01:29.510> walk<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:30.020> double<00:01:30.410> stop

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
stop but then if I walk that double stop

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:40.240 
stop but then if I walk that double stop
down<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:36.890> go<00:01:37.040> from<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.310> G<00:01:38.440> with<00:01:39.440> an<00:01:39.530> F<00:01:39.650> sharp<00:01:39.950> on

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
down so I go from a G with an F sharp on

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.760 
down so I go from a G with an F sharp on
top<00:01:41.000> of<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.240> D<00:01:41.950> now<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:42.980> won't<00:01:43.190> have<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.550> E<00:01:43.820> and

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
top of the D now I won't have the E and

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.390 
top of the D now I won't have the E and
then<00:01:45.770> go<00:01:45.920> back<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.250> D<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:46.790> openes<00:01:48.340> now<00:01:49.340> I'm

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
then go back to a D and openes now I'm

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.770 
then go back to a D and openes now I'm
going<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.580> do<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.760> same<00:01:50.030> double<00:01:50.420> stuff<00:01:50.600> that<00:01:50.750> I

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
going to do the same double stuff that I

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.600 
going to do the same double stuff that I
did<00:01:50.990> before<00:01:51.110> but<00:01:51.530> I'm<00:01:51.590> doing<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:51.950> different
