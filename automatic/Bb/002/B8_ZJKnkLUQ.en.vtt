important having studied pharmacy and
now<00:02:48.380> studying<00:02:48.739> optometry<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.459> realise<00:02:49.819> that

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
now studying optometry you realise that

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.150 
now studying optometry you realise that
the<00:02:50.150> eye<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.330> such<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.780> critical<00:02:51.319> component<00:02:51.980> of

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
the eye is such a critical component of

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.759 
the eye is such a critical component of
a<00:02:52.610> patient's<00:02:53.330> well-being<00:02:53.650> basically<00:02:54.650> it's

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
a patient's well-being basically it's

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.320 
a patient's well-being basically it's
the<00:02:54.950> window<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.549> world<00:02:55.700> itself

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
the window to the world itself

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.680 
the window to the world itself
I<00:02:56.950> think<00:02:57.950> optometry<00:02:58.610> offers<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.390> good

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
I think optometry offers you a good

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.020 
I think optometry offers you a good
work/life<00:03:00.109> balance<00:03:00.140> it's<00:03:01.100> a<00:03:01.220> rewarding<00:03:01.670> field

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
work/life balance it's a rewarding field

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.240 
work/life balance it's a rewarding field
I<00:03:02.299> think<00:03:02.959> everything<00:03:03.380> about<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.799> course<00:03:04.070> is

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
I think everything about this course is

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
exciting the life skills that you gain

exciting the life skills that you gain
in<00:03:06.500> terms<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:06.829> patient<00:03:07.220> interaction<00:03:07.820> we<00:03:08.299> are

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
in terms of patient interaction we are

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.840 
in terms of patient interaction we are
exposed<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.260> lots<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.799> other<00:03:09.980> aspects<00:03:10.609> of

exposed to lots of other aspects of

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.210 
exposed to lots of other aspects of
optometry<00:03:11.630> practice<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.530> making<00:03:12.739> us<00:03:12.920> work

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
optometry practice so making us work

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.460 
optometry practice so making us work
ready<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.670> part<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.420> parcel<00:03:14.480> of<00:03:15.019> this<00:03:15.200> course

the<00:03:16.010> facility<00:03:16.489> itself<00:03:16.819> is<00:03:17.150> fantastic<00:03:17.840> I<00:03:18.049> don't

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
the facility itself is fantastic I don't

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.289
