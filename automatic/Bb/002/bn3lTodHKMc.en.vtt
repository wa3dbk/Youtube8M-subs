and amazing insects that produce
incredibly<00:00:03.959> loud<00:00:04.380> sounds<00:00:05.009> now<00:00:05.430> again<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:05.910> it

incredibly loud sounds now again is it
wing<00:00:06.600> beats<00:00:06.839> that<00:00:07.109> create<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.859> sound<00:00:08.099> no<00:00:08.880> they

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
wing beats that create the sound no they

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.270 
wing beats that create the sound no they
actually<00:00:09.150> have<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.450> special<00:00:10.010> organ<00:00:11.010> called<00:00:11.190> a

actually have a special organ called a
thimble<00:00:11.700> which<00:00:11.849> vibrates<00:00:12.450> at<00:00:12.630> high<00:00:12.809> speed<00:00:13.290> to

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
thimble which vibrates at high speed to

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.430 
thimble which vibrates at high speed to
make<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:14.940> unique<00:00:15.269> sound<00:00:15.570> okay<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.199> where<00:00:16.350> is

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
make this unique sound okay and where is

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.230 
make this unique sound okay and where is
that<00:00:16.470> located<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.220> we<00:00:17.400> can<00:00:17.550> try<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.789> film<00:00:18.090> it

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
that located so we can try and film it

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.359 
that located so we can try and film it
what<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.600> have<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.810> do<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.410> hidden<00:00:19.710> by

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
what you have to do is it's hidden by

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.460 
what you have to do is it's hidden by
the<00:00:20.430> wings<00:00:20.730> right<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:21.900> making<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.289> eyes

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
the wings right here making the eyes

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.050 
the wings right here making the eyes
right<00:00:22.650> now<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.010> if<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.250> lift<00:00:23.519> up<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.699> wing

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
right now and if you lift up the wing

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.859 
right now and if you lift up the wing
you'll<00:00:24.330> see<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:25.070> right<00:00:26.070> there<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:27.029> pulsing

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
you'll see this right there that pulsing

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.320 
you'll see this right there that pulsing
back<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.289> forth<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:29.849> bitterly

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
back and forth but you can just bitterly

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.240 
back and forth but you can just bitterly
see<00:00:30.660> something<00:00:31.050> that's<00:00:31.230> shaking<00:00:31.650> yeah<00:00:31.949> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
see something that's shaking yeah and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.979 
see something that's shaking yeah and
and<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.910> abdomen<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.450> hollow<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:33.809> it

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and the abdomen is hollow so it

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.840 
and the abdomen is hollow so it
amplifies<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.739> sound<00:00:34.920> sounds<00:00:35.550> like<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> guitar

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
amplifies the sound sounds like a guitar

amplifies the sound sounds like a guitar
body<00:00:36.300> right<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:37.620> part<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.190> cicadas

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
body right this part of the cicadas

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.880 
body right this part of the cicadas
Anatomy<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.210> called<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.629> Tim<00:00:39.899> ball<00:00:40.140> all<00:00:40.829> right

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
Anatomy is called the Tim ball all right

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.500 
Anatomy is called the Tim ball all right
and<00:00:41.309> if<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.460> look<00:00:41.489> closely<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.360> see

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and if you look closely you can see

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.200 
and if you look closely you can see
there<00:00:42.960> there<00:00:43.320> she<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:44.030> amazing<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.090> really

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
there there she is amazing you really

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.930 
there there she is amazing you really
you<00:00:45.480> can't<00:00:45.719> even<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:47.280> timbal<00:00:47.640> at<00:00:47.730> all

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you can't even see the timbal at all

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.299 
you can't even see the timbal at all
it's<00:00:48.840> really<00:00:49.020> protective<00:00:49.590> totally<00:00:50.010> hidden<00:00:50.129> by

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
it's really protective totally hidden by

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.490 
it's really protective totally hidden by
the<00:00:50.370> wings<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:51.840> most<00:00:52.050> people<00:00:52.289> would<00:00:52.410> never

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the wings so most people would never

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.840 
the wings so most people would never
even<00:00:52.649> know<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.949> there<00:00:53.210> but<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.570> there<00:00:55.140> at

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
even know it's there but it is there at

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.700 
even know it's there but it is there at
10,000<00:00:56.850> frames<00:00:57.059> per<00:00:57.390> second<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.530> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
10,000 frames per second we can see that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.740 
10,000 frames per second we can see that
as<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> Tim<00:00:59.129> ball<00:00:59.340> buckles<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.149> words<00:01:00.359> it

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
as the Tim ball buckles in words it

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.200 
as the Tim ball buckles in words it
produces<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.469> click<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.579> these<00:01:02.760> muscles

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
produces a click and as these muscles

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.200 
produces a click and as these muscles
relax<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.960> produces<00:01:04.439> another<00:01:04.769> click<00:01:05.129> 10<00:01:06.060> of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
relax it produces another click 10 of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.539 
relax it produces another click 10 of
these<00:01:06.330> vibrations<00:01:07.020> produce<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.770> full<00:01:08.070> cycle

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
these vibrations produce a full cycle

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.910 
these vibrations produce a full cycle
and<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.000> takes<00:01:09.240> 50<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.780> these<00:01:09.990> cycles<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and it takes 50 of these cycles to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.020 
and it takes 50 of these cycles to
generate<00:01:11.369> one<00:01:11.790> second<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.450> actual<00:01:12.990> sound

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
generate one second of actual sound

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.780 
generate one second of actual sound
mix<00:01:15.870> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> hill<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> thousand<00:01:16.920> or<00:01:17.010> so<00:01:17.040> cicadas

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
mix in the hill a thousand or so cicadas

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.210 
mix in the hill a thousand or so cicadas
and<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.390> solo<00:01:18.720> performance<00:01:19.040> becomes<00:01:20.040> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and the solo performance becomes a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.450 
and the solo performance becomes a
deafening<00:01:20.940> summer<00:01:21.450> Orchestra

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.860 

but<00:01:29.460> when<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.700> slow<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> down<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.330> can<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.660> so

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
but when we slow it down you can see so

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.810 
but when we slow it down you can see so
much<00:01:31.020> more<00:01:31.080> detail<00:01:31.620> you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.280> this

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
much more detail you can see that this

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.060 
much more detail you can see that this
is<00:01:33.000> actually<00:01:33.300> a<00:01:33.330> stack<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.780> about<00:01:34.230> ten<00:01:34.620> strong

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
is actually a stack of about ten strong

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
is actually a stack of about ten strong
structures<00:01:35.610> connected<00:01:35.970> by<00:01:36.300> you<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:37.050> some

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
structures connected by you know some

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.230 
structures connected by you know some
thinner<00:01:37.590> weak<00:01:37.860> membrane<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.550> it<00:01:38.970> keeps

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
thinner weak membrane and it keeps

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.880 
thinner weak membrane and it keeps
folding<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:39.870> those<00:01:40.020> points<00:01:40.440> it<00:01:40.530> doesn't<00:01:40.800> make

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
folding at those points it doesn't make

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.150 
folding at those points it doesn't make
it<00:01:40.920> all<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.340> way<00:01:41.430> across<00:01:42.410> so<00:01:43.410> I<00:01:43.440> don't<00:01:43.830> do<00:01:43.950> very

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
it all the way across so I don't do very

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.890 
it all the way across so I don't do very
many<00:01:44.250> people<00:01:44.460> never<00:01:44.700> seen<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.120> before<00:01:45.270> well

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
many people never seen this before well

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.480 
many people never seen this before well
if<00:01:46.080> you<00:01:46.230> have<00:01:46.410> never<00:01:46.590> seen<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.980> than<00:01:47.190> I<00:01:47.310> would

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
if you have never seen this than I would

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.040 
if you have never seen this than I would
i<00:01:47.640> would<00:01:47.760> guess<00:01:48.060> very<00:01:48.330> few<00:01:48.600> people<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:49.020> seen

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
i would guess very few people have seen

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.010 
i would guess very few people have seen
this<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:49.590> loud<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.670> mesmerizing<00:01:51.270> as<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.780> is

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
this as loud and mesmerizing as this is

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.280 
this as loud and mesmerizing as this is
it's<00:01:52.650> a<00:01:52.800> love<00:01:53.070> call<00:01:53.400> compared<00:01:54.300> to<00:01:54.900> our<00:01:55.050> other

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it's a love call compared to our other

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:04.020
