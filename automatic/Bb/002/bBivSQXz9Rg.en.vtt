00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:10.300
 Yes then one of the radicals of kanji 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:19.150
 I would like to introduce you about how to write a heavy duty team 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:21.740
 In this video, you will use the whiteboard and pen to open it, but everyone 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:27.560
 Of course by all means of course man's okay 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.450
 In God from that pen pencil ball pen star 4 anything is fine, so please watch the video 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:36.590
 It is together while having you see it 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:40.340
 I think it would be nice if you can practice the rotation , so first of all it's together 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:44.470
 What you want to do is a square of appropriate size 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.470
 As it is all right with freehand 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.750
 Please write a little about it. 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:59.030
 Yes i feel like this 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:04.549
 If you put it, it 's in the center, but it's slightly shifted to the left from the middle 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.990
 If you have a dotted line, please try to draw more and more with this freehand 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:12.370
 Yes 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:18.460
 As an image, it is an image of 4 here is around 6 yes 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:19.420
 It will be 4 vs. 6 It will be one for each sound mail here is this on the left side 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.470
 In space 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.010
 I will write Bow valve 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.990
 First of all, though I hit the garden 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.640
 Book 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.730
 Something like this 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.409
 Yes and a long line with a slight increase in the corner 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.619
 I will pull 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:44.440
 The point I came in was not right 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:49.300
 Is that will square up Yes'll be fine in this 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:52.110
 And then we have a short line at the same angle as Japan 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.110
 I will continue 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.659
 At the falling length of a single other one 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.640
 Japan 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.560
 Yes 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.430
 Is it all right here 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.430
 It is point to make 9 a little up, though 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.410
 Excuse me before the point is the point 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.850
 here 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.800
 here 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.810
 Though is equal interval is different is the same width length'll be the same width 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.060
 This is the point 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.270
 And 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.910
 Let's look 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.280
 Because this year is not complete 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:46.710
 Though this is a mouth comes in 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:51.430
 Write go here corner eyes of mouth but diagonally a little on the inside rather than directly below 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:54.110
 Ugh Masugu we wrote we will put in a lower right 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:00.350
 It is such a feeling that pita stops 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:01.230
 Yes, and the same angle parallel line and the next horizontal line also the right side is clever child 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.980
 Right now 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.330
 Lift up and stop all the time and again just a little inside 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.660
 I will put in 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.660
 Yes 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.370
 And 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:22.569
 Horizontal lines and bruises of the mouth 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:23.590
 After all the same angle, that is , three places here create the same space, the balance is beautiful 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.190
 It looks like 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.190
 And last 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:38.810
 It means that you have drawn a line next to Yu 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:43.040
 All the same angle including heart war including one two three four five shoes 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:47.380
 It's all about bringing it at the same angle 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:52.630
 Then I will carry it at equal intervals 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:57.240
 Will be the point of that I bring to take line is it the same each of horizontal 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:05.220
 Yes Naturally this alone does not hold as a feeling 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:05.220
 For example, if it is a child who speaks, it is right here 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.770
 It enters like this 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.660
 Movement of this side as point 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:28.160
 From now on the line under the hood 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:29.449
 It looks well balanced if you write here to be the same height 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.180
 Now 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:37.250
 It was that we separated 2 episodes 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.250
 I wrote 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.310
 Besides, for example, the feeling of stunt 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:57.110
 m 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:57.110
 Although the number of strokes is reduced while calculating the clock 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:08.740
 After all I think that the balance is good by making it the same height as the final school here 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.949
 It will be visible 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:18.430
 One more time at the end in a little frame of c in 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:21.060
 Gonbei I would like to write a little bit you also please try to write us together 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.060
 At first 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.209
 Hit a point 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.510
 Right shoulder 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:30.670
 And 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.860
 One 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.860
 Japan Aikosei same sense 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:45.460
 And put the mouth a little inside 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.900
 Raise and put inside 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.860
 Firmly close here parallel lines 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.860
 It will be that I have at regular intervals 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:59.940
 The One of supplies of feeling this time in So 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:06.930
 We continue to introduce how to write a Gonben 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:08.889
 I think if you have you refer to it by all means and use it in the actual game I think it looks like until the end 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.310
 Thank you very much 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:11.310
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.440
 Four days 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.440
 dee dee
