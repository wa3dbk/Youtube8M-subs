00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
know this now they didn't want to do a

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.410 
know this now they didn't want to do a
pump<00:00:55.440> from<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.710> I've<00:00:55.829> heard<00:00:56.270> because<00:00:57.270> they

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
pump from what I've heard because they

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.869 
pump from what I've heard because they
want<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.780> shake<00:00:57.989> your<00:00:58.859> foundation<00:00:59.460> before

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
want you to shake your foundation before

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.939 
want you to shake your foundation before
you<00:00:59.940> use<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.059> which<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.750> get<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.260> mean<00:01:01.440> you

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
you use it which I get I mean you

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.889 
you use it which I get I mean you
totally<00:01:02.100> should<00:01:02.460> do<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.730> depending<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.809> how

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
totally should do that depending on how

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.440 
totally should do that depending on how
long<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.199> been<00:01:04.290> sitting<00:01:04.700> but<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.939> think<00:01:06.299> we

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
long it's been sitting but I think we

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.469 
long it's been sitting but I think we
can<00:01:06.600> still<00:01:06.810> shake<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:08.210> even<00:01:09.210> though<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.360> has<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
can still shake it even though it has a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.429 
can still shake it even though it has a
pump<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:12.119> great<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.260> the

just wanted to let you guys know what I

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.809 
just wanted to let you guys know what I
found<00:03:48.510> because<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.930> was<00:03:49.139> so<00:03:49.500> excited<00:03:50.370> about<00:03:50.639> it

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
found because I was so excited about it

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.640 
found because I was so excited about it
oh<00:03:51.209> one<00:03:52.049> last<00:03:52.290> thing

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
oh one last thing

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.559 
oh one last thing
the<00:03:54.829> obviously<00:03:55.829> not<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.220> same<00:03:56.370> size<00:03:56.609> so<00:03:57.150> the

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
the obviously not the same size so the

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.210 
the obviously not the same size so the
stem<00:03:57.810> inside<00:03:58.290> here<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.650> not<00:03:58.799> going<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.069> reach

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
stem inside here is not going to reach

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.240 
stem inside here is not going to reach
to<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.549> bottom<00:03:59.930> however<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.650> much<00:04:01.829> easier<00:04:02.160> to

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
to the bottom however so much easier to

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.670 
to the bottom however so much easier to
find<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.489> stem<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:03.060> fits<00:04:03.690> inside<00:04:03.900> this<00:04:04.380> then

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
find a stem that fits inside this then

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.410 
find a stem that fits inside this then
to<00:04:04.769> find<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.190> pump<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.519> fits<00:04:05.819> on<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.150> top<00:04:06.329> of

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
to find a pump that fits on the top of

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.039 
to find a pump that fits on the top of
this<00:04:06.480> bottle<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:07.650> eye<00:04:08.160> glasses<00:04:09.090> cleaner

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
this bottle this eye glasses cleaner

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.740 
this bottle this eye glasses cleaner
stuff<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:11.280> stem<00:04:11.609> fits<00:04:11.940> perfectly<00:04:12.359> I<00:04:12.450> tried

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
stuff this stem fits perfectly I tried

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.159 
stuff this stem fits perfectly I tried
it<00:04:12.870> before<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:13.139> put<00:04:13.349> it<00:04:13.440> in<00:04:13.639> so<00:04:14.660> when<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:15.690> finished

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
it before I put it in so when I finished

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.349 
it before I put it in so when I finished
off<00:04:16.349> this<00:04:16.620> I'm<00:04:17.220> gonna<00:04:17.489> switch<00:04:17.789> I'm<00:04:18.180> gonna

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
off this I'm gonna switch I'm gonna

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.379 
off this I'm gonna switch I'm gonna
switch<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.750> up<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.169> use<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:19.979> last<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.459> so

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
switch this up and use the last of it so

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.779 
switch this up and use the last of it so
that's<00:04:21.750> that's<00:04:22.169> so<00:04:22.890> much<00:04:23.039> easier<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.490> find<00:04:23.640> a

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
that's that's so much easier to find a

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:24.800 
that's that's so much easier to find a
stem<00:04:24.150> that's

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
stem that's

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.650 
stem that's
fit<00:04:25.550> with<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.669> pump<00:04:26.880> that<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.240> gonna<00:04:27.419> find

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
fit with the pump that it is gonna find

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.180 
fit with the pump that it is gonna find
a<00:04:27.720> pump<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.080> fits<00:04:28.230> at<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.410> bottle<00:04:28.710> if<00:04:29.010> that

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
a pump that fits at the bottle if that

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.720 
a pump that fits at the bottle if that
makes<00:04:29.340> sense

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
makes sense

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.240 
makes sense
probably<00:04:30.090> does<00:04:30.270> but<00:04:31.260> yes<00:04:31.380> so<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.740> hope<00:04:32.010> this

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
probably does but yes so I hope this

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.020 
probably does but yes so I hope this
helps

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
helps

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.590 
helps
I<00:04:33.060> hope<00:04:33.720> you<00:04:33.870> guys<00:04:34.190> can<00:04:35.190> get<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.120> hold<00:04:36.389> of<00:04:36.510> this

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
I hope you guys can get a hold of this

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.020 
I hope you guys can get a hold of this
and<00:04:37.280> transform<00:04:38.280> your<00:04:38.430> bottle<00:04:38.730> because

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
and transform your bottle because

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.909 
and transform your bottle because
there's<00:04:39.960> nothing<00:04:40.169> better<00:04:40.470> than<00:04:40.620> having<00:04:40.740> a

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
there's nothing better than having a

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.650 
there's nothing better than having a
pump<00:04:41.100> on<00:04:41.190> your<00:04:41.250> foundation<00:04:41.940> I<00:04:42.120> think<00:04:42.480> we<00:04:42.540> all

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
pump on your foundation I think we all

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.930 
pump on your foundation I think we all
agree
