is really what kind of attracted me to
this<00:00:52.469> game<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.429> it<00:00:53.699> looks<00:00:53.940> absolutely

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
this game I think it looks absolutely

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.219 
this game I think it looks absolutely
delicious<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:59.749> yeah<00:01:00.749> I<00:01:00.780> really<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
delicious you and yeah I really like the

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.160 
delicious you and yeah I really like the
pixel<00:01:01.530> art<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.069> I<00:01:02.129> think<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.399> kind<00:01:02.519> of<00:01:02.640> cool

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
pixel art and I think it's kind of cool

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.840 
pixel art and I think it's kind of cool
but<00:01:04.170> other<00:01:04.590> than<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.280> gameplay<00:01:05.640> is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
but other than that the gameplay is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.820 
but other than that the gameplay is
really<00:01:06.180> kind<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.660> one<00:01:06.840> lohan<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.470> think<00:01:07.710> you've

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
really kind of one lohan I think you've

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.260 
really kind of one lohan I think you've
probably<00:01:08.130> played<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.730> before<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:09.120> you<00:01:09.240> haven't

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
probably played it before if you haven't

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
probably played it before if you haven't
then<00:01:09.660> this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.080> probably<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.560> one<00:01:10.980> to<00:01:11.160> get

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
then this is probably the one to get

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.560 
then this is probably the one to get
into<00:01:11.430> because<00:01:11.790> ok<00:01:12.800> visuals<00:01:13.800> are<00:01:13.920> pretty<00:01:14.130> nice

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
into because ok visuals are pretty nice

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.670 
into because ok visuals are pretty nice
the<00:01:15.570> whole<00:01:15.660> idea<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.200> keep<00:01:16.440> going

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
the whole idea is that you keep going

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.710 
the whole idea is that you keep going
and<00:01:16.950> keep<00:01:17.040> going<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.910> you<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.480> top<00:01:18.570> of

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and keep going and you see at the top of

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.600 
and keep going and you see at the top of
the<00:01:18.840> screen<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.290> you've<00:01:19.470> got<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.830> that

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the screen there you've got that that

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.670 
the screen there you've got that that
bar<00:01:20.850> that's<00:01:21.120> steadily<00:01:21.720> ticking<00:01:22.050> down<00:01:22.260> well

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
bar that's steadily ticking down well

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.080 
bar that's steadily ticking down well
essentially<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.550> can<00:01:23.580> refill<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.300> by<00:01:25.200> during

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
essentially you can refill it by during

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.760 
essentially you can refill it by during
eaten<00:01:27.090> food<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.630> staying<00:01:27.960> alive<00:01:28.260> like<00:01:28.590> that

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
eaten food and staying alive like that

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.750 
eaten food and staying alive like that
and<00:01:30.560> yeah<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.830> then<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.100> compete<00:01:32.580> with<00:01:32.670> your

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760
