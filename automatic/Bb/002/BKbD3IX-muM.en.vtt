 but from the computer 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:23.030

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.040
 I did some good features I do not know 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.220

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.830
 person or something 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.830

 minutes do you do it to see I know 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:05.389
 realistic 

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:08.989
 I'm not going to say what I'm going to do 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:11.869
 crazy things I spent those minutes 

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:15.409
