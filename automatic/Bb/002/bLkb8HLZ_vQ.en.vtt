pretty<00:03:49.290> handy<00:03:49.590> it's<00:03:49.709> a<00:03:49.739> great<00:03:49.920> way<00:03:50.040> to

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
pretty handy it's a great way to

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.070 
pretty handy it's a great way to
organize<00:03:50.459> things<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.570> can<00:03:51.720> move<00:03:51.959> things

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
organize things and you can move things

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.570 
organize things and you can move things
into<00:03:52.290> folders<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.739> can<00:03:52.800> also<00:03:52.950> just<00:03:53.250> hide<00:03:53.430> them

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
into folders you can also just hide them

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.120 
into folders you can also just hide them
because<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:53.880> don't<00:03:54.030> normally<00:03:54.120> use<00:03:54.450> them

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130

there's<00:03:56.130> an<00:03:56.280> accelerometer<00:03:56.670> as<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.180> mentioned

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
there's an accelerometer as I mentioned

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.680 
there's an accelerometer as I mentioned
earlier<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.830> means<00:03:59.400> that<00:03:59.690> everything

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
earlier and that means that everything

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.780 
earlier and that means that everything

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
firmware that's on the storm is that

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.449 
firmware that's on the storm is that
it's<00:04:06.600> just<00:04:06.870> not<00:04:06.930> very<00:04:07.230> fast<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.950> rotating

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
it's just not very fast and rotating

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.860 
it's just not very fast and rotating
well<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:08.940> seems<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.209> be<00:04:09.330> working<00:04:09.450> quite<00:04:09.840> well
