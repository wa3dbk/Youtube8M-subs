basic principles for lighting a fire
first<00:00:46.270> try<00:00:47.270> to<00:00:47.329> site<00:00:47.629> your<00:00:47.809> fire<00:00:48.079> where<00:00:48.620> you

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
first try to site your fire where you

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.900 
first try to site your fire where you
have<00:00:48.920> access<00:00:49.129> to<00:00:49.579> fuel<00:00:50.410> very<00:00:51.410> important

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
between success or failure at fire

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.999 
between success or failure at fire
lighting<00:01:40.869> but<00:01:41.869> most<00:01:42.110> importantly<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.890> all

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
lighting but most importantly of all

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.580 
lighting but most importantly of all
when<00:01:43.549> I<00:01:43.579> light<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.119> fire<00:01:44.360> these<00:01:44.930> logs<00:01:45.350> will

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
when I light the fire these logs will

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.550 
when I light the fire these logs will
begin<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.100> burn<00:01:46.340> early<00:01:47.030> on<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:47.689> create<00:01:48.020> embers

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
begin to burn early on to create embers

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.620 
begin to burn early on to create embers
and<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:48.799> good<00:01:49.040> heart<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.640> fire<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:50.360> makes

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
and a good heart to the fire that makes

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.730 
and a good heart to the fire that makes
it<00:01:50.840> certain<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.530> start<00:01:51.829> and<00:01:52.009> light<00:01:52.220> properly

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
it certain to start and light properly

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.850 
it certain to start and light properly
the<00:01:54.740> next<00:01:55.040> step<00:01:55.270> is<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.899> provide<00:01:57.680> ourselves

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
the next step is to provide ourselves

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.550 
the next step is to provide ourselves
with<00:01:58.100> kindling<00:01:58.700> little<00:01:59.360> thin<00:01:59.899> dead<00:02:00.229> twigs

dry<00:02:23.930> moss<00:02:24.290> anything<00:02:25.160> like<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.370> but<00:02:26.150> one<00:02:26.330> of

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
dry moss anything like that but one of

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.780 
dry moss anything like that but one of
the<00:02:26.510> best<00:02:26.750> things<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.230> all<00:02:27.380> is<00:02:27.620> birch<00:02:28.280> bark<00:02:28.610> and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
the best things of all is birch bark and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.030 
the best things of all is birch bark and
I've<00:02:28.940> got<00:02:29.090> an<00:02:29.180> old<00:02:29.360> rotten<00:02:30.140> log<00:02:30.380> here<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.890> can

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
I've got an old rotten log here you can

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.580 
I've got an old rotten log here you can
see<00:02:31.160> how<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.310> wood<00:02:31.519> is<00:02:31.670> rotted<00:02:32.290> but<00:02:33.290> not<00:02:33.470> the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
see how the wood is rotted but not the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.949 
see how the wood is rotted but not the
bark<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.430> reason<00:02:34.819> for<00:02:34.849> that<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.750> the

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
bark and the reason for that is that the

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.390 
bark and the reason for that is that the
bark<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:36.620> full<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:37.010> oil

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
bark is full of oil

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.979 
bark is full of oil
that's<00:02:37.760> preservative<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.360> that<00:02:38.480> all<00:02:38.599> burns

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
that's preservative and that all burns

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.440 
that's preservative and that all burns
extremely<00:02:39.709> well<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.549> this<00:02:40.760> will<00:02:40.940> make<00:02:41.120> very

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
extremely well so this will make very

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.440 
extremely well so this will make very
good<00:02:41.569> tinder<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.650> fill<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.040> gap<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:44.360> I'll

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
good tinder to fill that gap and I'll

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.539 
good tinder to fill that gap and I'll
just<00:02:44.690> shred<00:02:45.019> that<00:02:45.200> down<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:45.980> it's<00:02:46.130> nice<00:02:46.280> and

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
just shred that down so it's nice and

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.509 
just shred that down so it's nice and
thin<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.450> will<00:02:47.599> take<00:02:47.840> very<00:02:48.230> easily<00:02:48.500> from<00:02:49.310> the

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
thin and will take very easily from the

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.850 
thin and will take very easily from the
small<00:02:50.360> flame<00:02:50.660> I'll<00:02:50.840> introduce<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.590> park

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
small flame I'll introduce to the park

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:16.650 
small flame I'll introduce to the park
for<00:02:52.519> ignition

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.070 

the<00:03:17.660> next<00:03:17.960> thing<00:03:18.140> is<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.440> get<00:03:18.710> ready<00:03:19.420> fuel<00:03:20.420> so

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
the next thing is to get ready fuel so

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.200 
the next thing is to get ready fuel so
add<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.500> kindling<00:03:21.950> once<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.610> have<00:03:22.730> ignited

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
add to the kindling once I have ignited

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.510 
add to the kindling once I have ignited
the<00:03:23.330> kindling<00:03:23.720> this<00:03:24.710> goes<00:03:24.980> up<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.190> little

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
the kindling this goes up to little

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.040 
the kindling this goes up to little
finger<00:03:25.820> thickness<00:03:26.210> I<00:03:26.390> won't<00:03:26.660> need<00:03:26.780> any<00:03:27.020> more

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
finger thickness I won't need any more

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.540 
finger thickness I won't need any more
than<00:03:27.200> that<00:03:27.380> for<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.650> time<00:03:27.860> being<00:03:28.100> there's

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
than that for the time being there's

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.070

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
so what I'll do now is drop the sparks

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.580 
so what I'll do now is drop the sparks
onto<00:04:37.270> these<00:04:37.389> shavings<00:04:37.660> when<00:04:38.260> they<00:04:38.380> catch

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
onto these shavings when they catch

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.310 
onto these shavings when they catch
light<00:04:38.919> I'll<00:04:39.130> move<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:39.880> flames<00:04:40.300> in<00:04:40.570> under<00:04:41.199> the
