Mack's<00:00:06.690> hammer<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.170> lie<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.649> sickle<00:00:07.919> was

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
Mack's hammer is lie and the sickle was

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.970 
Mack's hammer is lie and the sickle was
definitely<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.849> gnarliest<00:00:09.240> one<00:00:09.980> it's

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
definitely the gnarliest one it's

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.860 
definitely the gnarliest one it's
usually<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.370> line<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.820> takes<00:00:12.090> rappelling<00:00:12.660> and

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
usually a line that takes rappelling and

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.360 
usually a line that takes rappelling and
it<00:00:13.290> looked<00:00:13.440> like<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.650> could<00:00:13.679> ski<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.099> without

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
it looked like you could ski it without

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:26.210 
it looked like you could ski it without
ropes<00:00:23.600> after<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.840> few<00:00:25.260> recon<00:00:25.560> missions<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
ropes after a few recon missions and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.370 
ropes after a few recon missions and
just<00:00:26.400> staring<00:00:26.820> at<00:00:26.910> Mount<00:00:27.090> Moran<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.289> so

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
just staring at Mount Moran is just so

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.740 
just staring at Mount Moran is just so
obvious<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:29.160> was<00:00:29.939> kind<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.300> next<00:00:30.449> goal

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
obvious that was kind of the next goal

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.089 
obvious that was kind of the next goal
that<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.140> was<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> place<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.590> go

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that that was the place to go

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.190 
that that was the place to go
but<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> problem<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.910> during<00:00:33.329> winter<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:33.930> a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
but the problem is during winter it's a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.170 
but the problem is during winter it's a
six<00:00:34.530> mile<00:00:34.680> approach<00:00:35.100> across<00:00:35.340> Lake<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
six mile approach across Lake just to

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.060 
six mile approach across Lake just to
get<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> base<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.960> Oh<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.559> cuz<00:00:37.860> this

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
get to the base of it Oh see cuz this

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.850 
get to the base of it Oh see cuz this
broke<00:00:38.489> okay<00:00:38.940> here's<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.629> problem<00:00:39.860> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
broke okay here's the problem the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.619 
broke okay here's the problem the
logistical<00:00:41.430> side<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.790> things<00:00:42.000> people<00:00:42.420> might

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
logistical side of things people might

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.779 
logistical side of things people might
not<00:00:42.780> always<00:00:43.020> realize<00:00:43.440> how<00:00:43.800> complicated<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.550> to

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
not always realize how complicated is to

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.029 
not always realize how complicated is to
film<00:00:45.059> something<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:46.170> far<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.620> there<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
film something that far out there in the

film something that far out there in the
national<00:00:47.460> park<00:00:48.920> camping<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.039> winter<00:00:50.219> like

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
national park camping in the winter like

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.430 
national park camping in the winter like
you<00:00:50.670> need<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> lot<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.270> stuff<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.840> had<00:00:51.989> help<00:00:52.289> from

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
you need a lot of stuff we had help from

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
you need a lot of stuff we had help from
bunch<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.829> porters<00:00:53.219> who<00:00:53.489> came<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.360> mean

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
bunch of porters who came in and I mean

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.819 
bunch of porters who came in and I mean
we<00:00:54.719> could<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:54.899> done<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> by<00:00:55.320> ourselves<00:00:55.469> for

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
we could have done it by ourselves for

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:05.899 
we could have done it by ourselves for
sure<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.430> were<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.329> key<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:05.760> was<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
sure they were like really key it was a

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.490 
sure they were like really key it was a
full-on<00:01:06.240> undertaking<00:01:07.020> but<00:01:07.140> once<00:01:07.350> you're

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
full-on undertaking but once you're

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.200 
full-on undertaking but once you're
there<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.920> you're<00:01:07.979> established<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.820> these

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
there and you're established all these

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.060 
there and you're established all these
lines<00:01:09.450> are<00:01:09.750> literally<00:01:10.320> out<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.710> front<00:01:10.920> door

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
lines are literally out the front door

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.060 
lines are literally out the front door
of<00:01:11.100> your<00:01:11.310> tent<00:01:11.869> you<00:01:12.869> made<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.170> plan<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
of your tent you made this plan for the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.620 
of your tent you made this plan for the
first<00:01:14.250> sunny<00:01:14.460> day<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> trip<00:01:15.119> we'd<00:01:15.509> have

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
first sunny day of the trip we'd have

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.359 
first sunny day of the trip we'd have
three<00:01:16.020> different<00:01:16.170> crews<00:01:16.619> go<00:01:16.920> into<00:01:17.130> three

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
three different crews go into three

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.800 
three different crews go into three
different<00:01:17.490> parts<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> mountains<00:01:18.509> leaving

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
different parts of the mountains leaving

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.719 
different parts of the mountains leaving
at<00:01:19.049> three<00:01:19.259> different<00:01:19.380> times<00:01:19.770> when<00:01:20.430> planning

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
at three different times when planning

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.249 
at three different times when planning
our<00:01:20.850> day<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.180> kind<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.420> picked<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> time<00:01:22.140> we

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
our day we kind of picked the time we

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.929 
our day we kind of picked the time we
wanted<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> drop<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.340> then<00:01:23.430> work<00:01:23.640> backwards

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
wanted to drop and then work backwards

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.240 
wanted to drop and then work backwards
and<00:01:24.420> kind<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.780> guessed<00:01:25.080> when<00:01:25.830> everybody

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
and kind of guessed when everybody

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.060 
and kind of guessed when everybody
should<00:01:26.490> start

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.310 

Mack's<00:01:33.790> hammer<00:01:34.060> is<00:01:34.270> lying<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.750> sickle<00:01:35.170> was

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
Mack's hammer is lying the sickle was

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.500 
Mack's hammer is lying the sickle was
definitely<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:35.950> gnarliest<00:01:36.310> one<00:01:36.670> it's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
definitely the gnarliest one it's

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.420 
definitely the gnarliest one it's
usually<00:01:37.720> a<00:01:37.930> line<00:01:38.170> that<00:01:38.380> takes<00:01:38.620> rappelling<00:01:39.190> and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
usually a line that takes rappelling and

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.040 
usually a line that takes rappelling and
luckily<00:01:40.030> we've<00:01:40.270> had<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.420> lot<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:40.630> really<00:01:40.870> good

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
luckily we've had a lot of really good

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.600 
luckily we've had a lot of really good
snow<00:01:41.320> and<00:01:41.620> it<00:01:41.800> looked<00:01:41.950> like<00:01:42.040> you<00:01:42.160> get<00:01:42.310> ski<00:01:42.520> it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
snow and it looked like you get ski it

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.370 
snow and it looked like you get ski it
without<00:01:42.880> ropes<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:43.960> gonna<00:01:44.050> be<00:01:44.229> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
without ropes this is gonna be the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.840 
without ropes this is gonna be the
hardest<00:01:44.650> move<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.160> afterwards<00:01:45.640> it's<00:01:45.760> gonna

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
hardest move and afterwards it's gonna

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.630 
hardest move and afterwards it's gonna
be<00:01:46.060> like<00:01:46.300> in<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.710> bottom<00:01:48.070> I<00:01:48.159> think<00:01:48.190> I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
be like in it to the bottom I think I

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.680 
be like in it to the bottom I think I
don't<00:01:48.909> think<00:01:49.030> they'll<00:01:49.150> be<00:01:49.180> shutting<00:01:49.570> it<00:01:49.660> down

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
don't think they'll be shutting it down

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.230 
don't think they'll be shutting it down
too<00:01:50.050> much<00:01:50.080> afterwards<00:01:50.740> for<00:01:51.670> all<00:01:51.820> three<00:01:52.119> of

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
too much afterwards for all three of

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.670 
too much afterwards for all three of
those<00:01:52.330> lines<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.750> go<00:01:52.840> down<00:01:53.020> like<00:01:53.350> we<00:01:53.470> had<00:01:53.590> to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
those lines to go down like we had to

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.650 
those lines to go down like we had to
have<00:01:53.770> three<00:01:54.400> different<00:01:54.729> groups<00:01:54.850> three

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
have three different groups three

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.480 
have three different groups three
different<00:01:55.990> guides<00:01:56.229> we<00:01:56.979> had<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.160> make<00:01:57.280> sure

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
different guides we had to make sure

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.830 
different guides we had to make sure
camera<00:01:57.850> crews<00:01:58.030> were<00:01:58.180> set<00:01:58.420> up<00:01:58.450> in<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:58.690> right

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
camera crews were set up in the right

camp by about 1 o'clock we had a view of
Max's<00:02:41.310> line<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:43.050> sickle<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.860> somewhat<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.460> a

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
Max's line the sickle is somewhat of a

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.700 
Max's line the sickle is somewhat of a
closeout<00:02:44.970> line<00:02:45.300> because<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.230> has<00:02:46.410> these<00:02:46.560> two

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
closeout line because it has these two

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.550 
closeout line because it has these two
parallel<00:02:47.400> chokes<00:02:47.940> at<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.510> bottom<00:02:48.870> very<00:02:49.380> much
