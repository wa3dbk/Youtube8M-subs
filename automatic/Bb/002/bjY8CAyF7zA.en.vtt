00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.849
 we have new tactics here and whole 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:11.449
 by the company 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.449
 Fox you have 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.630
 they come look 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.630
 WHO the box 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.669
 that looks quite 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.669
 it looks pretty good 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.350
 reason 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.570
 the geese are still from the processing of his 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.150
 the handling yes Teichmann that together I am totally thrilled - St 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670
 without a tip first 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.670
 either off 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.530
 or 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.600
 Plastic can be our know-how 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.670
 for the liberals 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.050
 Of course, do not lead to use 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.230
 feel 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.860
 iPhone by Heidrun Brugger and Capacitive 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 Of course that does not belong in vain 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.950
 Displays sin 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.590
 when 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.740
 that can already be used 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.320
 Zone look us 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.979
 Walls walls Hornung of the design you can already see the black but could 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.979
 a lot of luck 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.680
 beside these riots 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.650
 the very beautiful very precious made the caps 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.670
 he wants Alsace 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.670
 mechanical engineer 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.440
 because they are just the first design and workmanship 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.800
 Nobody dodges a bit more about that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.620
 to look at us 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.620
 Lehmann 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.639
 and Disney Dream Team 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.919
 so 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:32.099
 Change if you are the top house 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.480
 in the top but orbit that came very well up 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.039
 to hang around 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.529
 MultiArchive black tip screwed on 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.259
 the one at that time 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:46.229
 Baku 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:47.660
 to serve 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.499
 MÃ¼nster AK 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.359
 this triggered a tsunami 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.339
 without writing anything 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:55.939
 to the story always on 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:00.919
 Sternberg stopped I had to talk to her so mustard and still has 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.809
 additional problems that is of course bad 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.809
 that's just how the caps fall off 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.369
 the parents too 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:17.379
 analogously, they can already be increased and secured properly 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.249
 so here too 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:23.499
 Andersson was bumpy 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:26.499
 that offers really good 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.819
 all this hunger 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.819
 and here we are now 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.479
 the key scene 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.189
 For example, you see steel if that's all 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.879
 Correct! Well done 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.549
 Schmidt Tripoli 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.499
 Min r stands out from the pure 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:58.719
 Wearing Kerkhoff 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:03.149
 that it does not dry out when its year seems to have dropped Rolf 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:06.499
 the theoretically no Kappel 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:08.569
 prevent it from drying out 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.839
 that is so 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.419
 possible a Schmidt 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.219
 Take note 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:19.219
 really really great 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.779
 and corresponded 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:26.779
 Not 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.050
 s 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.050
 Residents should be many more 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:42.590
 Darfeld 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.699
 the choice will be difficult to obtain 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.559
 scary I am not sure I want to supply already 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.319
 because thus quotas
