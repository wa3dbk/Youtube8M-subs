00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.280 
shot so much and how do you mostly use
it<00:00:39.989> well<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> one-handed<00:00:42.090> slice<00:00:42.420> it's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it well with the one-handed slice it's

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410 
it well with the one-handed slice it's
great<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.860> rally<00:00:44.070> from<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> baseline<00:00:45.180> with

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
great to rally from the baseline with

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.690 
great to rally from the baseline with
the<00:00:45.539> slice<00:00:45.809> because<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.100> keep<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.489> ball

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the slice because you can keep the ball

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.350 
the slice because you can keep the ball
so<00:00:47.969> deep<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:49.160> once<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.520> good<00:00:50.820> depth<00:00:51.120> on

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
so deep and once you get good depth on

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.389 
so deep and once you get good depth on
the<00:00:51.510> ball<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.020> plus<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.500> you've<00:00:52.680> sliced<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the ball and plus if you've sliced it a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.410 
the ball and plus if you've sliced it a
good<00:00:53.699> compact<00:00:54.329> solid<00:00:55.289> slice<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:56.010> skids<00:00:56.579> so

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
good compact solid slice it skids so

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.209 
good compact solid slice it skids so
it's<00:00:57.600> very<00:00:57.719> difficult<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.410> your<00:00:58.680> opponents

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
it's very difficult for your opponents

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.880 
it's very difficult for your opponents
to<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.550> much<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.090> ball<00:01:00.510> also<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.559> can

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
to do much with that ball also you can

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.039 
to do much with that ball also you can
use<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.550> return<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.090> serve<00:01:03.329> someone<00:01:03.930> has

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
use it for a return of serve someone has

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.359 
use it for a return of serve someone has
a<00:01:04.080> big<00:01:04.379> serve<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:05.720> slice<00:01:06.720> or<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> block<00:01:07.470> return<00:01:08.100> or

a big serve a slice or a block return or

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.399 
a big serve a slice or a block return or
the<00:01:08.400> backhand<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.450> you're<00:01:09.570> not<00:01:09.689> taking<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.200> you

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the backhand so you're not taking it you

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.130 
the backhand so you're not taking it you
swing<00:01:10.799> swing<00:01:11.460> when<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> take<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> ball<00:01:12.900> on

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the rise and if you hit it properly and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.910 
the rise and if you hit it properly and
I<00:01:15.869> said<00:01:16.080> well<00:01:16.229> put<00:01:16.409> your<00:01:16.650> stroke<00:01:18.439> we<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
I said well put your stroke we think the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.130 
I said well put your stroke we think the
key<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.310> really<00:01:20.670> getting<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.060> driving<00:01:21.869> that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
key is to really getting it driving that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.560 
key is to really getting it driving that
I<00:01:22.380> find<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.280> even<00:01:23.549> with<00:01:23.820> myself<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> lot

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
I find that even with myself and a lot

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.030 
I find that even with myself and a lot
of<00:01:24.689> students<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.170> teach<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.650> know<00:01:25.710> sometimes

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
it floats too much what's the key to

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.050 
it floats too much what's the key to
make<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.229> drive<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:29.040> nice<00:01:29.310> well<00:01:29.729> you've

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
make it drive really nice well you've
