on the Scotch opening so on this video
I'm<00:00:11.860> going<00:00:11.980> to<00:00:12.040> show<00:00:12.219> you

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
I'm going to show you

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.400 
I'm going to show you
theoretically<00:00:13.330> how<00:00:13.540> you<00:00:13.599> get<00:00:13.870> to<00:00:14.019> the<00:00:14.110> scotch

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
theoretically how you get to the scotch

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.749 
theoretically how you get to the scotch
and<00:00:14.710> then<00:00:14.980> I'll<00:00:15.130> show<00:00:15.280> you<00:00:15.309> a<00:00:15.400> little<00:00:15.580> bit<00:00:15.730> of

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:15.759 
and then I'll show you a little bit of

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.109 
and then I'll show you a little bit of
theory<00:00:16.090> so<00:00:16.270> let's<00:00:16.420> get<00:00:16.570> started<00:00:16.960> after<00:00:17.259> you<00:00:17.349> 45

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
theory so let's get started after you 45

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.929 
theory so let's get started after you 45
out<00:00:19.119> of<00:00:19.350> 396<00:00:20.350> d<00:00:20.830> 4<00:00:21.160> this<00:00:21.310> is<00:00:21.369> the<00:00:21.640> mother

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
out of 396 d 4 this is the mother

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.670 
out of 396 d 4 this is the mother
position<00:00:22.570> of<00:00:22.689> the<00:00:22.779> Scotch<00:00:23.080> opening<00:00:23.500> and<00:00:23.590> what

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
position of the Scotch opening and what

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.929 
position of the Scotch opening and what
could<00:00:23.830> we<00:00:23.920> say<00:00:23.949> about<00:00:24.100> the<00:00:24.430> opening

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
could we say about the opening

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.029 
could we say about the opening
well<00:00:25.480> basically<00:00:25.689> garry<00:00:26.170> kasparov<00:00:26.320> who<00:00:26.830> is

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
well basically garry kasparov who is

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.099 
well basically garry kasparov who is
considered<00:00:27.490> to<00:00:27.580> be<00:00:27.699> by<00:00:27.880> many<00:00:28.119> are<00:00:28.449> one<00:00:28.660> the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
considered to be by many are one the

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.599 
considered to be by many are one the
best<00:00:29.320> player<00:00:29.619> that<00:00:29.650> ever<00:00:30.039> that<00:00:30.340> has<00:00:30.460> ever

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
best player that ever that has ever

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.990 
best player that ever that has ever
played<00:00:30.880> chess<00:00:31.119> he<00:00:31.900> has<00:00:32.080> said<00:00:32.379> that<00:00:32.670> the<00:00:33.670> Scotch

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
played chess he has said that the Scotch

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.240 
played chess he has said that the Scotch
is<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.390> only<00:00:34.540> real<00:00:34.840> alternative<00:00:35.020> to<00:00:35.649> the<00:00:35.950> real

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
is the only real alternative to the real

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.860 
is the only real alternative to the real
openness<00:00:36.670> to<00:00:36.790> gain<00:00:36.969> an<00:00:37.059> advantage<00:00:37.180> as<00:00:37.630> white

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
openness to gain an advantage as white

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.619 
openness to gain an advantage as white
so<00:00:38.559> with<00:00:39.010> that<00:00:39.160> said<00:00:39.489> black<00:00:39.969> typically<00:00:40.390> plays

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
so with that said black typically plays

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.319 
so with that said black typically plays
pawn<00:00:41.050> takes<00:00:41.350> d4<00:00:41.770> Knight<00:00:42.070> takes<00:00:42.309> d4<00:00:42.700> now<00:00:43.270> the

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
pawn takes d4 Knight takes d4 now the

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.479 
pawn takes d4 Knight takes d4 now the
main<00:00:43.570> move<00:00:43.780> is<00:00:43.899> Knight<00:00:44.079> of<00:00:44.230> 6<00:00:44.440> but<00:00:44.829> black<00:00:45.250> has

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
main move is Knight of 6 but black has

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.880 
main move is Knight of 6 but black has
some<00:00:45.670> alternatives<00:00:46.360> Bishop<00:00:47.079> c5<00:00:47.469> is<00:00:47.710> one

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
some alternatives Bishop c5 is one

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.810 
some alternatives Bishop c5 is one
Bishop<00:00:48.430> b4<00:00:48.969> is<00:00:49.180> one<00:00:49.390> and<00:00:49.860> Queen<00:00:50.860> to<00:00:51.070> h4<00:00:51.489> is<00:00:51.640> the

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
Bishop b4 is one and Queen to h4 is the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.100 
Bishop b4 is one and Queen to h4 is the
other<00:00:51.940> one<00:00:52.149> so<00:00:52.329> let's<00:00:52.510> go<00:00:52.629> ahead<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:52.899> start

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
other one so let's go ahead and start

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.600 
other one so let's go ahead and start
off<00:00:53.230> with<00:00:53.440> clink<00:00:53.680> to<00:00:53.770> H<00:00:53.860> force<00:00:54.160> is<00:00:54.309> probably

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
off with clink to H force is probably

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.150 
off with clink to H force is probably
the<00:00:54.730> worst<00:00:54.969> of<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.270> alternatives<00:00:55.809> this<00:00:56.410> is<00:00:56.680> a

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
the worst of the alternatives this is a

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.010 
the worst of the alternatives this is a
hyper<00:00:57.579> aggressive<00:00:57.850> way<00:00:58.360> of<00:00:58.420> playing<00:00:58.719> it<00:00:58.930> was

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
hyper aggressive way of playing it was

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.939 
hyper aggressive way of playing it was
developed<00:00:59.800> by<00:01:00.270> William<00:01:01.270> stain<00:01:01.719> it's<00:01:01.899> but<00:01:02.559> ok

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
developed by William stain it's but ok

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.010 
developed by William stain it's but ok
here<00:01:03.160> we<00:01:03.280> take<00:01:03.430> if<00:01:03.579> we<00:01:03.609> play<00:01:03.879> Knight<00:01:04.119> c3<00:01:04.360> Bishop

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
here we take if we play Knight c3 Bishop

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.560 
here we take if we play Knight c3 Bishop
b4<00:01:05.440> Bishop<00:01:05.800> e2<00:01:05.920> and<00:01:06.280> here<00:01:06.729> black<00:01:07.000> has<00:01:07.030> two

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
b4 Bishop e2 and here black has two

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.399 
b4 Bishop e2 and here black has two
variations<00:01:07.869> he<00:01:08.320> could<00:01:08.470> capture<00:01:08.710> on<00:01:09.010> c3<00:01:10.409> after

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
variations he could capture on c3 after

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.660 
variations he could capture on c3 after
which<00:01:12.060> wiped<00:01:13.060> his<00:01:13.270> castles<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:13.990> White<00:01:14.740> has

Bishop a5 and Bishop e7 but these are

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.640 
Bishop a5 and Bishop e7 but these are
both<00:02:30.210> mistakes<00:02:31.210> if<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:31.930> should<00:02:32.080> be<00:02:32.170> 7<00:02:32.500> then

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
both mistakes if this should be 7 then

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.960 
both mistakes if this should be 7 then

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
this position is better for white

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.320 
this position is better for white
because<00:02:44.200> after<00:02:44.530> d6<00:02:45.010> notice<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.520> d5<00:02:45.940> can't<00:02:46.210> be

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.670 
played after these 60s or our bishop on
d3<00:02:49.270> is<00:02:49.570> better<00:02:49.750> placed<00:02:50.020> in<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.230> bishop<00:02:50.530> money

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
d3 is better placed in the bishop money

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.560 
d3 is better placed in the bishop money
7<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.130> as<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.250> result<00:02:51.640> we<00:02:51.730> have<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.970> advantage

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
7 and as a result we have the advantage

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.460 
7 and as a result we have the advantage
so<00:02:53.020> going<00:02:53.230> back<00:02:54.690> another<00:02:55.690> alternative<00:02:56.320> here

white<00:04:21.910> should<00:04:22.150> be<00:04:22.270> inferior<00:04:22.660> but<00:04:23.470> if<00:04:23.710> white<00:04:24.039> is

capable of developing his pieces he
should<00:04:27.729> be<00:04:27.850> better<00:04:28.030> because<00:04:28.300> he<00:04:28.539> has<00:04:28.660> about

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020

structure<00:04:29.470> so<00:04:29.620> let's<00:04:29.650> see<00:04:29.919> how<00:04:30.009> that<00:04:30.069> pans<00:04:30.370> out

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
structure so let's see how that pans out

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.029

typically<00:04:31.539> where<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:31.780> plays<00:04:31.990> d5<00:04:32.410> here<00:04:32.680> black

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
typically where it plays d5 here black

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.020 
typically where it plays d5 here black
will<00:04:33.220> play<00:04:33.250> cleaning<00:04:34.020> 722<00:04:35.020> now<00:04:35.319> Knight<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.710> d5

will play cleaning 722 now Knight to d5
here<00:04:37.030> white<00:04:37.270> usually<00:04:37.690> plays<00:04:37.960> c4<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:38.860> now<00:04:39.370> it's

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
here white usually plays c4 and now it's

play Queen 12 to Bishop to a3 and

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.960 
play Queen 12 to Bishop to a3 and

result black started playing g5 and

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.370 
result black started playing g5 and
white<00:05:06.789> would<00:05:06.940> continue<00:05:07.449> with<00:05:07.599> g3<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.289> we

white would continue with g3 and we

white would continue with g3 and we

enter a variation where basically we

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.629 
enter a variation where basically we
play<00:05:12.069> an<00:05:12.130> endgame<00:05:12.430> where<00:05:14.039> there<00:05:15.039> is<00:05:15.190> equal
