00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
going to tie a knot all right here just

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.530 
going to tie a knot all right here just

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
like that and then we're going to tie

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.660 
like that and then we're going to tie
off<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.990> end

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
off the end

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.540 
off the end
now<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.730> reason<00:02:44.240> I'm<00:02:44.360> doing<00:02:44.600> this<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:46.250> not

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
now the reason I'm doing this and not

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.860 
now the reason I'm doing this and not
just<00:02:46.730> going<00:02:46.970> straight<00:02:47.360> through<00:02:51.160> is<00:02:52.160> because

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
just going straight through is because

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.050 
just going straight through is because
once<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.020> tie<00:02:54.260> this<00:02:54.320> up<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:55.520> gives<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.970> a

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
once you tie this up it gives it a

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.690 
once you tie this up it gives it a
little<00:02:56.240> lip<00:02:56.600> in<00:02:56.780> here<00:02:57.050> so<00:02:57.200> like<00:02:57.410> your<00:02:58.250> pet<00:02:58.490> cake

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700
