you guys silvering and I'm just giving
you<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:03.290> comparison<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.740> first<00:00:05.640> gen<00:00:05.910> itouch

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
you a comparison of the first gen itouch

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.870 
you a comparison of the first gen itouch
to<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.870> second<00:00:07.200> gen<00:00:07.379> ipod<00:00:07.740> touch<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.309> know

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
to the second gen ipod touch I know

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.060 
to the second gen ipod touch I know
there's<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.240> lot<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.650> comparison<00:00:10.650> videos<00:00:10.920> out

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
there's a lot of comparison videos out

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.589 
there's a lot of comparison videos out
there<00:00:11.099> but<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.519> just<00:00:11.700> figured<00:00:12.000> out<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.120> would<00:00:12.389> do

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
there but I just figured out I would do

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.010 
there but I just figured out I would do
one<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.809> us<00:00:13.049> do<00:00:13.590> one<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.799> my<00:00:14.009> my<00:00:14.700> own<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.719> first

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
one of us do one of my my own so first

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.220 
one of us do one of my my own so first
of<00:00:16.230> all<00:00:16.350> because<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.279> can<00:00:17.490> see<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.750> ipod

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
of all because you can see the ipod

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.010 
of all because you can see the ipod
touch<00:00:19.590> 2nd<00:00:20.279> gen<00:00:20.460> looks<00:00:20.670> way<00:00:20.939> thinner<00:00:21.270> tell<00:00:21.840> you

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
touch 2nd gen looks way thinner tell you

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.580 
touch 2nd gen looks way thinner tell you
truth<00:00:22.230> guys<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:22.800> not<00:00:23.160> thinner<00:00:23.640> because<00:00:24.590> it

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
truth guys it's not thinner because it

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.580 
truth guys it's not thinner because it
has<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> curved<00:00:26.430> back<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.269> then<00:00:28.170> from<00:00:28.529> here

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
has a curved back and then from here

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.859 
has a curved back and then from here
it's<00:00:29.279> maybe<00:00:29.609> like<00:00:29.699> two<00:00:30.060> millimeters<00:00:30.660> thick

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
it's maybe like two millimeters thick

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.200 
it's maybe like two millimeters thick
i'm<00:00:31.050> not<00:00:31.230> sure<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:32.489> not<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.969> it's

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
i'm not sure but it's not it's it's

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.959 
i'm not sure but it's not it's it's
thicker<00:00:33.570> actually<00:00:34.280> see<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.460> look<00:00:35.610> here<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
thicker actually see it look here is

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.860 
thicker actually see it look here is
comparison<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.030> kind<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.690> it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
comparison so you can kind of see it

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.600 
comparison so you can kind of see it
right<00:00:40.079> there<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:41.070> kinda<00:00:41.340> hard<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.579> tell

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
um this one this the first gen kind of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.380 
um this one this the first gen kind of
scratch<00:00:46.440> back<00:00:46.710> foot<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.969> see<00:00:48.149> it

taller<00:01:25.860> than<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> second<00:01:26.700> gen<00:01:26.850> maybe<00:01:27.090> like

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
taller than the second gen maybe like

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
that angle it looks like it is taller

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.760 
that angle it looks like it is taller
but<00:01:37.890> from<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.400> angle<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.150> looks<00:01:40.110> way<00:01:40.439> taller

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
but from this angle it looks way taller

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.170 
but from this angle it looks way taller
will<00:01:41.159> not<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.610> taller<00:01:42.229> it's<00:01:43.229> maybe<00:01:43.890> about<00:01:44.180> as

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
will not be taller it's maybe about as

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.600 
will not be taller it's maybe about as
you<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.420> see<00:01:45.630> they're<00:01:46.409> both<00:01:46.649> flat<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
you can see they're both flat on the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.080 
you can see they're both flat on the
ground<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:48.149> my<00:01:48.509> best<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:50.159> 2<00:01:50.460> g's<00:01:50.729> taller

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
ground on my best and the 2 g's taller

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.969 
ground on my best and the 2 g's taller
about<00:01:51.390> about<00:01:51.930> maybe<00:01:52.350> two<00:01:52.799> or<00:01:52.829> three

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
about about maybe two or three

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.969 
about about maybe two or three
millimeters<00:01:53.850> another<00:01:54.810> difference<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.560> peep

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
millimeters another difference that peep

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.469 
millimeters another difference that peep
I<00:01:56.219> don't<00:01:56.399> think<00:01:56.460> people<00:01:56.880> are<00:01:56.969> recognized<00:01:57.329> as

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
I don't think people are recognized as

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.660 
I don't think people are recognized as
much<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> home<00:01:58.229> button<00:01:58.439> see<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.549> can

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
much is the home button see as you can

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.730 
much is the home button see as you can
see<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.909> looks<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.240> same<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:01.530> if<00:02:01.649> you

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
see it looks the same but then if you

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.060 
see it looks the same but then if you
click<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> first<00:02:02.369> gen<00:02:03.860> click<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
click it on the first gen click on the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.900 
click it on the first gen click on the
second<00:02:05.490> gen<00:02:06.049> feels<00:02:07.049> like<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.350> second<00:02:07.770> gen<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
second gen feels like the second gen the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.850 
second gen feels like the second gen the
second<00:02:09.509> gen<00:02:09.660> home<00:02:09.899> button<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.289> bigger<00:02:10.500> like<00:02:10.709> if

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
second gen home button is bigger like if

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.350 
second gen home button is bigger like if
you<00:02:10.950> put<00:02:11.129> your<00:02:11.160> boat<00:02:11.489> two<00:02:11.760> thumbs<00:02:11.940> there<00:02:12.239> it

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.309 
you put your boat two thumbs there it
feels<00:02:12.510> like<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.840> second

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
feels like the second

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.170 
feels like the second
and<00:02:13.379> home<00:02:13.560> buttons<00:02:13.920> bigger<00:02:14.129> bite<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:15.109> also<00:02:16.109> i

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
and home buttons bigger bite it also i

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:32.330 
and home buttons bigger bite it also i
sway<00:02:24.799> Suites<00:02:28.670> second<00:02:29.670> gen<00:02:29.969> is<00:02:30.269> a<00:02:30.680> bit<00:02:31.680> taller

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
sway Suites second gen is a bit taller

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.589 
sway Suites second gen is a bit taller
than<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.700> point<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.599> view<00:02:33.859> also<00:02:35.329> another<00:02:36.329> big

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
than that point of view also another big

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.599 
than that point of view also another big
difference<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.200> 2g<00:02:38.129> has<00:02:38.819> internal<00:02:39.689> speakers

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
difference is 2g has internal speakers

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:55.670 
difference is 2g has internal speakers
so<00:02:41.609> let<00:02:41.849> me<00:02:41.909> choose<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> song<00:02:42.450> here<00:02:54.199> closer<00:02:55.199> by

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
so let me choose a song here closer by

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.580 
so let me choose a song here closer by
neil<00:02:55.919> has<00:02:56.609> internal<00:02:57.120> speakers<00:03:00.590> somewhere

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
neil has internal speakers somewhere

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.470 
neil has internal speakers somewhere
located<00:03:02.219> in<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.400> bottom<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.980> then<00:03:05.239> first<00:03:06.239> n

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
located in the bottom and then first n

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.610 
located in the bottom and then first n
does<00:03:06.689> is<00:03:08.359> so<00:03:09.359> that's<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.689> big<00:03:09.840> difference<00:03:10.019> takes

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
does is so that's a big difference takes

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.699 
does is so that's a big difference takes
a<00:03:11.010> big<00:03:11.549> hardware<00:03:12.000> difference<00:03:12.409> so<00:03:13.409> go<00:03:13.560> back

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
a big hardware difference so go back

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.960 
a big hardware difference so go back
home<00:03:14.689> for<00:03:15.689> the<00:03:15.870> 2nd<00:03:16.560> gen<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:16.980> mean<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:17.729> first

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
home for the 2nd gen I mean the first

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.559 
home for the 2nd gen I mean the first
gen<00:03:18.259> obviously<00:03:19.259> there<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.650> no<00:03:20.209> rocker<00:03:21.209> keys

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
gen obviously there is no rocker keys

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.199 
gen obviously there is no rocker keys
and<00:03:21.900> then<00:03:22.049> also<00:03:22.349> in<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.709> first<00:03:22.889> gen<00:03:23.189> my<00:03:23.819> 2nd

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
and then also in the first gen my 2nd

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.719 
and then also in the first gen my 2nd
gen<00:03:24.329> they<00:03:24.509> have<00:03:24.720> rock<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.079> keys<00:03:25.259> as<00:03:25.859> are<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.669> if

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729 
gen they have rock the keys as are so if

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:32.119 
gen they have rock the keys as are so if
I<00:03:26.849> go<00:03:26.879> back<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.419> that<00:03:29.239> Oregon<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.680> control

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
I go back to that Oregon is the control

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.979 
I go back to that Oregon is the control
left<00:03:32.370> 50<00:03:33.379> and<00:03:34.379> then<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.739> could<00:03:34.859> also<00:03:35.009> do<00:03:35.280> it

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
left 50 and then you could also do it

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.689 
left 50 and then you could also do it
it'll<00:03:36.989> do<00:03:37.139> it<00:03:37.259> also<00:03:37.590> control<00:03:38.159> it<00:03:38.340> once<00:03:38.519> on

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
it'll do it also control it once on

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:51.199 
it'll do it also control it once on
standby<00:03:40.400> need<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.519> taste<00:03:41.729> speaker<00:03:43.729> so<00:03:50.209> another

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
standby need to taste speaker so another

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.860 
standby need to taste speaker so another
difference<00:03:51.689> is<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.609> when<00:03:53.609> you<00:03:53.849> unlock<00:03:54.299> the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
difference is that when you unlock the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.709 
difference is that when you unlock the
ipod<00:03:55.590> there's<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.489> sound<00:03:56.759> different<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:57.479> if<00:03:57.629> i

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:57.719 
ipod there's a sound different so if i

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.729 
ipod there's a sound different so if i
do<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:57.959> here<00:03:58.579> listen<00:04:00.199> it's<00:04:01.199> like<00:04:01.349> a<00:04:01.379> little

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
do it here listen it's like a little

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.469 
do it here listen it's like a little
click<00:04:01.979> and<00:04:02.250> then<00:04:02.370> also<00:04:02.639> here<00:04:03.060> when<00:04:03.239> you<00:04:03.299> put

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
click and then also here when you put

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.899 
click and then also here when you put
the<00:04:03.629> one<00:04:03.989> put<00:04:04.290> on<00:04:04.379> sleep<00:04:04.620> mode<00:04:04.650> on<00:04:05.040> here<00:04:05.819> it

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
the one put on sleep mode on here it

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.569 
the one put on sleep mode on here it
sounds<00:04:06.090> like<00:04:06.359> a<00:04:06.419> louder<00:04:06.750> 1<00:04:10.189> i'm<00:04:11.189> pretty<00:04:11.430> sure

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
sounds like a louder 1 i'm pretty sure

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.379 
sounds like a louder 1 i'm pretty sure
you<00:04:11.609> guys<00:04:11.759> can<00:04:11.849> hear<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.359> so<00:04:14.030> that's<00:04:15.030> just<00:04:15.150> a

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
you guys can hear that so that's just a

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.569 
you guys can hear that so that's just a
little<00:04:15.509> comparison<00:04:16.039> currently<00:04:17.039> they're<00:04:17.370> both

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
little comparison currently they're both

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.339 
little comparison currently they're both
running<00:04:17.699> on<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.030> same<00:04:18.209> firmware<00:04:18.509> to<00:04:18.900> point<00:04:19.139> to

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
running on the same firmware to point to

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.180 
running on the same firmware to point to
point<00:04:19.709> one<00:04:20.269> so<00:04:21.269> there<00:04:21.680> software-wise<00:04:22.680> they're

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
point one so there software-wise they're

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.990 
point one so there software-wise they're
both<00:04:23.340> up<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.639> date<00:04:23.820> on<00:04:24.919> yeah<00:04:25.919> those<00:04:26.130> are<00:04:26.250> some

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
both up to date on yeah those are some

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.340 
both up to date on yeah those are some
from<00:04:27.300> this<00:04:27.630> just<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.080> person<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.820> yeah<00:04:29.820> also

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
from this just in person and yeah also

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.540 
from this just in person and yeah also
for<00:04:31.350> go<00:04:31.470> to<00:04:31.530> notes<00:04:33.950> you<00:04:34.950> could<00:04:35.130> hear<00:04:35.370> the

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
for go to notes you could hear the

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.460 
for go to notes you could hear the
difference<00:04:36.980> when<00:04:37.980> you<00:04:38.430> type<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.930> for<00:04:40.380> example

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
difference when you type so for example

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.840 
difference when you type so for example
type<00:04:41.460> stuff<00:04:41.790> here<00:04:43.370> sounds<00:04:44.370> different<00:04:44.670> they're

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
type stuff here sounds different they're

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.120 
type stuff here sounds different they're
tight<00:04:45.780> hot<00:04:46.110> stuff<00:04:46.650> here<00:04:48.170> sounds<00:04:49.170> different<00:04:49.530> so

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
tight hot stuff here sounds different so

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.300 
tight hot stuff here sounds different so
in<00:04:50.250> my<00:04:50.400> opinion<00:04:50.520> I<00:04:50.970> like<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.360> 2g<00:04:51.840> better<00:04:52.310> not

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
in my opinion I like the 2g better not

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.240 
in my opinion I like the 2g better not
because<00:04:53.490> it's<00:04:53.790> newer<00:04:54.000> or<00:04:54.300> I<00:04:54.870> don't<00:04:55.260> know<00:04:55.440> also

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
because it's newer or I don't know also

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.860 
because it's newer or I don't know also
because<00:04:56.400> of<00:04:56.730> the<00:04:56.760> internal<00:04:57.180> speaker<00:04:57.510> the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
because of the internal speaker the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.510 
because of the internal speaker the
rocker<00:04:58.140> buttons<00:04:58.620> um<00:05:00.530> all<00:05:01.530> in<00:05:01.860> all<00:05:01.980> the<00:05:02.160> design

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
rocker buttons um all in all the design

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.750 
rocker buttons um all in all the design
I<00:05:02.850> like<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:03.690> curved<00:05:03.990> design<00:05:04.230> better<00:05:04.760> looks

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
I like the curved design better looks

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.310 
I like the curved design better looks
kind<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.030> cooler<00:05:06.240> and<00:05:06.570> more<00:05:08.300> user-friendly

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
kind of cooler and more user-friendly

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.100 
kind of cooler and more user-friendly
even<00:05:10.320> though<00:05:10.440> they're<00:05:10.620> like<00:05:10.770> both<00:05:10.980> the<00:05:11.130> same

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
even though they're like both the same

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.640 
even though they're like both the same
but<00:05:13.110> i'll<00:05:13.380> sell<00:05:13.680> it<00:05:13.710> away<00:05:14.040> like<00:05:14.340> few<00:05:15.330> unlock<00:05:15.720> i

honestly<00:05:27.990> go<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:29.070> G<00:05:29.280> because<00:05:29.460> it's<00:05:29.610> newer<00:05:29.820> but

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
honestly go to G because it's newer but

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.080 
honestly go to G because it's newer but
still<00:05:31.050> not<00:05:31.919> many<00:05:33.410> differences<00:05:34.410> but<00:05:34.880> some<00:05:35.880> big

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
still not many differences but some big

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.820
