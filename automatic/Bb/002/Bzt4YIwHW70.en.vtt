00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.580 
it to your clients and it's easier to
find<00:01:32.700> then<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.329> always<00:01:33.479> import<00:01:34.470> them

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
find then you can always import them

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.550 
find then you can always import them
back<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.460> let's<00:01:35.900> let's<00:01:36.900> go<00:01:37.079> up<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.439> and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
back in but let's let's go up here and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.960 
back in but let's let's go up here and
let's<00:01:37.619> choose<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:39.470> specific<00:01:40.470> folder<00:01:41.159> okay

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
let's choose the specific folder okay

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.060 
let's choose the specific folder okay
and<00:01:43.250> right<00:01:44.250> now<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.750> going<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.350> an<00:01:46.619> iPad

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and right now it's it's going to an iPad

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.280 
and right now it's it's going to an iPad
folder<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.299> need<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.600> choose<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.899> folder

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
folder so we need to choose the folder

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.499 
folder so we need to choose the folder
so<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.740> means<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.729> go<00:01:50.880> back<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.360> this

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
so that means we have to go back to this

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.560 
so that means we have to go back to this
Drive<00:01:52.850> that<00:01:53.850> we're<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:55.640> which<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> d

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
Drive that we're in which is in the d

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.350 
Drive that we're in which is in the d
drive<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.060> and<00:02:00.590> then<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.950> go<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.790> go<00:02:03.030> down

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
drive and and then we go and we go down

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.040 
drive and and then we go and we go down
to

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:16.710 

downloads<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:10.680> we<00:02:11.680> go<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:12.540> Wayne<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:15.450> then<00:02:16.450> we

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
downloads and we go to Wayne and then we

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.839 
downloads and we go to Wayne and then we
create<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.319> new<00:02:17.590> folder<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.250> we'll<00:02:18.520> call<00:02:18.819> that

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
create a new folder and we'll call that

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:27.479 
create a new folder and we'll call that
JPEG<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:24.989> then<00:02:25.989> we'll<00:02:26.230> select<00:02:26.739> that<00:02:27.010> as<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
JPEG and then we'll select that as the

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.830 
JPEG and then we'll select that as the
folder<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:33.760> can<00:02:33.940> put<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.300> in<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.569> subfolder

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
folder and you can put it in a subfolder

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.809 
folder and you can put it in a subfolder

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.910 
right now and maybe let's just give it a
custom<00:02:49.000> name<00:02:49.239> called<00:02:50.019> it<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:53.590> might<00:02:53.769> want

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
custom name called it and you might want

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:10.270 
custom name called it and you might want
to<00:02:54.069> use<00:02:54.190> your<00:02:54.370> studio<00:02:54.760> name

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.990 

I<00:03:10.340> i<00:03:11.330> use<00:03:12.110> underscore<00:03:12.680> on<00:03:12.830> that<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.310> start

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
I i use underscore on that and start

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.690 
I i use underscore on that and start
there<00:03:14.800> whatever<00:03:15.800> number<00:03:16.100> you<00:03:16.130> want<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.459> start

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
there whatever number you want to start

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.070 
there whatever number you want to start
so<00:03:17.030> this<00:03:17.240> is<00:03:17.390> what<00:03:17.540> it's<00:03:17.690> going<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.900> look<00:03:17.959> like

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
so this is what it's going to look like

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.540 
so this is what it's going to look like
Wayne<00:03:18.950> Miller<00:03:19.190> photography<00:03:20.230> one<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.530> five<00:03:21.980> or

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
Wayne Miller photography one of five or

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.800 
Wayne Miller photography one of five or
you<00:03:23.090> can<00:03:23.360> just<00:03:23.420> use<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:25.030> custom<00:03:26.030> name<00:03:26.480> and

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
you can just use a custom name and

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.870 
you can just use a custom name and
sequence<00:03:27.200> which<00:03:27.500> Wayne<00:03:27.860> Miller<00:03:28.100> photography

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
sequence which Wayne Miller photography

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.440 
sequence which Wayne Miller photography
dash<00:03:29.390> one<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:30.500> forth<00:03:30.800> image<00:03:31.790> format<00:03:32.270> will

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
dash one and so forth image format will

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.199 
dash one and so forth image format will
go<00:03:32.569> down<00:03:32.750> here<00:03:33.200> you<00:03:33.560> want<00:03:33.770> a<00:03:33.830> JPEG<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:35.030> want

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
go down here you want a JPEG you want

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.720 
go down here you want a JPEG you want
color<00:03:35.450> space<00:03:35.860> srgb<00:03:37.660> quality<00:03:38.680> 100<00:03:39.680> now<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.340> can

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
longest edge you can go pixels or inches

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.820 
longest edge you can go pixels or inches
so<00:03:55.850> just<00:03:56.420> for<00:03:56.600> drill<00:03:56.900> I'm<00:03:57.200> going<00:03:57.410> to<00:03:57.500> put<00:03:57.680> in

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
then you can you know create a new

because you may want to do different

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.270 
because you may want to do different
sizes<00:05:55.970> so<00:05:56.810> that<00:05:56.840> is<00:05:57.320> created<00:05:57.710> that<00:05:57.890> one<00:05:58.070> and

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
sizes so that is created that one and

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:05.670 
sizes so that is created that one and
then<00:05:58.670> I<00:05:59.090> would<00:05:59.540> just<00:05:59.750> name<00:05:59.990> it<00:06:00.020> with<00:06:00.350> the<00:06:02.080> JPEG
