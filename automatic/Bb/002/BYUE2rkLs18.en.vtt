 a place of barrage is a small 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.879
 little objective early in the meeting that

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.850
 after two minutes for racing and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.620
 but the racing team will be caught 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.899
 by his demons to know and problems 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.699
 in the closed scrum sector on 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.530
 this introduction the pressure of 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.720
 bordeaux who will put at fault and the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.670
 match is rather balanced but it's 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.439
 bordeaux which as from the beginning the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.700
 season is well played uninhibited plays the 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.229
 recovery balloons against 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.729
 talib tackle attacks there and that 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.950
 takes advantage of levels so you who goes 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.750
 accelerate who only has to run for 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.750

 Begins to lead 13 to 3 after 21 minutes 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.130

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.810
 balloons and expose themselves to cons with 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.579
 this attack the center three quarters 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.290
 lacroix who gave the bourhis louise 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.330
 who will crop for talent and you there 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.290
 who will flatten and who will flatten but 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.570
 it's a little bit just 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.770
 video arbitration and you see it you have 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.260
 the balls at that is played a few 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.770

 install his rugby that does not happen to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.370
 play and who will even make mistakes 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.230
 the conquest of Bordeaux is very clean 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.660
 in the image of 2.7 of president in touch 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.350

 by the ground the referee who signals a 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.970
 fault it pleases the coaches vincent 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.780
 etcheto and regis sonnes and bernard and 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.760
 well he continues his recital 16 to 3 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.840
 the racing team does not have too much 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.490
 solution facing one of the best 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.440
 gunners of the season so the racing 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.840
 do not get complicated in this match and 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.640
 various in this game a little bit closed 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.440
 vacon simply to multiply 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.870
 charges with the govou fronts then 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.459
 virgile lacombe who will even get a 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.739
 penalty in the camp of the union 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.520

 stora and from 16 to 3.6 for the union 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.600
 bordeaux begles which continues to make 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.580
 the effort on the melee phase closed and 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.989
 it pays to pay because a few 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.160
 minutes of the break and although they 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.690
 get a penalty 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.430
 Maxime Machenaud just returned from 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.019
 cardiff comes to his hometown to 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.300
 burgundy see well the ordeal 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.070
 inflicted on his racing teammates 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.670
 subway who are coming so at break 19 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.190
 at 6 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.299
 early in the second period and well the 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.680
 racing melee goes a little bit better 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.970
 this is the first information the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.799
 first good news for racing 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.230
 leads in early May laurent through is 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.850
 not too reassured even if the penalty goes 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.220
 spend 19 to 9 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.959
 after 50 minutes the racing tries to 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.130
 to attack they are superior 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.450
 digital at this point in the match 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.850
 look at krueger going through the ground 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.070
 but magnificent attitude of the second 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.950
 line and hitch marrer car king 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.540
 who plays against 50 meters in the corner 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.940
 well it does not scare this man 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.239
 Bernard Stone who will pass the penalty 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.340
 50 meters in corner 22 to 9 for the union 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.840
 bordeaux bègles which relies on its 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.880
 strengths there but the conquest the 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.690
 touch the racing is completely sitting 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.610
 triennial has no solution 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.100
 to try to counteract this well 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.080
 rigor and 7 this offensive bordelaise 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.750
 with a balloon carried there that gets organized 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.340
 and who again puts to fault the 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.020
 ahead of racing olé avei who tries to 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.310
 get out that she will not give you anything 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.350
 therefore comes back to the penalty 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.540
 the old three-quarters enjoyed the 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.220
 Wholesale work 25 to 9 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.780
 10 minutes left what's left 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.030

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.560
 of racing that you when you at a 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.480
 solution on the outside there a little bit 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.310
 greedy the Fijian yves be taken back to 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.740
 a few centimeters with the relay of 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.630
 his fellow matt anigo who plunged 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.030
 in the goal but that has not flattened 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.620
 see connors who is going to throw themselves and 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.890
 after video refereeing and well left 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.490
 will be refused so we stick to that score 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.380
 25 to 9 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.900

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.790
 continues to assert credible candidate 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.790
 in the finals of the top 14
