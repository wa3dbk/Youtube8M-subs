happen do can against all authority come

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.640 
happen do can against all authority come
back<00:00:11.580> or<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.360> going<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.570> be<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.809> Cydia<00:00:13.200> to

well<00:00:15.509> let's<00:00:15.690> hope<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> break<00:00:16.320> hasn't

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
well let's hope that the break hasn't

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.890 
well let's hope that the break hasn't
affected<00:00:17.070> them<00:00:17.250> too<00:00:17.609> much<00:00:17.970> because<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.630> game

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
affected them too much because this game

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.019 
affected them too much because this game
is<00:00:19.080> going<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.230> be<00:00:19.320> history<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.279> making

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
is going to be history in the making

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.939 
is going to be history in the making
and<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.359> think<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.630> most<00:00:21.779> important<00:00:22.260> aspect<00:00:22.769> of

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
and I think the most important aspect of

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.630 
and I think the most important aspect of
what<00:00:23.279> we've<00:00:23.460> seen<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.119> far<00:00:24.390> today<00:00:24.630> has<00:00:25.289> been
