00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
little a little bit of movement on the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.290 
little a little bit of movement on the
bait<00:00:16.170> especially<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.770> wind<00:00:16.980> tip<00:00:17.160> ups<00:00:17.400> a

bait especially with the wind tip ups a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.849 
bait especially with the wind tip ups a
lot<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.840> times<00:00:19.080> these<00:00:19.199> crappies<00:00:19.590> will<00:00:19.710> just

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
lot of times these crappies will just

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.320 
lot of times these crappies will just
kind<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.070> come<00:00:20.250> through<00:00:20.490> casually<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.240> when

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
kind of come through casually and when

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.849 
kind of come through casually and when
they<00:00:21.449> see<00:00:21.510> those<00:00:21.810> minerals<00:00:22.470> hanging<00:00:22.710> under

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
they see those minerals hanging under

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.859 
they see those minerals hanging under
the<00:00:22.949> wind<00:00:23.130> tip<00:00:23.279> up<00:00:23.460> or<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.640> tip<00:00:23.820> down<00:00:24.029> they'll

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the wind tip up or the tip down they'll

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.929 
the wind tip up or the tip down they'll
grab<00:00:25.080> ahold<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.619> they're<00:00:26.130> light<00:00:26.460> biters

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
grab ahold of it they're light biters

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.820 
grab ahold of it they're light biters
with<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> wind<00:00:27.869> tip<00:00:28.080> ups<00:00:28.289> or<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.439> tip<00:00:28.619> dogs

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
with the wind tip ups or the tip dogs

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.429 
with the wind tip ups or the tip dogs
they<00:00:28.980> don't<00:00:29.010> feel<00:00:29.279> any<00:00:29.429> resistance<00:00:30.260> they<00:00:31.260> can

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
they don't feel any resistance they can

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.200 
they don't feel any resistance they can
pull<00:00:31.859> off<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.610> go<00:00:32.700> over<00:00:32.790> there<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.059> just

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
pull off you can go over there and just

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.580 
pull off you can go over there and just
gently<00:00:33.420> set<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> hook<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.020> bring<00:00:34.350> them<00:00:34.469> in

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
gently set the hook and bring them in

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.610 
gently set the hook and bring them in
it's<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.829> good<00:00:35.160> way<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.790> locate<00:00:36.300> fish<00:00:36.870> kind<00:00:37.500> of

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
it's a good way to locate fish kind of

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.110 
it's a good way to locate fish kind of
outside<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.129> area<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.430> you're<00:00:38.579> jigging<00:00:38.969> it

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
outside the area that you're jigging it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.700 
outside the area that you're jigging it
just<00:00:39.690> gives<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.930> more<00:00:40.079> lines<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.559> water

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
just gives you more lines in the water

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.889 
just gives you more lines in the water
which<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.040> course<00:00:41.070> increases<00:00:41.579> your<00:00:41.940> chances

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
which of course increases your chances

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.290 
which of course increases your chances
of<00:00:43.050> success<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.760> I'm<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.180> go<00:00:45.239> ahead

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
of success so I'm just going to go ahead

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.369 
of success so I'm just going to go ahead
I'm<00:00:45.390> going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.600> set<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.930> couple<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.260> these

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
I'm going to set up a couple of these

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.630 
I'm going to set up a couple of these
wind<00:00:47.309> tip<00:00:47.489> ups<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:48.950> like<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> wind<00:00:50.250> tip<00:00:50.430> ups

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
wind tip ups I like the wind tip ups

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.160 
wind tip ups I like the wind tip ups
just<00:00:50.789> because<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.510> get<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.719> little<00:00:51.899> bit

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
just because if we do get a little bit

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.139 
just because if we do get a little bit
of<00:00:52.320> breeze<00:00:53.149> of<00:00:54.149> course<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:55.850> action<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
of breeze of course the action of the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.569 
of breeze of course the action of the
rocker<00:00:57.629> arm<00:00:57.960> does<00:00:58.620> help<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.949> actually<00:00:59.100> jig<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
rocker arm does help to actually jig the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.450 
rocker arm does help to actually jig the
bait<00:00:59.789> which<00:01:00.000> will<00:01:00.149> help<00:01:00.239> attract<00:01:00.660> fish<00:01:01.460> yeah

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
bait which will help attract fish yeah

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.700 
bait which will help attract fish yeah

if a crappie does hit this it's just

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.640 
if a crappie does hit this it's just
gonna<00:03:19.310> drop<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.180> rocker<00:03:20.570> arm<00:03:20.870> down<00:03:21.140> of

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
gonna drop that rocker arm down of

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.140 
gonna drop that rocker arm down of

then<00:03:45.380> of<00:03:45.470> course<00:03:45.650> I'm<00:03:45.709> gonna<00:03:45.800> have<00:03:45.920> to<00:03:46.070> move

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
then of course I'm gonna have to move

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.550 
then of course I'm gonna have to move
that<00:03:46.640> tip<00:03:47.060> up<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:47.360> set<00:03:47.600> it<00:03:47.630> at<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.840> different

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
that tip up and set it at a different

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.520 
that tip up and set it at a different
angle<00:03:48.680> but<00:03:48.950> for<00:03:49.160> right<00:03:49.250> now<00:03:50.019> it's<00:03:51.019> pretty<00:03:51.230> calm
