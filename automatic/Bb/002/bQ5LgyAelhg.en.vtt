every year for you they talking about
the<00:00:09.360> cold<00:00:09.540> steel<00:00:09.840> kind<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.320> point<00:00:10.559> one<00:00:10.830> I

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
the cold steel kind of point one I

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.370 
the cold steel kind of point one I
really<00:00:11.910> like<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.210> knife<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.719> pretty<00:00:13.049> much<00:00:13.170> my

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
really like this knife is pretty much my

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.410 
really like this knife is pretty much my
everyday<00:00:13.620> carry<00:00:14.009> at<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.309> point<00:00:14.610> for<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
everyday carry at this point for the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.359 
everyday carry at this point for the
upsides<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.230> has<00:00:16.440> but<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.190> come

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
upsides that it has but I have come

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.769 
upsides that it has but I have come
across<00:00:17.490> something<00:00:18.150> now<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.390> I've<00:00:18.510> carried

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
across something now that I've carried

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.019 
across something now that I've carried
it<00:00:18.990> through<00:00:19.170> almost<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.529> entire<00:00:19.619> winter<00:00:20.220> with

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
it through almost the entire winter with

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.480 
it through almost the entire winter with
a<00:00:21.330> downside<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.710> think<00:00:22.830> cold<00:00:23.250> steel

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
a downside to it that I think cold steel

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.660 
a downside to it that I think cold steel
can<00:00:23.760> improve<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.750> let<00:00:25.019> me<00:00:25.140> get<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.670> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
can improve on and let me get to it the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.580 
can improve on and let me get to it the
upside<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.689> nice<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.170> smooth<00:00:28.439> around

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
upside is it's nice and smooth around

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.800 
upside is it's nice and smooth around
the<00:00:28.890> circle's<00:00:29.310> here<00:00:29.490> where<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.420> move<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
the circle's here where you can move the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.440 
the circle's here where you can move the
knife<00:00:30.990> around<00:00:31.199> right<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.669> go<00:00:32.790> ahead<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
knife around right you can go ahead and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.880 
knife around right you can go ahead and
move<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.020> into<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.770> know<00:00:34.800> different

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
move it into you know different

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.750 
move it into you know different
positions<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.090> use<00:00:36.840> these<00:00:37.110> circles<00:00:37.710> as<00:00:37.980> you

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
positions and use these circles as you

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.430 
positions and use these circles as you
know<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.090> means<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.870> getting<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.320> into

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
know a means of getting it into

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.459 
know a means of getting it into
different<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.280> know<00:00:41.399> holes<00:00:42.110> but<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.170> I've

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
different you know holes but what I've

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.040 
different you know holes but what I've
come<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.739> find<00:00:44.280> out<00:00:44.969> through<00:00:45.360> using<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.899> in

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
come to find out through using it in

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.200 
come to find out through using it in
extreme<00:00:46.440> cold<00:00:46.680> conditions<00:00:46.950> when<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.000> say

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
extreme cold conditions when I say

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.880 
extreme cold conditions when I say
extreme<00:00:48.510> cold<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.989> mean<00:00:49.170> extreme<00:00:49.440> cold<00:00:49.710> this

part you're gonna come across 30 degree
temperatures<00:01:01.969> what<00:01:02.969> I've<00:01:03.090> come<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.420> find<00:01:03.690> out

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
temperatures what I've come to find out

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.899 
temperatures what I've come to find out
is<00:01:04.199> two<00:01:04.589> times<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.129> I've<00:01:05.369> had<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.729> out

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
is two times now that I've had this out

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.240 
is two times now that I've had this out
in<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:07.799> cold

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
in the the cold

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.940 
in the the cold
I<00:01:08.340> had<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.240> fly<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.780> hands<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.409> stood

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
I had this fly out of my hands and stood

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.350 
I had this fly out of my hands and stood
the<00:01:11.100> fact<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.610> slippery<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.210> when

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
the fact that it's slippery and when

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.000 
the fact that it's slippery and when
this<00:01:12.510> gets<00:01:12.689> cold<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.560> gets<00:01:13.740> even<00:01:13.979> more

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
this gets cold it gets even more

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.679 
this gets cold it gets even more
slippery<00:01:14.670> especially<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.509> hands

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
slippery especially with your hands

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.539 
slippery especially with your hands
being<00:01:15.930> cold<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.530> when<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.009> go<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.130> flick<00:01:17.430> it

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
being cold and when you go to flick it

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.980 
being cold and when you go to flick it
out<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.450> right<00:01:20.509> it'll<00:01:21.509> come<00:01:21.750> flying

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
out like I do right it'll come flying

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.570 
out like I do right it'll come flying
out<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.200> your<00:01:22.290> hands<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.920> flicked<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.490> out

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
out of your hands which I flicked it out

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.859 
out of your hands which I flicked it out
and<00:01:23.850> I've<00:01:23.939> had<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.240> come<00:01:24.390> flying<00:01:24.600> out<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> my

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
and I've had it come flying out of my

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.260 
and I've had it come flying out of my
hands<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:26.400> know<00:01:26.490> when<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:26.939> hold<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
hands because you know when I hold it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.670 
hands because you know when I hold it
like<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:28.909> to<00:01:29.909> get<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.180> out<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:31.380> know<00:01:31.470> this

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
like this to to get it out you know this

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.160 
like this to to get it out you know this
is<00:01:31.829> how<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:31.979> hold<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.400> right<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.689> right<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.079> is

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
is how I hold it right and right here is

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.690 
is how I hold it right and right here is
my<00:01:34.320> underneath<00:01:34.710> well<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.250> will<00:01:35.460> come<00:01:35.670> off

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
my underneath well this will come off

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.060 
my underneath well this will come off
because<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.479> slippery<00:01:36.780> well<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.799> comes

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
because it's slippery well this comes

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.649 
because it's slippery well this comes
off<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.520> entire<00:01:38.759> night<00:01:39.030> will<00:01:39.210> go<00:01:39.240> flying

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
off the entire night will go flying

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.149 
off the entire night will go flying
because<00:01:40.110> there's<00:01:40.259> nothing<00:01:40.560> else<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.829> hold<00:01:41.009> on

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
because there's nothing else to hold on

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.280 
because there's nothing else to hold on
to<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.540> cold<00:01:42.750> steel<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.200> maybe

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
to so I think if cold steel can maybe

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.819 
to so I think if cold steel can maybe
take<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:45.149> keep<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.630> area<00:01:46.170> where<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
take and keep this area where the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.340 
take and keep this area where the
circles<00:01:47.250> are<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:48.090> circle<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.840> down<00:01:49.170> in

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
circles are and a circle and down in

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.670 
circles are and a circle and down in
here<00:01:49.740> smooth<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:51.869> rest<00:01:52.140> they<00:01:52.350> could<00:01:52.500> probably

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
here smooth the rest they could probably

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.380 
here smooth the rest they could probably
texture<00:01:53.280> out<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.670> maybe<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:53.970> some<00:01:54.180> grip

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
texture out and maybe get some grip

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.359 
texture out and maybe get some grip
going<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.899> or<00:01:55.439> maybe<00:01:55.680> even<00:01:55.710> make<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> entire

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
going on or maybe even make the entire

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.749 
going on or maybe even make the entire
handles<00:01:56.909> out<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.390> g10<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.140> keep<00:01:58.530> these<00:01:59.250> areas

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
handles out of g10 and keep these areas

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.709 
handles out of g10 and keep these areas
smooth<00:02:00.920> but<00:02:01.920> keep<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> rest<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.240> textured

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
smooth but keep the rest of it textured

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.630 
smooth but keep the rest of it textured
g10<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> East<00:02:04.740> kit<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.130> can<00:02:05.219> at<00:02:05.340> least<00:02:05.369> get

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
g10 so the East kit you can at least get

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.819 
g10 so the East kit you can at least get
a<00:02:05.670> handle<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:07.290> would<00:02:07.380> keep<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
a handle on it and you would keep the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.710 
a handle on it and you would keep the
functionality<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:09.000> what<00:02:09.390> makes<00:02:09.569> it

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
functionality that is what makes it

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
functionality that is what makes it
different<00:02:09.899> than<00:02:10.110> everything<00:02:10.319> else

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
different than everything else

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.970 
different than everything else
with<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.240> circles<00:02:12.240> like<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.620> can<00:02:13.740> move

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
with the circles like that you can move

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.860 
with the circles like that you can move
it<00:02:14.040> around<00:02:14.100> at<00:02:15.060> least<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.360> would<00:02:15.420> keep<00:02:15.600> those

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
it around at least it would keep those

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.960 
it around at least it would keep those
nice<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.710> smooth<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.100> move<00:02:17.250> around<00:02:17.490> but<00:02:17.850> then

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
nice and smooth to move around but then

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.080 
nice and smooth to move around but then
you<00:02:18.030> have<00:02:18.210> some<00:02:18.390> area<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.690> grip<00:02:19.100> as<00:02:20.100> well<00:02:20.160> so

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
you have some area to grip as well so

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.610 
you have some area to grip as well so
that's<00:02:21.330> just<00:02:21.420> something<00:02:21.660> I've<00:02:21.870> seen<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.230> still

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
that's just something I've seen I still

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.320 
that's just something I've seen I still

job done for what I'm looking to do

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.090 
job done for what I'm looking to do
which<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.670> everyday<00:02:30.060> carry<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.680> really

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
that change because it's something I

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.070 
that change because it's something I
came<00:02:35.490> across<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.090> didn't<00:02:36.420> see<00:02:37.050> before

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
came across that I didn't see before

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.350 
came across that I didn't see before
because<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.860> wasn't<00:02:38.220> using<00:02:38.460> this<00:02:38.790> knife<00:02:39.060> before

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
because I wasn't using this knife before

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.140 
because I wasn't using this knife before
I<00:02:39.570> did<00:02:39.810> my<00:02:39.840> review<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.700> bumping<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.790> camera

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
I did my review and bumping the camera

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.750 
I did my review and bumping the camera
out<00:02:42.270> late<00:02:42.480> professionals<00:02:43.050> do<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.610> wasn't<00:02:44.610> using

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
out late professionals do I wasn't using

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.850 
out late professionals do I wasn't using
this<00:02:44.970> knife<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.960> extreme<00:02:46.380> cold<00:02:46.650> conditions

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
this knife and extreme cold conditions

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.310 
this knife and extreme cold conditions
and<00:02:47.550> that's<00:02:48.420> something<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.780> came<00:02:48.840> across<00:02:49.080> that

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
and that's something I came across that

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.890 
and that's something I came across that
I<00:02:49.590> really<00:02:49.920> would<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.370> cold<00:02:50.940> steel<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.450> at

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
I really would like cold steel to at

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.180 
I really would like cold steel to at
least<00:02:52.020> take<00:02:52.260> into<00:02:52.440> consideration<00:02:53.070> because

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
least take into consideration because

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.550 
least take into consideration because
you<00:02:54.090> know<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:54.660> knife<00:02:54.930> which<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> really

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
you know this knife which is a really

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.260 
you know this knife which is a really
great<00:02:55.680> knife<00:02:55.980> could<00:02:56.220> be<00:02:56.340> an<00:02:56.550> extremely<00:02:56.850> great

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
great knife could be an extremely great

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.390 
great knife could be an extremely great
knife<00:02:57.510> if<00:02:57.840> maybe<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.470> little<00:02:58.710> change<00:02:59.070> was

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
knife if maybe that little change was

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.910 
knife if maybe that little change was
made<00:02:59.430> in<00:03:00.000> my<00:03:00.030> opinion<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:01.200> if<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.560> guys<00:03:01.680> have
