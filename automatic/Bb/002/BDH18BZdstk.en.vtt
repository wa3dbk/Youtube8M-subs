00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello my video appeal to 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.019
 primarily aimed at those whose 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.780
 rights were violated as a result 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.589
 activities of notorious groups 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.200
 Chicken 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.360
 then free city and talking about 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.150
 constitutional and constitutional rights 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.270
 each for honor and dignity and good 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.250
 name when i just found out about 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.200
 the existence of such groups think 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.900
 why not yet closed 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.760
 why they grow up why not them 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.500
 condemned 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.850
 because such groups can discredit 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.649
 honor decent girls for more 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.480
 ideas think about me 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.789
 felt if I learned that there 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.079
 turned out to be my sister my favorite girl 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:50.190
 even all of these groups say something 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.469
 the fact that something truthful to them 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.399
 no right to personal privacy 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.260
 everyone for public discussion and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.940
 started looking for some court cases 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.230
 precedents for activity on data rub 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.290
 but to my surprise I found only 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.590
 numerous complaints without any 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.400
 positive result so i wondered 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.850
 the purpose 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.160
 and convey to everyone but how 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.340

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.860
 situations 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.290
 that all you have to do is 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.400
 read fully prepared my 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.400
 legal analysis 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.430
 or otherwise the memorandum is not 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.010
 chase down any footnotes and start 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.100

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:41.730

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.400
