return<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:09.060> classics<00:03:09.599> what<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.200> always

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
return to the classics what I always

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.470 
return to the classics what I always
thought<00:03:10.829> that<00:03:10.859> pairing<00:03:11.430> pink<00:03:11.819> with<00:03:12.060> green

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
thought that pairing pink with green

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.300 
thought that pairing pink with green
kind<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.049> makes<00:03:13.319> me<00:03:13.439> think<00:03:13.469> of<00:03:13.799> Robin<00:03:14.159> Hood

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
kind of makes me think of Robin Hood

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.599 
kind of makes me think of Robin Hood
listen<00:03:15.060> it's<00:03:15.329> very<00:03:15.420> subtle<00:03:16.049> and<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:16.739> leave

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
listen it's very subtle and like leave

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.300 
listen it's very subtle and like leave
washed<00:03:18.060> over<00:03:18.629> each<00:03:18.989> garment<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:19.769> this<00:03:19.920> outfit

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
washed over each garment in this outfit

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.179 
washed over each garment in this outfit
I<00:03:20.549> think<00:03:20.609> that<00:03:21.329> this<00:03:21.599> is<00:03:21.840> fine<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.500> go<00:03:22.650> with<00:03:22.829> it

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:23.189 
I think that this is fine to go with it

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.209 
I think that this is fine to go with it
