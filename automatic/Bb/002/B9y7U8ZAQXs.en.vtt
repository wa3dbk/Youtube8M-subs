00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.819
 There are different ways how we use the Passion Spa 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.700
 Make Planet Friendly for you. This ensures that you save money while using the spa 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.139
 because of the efficiency of the spa. We start with an insulation that in three 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.400
 steps is divided 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.740
 each spa shell is fully insulated with High Density foam 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.960
 to retain the heat in the shell second 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.119
 we have scrapped the entire enclosure of the spa 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.660
 with this insulation cloth which retains the heat completely 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.090
 The third step is at the rear of the panels 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.460
 have approximately 2 cm of insulation around the entire spa 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.510
 as well as the corners of the spa enclosure. So we insulated the spa enclosure 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.700
 we have the insulation sheet and finally we have insulated the back of the panels 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.960
 to create a fully energy efficient / conserving system 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.600
 this ensures that our Spas are very efficient in terms of consumption costs. 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.969
 In addition to the three layers of insulation that are installed in each Passion 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:00.600
 Spa 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.790
 we also use spa pumps that are more energy efficient 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.150
 to start with the air filtration pump that has a low wattage 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.380
 and requires a minimum amount of electricity to keep energy costs low 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.670
 furthermore we reuse the heat generated from the spa pumps 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.110
 we retain this heat between the casing and the shell 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.280
 both of which are insulated and therefore retain this heat and circulate under the shell of 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.229
 the Spa. In addition, the control system is programmable 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.400
 this allows you to turn the filtration pump on and off 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.140
 when you want and how often you want. In addition, this option reduces energy costs. 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.820
 Of course applies to all the energy and efficiency in the world 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.759
 that it doesn't work if you don't use a good spa cover, that's why it's rising 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.820
 very important that we retain this heat 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.729
 the Passion Spa cover is quite thick 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.860
 with a thin layer so that the water drains onto the cover 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.020
 the cover is quite thick, but also very effective 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.969
 because there is a sort of center strip in the middle 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.490
 which makes it possible to seal the gap between these two halves 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.629
 when you want to close the cover 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.110
 the intermediate piece falls exactly together 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.000
 which ensures a nice closure. In addition, the cover is incredibly strong, if you are one of the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.700
 if you are a client who lives in the northern climate with a lot of snowfall, then you do 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.100
 not to worry about the weight on the cover 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.220
 because this is a very strong cover. In conclusion 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.900
 ensures the combination of the insulating factors 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.730
 for a Spa that is very energy efficient for 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.000
