problem<00:01:43.110> which<00:01:43.470> started<00:01:43.979> way<00:01:44.250> back<00:01:44.549> has<00:01:45.210> now

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
problem which started way back has now

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.359 
problem which started way back has now
been<00:01:45.840> addressed<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.590> more<00:01:46.829> than<00:01:47.009> addressed

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
been addressed and more than addressed

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.700 
been addressed and more than addressed
God<00:01:47.820> has<00:01:47.970> actually<00:01:48.360> got<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.020> project<00:01:49.530> of

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
God has actually got the project of

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.280 
God has actually got the project of
Genesis<00:01:50.130> 1<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.340> 2<00:01:50.549> back<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.420> track<00:01:51.720> at<00:01:52.020> last

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
Genesis 1 and 2 back on track at last

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.260 
Genesis 1 and 2 back on track at last
after<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.860> had<00:01:52.979> been<00:01:53.009> derailed

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
after it had been derailed

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.600 
after it had been derailed
so<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:54.960> Paul<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.590> enormous<00:01:55.890> ly<00:01:56.159> important

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
so for Paul it is enormous ly important

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.539 
so for Paul it is enormous ly important
because<00:01:57.360> he<00:01:57.630> knows<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> significance

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
because he knows that the significance

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.010 
because he knows that the significance
of<00:01:59.640> Abraham's<00:02:00.119> family<00:02:00.360> which<00:02:00.719> he's<00:02:00.869> been

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.040 
supposed to be there for in the first
place<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> answer<00:02:11.039> from<00:02:11.160> Genesis<00:02:11.730> is

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
place and the answer from Genesis is

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.150 
place and the answer from Genesis is
clearly

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
clearly

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.260 
clearly
to<00:02:13.820> deal<00:02:14.120> with<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.690> problem<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.430> Adam<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:16.970> Paul

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
to deal with the problem of Adam so Paul

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.380 
to deal with the problem of Adam so Paul
says<00:02:17.570> this<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.500> how<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.830> atom<00:02:19.190> problem<00:02:19.640> gets

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
says this is how the atom problem gets

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.010 
says this is how the atom problem gets
dealt<00:02:20.630> with

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
dealt with

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.980 
dealt with
I<00:02:21.050> think<00:02:21.710> Paul<00:02:21.890> says<00:02:22.220> Israel<00:02:22.940> remains<00:02:23.480> the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
I think Paul says Israel remains the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.200 
I think Paul says Israel remains the
solution<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:24.890> how<00:02:25.220> does<00:02:25.280> Israel<00:02:25.820> remain<00:02:26.030> the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
solution so how does Israel remain the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.960 
solution so how does Israel remain the
solution<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.720> answer<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.500> Messiah

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
solution the answer is that the Messiah

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.760 
solution the answer is that the Messiah
represents<00:02:28.970> Israel<00:02:29.150> he<00:02:29.690> does<00:02:30.020> what<00:02:30.290> Israel

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
represents Israel he does what Israel

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.530 
represents Israel he does what Israel
was<00:02:30.920> supposed<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.340> do<00:02:31.550> that<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.300> inner

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
was supposed to do that is the inner

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.050 
was supposed to do that is the inner
logic<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:33.080> Romans<00:02:33.500> chapter<00:02:33.800> 3<00:02:33.950> Israel<00:02:34.880> was

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060

unfaithful is God then going to say okay
let's<00:02:37.580> forget<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.940> idea<00:02:38.210> of<00:02:38.330> an<00:02:38.420> Israel<00:02:38.690> and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
let's forget the idea of an Israel and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.510 
let's forget the idea of an Israel and
do<00:02:38.960> something<00:02:39.230> different<00:02:39.260> no<00:02:39.650> God<00:02:40.340> is

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
do something different no God is

Israelite<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.780> Romans<00:02:45.080> 322<00:02:45.770> precisely<00:02:46.640> what

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
Israelite the Romans 322 precisely what

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.940 
Israelite the Romans 322 precisely what
you<00:02:47.060> got<00:02:47.270> God's<00:02:47.810> covenant<00:02:48.350> faithfulness<00:02:48.680> is

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
you got God's covenant faithfulness is

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.710 
you got God's covenant faithfulness is
revealed<00:02:49.250> through<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.700> faithfulness<00:02:50.510> of<00:02:50.630> the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
revealed through the faithfulness of the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.950 
revealed through the faithfulness of the
Messiah<00:02:51.050> for<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:51.860> benefit<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.430> all<00:02:52.850> those<00:02:53.390> who

Messiah for the benefit of all those who
believe<00:02:53.990> that's<00:02:54.890> how<00:02:55.100> that<00:02:55.160> logic<00:02:55.730> works<00:02:55.940> so

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
believe that's how that logic works so

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.210 
believe that's how that logic works so
the<00:02:56.510> Israel<00:02:56.960> promises<00:02:57.440> fulfilled<00:02:57.590> but<00:02:58.100> it's
