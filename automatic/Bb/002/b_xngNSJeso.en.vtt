00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.679
 m 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.759
 you are my cousin so today we 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.400
 is found for a new video 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.839
 7.5 in laye tutoring where I take a 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.970
 index that will help to make 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.309
 the money imitating it so on after the 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.689
 French patch 1 so you will see 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:31.489
 in the video that this guide I really 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.589
 worked that out and I even believe it's 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.110
 the glitch since simple I found 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:37.579
 so you after patch 1.16 and so 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.800
 for that you already need a friend 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.989
 who will stand in front of the door on the side 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.379
 driver so your car or the 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.530
 banks 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.699
 - some users they must 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.620
 have room and you will go into 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.090
 face him and get in the car 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.710
 they have me we will go up in the 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.019
 car you have connect your 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.890
 joystick and the normal in you are you going 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.890
 teleport alongside 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.050
 so to accept you're going to buy the 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.210
 beautiful cairo and there or not that it is necessary that 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.190
 your friend strums the button creating 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.350
 to make it the cinematic where he 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.150
 wants to open the door of their break 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.370
 so there you will replace with the 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:20.410
 other cars you choose to participate 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.820
 you go to the back of the garage and there you 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.320
 will replace stewards with the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.120
 rebel the convoy the car that of the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.070
 pic and now you're going to take the 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.320
 vehicle or your friend just fell to 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.890
 side was out outside the garage and 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.890
 to return 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.970
 and where we could see that we were coming back 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.530
 the garage the alternation and disappeared so 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.820
 do not worry, you just have to 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.820
 wait for the release of the Nobel Prize 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.900
 I 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.000
 and where we saw when 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.460
 rebel was celebrating and arresting a man who 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.990
 would rise up instead so you 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.619
 go take the head arnaud and 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.330
 take a risk to stones so 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.050
 maybe for some if do not forget 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.520
 not the simplest 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.240
 and for me personally the one that 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.240
 simple so that's it 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.000
 and the company when I get to 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.100
 shaking tom i can sell the vehicle 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.200
 120 miles away so it's really 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.590
 not bad so that's the end of this 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.090
 video 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.100
 so do not hesitate to me videos of 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.330
 their comments on this budget to the 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.870
 next for a next video 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.870
 go ciao
