setting

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.250 

as<00:00:26.420> you<00:00:26.660> can<00:00:26.810> see<00:00:28.780> spilling<00:00:29.780> their<00:00:29.900> moves<00:00:30.080> up

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.530 
as you can see spilling their moves up
pretty<00:00:30.470> quickly<00:00:30.740> now<00:00:30.890> we'll<00:00:31.340> do<00:00:31.580> one<00:00:32.240> full

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
pretty quickly now we'll do one full

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:44.380 
pretty quickly now we'll do one full
turn

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.860 

a<00:00:44.450> little<00:00:45.140> bit<00:00:45.230> slower<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.940> bit<00:00:46.940> firmer<00:00:47.239> bump

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
a little bit slower a bit firmer bump

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.170 
a little bit slower a bit firmer bump
stop<00:00:48.170> now<00:00:49.070> here's<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.430> interesting<00:00:49.489> part<00:00:49.820> if

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
stop now here's the interesting part if

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.170 
stop now here's the interesting part if
you<00:00:50.360> turn<00:00:50.899> these<00:00:51.910> two<00:00:52.910> full<00:00:53.210> firm<00:00:53.570> setting

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
you turn these two full firm setting

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.310 
you turn these two full firm setting
let's<00:00:56.180> hold<00:00:56.390> firm<00:00:56.629> and<00:00:56.660> all<00:00:56.899> doesn't<00:00:57.110> turn

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
let's hold firm and all doesn't turn

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.710 
let's hold firm and all doesn't turn
anymore<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:58.129> show<00:00:58.790> you<00:00:58.850> what<00:00:59.030> happens

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.480 

as<00:01:05.680> you<00:01:06.010> can<00:01:06.160> see<00:01:06.400> it's<00:01:07.330> rising<00:01:07.960> but<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.650> very

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
as you can see it's rising but a very

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.790 
as you can see it's rising but a very
very<00:01:10.200> slow<00:01:11.200> rate<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:14.200> what's<00:01:14.500> even<00:01:14.770> more

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
very slow rate and what's even more

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.070 
very slow rate and what's even more
interesting<00:01:15.160> is<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.130> back<00:01:19.120> this<00:01:19.390> off<00:01:19.660> and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
interesting is if you back this off and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.600 
interesting is if you back this off and
just<00:01:20.500> an<00:01:20.650> eighth<00:01:20.860> of<00:01:21.040> a<00:01:21.130> turn

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
just an eighth of a turn

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.710 
just an eighth of a turn
so<00:01:21.760> right<00:01:23.460> there<00:01:24.460> an<00:01:24.910> eighth<00:01:25.120> look<00:01:25.540> at<00:01:25.630> the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
so right there an eighth look at the

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.340 
so right there an eighth look at the
difference

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.130 

so<00:01:32.350> as<00:01:32.679> you<00:01:32.859> can<00:01:32.979> see<00:01:33.039> in<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.850> full<00:01:34.140> firm

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
so as you can see in the full firm

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.330 
so as you can see in the full firm
position<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.689> cylinder<00:01:38.170> braid<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:39.039> shaft

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
position the cylinder braid the shaft

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.919 
position the cylinder braid the shaft
basically<00:01:40.709> doesn't<00:01:41.709> come<00:01:41.829> out<00:01:42.749> try<00:01:43.749> that

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
basically doesn't come out try that

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:44.219 
basically doesn't come out try that
again

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
again

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:53.630 
again
this<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:44.740> at<00:01:44.950> 1/8<00:01:47.880> awful<00:01:48.880> firm

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.270 

tell<00:01:54.150> us<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.330> lock<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.750> right<00:01:54.900> now<00:01:55.050> or<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.010> full

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
tell us to lock it right now or a full

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.690 
tell us to lock it right now or a full
firm<00:01:56.870> that's<00:01:57.870> full<00:01:58.110> firm<00:01:58.380> almost<00:01:58.980> stops<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
firm that's full firm almost stops the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.930 
firm that's full firm almost stops the
cylinder<00:02:00.060> from<00:02:00.120> moving<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:01.370> an<00:02:02.370> eighth<00:02:02.580> turn

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
cylinder from moving out an eighth turn

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.760 
cylinder from moving out an eighth turn
out<00:02:03.740> starts<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.860> move<00:02:09.230> all<00:02:10.230> the<00:02:10.440> way<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
out starts to move all the way to the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.790 
out starts to move all the way to the
top<00:02:11.010> so<00:02:12.890> you<00:02:13.890> shouldn't<00:02:14.190> run<00:02:14.400> Koni<00:02:15.150> yellows<00:02:15.800> at

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
top so you shouldn't run Koni yellows at

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.490 
top so you shouldn't run Koni yellows at
full<00:02:17.370> firm<00:02:18.360> setting<00:02:18.810> otherwise<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.350> might

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
full firm setting otherwise you might

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.330 
full firm setting otherwise you might
risk<00:02:20.340> damaging<00:02:20.940> your<00:02:21.000> shock
