00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
there's only two cuts that you actually

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.680 
there's only two cuts that you actually
have<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.289> make<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.390> so<00:00:48.390> you'll<00:00:48.510> take

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
have to make for it and so you'll take

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.020 
have to make for it and so you'll take
two<00:00:48.930> two<00:00:49.110> by<00:00:49.289> fours<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.860> you'll<00:00:50.340> cut<00:00:50.579> off<00:00:50.730> to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
two two by fours and you'll cut off to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.860 
two two by fours and you'll cut off to
two<00:00:51.899> feet<00:00:52.140> off<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.680> each<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.129> those<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:54.510> 2

one hint that I found um if you take the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.530 
one hint that I found um if you take the
stringer<00:01:34.979> boards<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.520> screw<00:01:35.970> those<00:01:36.119> together

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
stringer boards and screw those together

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.690 
stringer boards and screw those together
before<00:01:36.990> putting<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.470> legs<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.070> the

before putting in the legs and the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.649 
before putting in the legs and the
support<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.520> drill<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:41.970> pilot<00:01:42.119> holes

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
support and and drill your pilot holes

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.560 
support and and drill your pilot holes
in<00:01:42.899> those<00:01:43.020> first<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:44.670> put<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:45.060> legs<00:01:45.329> in

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and drill through those it makes it a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.850 
and drill through those it makes it a
little<00:01:48.180> bit<00:01:48.390> easier<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:49.380> kind<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.619> tough

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
little bit easier it's kind of tough

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.389 
little bit easier it's kind of tough
drilling<00:01:50.250> through<00:01:50.369> four<00:01:50.670> boards<00:01:50.939> at<00:01:51.090> once<00:01:52.399> if
