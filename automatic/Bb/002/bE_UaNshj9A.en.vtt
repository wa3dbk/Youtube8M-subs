comment here I wanted to show you my
wireless<00:00:10.219> tournament<00:00:11.219> edition<00:00:11.550> here<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:11.849> I

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
wireless tournament edition here that I

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:20.090 
wireless tournament edition here that I
use<00:00:12.090> with<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:14.269> axis<00:00:15.269> adapter<00:00:17.750> pretty<00:00:18.750> much<00:00:19.100> so

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
use with the axis adapter pretty much so

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.070 
use with the axis adapter pretty much so
install<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:20.970> adapter<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:23.840> actually<00:00:24.840> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
install the adapter here and actually I

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.140 
install the adapter here and actually I
have<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> home<00:00:25.560> button<00:00:25.830> active<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.910> have

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
have the home button active and I have

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.759 
have the home button active and I have
the<00:00:28.130> four<00:00:29.130> LED<00:00:29.849> lights<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:31.080> status<00:00:31.529> lights

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the four LED lights here status lights

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.020 
the four LED lights here status lights
to<00:00:32.250> mimic<00:00:33.200> what<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.680> status<00:00:35.579> lights<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
to mimic what the status lights on the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.290 
to mimic what the status lights on the
sixaxis<00:00:36.329> actually<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.090> tell

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
sixaxis actually do so you can tell

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.840 
sixaxis actually do so you can tell
right<00:00:39.329> now<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:41.210> system<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.420> ps3<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.410> off<00:00:43.850> so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
right now the system the ps3 is off so

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.850 
right now the system the ps3 is off so
we<00:00:45.600> push<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.350> home<00:00:46.680> button<00:00:47.000> it<00:00:48.000> starts<00:00:48.329> lineup

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
we push the home button it starts lineup

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.380 
we push the home button it starts lineup
you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> ps3<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.000> status

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
you can see the ps3 is on and the status

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.840 
you can see the ps3 is on and the status
light<00:00:54.800> letting<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> know<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.550> know<00:00:56.699> just

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
like the sixaxis so that there tells you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:11.510 
like the sixaxis so that there tells you
that<00:01:01.829> player<00:01:02.760> 1<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:07.040> alright<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:10.520> hold

that player 1 is on alright then we hold

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.120 
that player 1 is on alright then we hold
the<00:01:11.790> home<00:01:11.939> button<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:13.939> brings<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> menu

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
Circle go back so yes that's pretty much

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.430 
Circle go back so yes that's pretty much
it<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:27.130> know<00:01:27.750> everything<00:01:28.750> work<00:01:28.930> shin<00:01:29.260> jae

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440

shin jainism bapt ER works fine let me

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.700 
shin jainism bapt ER works fine let me
see<00:01:36.840> complete<00:01:37.840> forgot<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.350> reassign

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
see complete forgot to reassign

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.950 
see complete forgot to reassign
controllers<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:42.360> think<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:43.420> can<00:01:43.660> only<00:01:43.750> do<00:01:43.930> it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
controllers I think you can only do it

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:54.650 
controllers I think you can only do it
in<00:01:44.110> game<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:46.780> right<00:01:46.900> let's<00:01:47.080> try<00:01:47.260> out

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.420 

we're<00:01:55.660> wiring<00:01:56.050> of<00:01:56.410> the<00:01:57.420> LEDs<00:01:58.420> here<00:01:59.070> what<00:02:00.070> I<00:02:00.100> did

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
we're wiring of the LEDs here what I did

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.700 
we're wiring of the LEDs here what I did
I<00:02:00.460> wired<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:02.340> LEDs<00:02:03.340> on<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.730> madcatz<00:02:04.360> PCB<00:02:05.170> to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
I wired the LEDs on the madcatz PCB to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.210 
I wired the LEDs on the madcatz PCB to
the<00:02:05.830> LEDs<00:02:06.280> on<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.670> sixaxis<00:02:07.660> my<00:02:08.050> PCB<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.680> here<00:02:09.040> I

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
the LEDs on the sixaxis my PCB is here I

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.910 
the LEDs on the sixaxis my PCB is here I
didn't<00:02:09.970> open<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.240> because<00:02:10.710> dissipated<00:02:11.710> he<00:02:11.800> has

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
didn't open it because dissipated he has

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.620 
didn't open it because dissipated he has
to<00:02:12.250> get<00:02:13.030> back<00:02:13.300> in<00:02:14.070> there<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:15.730> but<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.390> can<00:02:16.510> take

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
to get back in there so but I can take

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.010 
to get back in there so but I can take
pictures<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:16.960> it<00:02:17.140> open<00:02:18.390> let's<00:02:19.390> see<00:02:19.600> now<00:02:19.840> that

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
pictures of it open let's see now that

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.250 
pictures of it open let's see now that
we're<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.290> game<00:02:23.190> their<00:02:24.190> controller<00:02:24.850> settings

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
we're in game their controller settings

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.350 
we're in game their controller settings
and<00:02:26.260> then<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.920> can<00:02:27.070> reassign<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.910> say

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
and then you can reassign to say

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.270 
and then you can reassign to say
controller<00:02:28.900> three<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:31.620> there<00:02:32.620> we<00:02:32.770> go<00:02:32.890> on<00:02:33.040> blue

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
controller three and there we go on blue

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.490 
controller three and there we go on blue
on<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:36.450> status<00:02:37.450> lights<00:02:37.690> here<00:02:37.930> lets<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.320> know

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
on the status lights here lets you know

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.770 
on the status lights here lets you know
so<00:02:39.040> we<00:02:39.100> can<00:02:39.220> reassign<00:02:39.640> again<00:02:39.910> back<00:02:40.120> controller

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
so we can reassign again back controller

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.290 
so we can reassign again back controller
for<00:02:41.340> lets<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.430> know<00:02:42.460> so<00:02:42.730> yeah<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.000> mimics

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
for lets you know so yeah it mimics

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.530 
for lets you know so yeah it mimics
everything<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:45.760> have<00:02:45.880> any<00:02:46.000> questions<00:02:46.420> you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
everything you have any questions you

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.370 
everything you have any questions you
know<00:02:46.630> pme<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.830> red<00:02:48.010> comet
