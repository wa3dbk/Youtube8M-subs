00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
which is the electric Cuisinart I like

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.190 
which is the electric Cuisinart I like
the<00:00:35.370> electric<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.120> because<00:00:36.239> takes<00:00:37.080> a

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the electric one just because takes a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.479 
the electric one just because takes a
lot<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> guesswork<00:00:37.800> out<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.160> pressure

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
lot of the guesswork out of pressure

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.010 
lot of the guesswork out of pressure
cooking<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.059> don't<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.510> try<00:00:39.720> and<00:00:39.750> gauge

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
cooking you don't have to try and gauge

because in an emergency it's actually
really<00:00:51.720> great<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.110> use<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.379> use<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.680> on

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
takes less time to cook things so you're

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150 
takes less time to cook things so you're
going<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.090> conserve<00:00:57.540> your<00:00:57.750> fuel<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.739> keep<00:00:59.010> that

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
that for cooking as well but let me show

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.730 
that for cooking as well but let me show
you<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:07.050> we're<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.410> I'm<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.649> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you what we're going to do I'm going to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.139 
you what we're going to do I'm going to
make<00:01:07.830> rice<00:01:08.070> today<00:01:08.340> I'm<00:01:08.520> actually<00:01:08.700> making<00:01:08.940> the

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
make rice today I'm actually making the

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.440 
make rice today I'm actually making the
sticky<00:01:09.420> rice

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.990 

a<00:01:13.480> great<00:01:13.990> rice<00:01:14.350> cooker<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:15.100> you<00:01:15.700> can<00:01:15.820> actually

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
a great rice cooker and you can actually

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.480 
a great rice cooker and you can actually
cook<00:01:16.330> things<00:01:16.630> like<00:01:16.870> brown<00:01:17.590> rice<00:01:17.860> in<00:01:18.340> a

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
cook things like brown rice in a

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.770 
cook things like brown rice in a
fraction<00:01:18.910> of<00:01:18.970> time<00:01:19.120> I<00:01:19.180> think<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:19.480> takes<00:01:19.630> about

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
fraction of time I think it takes about

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.080 
fraction of time I think it takes about
20<00:01:20.170> minutes<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.980> can<00:01:21.100> also<00:01:21.220> do<00:01:21.430> wheat<00:01:21.640> berries

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
20 minutes you can also do wheat berries

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.180 
20 minutes you can also do wheat berries
it's<00:01:22.900> all<00:01:23.020> going<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.230> be<00:01:23.290> about<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.680> same<00:01:23.860> idea

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
it's all going to be about the same idea

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.240 
it's all going to be about the same idea
so<00:01:24.910> I<00:01:24.940> need<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.390> make<00:01:25.510> 3<00:01:25.810> cups<00:01:26.020> of<00:01:26.140> rice<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:27.100> I'm

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
so I need to make 3 cups of rice and I'm

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.650 
so I need to make 3 cups of rice and I'm
going<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.520> do<00:01:27.930> 1<00:01:28.930> cup<00:01:29.170> of<00:01:29.200> rice<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:30.479> one<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.630> a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
going to do 1 cup of rice and one and a

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.130 
going to do 1 cup of rice and one and a
half<00:01:31.900> cups<00:01:32.260> of<00:01:32.410> water<00:01:32.470> now<00:01:32.830> this<00:01:33.040> is<00:01:33.310> a<00:01:34.140> little

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
half cups of water now this is a little

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.350 
half cups of water now this is a little
different<00:01:35.590> than<00:01:36.400> doing<00:01:36.790> rice<00:01:36.970> on<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.300> stove

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
different than doing rice on the stove

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.630 
different than doing rice on the stove
because<00:01:37.840> if<00:01:37.960> you<00:01:38.140> never<00:01:38.800> made<00:01:39.130> rice<00:01:39.340> on<00:01:39.520> the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
because if you never made rice on the

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.730 
because if you never made rice on the
stove<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:40.090> know<00:01:40.270> that<00:01:40.540> it's<00:01:40.720> one<00:01:41.380> cup<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.590> rice

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
stove you know that it's one cup of rice

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.830 
stove you know that it's one cup of rice
and<00:01:42.220> two<00:01:42.370> cups<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.760> water<00:01:42.820> makes<00:01:43.270> three<00:01:43.600> cups

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
and two cups of water makes three cups

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.560 
and two cups of water makes three cups
of<00:01:44.560> rice<00:01:44.770> but<00:01:45.130> in<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.460> pressure<00:01:45.640> cooker<00:01:45.759> it's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
of rice but in the pressure cooker it's

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.160 
of rice but in the pressure cooker it's
one<00:01:46.810> cup<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.140> rice<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:48.070> one-and-a-half<00:01:49.170> cups

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
one cup of rice to one-and-a-half cups

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.050 
one cup of rice to one-and-a-half cups
to<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.440> water<00:01:50.680> so<00:01:51.040> it's<00:01:51.369> a<00:01:51.670> one<00:01:51.880> to

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
to the water so it's a one to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.030 
to the water so it's a one to
one-and-a-half<00:01:52.390> ratio<00:01:53.020> instead<00:01:53.290> of<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.530> 1<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:53.860> 2

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
one-and-a-half ratio instead of a 1 to 2

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.920 
one-and-a-half ratio instead of a 1 to 2
ratio<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:55.119> other<00:01:55.240> thing<00:01:55.509> we<00:01:55.600> want<00:01:55.750> to<00:01:55.810> make

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
ratio the other thing we want to make

butter this isn't necessarily for flavor
and<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.670> can<00:02:03.850> use<00:02:03.970> any<00:02:04.210> oil<00:02:04.300> but<00:02:05.200> this<00:02:05.500> is

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
and you can use any oil but this is

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.650 
and you can use any oil but this is
actually<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.009> reason<00:02:06.160> why<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:06.399> put<00:02:06.520> oil<00:02:07.270> or

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
actually the reason why you put oil or

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.389 
actually the reason why you put oil or
butter<00:02:07.780> in<00:02:08.140> your<00:02:08.320> rice<00:02:08.470> is<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.830> keep<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.190> foam

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
butter in your rice is to keep the foam

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.949 
butter in your rice is to keep the foam
from<00:02:09.670> going<00:02:09.910> down<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.300> really<00:02:10.450> important

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
from going down it's really important

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.810 
from going down it's really important
when<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:11.140> have<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.290> pressure<00:02:11.500> cooker<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:12.640> you

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
when you have a pressure cooker that you

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.580 
when you have a pressure cooker that you
keep<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.180> foam<00:02:13.390> down<00:02:13.570> or<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.810> can<00:02:13.959> foam<00:02:14.200> up<00:02:14.410> and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
keep the foam down or it can foam up and

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.460 
keep the foam down or it can foam up and
ruin<00:02:15.220> your<00:02:15.250> pressure<00:02:15.520> cooker<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.630> put<00:02:17.020> in<00:02:17.170> a

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
ruin your pressure cooker so I put in a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.440 
ruin your pressure cooker so I put in a
tablespoon<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.370> butter<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:18.910> can<00:02:19.330> also

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
tablespoon of butter and you can also

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.750 
tablespoon of butter and you can also
put<00:02:19.750> in<00:02:19.840> some<00:02:19.870> salt<00:02:20.290> if<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.620> like<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.640> it's

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
put in some salt if you like that it's

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.340 
put in some salt if you like that it's
totally<00:02:21.940> preferential<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:22.870> if<00:02:22.959> you're<00:02:23.140> using

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
totally preferential and if you're using

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
totally preferential and if you're using
a<00:02:24.690> store-bought<00:02:25.690> broth<00:02:26.320> I<00:02:26.650> probably<00:02:27.040> wouldn't

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
a store-bought broth I probably wouldn't

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.830 
a store-bought broth I probably wouldn't
add<00:02:27.519> in<00:02:27.670> any<00:02:27.850> salt<00:02:28.150> because<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:28.450> already<00:02:28.630> is

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
add in any salt because I already is

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.259 
add in any salt because I already is
going<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.019> have<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.170> lot<00:02:29.320> of<00:02:29.380> salt<00:02:29.620> in<00:02:29.799> it<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.970> I

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
going to have a lot of salt in it so I

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.990 
going to have a lot of salt in it so I
put<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.690> into<00:02:31.900> my<00:02:32.080> container<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.160> did<00:02:33.910> it

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
put that into my container I did it

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.170 
put that into my container I did it
without<00:02:34.090> my<00:02:34.570> trivet<00:02:34.989> obviously<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.940> more

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
without my trivet obviously this is more

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.400 
without my trivet obviously this is more
if<00:02:37.269> you're<00:02:37.420> going<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.600> do<00:02:37.750> meat<00:02:37.930> or<00:02:38.080> something

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
if you're going to do meat or something

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.680 
if you're going to do meat or something
that<00:02:38.590> needs<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.830> sit<00:02:39.160> off<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.580> base<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.120> with

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
that needs to sit off the base and with

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.090 
that needs to sit off the base and with
rice<00:02:40.900> we<00:02:41.110> don't<00:02:41.290> need<00:02:41.380> this<00:02:41.560> because<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.950> rice

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
rice we don't need this because the rice

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.539 
rice we don't need this because the rice
would<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:42.549> fall<00:02:43.090> through<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.390> holes<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:45.459> I'm

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
would just fall through the holes so I'm

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.410 
would just fall through the holes so I'm
going<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.730> take<00:02:45.880> my<00:02:46.030> lid<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.959> I'm<00:02:47.290> going<00:02:47.620> to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
going to take my lid and I'm going to

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.120 
going to take my lid and I'm going to
lock<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:49.630> in<00:02:49.750> place<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.620> always<00:02:50.830> want<00:02:51.100> to

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
lock it in place and you always want to

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.580 
lock it in place and you always want to
check<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.459> make<00:02:51.489> sure<00:02:51.580> it's<00:02:51.880> locked<00:02:52.060> because

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
check and make sure it's locked because

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.199 
check and make sure it's locked because
if<00:02:53.590> it's<00:02:53.860> not<00:02:54.100> locked<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.700> won't<00:02:54.880> ever<00:02:55.000> get<00:02:55.150> to

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
if it's not locked it won't ever get to

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.310 
if it's not locked it won't ever get to
pressure<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.720> you'll<00:02:55.840> be<00:02:55.930> sitting<00:02:56.170> around

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
pressure and you'll be sitting around

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.320 
pressure and you'll be sitting around
waiting<00:02:56.500> forever<00:02:56.830> wondering<00:02:57.310> why<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.760> ever

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
waiting forever wondering why I ever

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.789 
waiting forever wondering why I ever
told<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.660> pressure<00:02:58.959> cookers<00:02:59.350> work<00:02:59.530> fast

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
told you pressure cookers work fast

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.640 
told you pressure cookers work fast
because<00:03:00.220> they<00:03:00.370> do<00:03:00.600> so

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
because they do so

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.380 
because they do so
make<00:03:02.769> sure<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.040> pull<00:03:03.250> up<00:03:03.400> on<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.180> make

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
make sure you pull up on it and make

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.789 
make sure you pull up on it and make
sure<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.659> it's<00:03:04.810> locked<00:03:04.930> if<00:03:05.230> it's<00:03:05.409> not<00:03:05.590> locked

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
sure that it's locked if it's not locked

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.509 
sure that it's locked if it's not locked
it<00:03:06.670> will<00:03:06.849> come<00:03:07.060> right<00:03:07.239> off<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:08.590> make<00:03:09.159> sure<00:03:09.190> that

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
it will come right off so make sure that

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.670 
it will come right off so make sure that
it's<00:03:09.700> locked<00:03:09.909> and<00:03:10.330> then<00:03:10.900> we're<00:03:11.110> just<00:03:11.140> going<00:03:11.440> to

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
it's locked and then we're just going to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.800 
it's locked and then we're just going to
press<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.099> Menu<00:03:12.340> button<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.849> put<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.510> on<00:03:13.629> high

press the Menu button and put it on high

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.630 
press the Menu button and put it on high
pressure<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.920> this<00:03:15.069> is<00:03:15.190> actually<00:03:15.489> what's

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
pressure and this is actually what's

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.460 
pressure and this is actually what's
amazing<00:03:15.819> is<00:03:16.150> I'm<00:03:16.599> going<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.900> set<00:03:17.019> my<00:03:17.140> timer<00:03:17.170> for

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
amazing is I'm going to set my timer for

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.770 
amazing is I'm going to set my timer for
only<00:03:17.709> three<00:03:17.980> minutes<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:19.329> will<00:03:19.450> be<00:03:19.599> done

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
only three minutes and it will be done

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.410 
only three minutes and it will be done

naturally pressure release for seven
minutes

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
minutes

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.569 
minutes
naturally<00:03:38.530> letting<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.040> pressure<00:03:39.190> release

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
naturally letting the pressure release

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.619 
naturally letting the pressure release
means<00:03:39.819> you<00:03:40.000> don't<00:03:40.150> touch<00:03:40.359> your<00:03:40.629> machine<00:03:41.040> until

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
means you don't touch your machine until

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.910 
means you don't touch your machine until
seven<00:03:43.629> minutes<00:03:43.900> has<00:03:44.079> gone<00:03:44.109> by<00:03:44.349> and<00:03:44.530> then<00:03:44.829> if

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
seven minutes has gone by and then if

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.170 
seven minutes has gone by and then if
there's<00:03:45.099> any<00:03:45.280> other<00:03:45.400> pressure<00:03:45.670> left<00:03:45.970> because

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
there's any other pressure left because

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.160 
there's any other pressure left because
remember<00:03:46.359> with<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.660> electric<00:03:47.019> pressure

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
remember with the electric pressure

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.229 
remember with the electric pressure
cooker<00:03:47.349> it<00:03:48.310> won't<00:03:48.489> let<00:03:48.670> you<00:03:48.760> take<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.060> lid<00:03:49.209> off

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
cooker it won't let you take the lid off

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.360 
cooker it won't let you take the lid off
until<00:03:49.690> it's<00:03:49.870> act<00:03:50.109> absolutely<00:03:50.799> safe<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:51.310> all

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
until it's act absolutely safe and all

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.729 
until it's act absolutely safe and all
pressure<00:03:51.640> has<00:03:51.909> been<00:03:52.060> released<00:03:52.390> so<00:03:53.140> if<00:03:53.379> after

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
pressure has been released so if after

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.649 
pressure has been released so if after
the<00:03:53.829> seven<00:03:54.129> minutes<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.730> still<00:03:55.120> won't<00:03:55.239> let<00:03:55.420> you

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
the seven minutes it still won't let you

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.460 
the seven minutes it still won't let you
unlock<00:03:56.849> the<00:03:57.849> lid<00:03:58.090> then<00:03:58.659> what<00:03:58.840> we're<00:03:59.230> going<00:03:59.409> to

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
unlock the lid then what we're going to

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.380 
unlock the lid then what we're going to
do<00:03:59.650> is<00:03:59.829> we're<00:04:00.040> going<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.370> pressure<00:04:00.970> release

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
do is we're going to pressure release

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.849 
do is we're going to pressure release
any<00:04:01.720> of<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.930> rest<00:04:02.109> of<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.349> pressure<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.769> I'll

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
any of the rest of the pressure and I'll

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.710 
any of the rest of the pressure and I'll
show<00:04:03.040> you<00:04:03.069> how<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.340> do<00:04:03.519> that<00:04:03.700> anyway<00:04:04.480> we'll<00:04:04.629> go

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
show you how to do that anyway we'll go

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.470 
show you how to do that anyway we'll go
ahead<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:04.930> let<00:04:05.109> this<00:04:05.319> go<00:04:06.220> for<00:04:06.639> three<00:04:07.299> minutes

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
ahead and let this go for three minutes

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.360 
ahead and let this go for three minutes
let<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:07.900> naturally<00:04:08.319> pressure<00:04:08.859> release<00:04:09.160> for

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
let it naturally pressure release for

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.770 
let it naturally pressure release for
seven<00:04:09.609> minutes<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.030> then<00:04:10.150> I've<00:04:10.239> got<00:04:10.419> my<00:04:10.569> rice

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
seven minutes and then I've got my rice

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.780 
seven minutes and then I've got my rice
ready<00:04:11.079> to<00:04:11.169> go<00:04:11.319> for<00:04:11.680> dinner<00:04:12.370> this<00:04:12.579> evening

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.710 

okay<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:18.670> cooked<00:04:19.670> it<00:04:19.820> on<00:04:19.910> high<00:04:20.090> pressure<00:04:20.360> for

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
okay so I cooked it on high pressure for

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.350 
okay so I cooked it on high pressure for
three<00:04:20.930> minutes<00:04:21.110> and<00:04:21.610> let<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.790> naturally

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
three minutes and let it naturally

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.060 
three minutes and let it naturally
release<00:04:23.600> its<00:04:23.780> pressure<00:04:24.020> for<00:04:24.350> seven<00:04:24.650> minutes

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
release its pressure for seven minutes

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.340 
release its pressure for seven minutes
now<00:04:25.520> some<00:04:25.790> people<00:04:25.940> are<00:04:26.450> a<00:04:26.780> little<00:04:26.990> iffy<00:04:27.320> about

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
now some people are a little iffy about

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.020 
now some people are a little iffy about
pressure<00:04:27.740> cookers<00:04:28.130> because<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.610> time<00:04:28.820> that

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
pressure cookers because the time that

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.640 
pressure cookers because the time that
it<00:04:29.150> takes<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.540> actually<00:04:29.660> get<00:04:30.020> to<00:04:30.350> pressure

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
it takes to actually get to pressure

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.410 
it takes to actually get to pressure
because<00:04:31.100> it<00:04:31.220> won't<00:04:31.400> start<00:04:31.730> counting<00:04:32.120> down<00:04:32.240> to

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
because it won't start counting down to

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.030 
because it won't start counting down to
three<00:04:32.630> minutes<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.050> tell<00:04:33.290> it<00:04:33.410> that<00:04:33.560> that<00:04:33.860> high

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
three minutes and tell it that that high

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.010 
three minutes and tell it that that high
pressure<00:04:34.280> which<00:04:35.090> can<00:04:35.300> take<00:04:35.480> a<00:04:35.540> couple<00:04:35.780> minutes

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
pressure which can take a couple minutes

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.180 
pressure which can take a couple minutes
but<00:04:36.350> if<00:04:36.410> you<00:04:36.470> think<00:04:36.590> about<00:04:36.710> it

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
but if you think about it

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.430 
but if you think about it
it<00:04:37.490> takes<00:04:38.000> 20<00:04:38.390> minutes<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.780> cook<00:04:38.930> rice<00:04:39.170> but

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
it takes 20 minutes to cook rice but

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.870 
it takes 20 minutes to cook rice but
that<00:04:39.590> doesn't<00:04:39.890> include<00:04:39.980> the<00:04:40.310> time<00:04:40.520> it<00:04:40.640> takes

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
that doesn't include the time it takes

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.060 
that doesn't include the time it takes
to<00:04:41.060> get<00:04:41.150> your<00:04:41.360> water<00:04:41.510> boiling<00:04:42.170> before<00:04:42.710> you

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
to get your water boiling before you

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.610 
to get your water boiling before you
actually<00:04:43.280> count<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.790> cook<00:04:44.000> time<00:04:44.210> so<00:04:44.930> cooking

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
actually count the cook time so cooking

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.130 
actually count the cook time so cooking
time<00:04:45.950> wise<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:46.640> did<00:04:47.180> cut<00:04:47.450> it<00:04:47.570> in<00:04:47.660> half<00:04:47.900> because

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
time wise it did cut it in half because

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.620 
time wise it did cut it in half because
this<00:04:48.530> will<00:04:48.710> take<00:04:48.890> ten<00:04:49.670> minutes<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.540> know

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
this will take ten minutes you know

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.480 
this will take ten minutes you know
three<00:04:51.020> minutes<00:04:51.140> cooking<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.890> seven<00:04:52.190> minutes

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
three minutes cooking the seven minutes

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.070 
three minutes cooking the seven minutes
on<00:04:52.610> natural<00:04:53.000> pressure<00:04:53.210> release<00:04:53.600> that's<00:04:53.810> ten

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
on natural pressure release that's ten

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.350 
on natural pressure release that's ten
minutes<00:04:54.410> whereas<00:04:55.190> normally<00:04:55.640> it<00:04:55.730> takes<00:04:55.790> twenty

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
minutes whereas normally it takes twenty

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.250 
minutes whereas normally it takes twenty
minutes<00:04:57.640> so<00:04:58.640> I'm<00:04:59.480> going<00:04:59.660> to<00:04:59.750> go<00:04:59.810> ahead<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.110> see

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
minutes so I'm going to go ahead and see

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.950 
minutes so I'm going to go ahead and see
if<00:05:00.290> it'll<00:05:00.500> let<00:05:00.560> me<00:05:00.890> open<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:02.090> lid<00:05:02.270> which<00:05:02.780> it

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
if it'll let me open the lid which it

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.680 
if it'll let me open the lid which it
won't<00:05:03.230> so<00:05:03.530> what<00:05:03.680> we<00:05:03.770> need<00:05:03.920> to<00:05:04.010> do<00:05:04.190> is<00:05:04.570> in<00:05:05.570> the

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
won't so what we need to do is in the

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.060 
won't so what we need to do is in the
back<00:05:06.490> where<00:05:07.490> it<00:05:07.640> has<00:05:08.500> this<00:05:09.500> thing<00:05:09.800> that<00:05:10.010> says

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
back where it has this thing that says

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.940 
back where it has this thing that says
pressure<00:05:10.580> and<00:05:11.000> pressure<00:05:11.240> relation<00:05:12.020> we<00:05:12.770> need

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
pressure and pressure relation we need

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.260 
pressure and pressure relation we need
to<00:05:13.040> open<00:05:13.160> up<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.520> press<00:05:13.730> release<00:05:14.030> and<00:05:14.180> I'm

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
to open up the press release and I'm

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.450 
to open up the press release and I'm
going<00:05:14.450> to<00:05:14.510> use<00:05:14.630> a<00:05:14.660> hot<00:05:14.840> pad<00:05:15.160> obviously<00:05:16.160> steam

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
going to use a hot pad obviously steam

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.740 
going to use a hot pad obviously steam
is<00:05:16.610> going<00:05:16.760> to<00:05:16.880> come<00:05:17.060> out<00:05:17.150> to<00:05:17.360> release<00:05:17.570> the

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
is going to come out to release the

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.600 
is going to come out to release the
pressure<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.800> what<00:05:18.950> you<00:05:19.040> want<00:05:19.160> to<00:05:19.220> do<00:05:19.340> is<00:05:19.430> just

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
pressure and what you want to do is just

down when it is done releasing its

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.690 
down when it is done releasing its
pressure<00:05:58.680> and<00:05:59.010> you'll<00:05:59.130> actually<00:05:59.280> hear<00:05:59.640> it

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
pressure and you'll actually hear it

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.880 
pressure and you'll actually hear it

sort of make a clicking sound like it's
unlocking<00:06:02.460> and<00:06:02.760> that's<00:06:03.360> when<00:06:03.600> you'll<00:06:03.750> be<00:06:03.900> able

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
unlocking and that's when you'll be able

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.420 
unlocking and that's when you'll be able
to<00:06:04.430> open<00:06:05.430> up<00:06:05.550> your<00:06:06.030> pressure<00:06:06.420> cooker<00:06:07.430> that's

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
to open up your pressure cooker that's

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.700 
to open up your pressure cooker that's
how<00:06:08.610> you'll<00:06:08.760> know<00:06:08.790> it's<00:06:09.120> safe<00:06:09.390> at<00:06:10.200> least<00:06:10.320> to<00:06:10.560> do

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
how you'll know it's safe at least to do

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.590 
how you'll know it's safe at least to do
so<00:06:10.920> so<00:06:11.820> um<00:06:12.770> when<00:06:13.770> I<00:06:13.800> can<00:06:14.100> open<00:06:14.400> this<00:06:14.580> I'm<00:06:15.360> going

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
so so um when I can open this I'm going

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.120 
so so um when I can open this I'm going
to<00:06:15.660> open<00:06:15.870> it<00:06:16.020> show<00:06:16.320> you<00:06:16.380> what<00:06:16.560> the<00:06:16.650> rice<00:06:16.830> looks

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
to open it show you what the rice looks

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.980 
to open it show you what the rice looks
like<00:06:17.310> see

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.159 

okay<00:06:22.680> so<00:06:22.740> it<00:06:23.490> was<00:06:23.699> about<00:06:23.910> 30<00:06:24.240> seconds<00:06:24.780> I<00:06:24.900> had<00:06:25.080> to

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
okay so it was about 30 seconds I had to

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.629 
okay so it was about 30 seconds I had to
wait<00:06:25.320> for<00:06:25.350> it<00:06:25.620> to<00:06:25.800> finish<00:06:25.919> releasing<00:06:26.520> its

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
wait for it to finish releasing its

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.670 
wait for it to finish releasing its
pressure<00:06:26.880> and<00:06:27.210> now<00:06:27.630> you<00:06:27.690> can<00:06:27.930> see<00:06:28.110> I<00:06:28.139> can<00:06:28.350> open

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
pressure and now you can see I can open

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.550 
pressure and now you can see I can open
it<00:06:28.830> and<00:06:30.740> I<00:06:31.740> think<00:06:32.610> we<00:06:33.449> have<00:06:33.539> perfectly<00:06:34.229> cooked

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
it and I think we have perfectly cooked

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.090 
it and I think we have perfectly cooked
rice<00:06:34.830> this<00:06:35.220> actually<00:06:35.729> makes<00:06:36.000> rice<00:06:37.100> rice

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
rice this actually makes rice rice

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.270 
rice this actually makes rice rice
quicker<00:06:38.490> then<00:06:39.449> it<00:06:39.600> does<00:06:39.840> on<00:06:40.259> the<00:06:40.740> stove<00:06:41.039> and

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
quicker then it does on the stove and
