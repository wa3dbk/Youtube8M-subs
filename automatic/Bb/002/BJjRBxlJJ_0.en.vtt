will communicate to your GPS in your
iphone<00:02:10.970> okay<00:02:11.480> so<00:02:11.750> particularly<00:02:12.140> using<00:02:12.440> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
iphone okay so particularly using the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.699 
iphone okay so particularly using the
activity<00:02:12.920> app<00:02:13.720> it'll<00:02:14.720> also<00:02:14.989> use<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.230> heart<00:02:15.530> rate

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
activity app it'll also use a heart rate

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.949 
activity app it'll also use a heart rate
sensor<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:16.190> don't<00:02:16.430> know<00:02:16.519> if<00:02:16.579> I<00:02:17.030> can<00:02:17.630> take<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.870> off

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
sensor I don't know if I can take it off

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:18.880 
sensor I don't know if I can take it off
we<00:02:18.019> can<00:02:18.140> show<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.410> heart<00:02:18.590> rate<00:02:18.680> sensor

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
we can show you the heart rate sensor

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.920 
we can show you the heart rate sensor
but<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:20.000> probably<00:02:20.180> would<00:02:20.359> have<00:02:20.420> seen<00:02:20.600> in<00:02:20.780> the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
but you probably would have seen in the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.080 
but you probably would have seen in the
in<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.200> videos<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.459> they're<00:02:22.609> those<00:02:22.760> four

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
in the videos so they're those four

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.810 
in the videos so they're those four
little<00:02:23.410> those<00:02:24.410> wipes<00:02:24.709> there<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.609> when<00:02:25.730> they

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
little those wipes there and when they

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.550 
little those wipes there and when they
come<00:02:26.000> on<00:02:26.120> actually<00:02:26.450> quite<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.690> green<00:02:27.019> white<00:02:27.290> and

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
come on actually quite a green white and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.009 
come on actually quite a green white and
they<00:02:27.859> measure<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.700> flow<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.030> blood<00:02:29.180> in<00:02:29.690> your

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
they measure the flow of blood in your

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.890 
they measure the flow of blood in your
in<00:02:30.470> your<00:02:30.500> veins<00:02:30.829> in<00:02:31.250> there<00:02:31.430> are<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:32.750> that's

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
in your veins in there are and so that's

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.180 
in your veins in there are and so that's
pretty<00:02:33.109> cool<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.560> helps<00:02:33.799> to<00:02:33.920> give<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.130> a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
pretty cool so that helps to give you a

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.220 
pretty cool so that helps to give you a
much<00:02:34.370> more<00:02:34.400> accurate<00:02:34.730> calorie<00:02:35.569> burn<00:02:35.840> rate<00:02:36.079> and

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
much more accurate calorie burn rate and

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.059 
much more accurate calorie burn rate and
things<00:02:36.440> like<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.620> yeah

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
things like that yeah

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.500 
things like that yeah
and<00:02:40.069> I<00:02:40.129> don't<00:02:40.189> know<00:02:40.370> if<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.519> a<00:02:40.640> link<00:02:40.909> link<00:02:41.269> fans
