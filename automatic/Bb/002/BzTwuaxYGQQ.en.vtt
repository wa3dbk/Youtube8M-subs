 I see you more as a 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.380
 real father 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.580
 up past 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.860
 I never appreciate this is pure for the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:39.600
 view of my house because it was a girl 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.730
 and your education was very rigid but now 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.910
 I learned to value it 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.740
 I want to give you a decent life a place 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.700
 decent where to live away from that 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.300
 dump and clear a good wool so that 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.300
 keep yourself 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.780
 good wool how much did you do 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.840
 about 30,000 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.150
 60,000 in total 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.150
 not a penny less 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.260
 60,000 will be a penny less 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.600
 tomorrow that money will be in your 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.040
 hands 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.680
 only that the caste is going to have to wait 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.090
 a little if you leave the dump now 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.420
 I was walking to think that we are together in 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.420
 this 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.410

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.700
 here to sleep 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.350
 I think it's better because the city is 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.510
 very dangerous 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.090

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.790

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.060
 Daily sleep in your room on a mattress 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.720

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.070

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.070

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.380

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.380

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.030
