the<00:00:24.330> thing<00:00:24.510> about<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:25.400> that<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.519> might<00:00:26.670> want

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
the thing about this that you might want

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.870 
the thing about this that you might want
to<00:00:27.380> consider<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.650> when<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.640> have<00:00:29.760> them

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
to consider is that when you have them

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.420 
to consider is that when you have them
on<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:31.019> hit<00:00:31.080> something<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:32.279> actually

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
on and this hit something it actually

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.470 
on and this hit something it actually
makes<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:33.110> semi<00:00:34.110> loud<00:00:34.410> noise<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.910> little<00:00:36.390> bit

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
makes a semi loud noise and a little bit

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.940 
makes a semi loud noise and a little bit
different<00:00:36.780> than<00:00:36.870> other<00:00:36.989> headphones<00:00:37.200> but

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
different than other headphones but

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.190 
different than other headphones but
other<00:00:38.820> than<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.420> really<00:00:39.719> noticed

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
other than that I really noticed

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.260 
other than that I really noticed
anything<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.739> would<00:00:40.950> consider<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.760> drawback

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
anything I would consider a drawback

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.270 
anything I would consider a drawback
really<00:00:43.700> obviously<00:00:44.700> sound<00:00:45.000> quality<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.510> not

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
really obviously sound quality is not

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.680 
really obviously sound quality is not
the<00:00:47.280> absolute<00:00:47.579> best<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.059> could<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.420> but

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the absolute best it could it be but

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930 
the absolute best it could it be but
that's<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:50.399> lower<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.789> price

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that's because the lower in the price

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.650 
that's because the lower in the price
range<00:00:51.059> which<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.660> plus<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:52.590> me<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.539> i'm<00:00:54.539> not

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
range which is plus for me and i'm not

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.740 
range which is plus for me and i'm not
too<00:00:54.840> picky<00:00:54.870> about<00:00:56.300> having<00:00:57.300> something<00:00:57.539> that

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
too picky about having something that

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.040 
too picky about having something that
sounds<00:00:58.590> audio<00:00:59.520> file<00:00:59.850> where<00:01:00.120> these<00:01:00.270> them<00:01:00.690> these

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
sounds audio file where these them these

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.570 
sounds audio file where these them these
are<00:01:01.109> really<00:01:01.379> good<00:01:01.590> um<00:01:03.830> i'm<00:01:04.830> saying<00:01:05.189> them<00:01:05.369> too

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
are really good um i'm saying them too

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.890 
are really good um i'm saying them too
much<00:01:05.720> but<00:01:06.720> these<00:01:07.070> are<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.880> good<00:01:09.540> buy<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
much but these are a good buy out of

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.510 
much but these are a good buy out of
thing<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.570> here's<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.840> goal<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.250> didn't

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
thing and here's that goal and I didn't

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
thing and here's that goal and I didn't
see<00:01:14.909> there's<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.150> hair<00:01:15.420> tie<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.990> wrapped

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
see there's a hair tie that I wrapped

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.230 
see there's a hair tie that I wrapped
around<00:01:16.409> here<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> could<00:01:20.670> attach<00:01:20.970> my

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
around here so that I could attach my

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.380 
around here so that I could attach my
ipod<00:01:21.780> obviously<00:01:22.710> they<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.299> but<00:01:24.299> it's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
ipod obviously they do this but it's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.719 
ipod obviously they do this but it's
actually<00:01:24.479> really<00:01:24.750> handy<00:01:24.990> because<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:26.580> can

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
actually really handy because you can
