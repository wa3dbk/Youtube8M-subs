for<00:03:05.920> what<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.070> understand<00:03:06.960> so<00:03:07.960> from<00:03:08.140> what<00:03:08.170> I

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
for what I understand so from what I

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.830 
for what I understand so from what I
understand<00:03:08.740> 4j<00:03:09.370> Studios<00:03:11.700> did<00:03:12.700> this<00:03:12.940> on<00:03:13.330> their

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
understand 4j Studios did this on their

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.930 
understand 4j Studios did this on their
own<00:03:13.870> without<00:03:14.590> telling<00:03:15.190> mojang<00:03:15.520> or<00:03:15.760> notch

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
own without telling mojang or notch

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.300 
own without telling mojang or notch
which<00:03:16.240> means<00:03:16.450> 4j<00:03:17.020> Studios<00:03:17.470> can<00:03:17.860> go<00:03:17.980> fuck

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
which means 4j Studios can go fuck

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.850 
which means 4j Studios can go fuck
themselves<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:19.210> next<00:03:19.840> time<00:03:19.990> they<00:03:20.500> pour<00:03:20.830> a
