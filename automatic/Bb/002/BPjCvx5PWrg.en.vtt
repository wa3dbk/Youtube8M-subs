00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.490
 this video has been recorded for 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:07.170
 'trading' a point is and remember that 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.160
 is invited to participate in the forum 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.160
 whenever you want 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.050
 Now let's talk about the triceratops 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.079
 which are translated into Spanish as a roof in 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.870
 tweezers 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.899
 you will see that they are candles that have a maximum 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.190
 a roof and they match both the 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.190
 opening as the closing on it 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.430
 this pattern as we have already said receives 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.430
 the name of 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.320
 3rd 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.910
 top 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.080
 the inverse that is the 3rd vor oms that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.360
 it would only be in tweezers 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.800
 it is a pattern of change of tendency by 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.740
 so first of all it requires 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.990
 a previous trend and in this case the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.400
 triceratops has a previous tendency 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.260
 bullish 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.070
 and what it would mean would be that after the 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.100
 Pattern 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.360
 the theory tells us reversal is to say 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.340
 that happens to be a bassist 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.340
 after the bearish pattern 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.420
 must be formed by at least two candles 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.790
 although it can be formed by more and is a 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.510
 so imprecise the case is that the maximum 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.910
 both of the body and of the shadows be 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.490
 the same in both candles there may be 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.650
 also between both some candles 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.430
 inferior but good to analyze it 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.130
 Much look more or less equal shades 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.200
 or shadow and body at the same height or 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.090
 shadow and shadow or the two bodies gives 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.940
 same the case is that it marks in the same 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.350
 roof these three examples here are 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.690
 only some examples of 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.119
 very many that there may be this is a 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.220
 Good pretty reliable and clear pattern to the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.610
 mark of the same roof that is indicating 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.470
 what we have already repeated a thousand times 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.420
 there must be an important area of 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.050
 resistance or overbought market 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.990
 in these levels is not so much the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.180
 pattern that occurs but where it occurs 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.310
 let's see some examples we are in 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.310
 euro dollar and diary graph 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.590
 how it will take to form better what 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.590
 we accelerate 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.950
 this candle appears to us we are a 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.520
 main bearish trend here now 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.530
 is seeing bullish movement 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.210
 so we do not know right now if this 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.210
 is going to be a new trend or is it a 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.440
 pullback let's analyze it a little there 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.540
 a bearish trend is going pretty 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.159
 pre-marked 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.379
 this trend as has also been 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.609
 intense and graphical diary is possible 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.950
 that the correction movement is 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.599
 also intense 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.980
 we take the next and look here 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.500
 I would be marking is not a triceratops 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.500
 because there are two candles with the same maximum 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.190
 just also coincides with this 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.040
 resistance to this resistance here two 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.689
 supports that he was breaking 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.189
 here good break and then made 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.189
 resistance and here has now returned 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.640
 let's also use fibonacci to 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.070
 It would also mark around 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.070
 between 61 and 50 percent 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.489
 and now we're going to see if maybe the 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.370
 rs and any oscillator in this 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.140
 case is also in overbought 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.910
 there is a great confluence of factors 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.710
 well you know me floor 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.470
 recommend you use the patterns 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.620
 bearish in bearish tendencies in the 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.200
 bearish trend corrections 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.209
 bearish pattern correction and enter 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.490
 favor of the main trend and not 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.709
 both in bullish trends for 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.150
 use them against trend is to say 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.799
 bullish bearish pattern 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.989
 and try to get a movement 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.120
 bearish from the beginning because that 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.640
 although it is the most lucrative thing is also 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.810
 extremely difficult, maybe 10 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.350
 sometimes you get it 4 3 probably 3 or 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.910
 less then in this case let's go 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.910
 commenting on the psychology of the situation 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.410
 this video has been recorded for trading 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.600
 united point is and remember that it is 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.020
