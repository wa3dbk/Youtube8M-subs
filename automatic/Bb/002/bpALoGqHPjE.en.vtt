00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.940
 Good day to all today I want 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.969
 start a series of tests on 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.480
 corrosion resistance with a knife kizlyar 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.650
 supreme 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.650
 echo for starters i just wash it and 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.720
 put in the sheath 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.539
 dry naturally 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.910
 do we see what happens 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:39.059
 are there spots on the wedge after 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:41.309
 drying took an hour and on the blade still 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.079
 such are traces of them that is multiplied he 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.989
 dries not very well but no 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.949
 I don’t see any problems with the blade from d2 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.079
 so it seems to me that the most 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:02.969
 right now will take a knife and 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:06.150
 dip it in the water with the sheath so 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.400
 good for a long time to dip 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.820
 and see what happens after that 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.820
 I took a paracord 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.920
 let's do it like this 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.750
 Well, let's see I will come to check 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.110
 how dries now decided to spend 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.940
 small test 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:46.659
 I decided to cut a lemon onion with a knife 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.229
 let's start slim queue cut so 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:58.050
 so that the knife is thoroughly soaked with juice 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:02:02.050
 lemon well and ellochka will be such a mixture 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:05.080
 let's see what happens with the knife after that 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:10.479
 if we leave it like this 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:13.750
 so here's another do think with a knife 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:20.350
 Of course not yet will see remove in 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:23.230
 We need to be done in this way remove 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.290
 needed and left overnight on the street i 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.739
 put here at night 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.610
 pretty damp now besides the weather 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.100
 This is not very overcast and maybe 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.720
 it will be raining 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:45.579
 let's see what will happen in the morning 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:53.609
 about 12 hours let's see what 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:03:01.120
 happened with a knife let me smash 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:03:04.109
 these spike spots and here here and here he 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.109
 still wet by the way 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:13.180
 nothing of this was here was just 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:26.709
 juice well let's wash the knife bowls 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:30.579
 and see what happens and so it is 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.519
 there were stains here they are not 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.459
 everything else is so dark 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.000
 washed off okay let's meet for 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.819
 the table 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.819
 I'll show you how it all to remove stains 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:57.210
 and so as to remove these patches here 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:01.620
 Blade than just have a slow option 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:05.590
 take the paste applied on the wedge 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.690
 a piece of leather bar and start through i 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.390
 have all something of the matter was I 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.060
 I use a drill I use to always 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.530
 I can’t live without him everywhere anymore 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:21.730
 slightly grazed on grammy 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:26.430
 Well, let 's start and let 's remove it 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.430
 from here and start rubbing 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:41.680
 so five minutes have passed in principle let's 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:44.770
 I'll show you a little closer what happened with this 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.150
 side we have not done anything like that 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.860
 specks are wonderful this side 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.640
 passed with time so quickly 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:59.560
 superficially for five minutes already visible 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:03.750
 Only here at an angle of the spot you need more 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.790
 a little walk so heaps became drain and 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.960
 so I just walked around like this 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:14.710
 places here here it seems removed all 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.740
 almost could in principle here is the country 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.470
 which I have not done 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.540
 the difference is very very big this 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.330
 the stain just does not clean it she me 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:29.320
 I'm pissed off, now I'll sit still a little 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:34.290

 radius and everything else so what can 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.210
 principle generally not to break their knives 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:51.970
