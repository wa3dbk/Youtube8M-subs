00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
do this but yeah and just put as much

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.300

pressure<00:02:48.870> on<00:02:49.260> top<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.830> battery<00:02:49.980> with<00:02:50.220> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
pressure on top of the battery with the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.550 
pressure on top of the battery with the
rubber<00:02:50.490> band<00:02:50.700> as<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.820> can<00:02:51.290> make<00:02:52.290> sure<00:02:52.410> it's<00:02:52.530> in

rubber band as you can make sure it's in
the<00:02:52.680> dead<00:02:52.920> center<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.930> i<00:02:54.930> would<00:02:55.110> suggest<00:02:55.290> just

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
the dead center and i would suggest just

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.140 
the dead center and i would suggest just
count<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.980> that's<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.280> safest<00:02:56.610> way<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.820> do<00:02:57.030> it

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
count it that's the safest way to do it

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.010 
count it that's the safest way to do it
