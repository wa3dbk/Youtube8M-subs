 set of sony for one or the other 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.519
 xperia z is already a concept 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.250
 be the area smartphone 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.580
 sony now also presents this brand in 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.470
 form of a tablet the former 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.170
 Processing difficulties of something 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.869
 older xperia tablets are said to be with the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.910
 new version now be past and 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.230
 Sony again on the tablet market completely 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.170
 mix in the top 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.540
 let's take a look at this 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:41.040
 xperia tablet measures 26 6 cm wide 17 2 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.460
 cm height and 0 7 cm deep at one 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.010
 weight of 495 grams 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.460
 The built-in display is 10.1 inches tall 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.399
 and offers a resolution of 1920 x 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.930
 1200 pixels 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.370
 the heart of the device is a qualcomm 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.520
 snapdragon s4 pro with 1 5 ghz of 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.860
 Memory is 2 gigabytes for 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.320
 User data is 16 gigabytes 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.350
 Storage capacity available with 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.210
 micro sd extended up to 64 gb 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.549
 can be 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.420
 so far so good as the device 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.830
 a bit closer 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.210
 that is how the flat construction is noticed 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.360
 it is on with only 6 9 mm housing depth 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.860
 flatter than any competitive product 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.500
 also to highlight are the scarce 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.659
 500 grams weight for a tablet of this 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.060
 size is that extraordinary 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.759
 easy knows the edgy style 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.580
 already from the xperia z smartphone itself 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.080
 can certainly be seen 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.060
 thanks to the rubberized back 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.660
 keep scratches and a slide rail 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.730
 avoided 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.850
 Overall, the tablet looks very good 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.830
 high quality and robust processes as it 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.790
 very thin is there are small maneuvers at 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.950
 the stability 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.940
 you feel the tablet a little bit 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.690
 to be able to bend 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.700
 the overall impression convinces us nevertheless 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.530
 a highlight of the xperia tablets et 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.150
 should you be able to water it 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.830
 and dust away 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.060
 the designated ip 55 and 57 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.229
 Protective measures have been very good in the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.390
 integrated design 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.010
 for example, the dust falls 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.459
 caps on the connections dream 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.450
 on the display gives a resolution of 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:23.810
 1920 x 1200 pixels again something 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.940
 corresponds to pixel density of 224 ps 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.770
 this is no comparison to competition 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.470
 but still good 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.090
 regarding the color brightness and 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.110
 Contrast values ​​we have nothing 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.300
 exposing 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.570
 everything looks pretty colorful and crispy 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.740
 sharp that scratch-resistant mineral glass 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.600
 he made for a particularly high 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.420
 mirroring effect whereby the 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.430
 brightness value of 346 candela per 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.090
 square meters do not oppose much 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.970
 can 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.010
 that gives a point deduction 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.320
 In things outfit has sony at 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.050
 This tablet everything installed for one 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.840
 peak power is needed so it gets from 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.940
 a qualcomm snapdragon s4 pro quad 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.000
 Core processor with a core clocking 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.150
 powered by 1 5 gigahertz and with 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.140
 two gigabytes of RAM complemented 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.180
 all games and software 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.980
 Applications are thus smoothly 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.970
 processed and reproduced 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.890
 that gives us the highest grade apropos 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.350
 software the preinstalled 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.390
 operating system is called android jelly bean 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.470
 the typical sony surface 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.110
 was extended 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.900
 On top of that, there are still xperia apps 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.690
 like walkman video studio and one 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.650
 remote control function 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.840
 the software package will be summarized 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.030
 visually less playful and very 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.630
 tidied up there we have nothing to 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.850
 gripe 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.310
 that communicates with the outside world 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.100
 xperia tablet z via wlan and the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.110
 standard mobile radio who that 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.959
 The right model even has the 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.300
 possibility to surf via lte 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.870
 Short distance from the tablet with bluetooth 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.300
 4.0 as well as nfc was built for the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.090
 navigation, of course, also a GPS sensor 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.709
 that works perfectly 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.230
 our thumbs up 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.600
 who likes to take pictures will be from sony 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.970
 not left alone was installed 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.370
 namely a 2 megapixel front camera for 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.489
 video chat and an 8 megapixel 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.500
 main camera on the back of the device 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.479
 thanks to the so-called x-times sensor 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.940
 scores the back camera one 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.439
 particularly high light output and thus 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.250
 less image noise and more sharpness 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:29.169
 In addition, it offers easy access 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.780
 serving camera app various effects 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.199
 and setting options great 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.319
 made the battery life impressed 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.900
 especially sony promises that with one 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:42.819
 Charge of 6000 mAh rechargeable batteries 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.159
 movies for more than nine hours 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.289
 can be watched in our test 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.909
 confirms that when the movies 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.710
 already stored on the tray 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.900
 you can see them via wlan 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.389
 this shortens the battery life 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.830
 still around seven hours anyway 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.650
 considerable achievement 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.009
 thumbs high from our side we come 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.530
 To sum up the xperia tablet set is 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.330
 Stylish powerful and does not believe 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.460
 with playful features at the end 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.250
 So who does not need an alternative 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.319
 looking for samsung or apple is likely 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.449
 to have found something in this device 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:19.180
 despite small weaknesses we are from 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:24.779
 xperia tablet set convinces and rates 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.779
 with four and a half out of five of his stars
