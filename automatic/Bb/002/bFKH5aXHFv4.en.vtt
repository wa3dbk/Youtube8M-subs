00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
and I guess I was just like the problem

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.160 
and I guess I was just like the problem
that<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:44.910> with<00:02:44.940> them<00:02:45.480> doing<00:02:45.780> another<00:02:45.989> one

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
that I have with them doing another one

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.320 
that I have with them doing another one
it's<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.410> fact<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.709> like<00:02:46.920> how<00:02:47.489> many<00:02:47.549> more<00:02:48.180> of

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
it's the fact that like how many more of

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.789 
it's the fact that like how many more of
these<00:02:48.480> are<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.810> gonna<00:02:48.930> do<00:02:49.200> when<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.620> just

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
these are you gonna do when it's just

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.680 
these are you gonna do when it's just
really<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.069> card<00:02:50.430> game<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.849> that<00:02:50.910> certainty<00:02:51.450> to

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
really a card game and that certainty to

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.600 
really a card game and that certainty to
be<00:02:51.780> honest<00:02:51.989> with<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.349> think<00:02:52.500> GX<00:02:53.040> was<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
be honest with you I think GX was the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.039 
be honest with you I think GX was the
appropriate<00:02:53.819> time<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.269> end<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.540> because<00:02:54.780> at

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
appropriate time to end it because at

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.930 
appropriate time to end it because at
that<00:02:55.230> point<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.560> was<00:02:55.650> wrapping<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.099> up<00:02:56.220> he<00:02:56.670> went

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
that point it was wrapping it up he went

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.660 
that point it was wrapping it up he went
he<00:02:57.120> fought<00:02:57.390> Yami<00:02:57.900> or<00:02:58.079> you<00:02:58.560> know<00:02:58.650> at<00:02:58.829> em<00:02:59.160> the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
he fought Yami or you know at em the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.970 
he fought Yami or you know at em the
Pharaoh<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.329> everything<00:03:00.870> was<00:03:01.019> good<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.530> then

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
Pharaoh and everything was good and then

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.770 
Pharaoh and everything was good and then
it<00:03:02.099> was<00:03:02.190> like<00:03:02.340> okay<00:03:02.610> well<00:03:03.209> no<00:03:03.329> I<00:03:03.360> don't<00:03:03.720> think

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
it was like okay well no I don't think

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.720
