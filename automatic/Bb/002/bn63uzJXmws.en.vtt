00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.260
 one of several reasons why 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.030
 I recommend and protein shakes and that 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.370
 they offer great nutrition in a 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.410
 glass a good amount of protein 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.880
 a portion of dairy products and most of the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.490
 sometimes even a bit of fruit 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.250
 but at some point I thought and if there was 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.930
 put in the vegetables also seen 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.910
 that there are many that have a good 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.519
 taste sweet because don't try 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.900
 adding them to our smoothie is true 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.120
 that most of the time the vegetables go 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.010
 cooked but just a little organized and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.809
 cook them more for dinner to have 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.910
 something to put in the smoothie of 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.570
 day later and make it even more 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.450
 nutritious here are some combinations that 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.760
 you can try beets and strawberries 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.710
 add half a cup of beetroot 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.899
 cooked and some strawberries to the smoothie 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.780
 even vanilla of cherries maybe 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.610
 frozen go well pumpkin and banana 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.160
 add to the vanilla smoothie 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.899
 half a cup of pumpkin a small banana 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.229
 and a pinch of cinnamon and walnut 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.380
 Muscat a real coconut delicacy 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.330
 pineapple and carrots that you add delight 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.490
 half a cup of vanilla milkshake 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 boiled carrots and pieces of pineapple 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.100
 plus a few drops of coconut extract 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.090
 to add a tropical note 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.790
 cherries and tomatoes 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.680
 an unusual but surprising combination 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.720
 add to the cocoa smoothie one 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.200
 cup of cherries and 2 tablespoons of 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.119
 unsalted tomato concentrate 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.100
 spinach and mango is definitely going here 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.020
 on the green the preparation 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.990
 particularly fast because they serve 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.909
 raw spinach and pieces of mango add 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.430
 a cup or more of raw spinach neither 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.259
 vanilla smoothie and mango helps 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.259
 to attenuate too green taste
