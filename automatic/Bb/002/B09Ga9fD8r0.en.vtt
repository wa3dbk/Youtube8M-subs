00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
vocalist songwriting style I I would

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.890 
vocalist songwriting style I I would
definitely<00:02:10.250> say<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.700> some<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.630> earlier

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
definitely say that some of the earlier

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.410 
definitely say that some of the earlier
albums<00:02:12.140> like<00:02:12.470> throwing<00:02:12.800> copper<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.340> live<00:02:13.670> that

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
albums like throwing copper of live that

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.610 
albums like throwing copper of live that
kind<00:02:15.380> of<00:02:15.530> shaped<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.220> way<00:02:16.310> i<00:02:16.340> right<00:02:16.730> but<00:02:17.090> I

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
kind of shaped the way i right but I

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.380 
kind of shaped the way i right but I
think<00:02:18.620> all<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:18.860> it<00:02:19.130> kind<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.520> gets<00:02:19.790> thrown<00:02:20.180> into

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
think all of it kind of gets thrown into

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.470 
think all of it kind of gets thrown into
a<00:02:20.480> pot<00:02:20.750> gets<00:02:21.260> stirred<00:02:21.530> up<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.270> makes<00:02:23.270> its

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
a pot gets stirred up and and makes its

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.860 
a pot gets stirred up and and makes its
way<00:02:23.720> in<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.980> music<00:02:25.370> somehow<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:26.270> little

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
way in the music somehow in little

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.380 
way in the music somehow in little
pieces<00:02:27.020> especially<00:02:28.010> as<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.460> vocalist<00:02:28.880> for<00:02:29.060> me<00:02:29.240> a

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
pieces especially as a vocalist for me a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.930 
pieces especially as a vocalist for me a
lot<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.750> those<00:02:29.900> singers<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.620> still<00:02:31.430> look<00:02:31.580> up<00:02:31.760> to

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
lot of those singers I still look up to

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.040 
lot of those singers I still look up to
and<00:02:32.180> pull<00:02:32.540> inspiration<00:02:32.810> from

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.500 

never<00:02:36.770> really<00:02:37.100> done<00:02:37.280> any<00:02:37.460> kind<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.820> rituals<00:02:38.240> to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
never really done any kind of rituals to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.840 
never really done any kind of rituals to
to<00:02:39.050> write<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.290> record<00:02:39.710> a<00:02:40.010> lot<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.340> times<00:02:40.550> there

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
to write a record a lot of times there

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.740 
to write a record a lot of times there
the<00:02:41.570> songs<00:02:41.870> come<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.740> me<00:02:42.860> as<00:02:43.340> inspiration<00:02:44.240> and

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
the songs come to me as inspiration and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.900 
the songs come to me as inspiration and
I<00:02:44.900> have<00:02:45.050> an<00:02:45.170> idea<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.710> lot<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.220> times<00:02:46.490> it's<00:02:46.700> just

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
I have an idea a lot of times it's just

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.030 
I have an idea a lot of times it's just
me<00:02:47.030> sitting<00:02:47.180> around<00:02:47.390> on<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.570> guitar<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.170> coming

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
me sitting around on a guitar and coming

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.610 
me sitting around on a guitar and coming
out<00:02:49.130> of<00:02:49.190> melody<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:50.050> trying<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.170> find<00:02:51.320> words

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
out of melody and trying to find words

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.790 
out of melody and trying to find words
