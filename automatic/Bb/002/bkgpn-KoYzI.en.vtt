I<00:05:19.120> mean<00:05:20.120> just<00:05:20.360> about<00:05:20.450> anything<00:05:20.780> you<00:05:21.050> can<00:05:21.200> think

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
I mean just about anything you can think

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.800 
I mean just about anything you can think
of<00:05:21.560> when<00:05:22.550> it<00:05:22.670> stops<00:05:22.940> making<00:05:23.360> that<00:05:23.510> noise<00:05:23.750> and

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
of when it stops making that noise and

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.690 
of when it stops making that noise and
that<00:05:24.260> means<00:05:24.470> it's<00:05:24.590> about<00:05:24.680> start<00:05:25.280> doing<00:05:25.580> the

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
that means it's about start doing the

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.030 
that means it's about start doing the
extraction<00:05:26.390> part<00:05:28.570> which<00:05:29.570> is<00:05:29.600> very<00:05:29.990> cool<00:05:30.530> so

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
extraction part which is very cool so

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.690 
extraction part which is very cool so

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
all the pasta comes out here and what

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.040 
all the pasta comes out here and what
you<00:05:34.790> do<00:05:34.970> is<00:05:35.270> you<00:05:35.390> grab<00:05:35.480> your<00:05:35.690> handy<00:05:35.930> little

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
you do is you grab your handy little

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.510 
you do is you grab your handy little
scraper<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:36.740> when<00:05:36.890> you<00:05:36.980> think<00:05:37.130> that<00:05:37.310> it<00:05:37.400> looks

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
noodles extracting out look like a

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.130 
noodles extracting out look like a
little<00:06:02.900> bit<00:06:03.050> funny<00:06:03.400> but<00:06:04.660> it<00:06:05.660> works<00:06:05.870> really

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
little bit funny but it works really

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.550 
little bit funny but it works really
well<00:06:06.260> and<00:06:06.470> like<00:06:06.560> I<00:06:06.740> said<00:06:06.800> real<00:06:07.220> quick<00:06:08.470> it's<00:06:09.470> a

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
well and like I said real quick it's a

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.830 
well and like I said real quick it's a
real<00:06:09.740> quick<00:06:10.010> process<00:06:10.520> so<00:06:12.430> it's<00:06:13.430> only<00:06:13.640> been

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
real quick process so it's only been

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.210 
real quick process so it's only been
four<00:06:14.840> minutes<00:06:14.990> now<00:06:15.380> and<00:06:15.710> we've<00:06:15.860> already<00:06:15.980> got

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
four minutes now and we've already got

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
the pasta coming out and the rest of the

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.420 
the pasta coming out and the rest of the
process<00:06:20.870> really<00:06:21.140> is<00:06:21.440> just<00:06:21.530> waiting<00:06:22.250> while

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
process really is just waiting while

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.600 
process really is just waiting while
this<00:06:23.290> comes<00:06:24.290> out<00:06:24.470> and<00:06:24.680> cutting<00:06:24.950> it<00:06:25.070> off<00:06:25.160> as<00:06:25.430> you

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
this comes out and cutting it off as you

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.950 
this comes out and cutting it off as you
go<00:06:27.340> the<00:06:28.340> timer<00:06:28.670> counts<00:06:29.090> all<00:06:29.240> the<00:06:29.390> way<00:06:29.510> down<00:06:29.720> so

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
go the timer counts all the way down so

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.750 
go the timer counts all the way down so
you<00:06:30.020> just<00:06:30.260> let<00:06:30.440> the<00:06:30.530> machine<00:06:30.860> run<00:06:31.130> until<00:06:31.580> it's

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
you just let the machine run until it's

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.070 
you just let the machine run until it's
actually<00:06:32.210> done<00:06:32.450> and<00:06:32.840> then<00:06:34.330> that's<00:06:35.330> it<00:06:35.540> really

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
actually done and then that's it really

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.050 
actually done and then that's it really
I<00:06:36.350> mean<00:06:36.800> once<00:06:37.040> it's<00:06:37.190> all<00:06:37.340> done<00:06:37.550> it<00:06:37.820> knows<00:06:38.030> that

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
I mean once it's all done it knows that

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.060 
I mean once it's all done it knows that
the<00:06:38.420> pasta<00:06:38.810> is<00:06:38.930> almost<00:06:39.110> all<00:06:39.380> the<00:06:39.410> way<00:06:39.530> out<00:06:39.770> you

the pasta is almost all the way out you
might<00:06:40.700> have<00:06:40.880> to<00:06:41.000> do<00:06:41.120> a<00:06:41.420> quick<00:06:41.600> instruction

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
might have to do a quick instruction

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.230 
might have to do a quick instruction
which<00:06:42.710> is<00:06:42.860> one<00:06:42.980> of<00:06:43.100> the<00:06:43.160> menu<00:06:43.400> options<00:06:43.820> just<00:06:44.090> to

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
which is one of the menu options just to

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.790 
which is one of the menu options just to
get<00:06:44.420> the<00:06:44.540> last<00:06:44.750> little<00:06:44.960> bit<00:06:45.200> of<00:06:45.320> dough<00:06:45.530> out

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.800 
get the last little bit of dough out
generally<00:06:46.700> and<00:06:46.820> I<00:06:46.850> found<00:06:47.090> it<00:06:47.210> there<00:06:47.390> isn't

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
generally and I found it there isn't

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.930 
generally and I found it there isn't
much<00:06:48.650> that<00:06:48.680> actually<00:06:49.220> needs<00:06:49.400> to<00:06:49.490> be<00:06:49.610> a<00:06:49.640> stretch

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
much that actually needs to be a stretch

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.540 
much that actually needs to be a stretch
to<00:06:50.060> strip<00:06:50.500> extracted<00:06:51.500> and<00:06:51.680> then<00:06:52.160> you<00:06:52.250> can<00:06:52.370> just

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
to strip extracted and then you can just

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.590 
to strip extracted and then you can just
go<00:06:52.670> ahead<00:06:52.820> and

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
go ahead and

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.630 
go ahead and
the<00:06:53.690> whole<00:06:53.870> machine<00:06:54.170> apart<00:06:54.440> and<00:06:54.710> clean<00:06:55.310> it<00:06:55.460> it

the whole machine apart and clean it it

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.030 
the whole machine apart and clean it it
comes<00:06:56.540> apart<00:06:56.810> super<00:06:57.230> easy<00:06:57.440> as<00:06:57.680> you<00:06:57.800> saw<00:06:57.980> from

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040

slides<00:07:00.380> out<00:07:00.710> the<00:07:00.890> front<00:07:01.130> so<00:07:01.670> it's<00:07:01.880> real<00:07:02.180> easy

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210
