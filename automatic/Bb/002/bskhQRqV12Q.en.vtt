00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello dear readers today we try 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.490
 one of the most frequently asked 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.759
 to answer questions namely how to 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.279
 Apply thermal grease correctly 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.260
 we need a lot of accessories very much 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.430
 good is always suitable 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.750
 paper handkerchiefs and for the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.449
 Cleaning is so specific 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.859
 cleaning solutions has facilitate 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.949
 one removing the old one 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.510
 thermal grease enormous 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.969
 The detergent LÃ¶w very strong 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.170
 they give a drop on it 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.399
 paper handkerchief and polish with it 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.399
 then the cpu off 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.540
 that of course only necessary if the cpu 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.570
 was already installed and with 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.350
 thermal grease was covered 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.239
 usually if you have one 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.390
 Thermal paste buys you get the in 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.829
 form of a syringe at cpu cooler and 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.780
 But it is also in the form of one 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.399
 so if a girl is an injection 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.320
 Of course, always easier 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.110
 we apply here use a 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.040
 you give syringe from the thermal compound 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.780
 at a drop on the hits praise it 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.360
 only needs a very small amount of 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.890
 thermal grease as this only serves 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.440
 the air between the bottom plate of the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.039
 cpu cooler and headset or cpu too 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.649
 repress 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.300
 Now there are two preferred methods around 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.490
 to distribute the thermal grease 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.039
 at first one simply calls the train 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.700
 the cpu cooler and puts this on the 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.500
 leg skin 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:39.750
 one should pay attention that the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.750
 cpu-cooler sits well and squeezed firmly 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.929
 this will cause the thermal grease 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.880
 automatically distributed and more 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.890
 it does not necessarily pass the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.810
 it is better method though 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.220
 put a blob of thermal grease on the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.530
 hits trailer and then this 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.030
 ideally distributed one uses 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.680
 for such a spatula 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.899
 with this it is very easy the 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.899
 to distribute thermal paste on the cpu 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.950
 when distributing the thermal paste should 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.280
 Make sure you have one 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.319
 if possible now a film forms because of the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.120
 thermal paste as I said only 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:20.319
 the air between cpu cooler and served 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.319
 to displace the piesberger 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.709
 the finished result looks like this 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.930
 single thin film spread over the 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.930
 all over the whole hits predator cpu 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.160
 Now we are ready again the ball cpu 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.709
 cooler set up on the mainboard 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.630
 pay attention to the fact that the 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:49.010
 Middle part of the cooler contact with the 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:51.410
 cpu has that were the two most common 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.200
 methods how to apply thermal grease 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.180
 in Hesse has the blob method 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.180
 as a little worse than the method of 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.920
 elapse referenced but sufficient 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.250
 cpu cooling can be achieved with both 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.250
 methods
