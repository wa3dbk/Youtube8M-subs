00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.800
 grams of sugar wine review team 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.140
 well let's go for this recipe let's 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.750
 use a knife to cut it in its 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.370
 a curious place ratico lettuce 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.230
 you will say the lettuce because 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.020
 can black so fast 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.460
 for the crop that the lettuce took 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.160
 too bitter after two hours in 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.290
 knife will include us a lot because 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.079
 what's up with the lettuce when I cut 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.940
 the lettuce with a dull knife what 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.450
 What I do is that he goes out to play soy 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.150
 running 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.920
 because because the lettuce so that the 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.180
 coconut so that it has a good flavor for 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.180
 Always keep cool 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.190
 let's not leave that is the white shell 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.120
 what's left 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.070
 because because we believe that the shell is 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.270
 more thus more bitter not really the 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.810
 white part of the shell what is 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.940
 now more 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.700
 good now what are we going to do 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:54.510
 the fiber that has the orange the truth 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.510
 is that here 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.100
 let's go with the knife without cutting the 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:04.930
 white part because we're not going to want it 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.930
 until the center we go up 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.099
 we removed him 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.810
 and we're going to do it with all the nara 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.000
 I'm going to cut it, I'm going to work 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.310
 because the total decoration theme of 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.989
 you then if you want it thicker 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:44.209
 can split it in four can 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:47.110
 impart in three now we go with the 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.790
 feta cheese which is the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.350
 the main ingredient in this 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.920
 salad that we are going to make with cheese 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.410
 feta we are going to ask you to observe that 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.540
 this question is not complete and its total 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.670
 knife that has holes this that we 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.670
 they help when we cut the cheese 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.630
 he assures me that he will always love free 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:17.500
 whole what they are going to hit in the cotif 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:20.820
 and we're going to apply a 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.820
 a sugar tablespoon 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.550
 and how you start to caramelize the 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.200
 sugar is what I electric that 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.860
 we need high temperature to be able 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.860
 to achieve this 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.860
 A) Yes 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.430
 and now we are going to finish the assembly 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.430
 of our salad 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.080
 let's go to chopped almonds 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.330
 we are replacing 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:11.020
 animal protein by cheese 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.490
 use a liter of balsam and 500 sugar 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.920
 hence, a lot of vinaigrette will come out 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.709
 you can use half here we are 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.989
 working two parts of balsamic by 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.850
 a part of sugar if we have a liter 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.740

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.730
 sugar we take to the fire to 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.040
 low average temperature the amount of 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.210
 time and the fire depends a lot on the 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.210
 amount that I am preparing 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:53.030
