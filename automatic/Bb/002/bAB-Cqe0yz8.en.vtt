00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
to chat with multiple people at the same

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.650 
to chat with multiple people at the same
time<00:02:27.730> here<00:02:28.390> we<00:02:28.540> have<00:02:28.690> laptops<00:02:29.320> set<00:02:29.530> up<00:02:29.650> around

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
time here we have laptops set up around

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.530 
time here we have laptops set up around
you<00:02:31.660> can<00:02:31.840> find<00:02:32.140> them<00:02:32.820> we<00:02:33.820> have<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> laptop<00:02:34.150> set

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
you can find them we have a laptop set

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.010 
you can find them we have a laptop set
up<00:02:34.660> around<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.990> room<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.380> it<00:02:36.310> is<00:02:36.520> showing<00:02:37.020> two

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
up around the room and it is showing two

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.140 
up around the room and it is showing two
video<00:02:38.380> that's<00:02:38.740> decoding<00:02:39.310> actually<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.910> each

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
video that's decoding actually to each

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.730 
video that's decoding actually to each
HD<00:02:40.930> streams<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.880> cameras<00:02:43.209> are<00:02:43.330> 720p<00:02:44.080> and

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
HD streams so the cameras are 720p and

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.949 
HD streams so the cameras are 720p and
it's<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.070> decoding<00:02:45.520> two<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.880> then<00:02:46.030> it'll<00:02:46.270> that

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
it's a decoding two and then it'll that

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.449 
it's a decoding two and then it'll that
it<00:02:47.740> also<00:02:48.100> outputs<00:02:49.680> streams<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.860> so<00:02:51.310> much

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
it also outputs streams you so much

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.720 
it also outputs streams you so much
things<00:02:52.080> yeah<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.110> mean<00:02:53.410> it's<00:02:53.470> but<00:02:54.250> still<00:02:54.550> the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
things yeah I mean it's but still the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.360 
things yeah I mean it's but still the
capability<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.680> doing<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.890> multistream

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
capability of doing a multistream

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.660 
capability of doing a multistream
conference<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:58.350> actually<00:02:59.350> pretty<00:02:59.530> cool<00:02:59.740> now

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
conference is actually pretty cool now

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.280 
conference is actually pretty cool now
this<00:03:00.850> is<00:03:01.000> actually<00:03:01.150> one<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.510> my<00:03:01.600> favorite<00:03:01.660> bit

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
this is actually one of my favorite bit

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.430 
this is actually one of my favorite bit
of<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.800> favorite<00:03:03.310> demos<00:03:03.610> this<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:04.720> demo<00:03:05.230> by

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
of a favorite demos this is a demo by

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.979 
of a favorite demos this is a demo by
imagination<00:03:06.100> so<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.400> shows<00:03:06.730> graphics<00:03:07.720> and

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
imagination so it shows graphics and

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.040 
imagination so it shows graphics and
performance<00:03:08.700> as<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:10.120> can<00:03:10.269> see<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.570> has<00:03:10.720> the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
performance as you can see it has the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.040 
performance as you can see it has the
rotating<00:03:11.860> background<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:13.720> know<00:03:13.780> they're

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
rotating background and you know they're

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.229 
rotating background and you know they're
all<00:03:14.200> three<00:03:14.440> dimensional<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:15.760> can<00:03:15.940> see<00:03:16.090> the

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
all three dimensional you can see the

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.100 
all three dimensional you can see the
detail<00:03:16.660> how<00:03:17.019> smooth

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
detail how smooth

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.050 
detail how smooth
as<00:03:18.620> soon<00:03:18.860> as<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.040> rotates<00:03:19.190> messing<00:03:19.850> with<00:03:19.970> it

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
as soon as it rotates messing with it

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.450 
as soon as it rotates messing with it
goes<00:03:20.180> from<00:03:20.300> scene<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:20.630> scene<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.920> if<00:03:22.280> you

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
goes from scene to scene and if you

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.190 
goes from scene to scene and if you
notice<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:23.030> windows<00:03:23.360> that<00:03:23.540> are<00:03:23.600> going<00:03:23.840> across

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
notice the windows that are going across

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.710 
notice the windows that are going across
it<00:03:24.560> its<00:03:25.340> treated<00:03:25.670> differently<00:03:26.240> so<00:03:26.480> there's

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
it its treated differently so there's

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.750 
it its treated differently so there's
different<00:03:26.870> textures<00:03:27.500> different<00:03:27.860> processing

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
different textures different processing

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.550 
different textures different processing
techniques<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:30.170> at<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.470> same<00:03:30.650> time<00:03:32.560> so

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
techniques and at the same time so

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.890 
techniques and at the same time so
that's<00:03:33.770> actually<00:03:34.250> pretty<00:03:34.460> cool<00:03:34.730> system<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:35.870> is

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
that's actually pretty cool system it is

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.380 
that's actually pretty cool system it is
this<00:03:36.350> is<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:37.310> know<00:03:37.430> it's<00:03:37.940> doing

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
this is a you know it's doing

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.470 
this is a you know it's doing
multi-point<00:03:38.810> streaming<00:03:39.290> right<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:41.360> guys

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
multi-point streaming right you guys

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.450 
multi-point streaming right you guys
know<00:03:41.720> those<00:03:41.900> are<00:03:42.080> both<00:03:42.500> very<00:03:42.800> performance

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
know those are both very performance

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.050 
know those are both very performance
that's<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:43.970> very<00:03:44.000> performance<00:03:44.660> incentive<00:03:46.060> one

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
that's a very performance incentive one

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.820 
that's a very performance incentive one
of<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.270> things<00:03:47.390> I'd<00:03:47.630> like<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.840> do<00:03:48.170> sometimes

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
of the things I'd like to do sometimes

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.350 
of the things I'd like to do sometimes
