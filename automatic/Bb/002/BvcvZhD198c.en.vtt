00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.899
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.730
 video our god comment a little 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.590
 about how to recover items that have 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.910
 been sold from your reaction account 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.910
 so let's start with the video 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.019
 well first of all we need 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.029
 obviously an armor that has not been 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.009
 sold without wanting or by simple 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.270
 mistake that we have sold simply 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.849
 because we have left our account in 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.439
 some booth and some malicious one is already 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.419
 has sold all the items for 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.679
 fuck us practically simply in 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.210
 this video I will try to teach a bit of 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.650
 how do they recover these items that have been 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.019
 sold that have been sold not 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.790
 sent simply sold and for 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.519
 check it I will try to do it 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.140
 recovering these items that are good 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.820
 which it is simply to make frozen that 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.829
 resell but before this I want to 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.659
 tell them a small detail that the 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.790
 items have to be recovered before 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.949
 of the next 7 days after having 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.629
 been sold and this how do you know it then 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.369
 and later I will explain how 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.400
 know how long it has been 

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:57.260
 sold and at what time it was sold 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.809
 it is always practically then 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.600
 I will teach as explained as I can 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.600
 that we are going as recovering these items 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.940
 good second place as we already know 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.730
 we just have to bring the page 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.410
 of sony and log in with our our 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.940
 account that has been stolen practically 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.800
 the items good that has not been stolen 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.990
 simply that they have been re-sold in 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.700
 the store you understand you have to have very 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.280
 Of course, if it has been re sold or 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.140
 if it has been sent are very 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.119
 different so just do not 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.510
 let's see in this step and we go to 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.510
 next step 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.210
 well in this third step we are going to see 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.610
 what item are those that have been sold and 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.020
 this to go is really easy the truth 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.850
 just once we had 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.310
 achieved we simply have to go to 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.530
 where my ration says and when I enter my 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.170
 region we would have to go to the section 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.020
 of trade history and then 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.030
 where the sale part says because in 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.650
 The sale shows practically all 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.750
 items that we have sold or anything 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.150
 that we have sold either be it 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.310
 temporary does not matter how simply 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.899
 shows us all the items that we have re 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.300
 sold and practically like that we 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.400
 we would find out and people have resold or 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.650
 has been sent or practically the items 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.930
 what do you want to recover and as we see here 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.490
 we get the list in the list of items 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.570
 what is resold that are the flowers in 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.570
 network and we go with the following 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.390
 well as a fourth step we would have 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.610
 to go directly to the support 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.680
 reaction obviously because it was the rack 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.870
 jon we do not go to the support and just in 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.270
 this time we would have to write 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.250
 the letter in mind we select radio ni 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.380
 radio contact us that is to send you 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.630
 a message asking you any 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.270
 application or any questions you have 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.030
 about radio that a lot of people show up 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.040
 knows what customer service or how 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.430
 you want to call simply the fifth 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.050
 step is to write your letter or ask for the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.030
 recovery of these items that have been 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.190
 sold and simply to be able 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.130
 to do this we would have to write 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.590
 a letter asking or writing down the reason 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.970
 more or less about him because that does have 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.280
 been sold or simply that 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.630
 telling him that it was stolen or you do 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.250
 left your account open or any 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.740
 one of these things and just what 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.040
 you will have to do is write the letter 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.870
 of the explanation of practically what 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.920
 that I just told you and the next 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.170
 what we have to do is simply 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.760
 copy all the items that have been 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.410
 stolen or are all the signs that have 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.560
 been sold more clicks or sorry no no 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.180
 tell us to steal 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.069
 in theaters that have been sold 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.950
 practically mine are simply 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.930
 six items I think are 67 in itself is a 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.970
 complete set that is resold and 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.940
 just one thing has to be I think 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.709
 a minimum of 6 items to see or I think 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.540
 which is a minimum of 10 items to be able 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.069
 retrieve the items because if by 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.840
 example have sold only one items 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.150
 obviously you will not recover it for more 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.310
 that is a bushing here 99 is difficult 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.200
 to return it is very complicated 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.330
 because it's just an item and it does not show 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.060
 that has been as stolen or as 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.160
 practically sold by some other 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.049
 person who is not you has been nothing 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.280
 this was simply what I wanted 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.900
 explain in the video and practically the 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.299
 letter at the end you would have something like that or 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.799
 more or less well explained and then nothing 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.390
 I hope you have served this video of 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.280
 help and ask me with all of you 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.280
 until next video 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.710
 here I leave you two other videos to see 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.540
 how can you recover intense stolen and 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.860
 how can you recover a stolen account 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.540
 that practically the stolen account is 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.520
 with the data that they have stolen in the 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.350
 mind so I do not say goodbye 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.350
 against you until a next video
