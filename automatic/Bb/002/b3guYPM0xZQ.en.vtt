players going off site so tracks off

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.990 
players going off site so tracks off
side<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.040> a<00:00:47.070> holes<00:00:47.400> going<00:00:47.670> off<00:00:47.790> side

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
side for a holes going off side

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.730 
side for a holes going off side
constantly<00:00:48.540> more<00:00:48.780> than<00:00:48.930> five<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.290> ten<00:00:49.500> times

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740 
constantly more than five to ten times

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.740 
constantly more than five to ten times
and<00:00:49.980> then<00:00:50.490> a<00:00:50.520> kick<00:00:50.760> option<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.300> offside<00:00:51.600> would

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
and then a kick option for offside would

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.930 
and then a kick option for offside would
pop<00:00:51.930> up<00:00:51.960> beside<00:00:52.380> their<00:00:52.530> name<00:00:52.560> so<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.610> isn't

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
pop up beside their name so this isn't

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.130 
pop up beside their name so this isn't
