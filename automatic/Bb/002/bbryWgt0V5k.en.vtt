00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello everyone I'm inspired by days 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.460
 I bring episode 18 of ultimate team and 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.120
 we are finishing season 1 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.610
 basically because I already have in staff 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.889
 to win games I do not know if you understand me 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.570
 start from scratch as you know I started 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.330
 with the bronze 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.170
 the bronze bronzes the bronzes 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.170
 they came to you as standard 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.880
 that you had nothing of rapport and 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:33.840
 has finished with a template of 100 with 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.840
 penetration and 81 attack I think 80 's 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.740
 of midfielders and defense 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.630
 good seventy-odd can be improved 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.550
 It's clear but I can do this 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.280
 fast if I happen to be an afternoon 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.750
 playing I can be me I can to me 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.540
 you can quietly take a 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.650
 template 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.320
 a template 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.800
 or it's called a defense quietly 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.690
 good pretty good so 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.420
 first let's talk a little about the 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.300
 gameplay is not a I'm going to do the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.540
 result that if not not funny but 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.520
 but it's a good match and you will not see the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.430
 100% team basically because they are 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.860
 tired because you get tired so much because 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.350
 you wear them because I wanted coins 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.270
 see now I have like 6000 coins like that 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.790
 that I spend very fast because 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.680
 I want substitutes to be able to put them in 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.330
 the template so they can play 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.750
 more or less that they are at the same level that 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.450
 the players who are in the field 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.700
 the headlines because to win matches 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.380
 it is clear that you have to have it in 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.649
 tell if you want they started a 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.250
 template you have to catch players 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.500
 humans pretty much a little bit less 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.510
 or less good 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.340
 but that they can perform at the same level 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.680
 that the holders to win matches 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.390
 and so you can buy for 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.659
 move to the next level that would be 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.899
 buy players with 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.819
 other currencies what you buy yourself a 111 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.819
 sky jordi alba still 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:13.540
 a rooney to these people there 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.400
 for example bronze players not that 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.829
 you can be worth 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.510
 fifteen thousand coins do not think I do believe 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.000
 There are players like that, I dominated 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.400
 a lot of bronze and silver but I think 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.739
 there are players like that 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.200
 so giving the party as I say no 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.209
 you will see them one hundred percent the players 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.939
 for example Juanfran had seventy and 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.489
 peak of very little rhythm because what 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.709
 He wore a lot but he made a great 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.180
 the host is also not the other is not 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.430
 that was very good because they have 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.130
 league premier players 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.170
 Portuguese woman 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.080
 of many different leagues does not have the 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.790
 100% rapport but good is 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.850
 defend quite well, no, we're not going to 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.850
 cheat 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.990
 is what was being discussed to the 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.090
 season 1 is running out 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.220
 you'll see to see how I end up 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.830
 If you want to leave me your suggestions for 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.090
 the end of season 1 of ultimate 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.390
 team will surely be 20 episodes 21 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.470
 I do not know people I have to think about it 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.720
 it also depends on the players that I 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.850
 can buy 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.060
 but I do not want to leave it apart either 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.210
 because imagine that I can make a 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.860
 much better template within in a 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.660
 future, what do I know in summer? 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.310
 I can make templates with messi 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.060
 Christian that I doubt it because I'm not 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.450
 as good as I know how 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.739
 as not really as power that is the 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:46.200
 fucking master uncle has like 170 million 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:49.540
 coins quietly that guy is brutal 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.700
 in the joseph 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.680
 that unfortunately has let him fuck not 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.400
 you would have left it with the feef host 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.799
 good that I messed up I deviate from subject what 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.430
 that was being commented on that I did not 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.689
 like to leave behind this series is 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.939
 is this team this template 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.709
 why because basically that within 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.180
 a future can get more money I can 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.740
 know more about ultimate and you can help me 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.100
 more with this 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.140
 back with the bbva league but what 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.380
 comes here the issue now is that you 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.630
 you think for season 2 a 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.810
 the objectives that I have to mark 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.080
 It's worth not to get a player who 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.420
 is worth 100 thousand coins is not fuck is not 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.490
 get a template and power like 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.010
 I'm my mother, it's not getting a 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.430
 template of all and efe that would be the 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:49.660
 black chromos nothing of that but to make me 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.660
 a gold silver bronze template 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.750
 of those of the league that you want 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.590
 OK 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.520
 and obviously when the 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.590
 said season 2 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.229
 you will already tell me recommending players who 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.500
 they buy me the lineup that goes better 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.990
 for this league for these players I 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.639
 you understand what I want what I want 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.310
 that leave me in the comments goes to 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.780
 that's worth season 2 season 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.610
 1 is already running out and I want me 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.180
 leave in the comments 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:28.330
 the equipment is worth what you would like to see in the 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.639
 season 2 for example if I put a 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.590
 example I would not like it to be a 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.590
 bronze team of this league 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.780
 League forward as vale me 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.690
 would like it to be a team 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.870
 of gold from the premier league of the series 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.370
 of what you want in the first 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:53.150
 episode 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.580
 I will play with him with the starting team 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.320
 season 1 for you to tell me the 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.870
 players that I will have to buy for 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.430
 Season 2 is pretty good 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.630
 explained I shit in the milk I left 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.550
 here 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.800
 improvised and non or did not have anything 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.389
 pointed but I had it quite clear 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.639
 You told me you what you want 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.710
 do because you already know that this is 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:16.540
 your series is what you like most about 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:19.639

 milk scoring goals since time 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:30.920
 immemorial is that you have to 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:35.150
 Khedira sign that is 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:37.610
