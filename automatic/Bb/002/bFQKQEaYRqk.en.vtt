00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.700 
proficiency in this class actually we're
so<00:00:15.540> really<00:00:15.960> well<00:00:16.109> if<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:16.410> not<00:00:16.560> tried

so really well if you have not tried

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.070 
so really well if you have not tried
something<00:00:17.039> similar<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:18.660> am<00:00:18.900> using

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
something similar to this I am using

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.349 
something similar to this I am using
sleight<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.439> hand<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.550> reason<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.060> don't

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
sleight of hand and the reason I don't

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.929 
sleight of hand and the reason I don't
use<00:00:21.570> sight<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.960> hand<00:00:22.170> on<00:00:22.410> essentially<00:00:23.369> every

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
use sight of hand on essentially every

use sight of hand on essentially every
one<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.119> my<00:00:24.300> classes<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.949> because<00:00:25.949> when<00:00:26.220> you

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
one of my classes is because when you

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.589 
one of my classes is because when you
use<00:00:26.430> sleight<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.640> hand<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.000> tend<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.359> run<00:00:27.510> out

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
use sleight of hand you tend to run out

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.689 
use sleight of hand you tend to run out
of<00:00:27.630> ammo<00:00:28.050> fairly<00:00:28.439> quickly<00:00:28.650> but<00:00:29.369> by<00:00:29.490> using

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
of ammo fairly quickly but by using

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.110 
of ammo fairly quickly but by using
extended<00:00:30.359> mags<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:31.140> get<00:00:31.289> an<00:00:31.410> extra<00:00:31.800> extra<00:00:32.399> 45

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
extended mags you get an extra extra 45

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.090 
extended mags you get an extra extra 45
bullets<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.719> start<00:00:33.930> off<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.320> which<00:00:34.829> allows

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
bullets to start off with which allows

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.569 
bullets to start off with which allows
you<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.610> use<00:00:36.829> sleight<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.860> hand<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.340> don't

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
you to use sleight of hand you don't

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.340 
you to use sleight of hand you don't
have<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.879> worry<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.300> much<00:00:39.510> about<00:00:39.750> running<00:00:40.320> out

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
have to worry as much about running out

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.970 
have to worry as much about running out
of<00:00:40.410> ammo

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
of ammo

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.799 
of ammo
you'll<00:00:41.219> still<00:00:41.430> run<00:00:41.579> out<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.760> ammo<00:00:42.120> but<00:00:42.149> you'll

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you'll still run out of ammo but you'll

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.150 
you'll still run out of ammo but you'll
be<00:00:42.930> able<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.200> get<00:00:43.320> slightly<00:00:43.710> higher<00:00:43.860> kill

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
be able to get slightly higher kill

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.299 
be able to get slightly higher kill
streaks<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.640> remain<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> ammo<00:00:46.309> you'll

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
streaks that remain out of ammo you'll

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.970 
streaks that remain out of ammo you'll
notice<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.410> 45<00:00:49.410> bullets<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
notice that I have 45 bullets in the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.910 
notice that I have 45 bullets in the
clip<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.270> an<00:00:51.360> extra<00:00:51.510> 15<00:00:51.920> or

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
magazine I guess I'm pretty sure it's a

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.639 
magazine I guess I'm pretty sure it's a
magazine<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.020> I'm<00:00:55.110> gonna<00:00:55.199> call<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.469> close

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
magazine but I'm gonna call it close

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.160 
magazine but I'm gonna call it close

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
anyways so I got 45 bullets in the clip

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.000 
anyways so I got 45 bullets in the clip
and<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.460> an<00:00:59.579> extra<00:01:00.020> two<00:01:01.020> clips<00:01:01.320> which<00:01:01.890> is

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and you get an extra two clips which is

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.630 
and you get an extra two clips which is
90<00:01:02.340> bullets<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:02.789> opposed<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.409> your<00:01:04.409> normal

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
90 bullets as opposed to your normal

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.789 
90 bullets as opposed to your normal
extra<00:01:05.640> two<00:01:05.790> Clips<00:01:06.150> only<00:01:06.840> gives<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.110> 60<00:01:07.500> votes

extra two Clips only gives you 60 votes

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.649 
extra two Clips only gives you 60 votes
but<00:01:07.979> since<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.400> clip<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.030> bigger<00:01:09.270> than<00:01:09.510> this

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
but since your clip is bigger than this

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.090 
but since your clip is bigger than this
you<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.070> fold<00:01:11.909> 90<00:01:12.299> bullets<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:13.439> black<00:01:13.799> ops

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you get the fold 90 bullets in black ops

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.240 
you get the fold 90 bullets in black ops
they<00:01:14.780> they<00:01:15.780> gave<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.110> three<00:01:16.560> extra<00:01:16.890> Clips

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
they they gave you three extra Clips

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.820 
they they gave you three extra Clips
when<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.090> started<00:01:18.479> not<00:01:18.780> using<00:01:19.110> scavenger<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
when you started not using scavenger and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.039 
when you started not using scavenger and
then<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.460> combine<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:21.090> dual<00:01:21.810> mags

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
then you combine that with dual mags

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.260 
then you combine that with dual mags
which<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.710> think<00:01:23.189> gave<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.430> an<00:01:23.520> extra<00:01:23.580> six

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
which I think gave you an extra six

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.880 
which I think gave you an extra six
people<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.810> think<00:01:24.900> usually<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.439> black<00:01:25.650> ops

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
people it's I think usually in black ops

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.460 
people it's I think usually in black ops
you<00:01:26.130> had<00:01:26.340> 90<00:01:27.330> extra<00:01:27.689> bullets<00:01:27.990> plus<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
you had 90 extra bullets plus the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.190 
you had 90 extra bullets plus the
bullets<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.829> your<00:01:28.920> clip<00:01:29.299> and<00:01:30.299> then<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.170> use

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
bullets in your clip and then if you use

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.350 
bullets in your clip and then if you use
dual<00:01:31.560> mags<00:01:31.829> maybe<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.549> had<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> bullets<00:01:33.210> then

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
dual mags maybe you had the bullets then

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.050 
dual mags maybe you had the bullets then
you<00:01:33.450> put<00:01:33.750> plus<00:01:34.250> 150<00:01:35.250> extra<00:01:35.490> bullets<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
you put plus 150 extra bullets so you

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.580 
you put plus 150 extra bullets so you
got<00:01:36.439> sixty<00:01:37.439> more<00:01:37.590> bullets<00:01:37.890> by<00:01:38.040> doing<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
got sixty more bullets by doing that and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.749 
got sixty more bullets by doing that and
well<00:01:40.590> that's<00:01:40.740> kind<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.340> reason<00:01:41.520> that

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
well that's kind of the reason that

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.499 
well that's kind of the reason that
Ghost<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.960> Opie<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.759> black<00:01:44.759> ops<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.299> that

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
Ghost was so Opie and black ops was that

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.170 
Ghost was so Opie and black ops was that
you<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.619> didn't<00:01:46.920> need<00:01:47.009> scavenger<00:01:47.670> like

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
you really didn't need scavenger like

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.899 
you really didn't need scavenger like
150<00:01:48.930> extra<00:01:49.290> bullets<00:01:49.590> that's<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:50.220> that's<00:01:50.610> 30

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
150 extra bullets that's just that's 30

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.580 
150 extra bullets that's just that's 30
bullets<00:01:51.210> less<00:01:51.479> than<00:01:51.689> bandolier<00:01:52.170> wasn't

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
bullets less than bandolier wasn't

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.399 
bullets less than bandolier wasn't
called<00:01:52.740> duty<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:53.820> almost<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:55.049> entire

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
called duty for that's almost the entire

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.889 
called duty for that's almost the entire
perk<00:01:55.829> right<00:01:56.759> there<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.420> only<00:01:57.540> thing<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
perk right there the only thing that

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.080 
perk right there the only thing that
you're<00:01:58.020> missing<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.740> ability<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.610> pick<00:01:59.939> up

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
you're missing is the ability to pick up

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.440 
you're missing is the ability to pick up
like<00:02:00.240> more<00:02:00.509> stuns<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.439> send<00:02:01.680> Texas<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.670> ammo

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
like more stuns and send Texas but ammo

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.999 
like more stuns and send Texas but ammo
wasn't<00:02:03.750> really<00:02:03.930> an<00:02:04.020> issue<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.590> not<00:02:04.799> using

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
wasn't really an issue when not using

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.089 
wasn't really an issue when not using
scavenger<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.880> black<00:02:06.810> ops<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.890> game

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
scavenger in black ops but in this game

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.800 
scavenger in black ops but in this game
if<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.610> don't<00:02:08.759> use<00:02:08.879> scavenger<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.509> only<00:02:09.660> get

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
if you don't use scavenger you only get

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.930 
if you don't use scavenger you only get
60<00:02:10.200> extra<00:02:10.500> bullets<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.430> run<00:02:11.550> out<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.700> ammo

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
60 extra bullets so you run out of ammo

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.180 
60 extra bullets so you run out of ammo
quite<00:02:12.150> quickly<00:02:12.420> unless<00:02:12.720> you're<00:02:12.989> you

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
quite quickly unless you're you

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.670 
quite quickly unless you're you
something<00:02:13.550> like<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.910> type<00:02:14.150> 95<00:02:14.510> or<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.080> m16

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
something like the type 95 or the m16

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.310 
something like the type 95 or the m16
which<00:02:16.250> tends<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.790> last<00:02:17.240> a<00:02:17.420> little<00:02:17.570> bit<00:02:17.660> longer

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
which tends to last a little bit longer

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.180 
which tends to last a little bit longer
ammo<00:02:19.100> wise<00:02:19.690> but<00:02:20.690> yeah<00:02:21.110> definitely<00:02:21.350> try<00:02:21.860> using

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
ammo wise but yeah definitely try using

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.150 
ammo wise but yeah definitely try using
extended<00:02:22.760> mags<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.780> weapon<00:02:24.080> with<00:02:24.920> sleight

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
extended mags on the weapon with sleight

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.620 
extended mags on the weapon with sleight
of<00:02:25.190> hand<00:02:25.460> you<00:02:25.700> don't<00:02:26.060> have<00:02:26.210> to<00:02:26.360> use<00:02:26.480> two

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
of hand you don't have to use two

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.180 
of hand you don't have to use two
attachments<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.260> just<00:02:27.500> really<00:02:27.680> like<00:02:27.830> having<00:02:28.160> a

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
attachments I just really like having a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.180 
attachments I just really like having a
silenced<00:02:28.520> around<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.820> ACR<00:02:29.230> but<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.770> extended

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
silenced around the ACR but the extended

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.150 
silenced around the ACR but the extended
mags<00:02:31.690> trick<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:32.930> very<00:02:33.440> helpful<00:02:33.860> if<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.070> have

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
mags trick is very helpful if you have

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.970 
mags trick is very helpful if you have
not<00:02:34.310> tried<00:02:34.460> that<00:02:35.290> extended<00:02:36.290> mags<00:02:36.440> itself<00:02:36.830> is

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
not tried that extended mags itself is

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.680 
not tried that extended mags itself is
actually<00:02:37.130> very<00:02:37.340> good<00:02:37.550> not<00:02:38.240> just<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.510> fact

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
actually very good not just the fact

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.140 
actually very good not just the fact
that<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.960> adds<00:02:39.080> extra<00:02:39.440> ammo<00:02:39.920> but<00:02:40.490> you<00:02:40.700> can<00:02:40.880> fill

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
that it adds extra ammo but you can fill

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.330 
that it adds extra ammo but you can fill
more<00:02:41.330> people<00:02:41.630> without<00:02:41.900> reloading<00:02:42.200> plus<00:02:43.190> you

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
more people without reloading plus you

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.400 
more people without reloading plus you
have<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.580> ability<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:43.940> reload<00:02:44.330> quickly<00:02:44.780> so

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
have the ability to reload quickly so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.620 
have the ability to reload quickly so
you<00:02:45.470> can<00:02:46.010> be<00:02:46.490> much<00:02:46.640> more<00:02:46.850> aggressive<00:02:46.970> when<00:02:47.510> you

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
you can be much more aggressive when you

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.050 
you can be much more aggressive when you
use<00:02:47.870> extended<00:02:48.500> banks<00:02:48.860> with<00:02:49.310> sleight<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.760> hand

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060

to know what you guys think of it

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.220 
to know what you guys think of it
honestly<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:21.980> think<00:03:22.220> it's<00:03:22.610> fairly<00:03:22.940> fun<00:03:23.360> when

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
honestly I think it's fairly fun when

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.730 
honestly I think it's fairly fun when
you<00:03:24.560> get<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:25.190> good<00:03:25.520> connection<00:03:25.820> when<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:27.050> lag

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
you get a good connection when the lag

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.770 
you get a good connection when the lag
compensation<00:03:28.400> isn't<00:03:28.790> working<00:03:29.300> in<00:03:29.390> your<00:03:29.480> favor

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
compensation isn't working in your favor

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.770 
compensation isn't working in your favor
things<00:03:30.680> aren't<00:03:30.890> very<00:03:31.010> much<00:03:31.340> fun<00:03:31.580> but<00:03:32.209> when

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
things aren't very much fun but when

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.780 
things aren't very much fun but when
that's<00:03:32.930> not<00:03:33.230> an<00:03:33.620> issue<00:03:33.800> then<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.610> games

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
that's not an issue then the games

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.690 
that's not an issue then the games
pretty<00:03:35.090> good<00:03:35.300> but<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:35.930> wouldn't<00:03:36.470> say<00:03:36.830> it's<00:03:37.250> as

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
pretty good but I wouldn't say it's as

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.699 
pretty good but I wouldn't say it's as
good<00:03:38.209> as<00:03:38.420> they<00:03:38.600> could<00:03:38.660> have<00:03:39.020> made<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.380> they

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
good as they could have made it they

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.430 
good as they could have made it they
could<00:03:39.950> have<00:03:40.040> done<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.459> little<00:03:40.640> bit<00:03:41.000> better<00:03:41.330> of<00:03:42.290> a

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
could have done a little bit better of a

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.880 
could have done a little bit better of a
job<00:03:42.470> I<00:03:42.970> don't<00:03:43.970> think<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.360> maps<00:03:44.630> are<00:03:44.989> as<00:03:45.650> good

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
job I don't think the maps are as good

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.949 
job I don't think the maps are as good
as<00:03:45.950> they<00:03:46.280> could<00:03:46.640> have<00:03:46.670> been<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:47.180> think<00:03:47.840> that

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
as they could have been I think that

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.840 
as they could have been I think that
they're<00:03:48.110> really<00:03:48.140> holding<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.800> game<00:03:49.160> back<00:03:49.489> I

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
they're really holding the game back I

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.020 
they're really holding the game back I
think<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.920> perk<00:03:52.160> balance<00:03:52.610> was<00:03:52.790> fairly

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
think that the perk balance was fairly

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.860 
think that the perk balance was fairly
well<00:03:53.270> done<00:03:53.540> but<00:03:53.870> without<00:03:54.470> stopping<00:03:55.100> power<00:03:55.870> the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
well done but without stopping power the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.560 
well done but without stopping power the
choice<00:03:57.140> is<00:03:57.500> clear<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:58.489> best<00:03:58.700> perk<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.180> use<00:03:59.330> is

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
choice is clear the best perk to use is

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.510 
choice is clear the best perk to use is
assassin<00:04:00.080> especially<00:04:00.590> with<00:04:00.770> how<00:04:00.920> many<00:04:00.980> UAVs

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
assassin especially with how many UAVs

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.940 
assassin especially with how many UAVs
they<00:04:01.730> have<00:04:01.880> in<00:04:02.030> this<00:04:02.120> game<00:04:02.330> there's<00:04:02.989> like<00:04:03.560> five

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
they have in this game there's like five

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.460 
they have in this game there's like five
times<00:04:04.340> as<00:04:04.610> much<00:04:04.760> UAV<00:04:05.270> in<00:04:05.480> this<00:04:05.870> game<00:04:06.080> as<00:04:06.320> there

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
times as much UAV in this game as there

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.130 
times as much UAV in this game as there
is<00:04:06.590> in<00:04:06.709> modern<00:04:06.950> warfare<00:04:07.100> 2<00:04:07.340> so<00:04:08.330> like<00:04:08.810> there's

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
is in modern warfare 2 so like there's

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.410 
is in modern warfare 2 so like there's
no<00:04:09.290> reason<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.739> not<00:04:09.860> use<00:04:10.130> assassin<00:04:10.730> there's

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
no reason to not use assassin there's

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.479 
no reason to not use assassin there's
constant<00:04:11.930> UAV<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:12.590> there's<00:04:12.800> no<00:04:13.040> perks<00:04:13.340> that

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
constant UAV and there's no perks that

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.300 
constant UAV and there's no perks that
compare<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:14.890> nobody's<00:04:15.890> going<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.190> be

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
compare to it so nobody's going to be

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.900 
compare to it so nobody's going to be
using<00:04:16.580> anything<00:04:16.940> different<00:04:17.330> I<00:04:18.910> honestly

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
using anything different I honestly

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.260 
using anything different I honestly
think<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.500> in<00:04:21.500> terms<00:04:21.799> of<00:04:22.070> like<00:04:22.270> fast-paced

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
think that in terms of like fast-paced

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.970 
think that in terms of like fast-paced
this<00:04:23.780> it's<00:04:24.140> pretty<00:04:24.860> good

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
this it's pretty good

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.560 
this it's pretty good
killstreaks<00:04:26.520> are<00:04:26.670> a<00:04:26.700> little<00:04:26.790> weak<00:04:27.060> but<00:04:27.330> I

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
killstreaks are a little weak but I

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.870 
killstreaks are a little weak but I
guess<00:04:27.930> some<00:04:28.170> people<00:04:28.530> wanted<00:04:29.010> that<00:04:29.220> I

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
guess some people wanted that I

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.600 
guess some people wanted that I
personally<00:04:30.840> enjoyed<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.290> when<00:04:31.610> killstreaks

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
personally enjoyed it when killstreaks

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.150 
personally enjoyed it when killstreaks
were<00:04:32.760> really<00:04:33.000> dominant<00:04:33.450> and<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:34.800> you'd<00:04:34.950> get

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
were really dominant and that you'd get

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.340 
were really dominant and that you'd get
killstreaks<00:04:35.670> and<00:04:35.880> then<00:04:35.970> get<00:04:36.570> like<00:04:36.720> 20<00:04:37.020> or<00:04:37.110> 30

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
killstreaks and then get like 20 or 30

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.490 
killstreaks and then get like 20 or 30
kills<00:04:37.880> with<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.000> new<00:04:39.120> map<00:04:39.330> design<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.230> the

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
kills with the new map design and the

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.040 
kills with the new map design and the
spawn<00:04:40.980> immunity<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.790> kill<00:04:42.030> streaks<00:04:42.360> kill

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
spawn immunity to kill streaks kill

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.840 
spawn immunity to kill streaks kill
streaks<00:04:43.320> seem<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.620> little<00:04:43.800> bit<00:04:44.040> weak<00:04:44.340> at<00:04:44.580> some

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
streaks seem a little bit weak at some

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.060 
streaks seem a little bit weak at some
points<00:04:45.290> especially<00:04:46.290> compared<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.800> something

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
points especially compared to something

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.400 
points especially compared to something
like<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.760> stealth<00:04:48.090> bomber<00:04:48.240> which<00:04:48.750> is<00:04:49.050> like

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
like the stealth bomber which is like

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.530 
like the stealth bomber which is like
super<00:04:49.680> powerful<00:04:50.040> now<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.880> its<00:04:51.000> support

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
super powerful now and its support

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.880 
super powerful now and its support
streaks<00:04:51.900> you<00:04:52.140> don't<00:04:52.290> actually<00:04:52.440> have<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.710> get<00:04:52.830> a

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
streaks you don't actually have to get a

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.490 
streaks you don't actually have to get a
kill<00:04:53.100> streak<00:04:53.600> it<00:04:54.600> seems<00:04:54.900> like<00:04:55.080> when<00:04:55.260> you<00:04:55.350> get

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
kill streak it seems like when you get

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.260 
kill streak it seems like when you get
an<00:04:55.650> ac-130<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.460> you<00:04:56.520> get<00:04:56.670> three<00:04:56.940> kills

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
an ac-130 and you get three kills

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.870 
an ac-130 and you get three kills
because<00:04:57.540> everybody<00:04:58.050> you<00:04:58.170> shoot<00:04:58.440> at<00:04:58.880> he's

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
because everybody you shoot at he's

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.730 
because everybody you shoot at he's
invincible<00:05:00.270> through<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.290> new<00:05:01.440> spawn

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
invincible through to the new spawn

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.910 
invincible through to the new spawn
invincibility<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:03.320> like<00:05:04.320> they<00:05:04.680> give<00:05:04.830> you

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
invincibility and like they give you

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.120 
invincibility and like they give you
enough<00:05:05.160> time<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.840> walk<00:05:06.840> on<00:05:07.080> with<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.740> stinger

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
enough time to walk on with a stinger

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.410 
enough time to walk on with a stinger
and<00:05:08.160> shoot<00:05:08.460> something<00:05:08.670> down<00:05:08.940> so<00:05:09.180> you<00:05:09.240> can't

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
and shoot something down so you can't

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.240 
and shoot something down so you can't
even<00:05:09.540> kill<00:05:09.750> people<00:05:09.780> when<00:05:10.080> they<00:05:10.200> spawn<00:05:10.470> so

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
even kill people when they spawn so

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.160 
even kill people when they spawn so
you're<00:05:12.150> pretty<00:05:12.360> pretty<00:05:12.600> much<00:05:12.750> if<00:05:12.900> somebody

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
you're pretty pretty much if somebody

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.630 
you're pretty pretty much if somebody
wants<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.470> kill<00:05:13.710> you<00:05:13.800> they<00:05:13.950> don't<00:05:14.100> even<00:05:14.370> have

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
wants to kill you they don't even have

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.520 
wants to kill you they don't even have
to<00:05:14.820> have<00:05:14.970> blind<00:05:15.360> eye<00:05:15.540> they<00:05:15.750> can<00:05:15.900> still<00:05:16.200> destroy

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
to have blind eye they can still destroy

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.610 
to have blind eye they can still destroy
your<00:05:16.710> kill<00:05:16.890> streaks<00:05:18.110> but<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.200> games<00:05:19.380> it's

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
your kill streaks but the games it's

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.480 
your kill streaks but the games it's
pretty<00:05:19.860> good<00:05:20.070> I'm<00:05:20.340> not<00:05:20.870> as<00:05:22.070> against<00:05:23.070> it<00:05:23.220> as<00:05:23.340> I

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
pretty good I'm not as against it as I

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.220 
pretty good I'm not as against it as I
was<00:05:23.730> before<00:05:24.240> when<00:05:24.480> the<00:05:25.230> lag<00:05:25.440> issues<00:05:25.950> were<00:05:26.190> more

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
was before when the lag issues were more

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.320 
was before when the lag issues were more
predominant<00:05:28.850> so<00:05:29.850> what<00:05:30.030> do<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.180> guys<00:05:30.270> think
