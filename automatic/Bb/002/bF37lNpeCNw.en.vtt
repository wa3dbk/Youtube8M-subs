00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
retarded time is 1/4 the time allotted

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.280 
retarded time is 1/4 the time allotted
are<00:00:33.020> you<00:00:33.290> ready<00:00:33.620> for<00:00:33.980> doomsday<00:00:34.310> friend<00:00:35.290> we

so<00:00:41.720> obviously<00:00:42.079> this<00:00:42.200> give<00:00:42.380> me<00:00:42.470> a<00:00:42.500> dojo<00:00:42.860> for

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
so obviously this give me a dojo for

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.860 
so obviously this give me a dojo for
rush<00:00:43.310> it's<00:00:43.640> super<00:00:43.970> super<00:00:44.270> effective<00:00:44.360> on<00:00:44.690> this

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
rush it's super super effective on this

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.900 
rush it's super super effective on this
map<00:00:45.200> and<00:00:46.210> I<00:00:47.210> mean<00:00:47.810> if<00:00:48.020> it<00:00:48.380> wasn't<00:00:49.130> such<00:00:49.490> a<00:00:49.520> crazy

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
map and I mean if it wasn't such a crazy

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.390 
map and I mean if it wasn't such a crazy
deadline<00:00:50.330> I<00:00:50.900> would<00:00:51.530> use<00:00:51.650> a<00:00:51.680> different<00:00:51.740> tactic

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
deadline I would use a different tactic

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.820 
deadline I would use a different tactic
but<00:00:52.700> it<00:00:52.880> works<00:00:53.360> out<00:00:53.540> pretty<00:00:53.960> well

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
but it works out pretty well

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.850 
but it works out pretty well
all<00:00:55.310> in<00:00:55.640> all<00:00:56.260> basically<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.410> gimmick<00:00:57.710> for

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
all in all basically the gimmick for

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.960 
all in all basically the gimmick for
this<00:00:57.980> map<00:00:58.250> is<00:00:58.550> that<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.630> will<00:00:59.900> have<00:01:00.970> your

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
this map is that you will have your

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.790 
this map is that you will have your
points<00:01:02.630> move<00:01:02.810> up<00:01:02.960> for<00:01:03.140> your<00:01:03.230> general<00:01:03.530> powers

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
points move up for your general powers

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.230 
points move up for your general powers
very<00:01:04.070> quickly<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:04.930> you're<00:01:05.930> going<00:01:06.259> to<00:01:07.240> get

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
very quickly and you're going to get

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.580 
very quickly and you're going to get
your<00:01:08.420> general<00:01:08.750> powers<00:01:09.280> insanely<00:01:10.280> fast<00:01:11.590> so

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
your general powers insanely fast so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.649 
your general powers insanely fast so
there<00:01:12.740> is<00:01:12.890> a<00:01:12.920> defense<00:01:13.790> sentry<00:01:14.119> guns<00:01:14.299> up<00:01:14.479> front

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
there is a defense sentry guns up front

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.510 
there is a defense sentry guns up front
here<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:15.049> try<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.710> prevent<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.040> from<00:01:16.100> rushing

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520

upfront<00:02:25.680> SAP<00:02:26.680> should<00:02:26.920> wipe<00:02:27.099> out<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.519> turrets

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
upfront SAP should wipe out the turrets

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.849 
upfront SAP should wipe out the turrets
pretty<00:02:29.170> easily<00:02:30.690> as<00:02:31.690> well<00:02:31.989> as<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.260> one<00:02:32.530> battle

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859
