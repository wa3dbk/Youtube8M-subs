sonia kashuk that i've tried they are
wonderful<00:02:32.750> um<00:02:33.370> another<00:02:34.370> one<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:35.209> think

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
wonderful um another one that I think

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.699 
wonderful um another one that I think
it's<00:02:36.250> different<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.640> very<00:02:38.450> very<00:02:38.959> nice<00:02:39.260> it's

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
it's different and very very nice it's

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.420 
it's different and very very nice it's
this<00:02:40.310> one<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.819> go<00:02:40.850> this<00:02:41.600> angle<00:02:42.019> on<00:02:42.430> eyeliner

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
this one and go this angle on eyeliner

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.039 
this one and go this angle on eyeliner
brush<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.900> think<00:02:45.410> it's<00:02:45.530> great<00:02:46.100> because<00:02:47.049> the

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
brush I think it's great because the

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.750 
brush I think it's great because the
shape<00:02:48.380> really<00:02:49.069> helps<00:02:49.910> with<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.720> line<00:02:51.580> so<00:02:52.580> this

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
shape really helps with the line so this

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.160 
shape really helps with the line so this
one<00:02:52.940> is<00:02:53.030> another<00:02:53.349> brush<00:02:54.349> then<00:02:55.299> lately<00:02:56.299> and<00:02:56.660> I'm

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
one is another brush then lately and I'm

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.250 
one is another brush then lately and I'm
