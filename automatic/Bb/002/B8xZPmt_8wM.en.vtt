 merle and therefore form between 15 and 20 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.019
 people a year who is destined to be 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.729
 shepherd transhumant alpine so 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.250
 currently there is a flock of 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:08.610
 sheep at town hall currently there is a 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.909
 flock of sheep to mary so instead 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.900
 has been taken over by a breeder who is 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.390
 sisteron's side and that's called 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.119
 olivier bayle and who is there with his 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.270
 associate and they have I believe between 900 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.249
 and 1000 sheep here so they took over 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.259
 the place 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:32.340
 it's people we know we have 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.549
 advised the alp and the page is 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.740
 pleasant because there is a lot of grass 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.690
 there are also a lot of constraints but 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.470
 it's an alp where you can 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.640
 go out as they say beautiful animals and 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.190

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.780

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.100
