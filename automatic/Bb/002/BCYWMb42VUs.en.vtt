00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 I am one of the taboo of Jesus 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.830
 stay from mini on the soon 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.349
 German market will come and that in 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.210
 the next week already at 1 &amp; 1 and 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.049
 other contractors 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.119
 we have a 7 inch tablet here but it 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.279
 There is a lot more to it than here 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.900
 have a smartphone 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.130
 and if we push the wheel it is 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.750
 here actually only a display and that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.730
 it shows the weight the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.090
 smartphone here has a 4 inch size 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.210
 Display beautiful 800 x 480 pixel resolution 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.430
 we have a snapdragon 400 processor 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.500
 built for the German market and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.110
 you can see it is really fast 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.750
 Incidentally, the inter variant is the same 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.280
 Rear view on and off 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.200
 volume control and this connector 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.079
 For the padfone you need that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.090
 on the left micro-usb to load 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.309
 around one and a half millimeters of headphones 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.699
 output in the back we have a camera and 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.629
 Although an 8-megapixel camera so 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.160
 much better than for example with the fans and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.670
 here behind hides a again 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.610
 Battery with 1200 milliseconds of this 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.110
 is also take out was we go 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.260
 just look at the camera make us 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.049
 how well this works try 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.250
 focus on phase here 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.659
 We also have one here 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.970
 turbo mode can travel fast 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.460
 shoot photos one after the other and that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.610
 up to 100 pieces on the piece so 100 pieces 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.920
 in a row this is really quite 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.460
 impressive the autofocus has here 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.460
 not quite working 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.860
 Let's have a look at the pictures 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.430
 So we shot here so that 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.960
 is a video so in the dark that is 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.730
 Camera also quite useful 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.550
 It has this new pixel technology 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.380
 the better in the dark better pictures 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.780
 but shows the interesting thing about this 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.450
 device is actually that is with this 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.950
 name lisa docking station together 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.750
 is driven out as you can here 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.410
 this smartphone is simply behind 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.140
 shove 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.300
 and zack goes to the tablet that lasts 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.880
 here not five seconds and we know 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.390
 the smartphone pack, so to speak here 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.910
 and have a big display and that 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.530
 becomes the processor and everything 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.850
 From Smartphone Months Only Display 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.280
 it is controlled here 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.380
 The display is a 7 inch display we 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.150
 have a resolution of 1280 x 800 here 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.680
 pixel the display really looks 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.250
 is neat from the sides though 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.750
 not quite as readable as that of 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.000
 patch for example and overall yes it 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.490
 is sharp you can with it quite well 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.850
 read longer texts but his noticeable 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.140
 it's really fat I appreciate both 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.530
 are two inches in thickness 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.030
 friends 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.100
 it is hard so this rounding 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.570
 held behind is quite comfortable too 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.380
 but you notice it already 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.810
 Altogether there are just under 400 grams so far 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.810
 I see that and you can already tell by 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.970
 weight that it quite a bit 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.470
 heavier option is otherwise in here 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.959
 this docking station we know the 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.239
 position control on off and on 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.520
 find switch ford and one 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.200
 micro-usb connection nothing else we 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.770
 So here can not micro sd card 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.230
 insert 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.850
 It's all about the smartphone 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.790
 So altogether an interesting option 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.280
 I think 249 euros cost 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.500
 not quite sure in her mouth 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.390
 any case a very good price for one 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.130
 combination between smartphone and 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.120
 then most of the time you only use tablet 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.010
 one thing 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.519
 in front and not two at the same time 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.580
 So you save a little money and 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.459
 Overall, that's an interesting one 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.040
 option for all those not two devices 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.440
 want to buy individually or get that 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.760
 We just can not afford it 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.310
 Of course you also install apps here 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.579
 we have the google places here 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.349
 have google maps we can from 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.500
 facebook is here about this player 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.269
 install and know of course 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.950
 They also talk a bit on the phone 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.900
 stupid with the 7 inch display but 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.209
 otherwise you just hold the smartphone like that 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.609
 room for this price 249 euro said 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.599
 I think that's definitely one 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.920
 interesting option 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.900
 otherwise tell me below in the 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.419
 comments how do you like these these 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.789
 combination of smartphone and tablet 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.990
 display and if you drove the video 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.820
 Here, of course, gives me a thumbs up 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.160
 I ask myself a lot and subscribe to that 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.960
 channel that the asus padfone mini the 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.729
 soon on the german market i 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.729
 plan to see the theaters of thale
