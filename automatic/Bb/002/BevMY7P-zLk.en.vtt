asking you one of our simple rules
questions<00:01:58.229> we<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.410> asked<00:01:58.560> every<00:01:58.649> once<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.009> a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
questions we get asked every once in a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.219 
questions we get asked every once in a
while<00:01:59.130> via<00:01:59.399> email<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> question<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.720> if<00:02:00.990> I

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
while via email so the question is if I

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.740 
while via email so the question is if I
have<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.800> genesis<00:02:02.340> wave<00:02:02.520> with<00:02:02.700> x<00:02:02.970> equals<00:02:03.090> 10<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
have a genesis wave with x equals 10 and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.230 
have a genesis wave with x equals 10 and
i<00:02:04.350> reveal<00:02:04.680> an<00:02:04.890> emic<00:02:05.220> role<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.399> ions<00:02:05.729> torn<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
i reveal an emic role of ions torn and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.120 
i reveal an emic role of ions torn and
then<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> turtle<00:02:06.720> with<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.800> choose

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
then the turtle with this can I choose

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.949 
then the turtle with this can I choose
with<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.459> total<00:02:08.729> edges<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.119> get<00:02:09.209> back<00:02:09.630> Emer

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
with the total edges to get back Emer

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.350 
with the total edges to get back Emer
cool<00:02:10.259> or<00:02:10.470> genesis<00:02:11.220> wave<00:02:11.370> or<00:02:11.730> maybe<00:02:12.000> neither

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
cool or genesis wave or maybe neither

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.270 
cool or genesis wave or maybe neither
because<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.930> emerald<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.800> what's<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> answer

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
because of emerald so what's the answer

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.660 
because of emerald so what's the answer
and<00:02:14.640> why<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.090> well<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.410> depends<00:02:17.070> on<00:02:17.190> how<00:02:17.610> you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
and why is it well it depends on how you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.000 
and why is it well it depends on how you
order<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.180> abilities<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:19.080> stack<00:02:19.350> what

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
order the abilities of a stack what

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.190 
order the abilities of a stack what
happens<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.700> both<00:02:21.000> eternal<00:02:21.750> witness<00:02:22.019> and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
happens is that both eternal witness and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.810 
happens is that both eternal witness and
Emeril's<00:02:22.590> trigger<00:02:22.860> are<00:02:23.160> trying<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.489> go<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
Emeril's trigger are trying to go on the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.570 
Emeril's trigger are trying to go on the
stack<00:02:24.090> as<00:02:24.299> genesis<00:02:25.019> wave<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.320> resolving<00:02:25.709> so

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
stack as genesis wave is resolving so

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.130 
stack as genesis wave is resolving so
they're<00:02:26.940> gonna<00:02:27.030> wait<00:02:27.299> until<00:02:27.450> genesis<00:02:27.900> wave

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
they're gonna wait until genesis wave

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.979 
they're gonna wait until genesis wave
finishes<00:02:28.650> resolving<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.340> going<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.850> set<00:02:30.060> once

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
finishes resolving to going to set once

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.570 
finishes resolving to going to set once
that<00:02:31.170> happens<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.799> as<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> controller<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.400> both

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
that happens you as a controller of both

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.400 
that happens you as a controller of both
abilities<00:02:33.120> get<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.570> choose<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.870> order<00:02:33.989> and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
abilities get to choose the order and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.380 
abilities get to choose the order and
you<00:02:34.920> get<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.220> true<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.430> identical<00:02:35.820> or<00:02:35.880> eternal

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
you get the true so identical or eternal

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.479 
you get the true so identical or eternal
witnesses<00:02:36.780> fair<00:02:36.989> at<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.980> point<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.340> time

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
witnesses fair at that point in time

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.670 
witnesses fair at that point in time
both<00:02:38.880> ever<00:02:39.299> cool<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.049> genesis<00:02:40.380> wave<00:02:40.530> are

both ever cool and the genesis wave are

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.710 
both ever cool and the genesis wave are
sitting<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.070> your<00:02:41.130> behaviour<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.820> then<00:02:42.420> well

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
sitting in your behaviour and then well

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.539

links<00:03:10.810> when<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.650> attacks<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.160> deals<00:03:12.250> damage

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
links when it attacks and deals damage

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.030 
links when it attacks and deals damage
how<00:03:12.820> much<00:03:12.970> luck<00:03:13.120> will<00:03:13.270> I<00:03:13.330> gain<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.750> why<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.770> a

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
how much luck will I gain and why so a

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.770 
how much luck will I gain and why so a
bear<00:03:15.280> cub<00:03:15.460> is<00:03:15.550> a<00:03:15.610> 2/2<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.180> if<00:03:16.600> we<00:03:16.690> are

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
bear cub is a 2/2 and if we are

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.030 
bear cub is a 2/2 and if we are
attacking<00:03:17.020> we're<00:03:17.230> gonna<00:03:17.320> be<00:03:17.470> going<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.800> damage

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
attacking we're gonna be going to damage

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.300 
attacking we're gonna be going to damage
spirit<00:03:19.030> link<00:03:19.380> has<00:03:20.380> a<00:03:20.410> triggered<00:03:20.890> ability<00:03:21.220> on

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
spirit link has a triggered ability on

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.860 
spirit link has a triggered ability on
it<00:03:21.460> that<00:03:21.850> says<00:03:22.120> whenever<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.600> creature

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
it that says whenever this creature

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.540 
it that says whenever this creature
deals<00:03:23.170> damage<00:03:23.380> its<00:03:23.740> controller<00:03:24.100> gains<00:03:24.370> that

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
deals damage its controller gains that

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.000 
deals damage its controller gains that
much<00:03:24.730> life<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.810> when<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.230> bear<00:03:26.350> cub<00:03:26.530> deals<00:03:26.800> to

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
much life so when the bear cub deals to

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.760 
much life so when the bear cub deals to
to<00:03:27.160> someone's<00:03:27.430> face<00:03:27.610> or<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:29.260> creature<00:03:29.500> or

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
to someone's face or to a creature or

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.510 
to someone's face or to a creature or
what<00:03:29.950> have<00:03:30.130> you

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
what have you

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.980 
what have you
those<00:03:31.300> are<00:03:31.390> going<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.600> trigger<00:03:31.750> both

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
those are going to trigger both

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.630 
those are going to trigger both
separately<00:03:32.440> because<00:03:32.950> both<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.460> trigger

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
separately because both of the trigger

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.370 
separately because both of the trigger
conditions<00:03:34.030> have<00:03:34.180> been<00:03:34.270> met<00:03:34.330> so<00:03:34.750> they<00:03:35.290> are

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
conditions have been met so they are

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.320 
conditions have been met so they are
both<00:03:35.500> going<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:35.860> go<00:03:36.010> oh<00:03:36.160> hey<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.640> do<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:36.790> thing<00:03:37.150> now

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
both going to go oh hey I do a thing now

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.780 
both going to go oh hey I do a thing now
so<00:03:37.620> what<00:03:38.620> they're<00:03:38.740> going<00:03:38.770> to<00:03:38.950> do<00:03:39.040> is<00:03:39.310> that

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
so what they're going to do is that

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.160 
so what they're going to do is that
controller<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.300> going<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.600> gain<00:03:40.840> two<00:03:40.990> light

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
controller is going to gain two light

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.080 
controller is going to gain two light
because<00:03:41.560> their<00:03:42.010> cups<00:03:42.190> do<00:03:42.340> two<00:03:42.460> and<00:03:42.910> that<00:03:43.000> is

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
because their cups do two and that is

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.340 
because their cups do two and that is
going<00:03:43.210> to<00:03:43.300> gain<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.570> life<00:03:43.690> again<00:03:43.810> so<00:03:44.140> in<00:03:44.260> total

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
going to gain to life again so in total

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.150 
going to gain to life again so in total
for<00:03:44.680> life

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
for life

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.190 
for life
great<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:46.360> what<00:03:46.690> do<00:03:46.750> we<00:03:46.780> change<00:03:47.080> the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
great and so what do we change the

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.990 
great and so what do we change the
spirit<00:03:47.470> links<00:03:47.710> into<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.310> light<00:03:48.520> links<00:03:48.820> how

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
spirit links into to light links how

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.070 
spirit links into to light links how
would<00:03:49.150> that<00:03:49.270> make<00:03:49.330> things<00:03:49.600> different

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
would that make things different

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.260 
would that make things different
or<00:03:50.140> would<00:03:50.350> it<00:03:50.380> so<00:03:51.100> it's<00:03:51.670> fairly<00:03:51.880> good<00:03:52.120> life

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
or would it so it's fairly good life

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.000 
or would it so it's fairly good life
link<00:03:52.420> are<00:03:52.570> two<00:03:52.780> different<00:03:53.680> things<00:03:53.800> one<00:03:53.890> of

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
link are two different things one of

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.050 
link are two different things one of
them<00:03:54.130> is<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.310> triggered<00:03:54.610> ability<00:03:54.910> which

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
them is a triggered ability which

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.100 
them is a triggered ability which
triggers<00:03:55.330> separately<00:03:55.690> every<00:03:55.840> time<00:03:55.990> it's

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
triggers separately every time it's

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.960 
triggers separately every time it's
conditions<00:03:56.470> are<00:03:56.590> met<00:03:56.740> while<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:57.670> other<00:03:57.790> one

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
conditions are met while the other one

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.910 
conditions are met while the other one
life<00:03:58.150> link<00:03:58.360> is<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.510> static<00:03:58.930> ability<00:03:59.320> that<00:03:59.710> just

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
life link is a static ability that just

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.920 
life link is a static ability that just
says<00:04:00.100> when<00:04:00.310> this<00:04:00.460> creature<00:04:00.640> deals<00:04:01.000> damage<00:04:01.240> its

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
says when this creature deals damage its

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.900 
says when this creature deals damage its
controller<00:04:02.230> gains<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.590> much<00:04:02.770> life<00:04:02.950> so

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
controller gains that much life so

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.880 
controller gains that much life so
multiple<00:04:04.390> instances<00:04:04.900> of<00:04:04.960> life<00:04:05.320> link<00:04:05.530> are<00:04:05.830> in

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
multiple instances of life link are in

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.710 
multiple instances of life link are in
fact<00:04:06.040> redundant<00:04:06.580> which<00:04:06.880> means<00:04:07.120> he's<00:04:07.630> only

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
fact redundant which means he's only

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.930 
fact redundant which means he's only
going<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:07.990> name<00:04:08.140> two<00:04:08.350> life<00:04:08.560> because<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.760> other

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
going to name two life because the other

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.670 
going to name two life because the other
life<00:04:10.300> link<00:04:10.480> is<00:04:10.570> oh<00:04:10.690> oh<00:04:10.900> I<00:04:11.260> already<00:04:11.500> did<00:04:11.650> my

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
life link is oh oh I already did my

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.140 
life link is oh oh I already did my
thing<00:04:11.980> so<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.220> have<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.490> do<00:04:12.580> it<00:04:12.670> again<00:04:12.790> great

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
thing so I have to do it again great

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.840 
thing so I have to do it again great

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
question that we normally get via email

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.310 
question that we normally get via email
so<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.549> question<00:04:21.880> was<00:04:22.030> if<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.630> play<00:04:22.840> collected

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
so the question was if I play collected

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.560 
so the question was if I play collected
company<00:04:23.620> can<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.400> put<00:04:24.580> a<00:04:24.610> creature<00:04:24.880> from<00:04:25.270> glutes

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
company can I put a creature from glutes

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.120 
company can I put a creature from glutes
company<00:04:25.900> face<00:04:26.140> down<00:04:26.350> onto<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.740> battlefield

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
company face down onto the battlefield

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.460 
company face down onto the battlefield
say<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.700> Dem<00:04:28.060> protector<00:04:28.420> and<00:04:28.600> why<00:04:29.020> or<00:04:29.170> why<00:04:29.290> not

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
say a Dem protector and why or why not

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.410 
say a Dem protector and why or why not
well<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.490> short<00:04:30.610> answer<00:04:30.730> is<00:04:30.940> no<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.360> here's

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
well the short answer is no and here's

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.410 
well the short answer is no and here's
why<00:04:31.750> is<00:04:32.410> that<00:04:32.650> morph<00:04:33.100> is<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.370> cost<00:04:34.000> you<00:04:34.150> can<00:04:34.270> only

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
why is that morph is a cost you can only

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.960 
why is that morph is a cost you can only
pay<00:04:34.600> as<00:04:34.720> an<00:04:34.810> alternative<00:04:35.230> casting<00:04:36.070> costs<00:04:36.520> and

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
pay as an alternative casting costs and

if<00:04:48.700> we<00:04:48.790> get<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:48.940> creature<00:04:49.150> with<00:04:49.360> X<00:04:49.630> in<00:04:49.780> its<00:04:49.930> costs

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
if we get a creature with X in its costs

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.370 
if we get a creature with X in its costs
say<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.950> hunted<00:04:51.550> Hydra<00:04:51.910> could<00:04:52.390> we<00:04:52.600> then<00:04:52.780> say<00:04:53.020> put

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
it in the play for x equals one since

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.840 
it in the play for x equals one since
this<00:04:55.210> converted<00:04:55.540> mana<00:04:55.600> cost<00:04:55.720> three<00:04:56.170> or<00:04:56.350> less

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.920 
as far as the game was concerned
X<00:05:00.740> is<00:05:00.950> always<00:05:01.220> zero<00:05:01.550> except<00:05:01.880> on<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.060> stack<00:05:02.270> so

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
X is always zero except on the stack so

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.810 
X is always zero except on the stack so
since<00:05:03.169> once<00:05:03.440> again<00:05:03.620> it's<00:05:03.740> never<00:05:03.980> cast<00:05:04.250> there's

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820
