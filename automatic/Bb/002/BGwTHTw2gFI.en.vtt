video you'll be able to tell whether

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.730 
video you'll be able to tell whether
it's<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.969> worthy<00:00:15.179> upgrade<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.440> first<00:00:16.650> thing

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
it's a worthy upgrade so the first thing

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.200 
it's a worthy upgrade so the first thing
that<00:00:16.859> you'll<00:00:17.070> notice<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.970> volume

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
that you'll notice is that the volume

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.300 
that you'll notice is that the volume
rockers<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.410> mute<00:00:19.560> switch<00:00:19.800> are<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
rockers and the mute switch are in the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.609 
rockers and the mute switch are in the
same<00:00:20.550> exact<00:00:21.060> spot<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.199> won't<00:00:22.470> be<00:00:22.529> a

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
same exact spot so that won't be a

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.910 
same exact spot so that won't be a
change<00:00:23.039> however<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:24.090> volume<00:00:24.840> headphone<00:00:25.590> jack

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
change however the volume headphone jack

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.640 
change however the volume headphone jack
is<00:00:26.130> now<00:00:27.029> at<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> bottom<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.900> your<00:00:27.930> device<00:00:28.380> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
is now at the bottom of your device and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.099 
is now at the bottom of your device and
you<00:00:29.039> have<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> new<00:00:29.550> lightning<00:00:29.910> port<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:31.080> that

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
you have a new lightning port so that

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.930 
you have a new lightning port so that
will<00:00:31.470> be<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> lot<00:00:31.800> easier<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.189> found<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.730> lot

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
will be a lot easier I found it's a lot

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.190 
will be a lot easier I found it's a lot
better<00:00:33.120> than<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> 30-pin<00:00:33.930> dock<00:00:33.989> connector

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
better than the 30-pin dock connector

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.880 
better than the 30-pin dock connector
even<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.700> change<00:00:36.510> your

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
even if you have to change your

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.290 
even if you have to change your
connectors<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.190> lot<00:00:38.340> easier<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.879> put<00:00:39.090> in

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
connectors it's a lot easier to put in

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.869 
connectors it's a lot easier to put in
the<00:00:40.050> locks<00:00:40.320> which<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> same<00:00:41.250> spot<00:00:41.520> as

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
the locks which is in the same spot as

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.459 
the locks which is in the same spot as
well<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.629> next<00:00:42.780> thing<00:00:42.930> I'm<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.290> talk

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
well so next thing I'm going to talk

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.100 
well so next thing I'm going to talk

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
iPhone 5 which is on the right it is an

8 megapixel camera with image
stabilization<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.840> video<00:00:52.140> stabilization<00:00:52.649> as

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
stabilization and video stabilization as

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
well as face detection HDR and the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.350 
well as face detection HDR and the
panorama<00:00:55.829> view<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.910> much<00:00:57.329> better

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
panorama view so it is a much better

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.240 
panorama view so it is a much better
camera<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.199> as<00:00:58.289> you'll<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> pictures

definitely<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.580> an<00:01:17.909> improvement<00:01:18.680> Apple<00:01:19.680> has

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
definitely see an improvement Apple has

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.679 
definitely see an improvement Apple has
now<00:01:19.890> put<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> metal<00:01:20.640> back<00:01:20.909> onto<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.360> iphone

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.630 
now put on a metal back onto the iphone
5<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.229> right<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.130> will<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.310> definitely

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
5 on the right so it will be definitely

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.640 
5 on the right so it will be definitely
more<00:01:24.090> durable<00:01:24.479> because<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.259> back<00:01:25.470> will

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
more durable because the the back will

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.859 
more durable because the the back will
not<00:01:25.770> crack<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.729> much<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.420> will<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:27.689> be

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
not crack as much but you will not be

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.319 
not crack as much but you will not be
able<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.110> replace<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.070> VBAC<00:01:29.640> because<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
able to replace a VBAC because it's a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.990 
able to replace a VBAC because it's a
full<00:01:30.659> piece<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.470> keep<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.009> mind<00:01:32.130> when

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
full piece so keep that in mind when

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.850 
full piece so keep that in mind when
upgrading<00:01:33.329> also<00:01:34.079> you'll<00:01:34.229> notice<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
upgrading also you'll notice that it's a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.370

like this do differentiate the iphone 4
on<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.670> left<00:02:43.000> from<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.330> iphone<00:02:43.660> 5<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.200> the
