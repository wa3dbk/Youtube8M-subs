now<00:00:16.379> we're<00:00:16.710> doing<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:16.980> stool<00:00:17.279> you're<00:00:18.090> going

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
now we're doing this stool you're going

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.090 
now we're doing this stool you're going
to<00:00:18.270> wrap<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.449> around<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.960> couple<00:00:19.140> times<00:00:19.320> just

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
to wrap it around a couple times just

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.950 
to wrap it around a couple times just
make<00:00:20.279> sure<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.670> sturdy<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.270> stable<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.840> not

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
it you're going to clamp it with this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.390 
it you're going to clamp it with this
clamp<00:00:27.990> right<00:00:28.289> here<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.920> you're<00:00:29.220> going<00:00:29.250> to

clamp right here and you're going to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.189 
clamp right here and you're going to
make<00:00:29.550> sure<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.060> bungee<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.480> attached<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
make sure that the bungee is attached to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.380 
make sure that the bungee is attached to
the<00:00:31.320> rope<00:00:31.700> then<00:00:32.700> you're<00:00:32.940> going<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> lay<00:00:33.239> your

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the rope then you're going to lay your

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.090 
the rope then you're going to lay your
bungee<00:00:33.630> out<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.200> make<00:00:34.380> sure<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> length

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
bungee out and make sure it's the length

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.459 
bungee out and make sure it's the length
that<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.309> want<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.510> want<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> optimal

that you want it you want it the optimal
amount<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.860> speed<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.100> you're<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> get

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
amount of speed that you're going to get

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.430 
amount of speed that you're going to get
so<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.420> get<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> most<00:00:39.809> amount<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.230> speed

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
so you can get the most amount of speed

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.459 
so you can get the most amount of speed
and<00:00:40.559> not<00:00:40.710> worry<00:00:41.040> about<00:00:41.100> lacking<00:00:42.260> okay<00:00:43.260> we're
