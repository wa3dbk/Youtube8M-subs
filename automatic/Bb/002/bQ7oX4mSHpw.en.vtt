00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
around your curling iron or whatever

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.330 
around your curling iron or whatever
this<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> first<00:00:48.899> time<00:00:49.230> I've<00:00:49.500> used<00:00:49.530> one

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
this is the first time I've used one

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.970 
this is the first time I've used one
that<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.820> aerosol<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.949> been

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
that is aerosol the one that I have been

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.860 
that is aerosol the one that I have been
using<00:00:53.280> before<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.480> suave

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
using before this was just the suave

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.380 
using before this was just the suave
heat<00:00:55.440> protection<00:00:55.860> spray<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.820> liked<00:00:57.120> it

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
heat protection spray and I liked it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.410 
heat protection spray and I liked it
okay<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.230> think<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.920> probably<00:00:59.430> was<00:00:59.699> doing<00:01:00.210> its

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
okay I think it probably was doing its

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.299 
okay I think it probably was doing its
job<00:01:00.660> where<00:01:00.930> heat<00:01:01.109> protection<00:01:01.500> was<00:01:01.829> concerned

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
job where heat protection was concerned

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.509 
job where heat protection was concerned
but<00:01:02.809> looking<00:01:03.809> back<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.589> wasn't<00:01:04.979> probably

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
but looking back it wasn't probably

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.060 
but looking back it wasn't probably
doing<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:06.000> much<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.720> locking<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> style

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
doing as much for locking in the style

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.630 
doing as much for locking in the style
and<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.659> regular<00:01:10.110> pump<00:01:10.500> sprayer<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and it's just a regular pump sprayer you

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.660 
and it's just a regular pump sprayer you
know<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.290> really<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.220> how<00:01:14.430> it's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
know and so this I really like how it's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.179 
know and so this I really like how it's
a<00:01:14.820> fine<00:01:15.150> mist<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:16.020> actually<00:01:16.380> feel<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.799> I'm

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
a fine mist I actually feel like I'm

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.539 
a fine mist I actually feel like I'm
getting<00:01:17.580> less<00:01:18.060> product<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.080> my<00:01:19.140> hair<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:20.220> it's

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
getting less product on my hair but it's

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.870 
getting less product on my hair but it's
kind<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.240> spreading<00:01:21.900> over<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> wider<00:01:22.799> area<00:01:22.950> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
kind of spreading over a wider area so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.090 
kind of spreading over a wider area so
I'll<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.150> take<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> chunk<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.259> know<00:01:25.409> let's

fine<00:01:47.040> mist<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:47.939> spritz<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.509> and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
fine mist I can just spritz it on and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.990 
fine mist I can just spritz it on and
then<00:01:48.930> start<00:01:49.590> wrapping<00:01:49.740> around<00:01:50.070> my<00:01:50.310> iron<00:01:50.610> so

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
then start wrapping around my iron so

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.340 
then start wrapping around my iron so
I've<00:01:51.119> been<00:01:51.270> using<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.899> couple<00:01:52.079> of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
I've been using this for a couple of

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.800 
I've been using this for a couple of
weeks<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.670> had<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> hunch<00:01:54.210> probably<00:01:54.750> in

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
weeks now and I had a hunch probably in

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.480 
weeks now and I had a hunch probably in
the<00:01:54.899> first<00:01:55.140> week<00:01:55.439> when<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.890> using<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the first week when I was using it and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.940 
the first week when I was using it and
using<00:01:56.729> my<00:01:56.850> curling<00:01:57.240> iron<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.630> stuff<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.170> had<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
using my curling iron and stuff I had a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.649 
using my curling iron and stuff I had a
hunch<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.640> was<00:01:59.759> doing<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.210> really<00:02:00.420> good

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
hunch that it was doing a really good

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.380 
hunch that it was doing a really good
job<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:01.950> all<00:02:02.130> solidified<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:02.880> me

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
job but it was all solidified for me

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.899 
job but it was all solidified for me
when<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.409> day<00:02:04.590> before<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.219> messed<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.759> day<00:02:05.880> I

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
when the day before I messed the day I

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.389 
when the day before I messed the day I
left<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.420> IMATS

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
left for IMATS

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.449 
left for IMATS
last<00:02:08.399> week<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.060> did<00:02:09.479> my<00:02:09.660> hair<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.379> used<00:02:11.220> this

last week I did my hair and I used this

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.180 
last week I did my hair and I used this
before

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190

wrap my hair around my iron and I used

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.980 
wrap my hair around my iron and I used
one<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.320> those<00:02:15.010> Remington<00:02:15.910> tea<00:02:16.120> studio<00:02:16.540> pearl

one of those Remington tea studio pearl
wands<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.070> have<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.550> small<00:02:18.940> one<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.420> large<00:02:19.660> one

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
wands I have a small one and a large one

wands I have a small one and a large one
the<00:02:20.200> small<00:02:20.560> one<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:21.070> feel<00:02:21.250> like<00:02:21.490> my<00:02:21.760> hair<00:02:22.060> will

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
the small one I feel like my hair will

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.930 
the small one I feel like my hair will
stay<00:02:22.570> for<00:02:22.990> a<00:02:23.020> long<00:02:23.560> long<00:02:23.830> time<00:02:23.890> when<00:02:24.460> I<00:02:24.490> wrap<00:02:24.790> my

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
stay for a long long time when I wrap my

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.490 
stay for a long long time when I wrap my
hair<00:02:25.120> around<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.570> always<00:02:25.990> had<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.470> just

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
hair around that always had it just

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.230 
hair around that always had it just
really<00:02:26.890> holds<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.310> curl<00:02:27.550> well<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.120> it's

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
really holds the curl well and it's

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.580 
really holds the curl well and it's
probably<00:02:28.420> because<00:02:28.570> it's<00:02:28.840> giving<00:02:29.080> me<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.200> fairly

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
probably because it's giving me a fairly

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.160 
probably because it's giving me a fairly
tight<00:02:29.830> curl<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.700> larger<00:02:31.210> one<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.750> gives<00:02:31.990> me<00:02:32.140> a

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
tight curl the larger one it gives me a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.140 
tight curl the larger one it gives me a
loose<00:02:32.500> wave<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.220> I've<00:02:33.340> always<00:02:33.670> struggled

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
loose wave and I've always struggled

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.110 
loose wave and I've always struggled
with<00:02:34.510> keeping<00:02:35.170> loose<00:02:35.800> waves<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.580> my<00:02:36.820> fine

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
with keeping loose waves in my fine

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.820 
with keeping loose waves in my fine
straight<00:02:37.570> hair<00:02:37.900> like<00:02:38.230> if<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.410> do<00:02:38.470> something

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830

first<00:02:42.370> couple<00:02:42.940> hours<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.870> then<00:02:44.020> it<00:02:44.140> just

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
first couple hours and then it just

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.840 
first couple hours and then it just
starts<00:02:44.710> to<00:02:44.800> fall<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.130> real<00:02:45.370> test<00:02:45.610> of<00:02:45.730> this

laying on my hair you know all that
stuff<00:03:07.810> really<00:03:08.290> maintained<00:03:08.890> my<00:03:09.070> style<00:03:09.490> to

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
stuff really maintained my style to

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.180 
stuff really maintained my style to
where<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.300> just<00:03:10.660> like<00:03:10.900> touched<00:03:11.470> up<00:03:11.710> a<00:03:11.830> few<00:03:11.980> areas

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
where I just like touched up a few areas

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.610 
where I just like touched up a few areas
on<00:03:12.550> top<00:03:12.820> but<00:03:13.090> my<00:03:13.180> overall<00:03:13.360> curl<00:03:14.020> all<00:03:14.290> over

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
on top but my overall curl all over

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.020 
on top but my overall curl all over
which<00:03:14.770> looks<00:03:15.040> something<00:03:15.250> like<00:03:15.460> this<00:03:15.790> because

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
which looks something like this because

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.140 
which looks something like this because
I<00:03:16.120> used<00:03:16.300> that<00:03:16.390> same<00:03:16.690> one<00:03:16.989> today<00:03:17.550> really<00:03:18.550> held

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
I used that same one today really held

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.060 
I used that same one today really held
the<00:03:19.330> look<00:03:19.540> also<00:03:20.110> I<00:03:20.440> think<00:03:20.500> I've<00:03:20.830> seen<00:03:21.010> a

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
the look also I think I've seen a

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.710 
the look also I think I've seen a
difference<00:03:21.580> with<00:03:21.790> this<00:03:22.030> when<00:03:22.450> I've<00:03:22.570> been

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
difference with this when I've been

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.350 
difference with this when I've been
using<00:03:22.930> hot<00:03:23.290> rollers<00:03:23.320> too<00:03:24.160> which<00:03:24.760> is<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:24.970> big

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
using hot rollers too which is a big

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
too much product and I feel like that

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.860 
too much product and I feel like that
can<00:03:43.690> happen<00:03:43.900> but<00:03:44.800> this<00:03:45.100> just<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:46.060> light<00:03:46.360> spray

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
can happen but this just the light spray

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.320 
can happen but this just the light spray
of<00:03:46.900> this<00:03:47.320> on<00:03:47.860> each<00:03:48.160> section<00:03:48.459> before<00:03:49.000> I<00:03:49.030> put<00:03:49.300> a

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
of this on each section before I put a

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.690 
of this on each section before I put a
roller<00:03:49.630> in<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:50.170> think<00:03:50.500> also<00:03:50.890> had<00:03:51.280> an<00:03:51.400> impact

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
roller in I think also had an impact

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.160 
roller in I think also had an impact
plus<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.180> was<00:03:52.269> getting<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.600> heat<00:03:52.750> protection

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
plus I was getting the heat protection

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.630 
plus I was getting the heat protection
you<00:03:53.470> know<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:53.680> know<00:03:54.010> it's<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.280> little<00:03:54.459> more

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
you know you know it's a little more

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.729 
you know you know it's a little more
pricey<00:03:54.940> than<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.570> suave<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.260> was<00:03:56.470> using

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
pricey than the suave that I was using

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.290 
pricey than the suave that I was using
but<00:03:57.160> if<00:03:57.250> I'm<00:03:57.370> getting<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.700> heat<00:03:57.880> protection

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
but if I'm getting the heat protection

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.560 
but if I'm getting the heat protection
and<00:03:58.780> helping<00:03:59.140> my<00:03:59.320> style<00:03:59.650> last<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.160> lot<00:04:00.310> longer<00:04:00.570> I
