00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.269
 that you can experience that in your life that is that doing something like that is special 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.079
 actually viewer own people actually very special 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.149
 those people in peace then you do that no matter how you start playing there and then 

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:24.739
 like an orchestra in the hague drove three days the woman came home then walked like that 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.839
 according to the bank 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.679
 a final greeting 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.190
 however you are there that the plan would be the end that sets its own 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.460
 surprise his statement 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.640
 well that is so bizarre so hard 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.980
 so much and the but yes the 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.260
 It is so overwhelming that you see they are planning to aggravate too many rules 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
 a lot of fuss 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.930
 the first rehearsal and was one of them for me 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.020
 of the most impressive they also because the whole race cameras they stood 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.550
 a sage all over the world 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.120
 and finally also the taste of paradiso the 14th of April in the evening 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.120
 first rehearsal he is also very strange 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.210
 because actually a lot of resistance broke a third suspect fit enough who didn't 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.580
 succeeds 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.750
 and 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.730
 the first thing i 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.670
 the airport itself mobilane that it was a win win situation so that was 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.540
 a 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.380
 laetitia afterwards 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.750
 yes it is natural 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.910
 I would say then you have real chance to think about taking more time 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.630
 from 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.710
 what exactly happened and because when you get there now we have everything going 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.850
 be so fast and so fast yes it is all very nice 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.260
 and that the other members of the orchestra had also had enough of everyone actually coming 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.740
 He finds out there is a bit of contact through Facebook and 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.560
 send these away from ea 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.520
 in other words, if it had not all been and pictures of reality 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.659
 I actually think it was next to the goal 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:10.319
 I am going to study abroad 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.279
 I am very happy with that and it has always been a dream of mine 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.669
 but actually it was yourv 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:16.949
 westervoort from in any case not 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:18.130
 go after a white Christmas 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.560
 Almere then you have found the cera stepper 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.490
 really 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.490
 away with allocated 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.459
 I would say watch the movie store 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.809
 the production set aside also stands out 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:31.239
 after concerts of the 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.799
 the experiences of others 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.109
 have been in the mood for protests 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:41.699
 yes especially the incident especially just don't be afraid that they also produce steel 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.239
 it's everyone can be and would fall it might be a little crazy 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:50.659
 precisely the attention and care selected that is that is all mt it is just 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.789
 experience of life and that is not possible but no one is wondering
