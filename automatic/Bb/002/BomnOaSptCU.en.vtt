00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hello dear friends with you necrosis 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.150
 and today i will briefly tell you about 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:16.830
 biographies of the druid and of course I will try 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:20.580
 to voice it even before we went 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.920
 first store and were written first 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.439
 books then already had a bear clan wise and 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.679
 its members were fair 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.630
 and their main goal was to understand 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:39.739
 nature orders higher forces of nature 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:44.329
 saw them and demanded the wisest of you 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:46.950
 I was called by force I was the second priest 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.640
 judge and seer of the clan 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.800
 I came out of the ranks of my fellow tribesmen 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.460
 when the last light of this world fades away 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.100
 when civilization leaves this land 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.180
 when the world is overrun 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.580
 endless desert end of worlds 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.159
 plant seed 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.700
 filled with faith I felt like 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.900
 the weight of years on my shoulders became lighter 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.229
 a little ches brightness little by little 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.439
 returned to the body in my mind 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:29.640
 immeasurable knowledge i absorbed 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.530
 able to change their physical shape but 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.689
 yet evil tongues and malleable ears 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.640
 smashed words about semen to other people 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:46.010
 and they descended on war clan battle 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.320
 they forgot about me and the seed forgot 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:53.400
 multiple majestic civilizations 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.380
 you yarn and fallen there where once was 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.640
 clan 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.580
 For centuries and millennia I waited, waited 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.310
 news from their deities 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.869
 waited for the end of the war in ever-rampant 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.979
 the lands waited in seclusion and in secret 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.630
 from all 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.720
 waited for the end of all things and its completion 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.470
 sacred missions are always ready 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:28.980
 destroy what would prevent the accomplishment 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:31.019
 sowing but if you liked it 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.030
 put your finger up and don't forget 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.030
