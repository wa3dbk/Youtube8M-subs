 puntonet technological friends we are here 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.240
 today with the como k8 the first smartphone 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.510
 acta core of the house in como we have 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.430
 already known for the k 5 series with the k 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.269
 5 turbos as top of the range and in 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.560
 this particular como k8 represents 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.260
 the first smartphone opts core 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.320
 we remind you that como is a company 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.000
 Italian that you are based near 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.120
 florence and which deals with proposing to 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.180
 favorable prices 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.239
 these features smartphones 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.750
 very important techniques 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.719
 in particular how a coat arrives 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.219
 in the sales package 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.160
 as you can see also sealed 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.409
 through the special stamp on 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.670
 both sides 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.070
 before opening it we remind you 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.380
 briefly that it is one 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.400
 smartphone with enough dimensions 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:22.350
 generous because we are talking about 55 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:25.080
 inches of display with the very famous 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.530
 indeed now the notorious processor 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:34.460
 mediatek mtk 65 90 65 92 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.460
 let's open it 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:49.560
 como coat coloration totally 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:52.460
 black plastic back slightly 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.409
 rough so as to favor its grip 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.110
 without battery and very light it will be necessary 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.320
 go and see how much it impacts 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.409
 battery on the terminal weight 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:12.030
 in this regard we open it immediately and 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:15.959
 we see the internal micro sd sim slots 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.660
 one of the standard type sim2 of micro type 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.930
 on both we can see that it is 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.099
 You can activate the data connection 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:30.410
 gucci dna type with regard to the 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:33.209
 rom and 48 gb while the camera from 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.790
 14.1 megapixels with LED flash 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.470
 we'll see if the results will be better 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.670
 of those obtainable with the k 5 55 series 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.739
 inches of display decidedly broad and 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.870
 what else can we tell you how 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.410
 2gb primary memory feature 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.410
 ram 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.730
 data connectivity can reach up to 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.120
 42 2 megabits per second bluetooth 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.200
 informed 4.0 therefore also important 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.079
 regarding savings 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.910
 full hd resolution energy 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.319
 so we're talking about a density of 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.720
 pixels per inch equal to about 401 ppi 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.780
 the gorilla glass sorry reflection of the 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.430
 class light and third generation 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.239
 while regarding the version 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:25.370
 of android is a 4.2 jelly bean version 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:30.000
 again while the processor is 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.850
 consisting of eight individual single GPUs 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.840
 from 127 rpm that if above all we find 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.489
 the gpu mali 450 sqm 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.720
 decidedly more suitable for the game 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:45.359
 compared to the one we found on 65 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.319
 89 which we have come to know 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.319
 we remind you that 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:59.560
 the battery I'm taking this 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:04.040
 moment is 2400 mm ram 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.930
 strange because if we go to see the 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.700
 technical features between movements 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.860
 we would have expected something more but 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.530
 also in this case it is better to see then 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.630
 the one that objectively the estate is the 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.540
 battery life 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:22.310
 probably shouldn't be loaded 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.280
 but at least we realize the weight i 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.560
 are only millimeters thick 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.010
 9.2 and in particular we note this 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.730
 shape a little particular you are waiting for that ve 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.730
 I show it better 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:46.449
 here we find lost micro usb 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:50.349
 the side speaker instead the 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:56.580
 volume adjustment with the button 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:56.580
 the metal house looks like plastic 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:03.629
 3.5mm jack speaker for audio 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:05.830
 dedicated key for the camera 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:10.680
 important addition to the models 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.680
 previous power button 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:17.379
 here we find the camera of course 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:22.360
 front with the various sensors of 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:26.710
 proximity and brightness we move a 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.810
 moment the terminal that must be 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:37.330
 loaded into the sales box what 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:40.449
 we find micro usb cable in earphones e 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.539
 obviously a reviewer says a box 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.060
 which represents the standard with then the 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:51.659
 24 month warranty and brand 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:55.060
 Italian directly from como and a mini 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:56.499
 guide in which we thank we say from 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.800
 part of como regarding the 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:01.389
 warranty assistance in Italy 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.979
 very short then this unboxing vi 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.909
 look forward to the full review 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.909
