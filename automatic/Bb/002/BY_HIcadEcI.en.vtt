we came up with two individual caps that

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.970 
we came up with two individual caps that
snap<00:03:18.790> into<00:03:19.000> place<00:03:19.239> with<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.139> caps<00:03:20.380> on<00:03:20.709> it

the vehicle the top looks great the car

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.509 
the vehicle the top looks great the car
looks<00:03:28.209> great<00:03:28.359> so<00:03:28.989> I'm<00:03:29.319> excited<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.920> see<00:03:30.160> that

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
looks great so I'm excited to see that
