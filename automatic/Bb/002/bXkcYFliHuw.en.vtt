00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.229
 I greet you and you again, Alexander 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.020
 ippolit and in this tutorial I will show how 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:12.140
 tune your camera for 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.360
 getting great shots with a machine gun and 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.689
 we will not be trusted anymore as she is not 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.599
 can understand your idea he shoots like 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.699
 like him ninety-five percent 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:26.300
 all great photos 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.720
 done in just two shooting modes about 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.220
 I will tell you more about them now 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.310
 sunny day and I decided to remove the bush 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.350
 blooming cherry set on camera 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.920
 automatic mode would do 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.590
 many 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.540
 and in the end got this mess from 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.500
 colors 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.320
 notice that this photo is really 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.140
 looks like some kind of mess to everything 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.030
 guilt machine he chooses how he 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.700
 enter any parameters 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.730
 here the machine closed the diaphragm to 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.790
 f-16 and a get short 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.860
 Exposure is sufficient for shooting with hands in 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.360
 In this case, it is 1 160 seconds 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.760
 increased from and that is 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.820
 sensitivity up to 1000 units and 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.010
 it is a bright sunny day to smell 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.140
 a little insanity on a bright day always 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:20.180
 Use of and they are more than 400 units 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.550
 that the photo came out interesting to us all 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.790
 just need to highlight one branch of cherry on 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.820
 against the background of others for this we will do the following 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.870
 we set the priority mode 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.799
 aperture 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.960
 and in or on some cameras and in this 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.380
 mode, we can select the aperture and 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.210
 the camera will select the shutter speed itself and so 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.820
 the depth of field lesson you caught 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.820
 that the wider the aperture is open the more 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.100
 shallow depth of field, and so we get 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.460
 use this to start i 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.190
 slightly open the diaphragm 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.610
 the values ​​of f10 and here we are 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.350
 We already get as we see the background, that is 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.439
 rear branches started a little bit 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.720
 blur and with a and in this case i 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.289
 entrusted automation and she removed the value 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.990
 400 which is basically tolerable now and i 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.700
 I will open the diaphragm even wider and install 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.239
 iso 100 units 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:22.519
 its what we already get at the diaphragm 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:24.800
 5.6 set the shutter speed to 1,200 seconds 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.780
 and finally i will take another frame with 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.650
 aperture f 4 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.260
 and here the camera has already set shutter speed 1 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.450
 250 seconds so we see on this 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.910
 photos branch separated from the background and 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.000
 already looks much more beautiful and much 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.250
 more interesting as you can see using these 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.799
 simple techniques for using manual 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.580
 settings can be achieved much more 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.290
 interesting results than on the machine 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.470
 camera output can be trusted to select 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.190
 just one of the parameters is not always in 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.500
 in this case 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.880
 the cameras picked me up for exposure and in some places 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.670
 iso to my 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.940
 aperture but don't let and choose for 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.549
 take you all the shooting options 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.700
 the next example is these two baby pictures 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.590
 I did on the machine here automatic 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.140
 coped well with the installation 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.510
 correct exposure shot consecrated 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.880
 good but she didn't cope with my 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.269
 Zadumka chamber covering diaphragm to 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.239
 values ​​of 71 and a lot of space in the frame 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.480
 turned out to be sharp which is not entirely appropriate in 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.989
 in this case also pay 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.109
 attention, these pictures and I did as 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:40.510
 would make them 99 percent beginners 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:42.799
 photographers that is standing out of eye level 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.690
 remove children from their level 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.180
 don't be lazy to squat or on 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.139
 knees and you get much more 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.660
 interesting pictures and so want to separate 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.440
 baby from the background for this i turn on 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.859
 mode a to 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.790
 and open the diaphragm wider in my case 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:04.910
 this is f4 and we get such much 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.099
 more interesting pictures and here I was shooting 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.730
 squatting ie from level 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.609
 child to depth of field was 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.940
 Minimum and I shot at the maximum 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.389
 zoom 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.959
 i.e. maximum focal length 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:23.150
 in my case it's 105 millimeters 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.640
 compare these two frames they are made with 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.260
 completely the same settings well on 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.420
 first frame I came up 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.150
 closer and took the child to the focal 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.270
 a distance of 23 millimeter on the second 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.670
 the picture I moved away zoom in and out 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.560
 shot at focal length 105 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.140
 millimeters 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.700
 the difference in depth of field is obvious 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.980
 so shoot at small focal 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.020
 distances and that is on a small zoom 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.180
 when you need to put more 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.610
 objects in the frame and vice versa 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.100
 and if you want to focus on 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.580
 the subject is shooting at large 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.750
 focal lengths also notice 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.550
 in the second picture 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:07.940
 proved closer bushes and the fence is the effect 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.670
 compression of the space when shooting zoom but 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.190
 that 's another story 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.980
 so consider the following example this 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.140
 wide angle photography for 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.480
 getting a beautiful landscape the other way around 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.980
 you need to cover the diaphragm to 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.100
 maximum number of parts 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.850
 was sharp use the diaphragm and not 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.510
 less than 7 so proceed to the next 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.810
 for example 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.370
 and here I'll show you how the next one works. 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.730
 tv mode or 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.890
 with this is the priority mode of exposure in this 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.830
 mode we choose the shutter speed well, 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.990
 aperture the camera adjusts itself to 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.290
 In this example, I decided to shoot here 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.570
 such a man-made waterfall was filmed 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.000
 in the afternoon the day was with 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.410
 variable cloud cover 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.590
 With this mode, I can 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.420
 freeze the water for this I just 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.180
 you need to set a short shutter speed 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.660
 one excerpt was used here 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.930
 thousandths of a second and the camera responds to 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.950
 this shutter speed opened the aperture to 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:14.750
 f-35 and lifted up to 800 units 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.060
 as we see the photo turned out a little 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.160
 boringly similar photos will be 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.280
 look much better and if we 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.730
 show the movement of water in the frame for this 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.560
 you need to increase the exposure time to 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:31.460
 it was clearer I will do it 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.940
 gradually it is to increase the shutter speed 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.940
 twice 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.220
 i.e. 1,500 seconds to nothing 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.610
 led memorize the motion in the frame will 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:45.740
 manifest at shutter speeds longer than 1 60 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:47.990
 seconds so I immediately put one 30 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:51.170
 in a second here it is already clear that the water 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.960
 starts to get a little viscous in 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:58.070
 In this case, the camera covered the diaphragm 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:00.800
 to the value of f7 and one of a this time I 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.870
 took over and put 100 units 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.360
 the next frame and i did the shutter speed 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:08.720
 one fifth of a second covered the camera 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.420
 aperture right up to f-18 but we already see 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.990
 good water movement and finally i did 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:17.960
 one more frame set shutter speed 1,3 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:21.050
 the camera's seconds closed as close as possible 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.000
 aperture up to f 29 is pretty 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.760
 extreme aperture but to 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.700
 line up the camera 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.330
 there was no other choice and here we are already 

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.340
 we have excellent water dynamics in the frame 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:36.950
 generally for long exposure 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.960
 day use special shading 

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.120
 filters so as not to close the diaphragm so 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.260
 Extremely but this again completely 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.260
 other story
