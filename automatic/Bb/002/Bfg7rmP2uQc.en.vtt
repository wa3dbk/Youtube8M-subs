00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
and easy to use but really for me the

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.590 
and easy to use but really for me the
biggest<00:01:51.579> difference<00:01:51.820> with<00:01:52.210> this<00:01:52.360> car

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
biggest difference with this car

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.539 
biggest difference with this car
compared<00:01:52.899> to<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.079> old<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:53.320> is<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.979> increase

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
compared to the old on is the increase

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.960 
compared to the old on is the increase
in<00:01:54.729> interior<00:01:55.479> quality<00:01:56.320> because<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:57.610> feels

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
in interior quality because it feels

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.420 
in interior quality because it feels
much<00:01:58.210> better<00:01:58.390> built<00:01:58.720> and<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.170> design<00:01:59.530> is<00:02:00.189> also

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
much better built and the design is also

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.780 
much better built and the design is also
nicer<00:02:00.759> too

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.590 

however<00:02:58.200> as<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:59.070> before<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.700> BMW<00:03:00.180> wants<00:03:00.480> who

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
however as like before the BMW wants who

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.449 
however as like before the BMW wants who
is<00:03:00.720> his<00:03:00.840> key<00:03:01.230> selling<00:03:01.500> point<00:03:01.830> is<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.250> fact

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
is his key selling point is the fact

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.520 
is his key selling point is the fact
that<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.940> only<00:03:02.970> car<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:03.480> size<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:04.080> is

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
that it's the only car this size that is

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.400 
that it's the only car this size that is
rear-wheel<00:03:04.950> drive<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.330> plus<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.900> low

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
rear-wheel drive and this plus the low

slung driving position and the very

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.360 
slung driving position and the very
responsive<00:03:09.630> steering<00:03:09.959> means<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.160> it

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
responsive steering means that it

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.890 
responsive steering means that it
effectively<00:03:11.790> feels<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.269> sports<00:03:12.720> car

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
however unlike the old car this new one

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.560 
however unlike the old car this new one
feels<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:17.040> lot<00:03:17.160> more<00:03:17.220> comfortable<00:03:17.850> over<00:03:18.120> bumps

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570

feels a lot more comfortable over bumps
in<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.720> road<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.230> it's<00:03:19.530> quieter<00:03:20.070> too<00:03:20.250> that

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.360 

the<00:03:48.720> biggest<00:03:48.930> problem<00:03:49.410> with<00:03:49.620> any<00:03:49.770> one<00:03:49.980> service

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
the biggest problem with any one service

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.400 
the biggest problem with any one service
though<00:03:50.550> is<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.940> there's<00:03:51.120> still<00:03:51.420> not<00:03:52.290> that

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
though is that there's still not that

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.850 
though is that there's still not that
much<00:03:52.530> room<00:03:52.770> in<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:53.640> back

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
much room in the back

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.500 
much room in the back
the<00:03:55.860> starters<00:03:56.340> being<00:03:56.910> rear-wheel<00:03:57.480> drive

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
the starters being rear-wheel drive

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.130 
the starters being rear-wheel drive
means<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.320> get<00:03:58.500> this<00:03:58.650> rather<00:03:59.250> annoying

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
means that you get this rather annoying

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.820 
means that you get this rather annoying
transmission<00:04:01.140> turn<00:04:01.320> which<00:04:01.500> pretty<00:04:01.710> much

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
transmission turn which pretty much

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.040 
transmission turn which pretty much
renders<00:04:02.250> this<00:04:02.340> central<00:04:02.760> seat<00:04:02.970> as<00:04:03.209> redundant

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
renders this central seat as redundant

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.660 
renders this central seat as redundant
now<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.320> have<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.530> admit<00:04:04.770> it<00:04:05.280> does<00:04:05.459> feel<00:04:05.640> more

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
now I have to admit it does feel more

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.610 
now I have to admit it does feel more
roomy<00:04:06.360> in<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.480> back<00:04:06.690> than<00:04:06.959> in<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.170> old<00:04:07.320> one

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.650 
roomy in the back than in the old one
series<00:04:07.980> but<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:08.459> still<00:04:08.730> not<00:04:08.940> great<00:04:09.390> if<00:04:09.600> you

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
series but it's still not great if you

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.330 
series but it's still not great if you
notice<00:04:09.990> knee<00:04:10.230> room<00:04:10.410> it's<00:04:10.920> not<00:04:10.950> really<00:04:11.220> any

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340
