00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.870
 hi everyone today I'm going to make you a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.180
 chicken broaster for this we need 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.209
 chicken here I already have chicken prey 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.600
 already cooked previously because I do not 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.970
 like to leave them uncooked because then 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.390
 when frying those that were raw inside 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.199
 and that's like I do not like it very much 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.720
 the chicken prey then we have bread 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.239
 a durao bread zest 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.050
 previously I put a little bit of 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.059
 salt and pepper here we have flour like that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.260
 also with a little salt and pepper 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.180
 and here we have the beaten egg after 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.239
 this once the chicken is already 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:54.620
 cooked we passed the bread for the flour 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.140
 we 're going to go through the flour 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.290
 so in the way 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.010
 to mix everything with the flour truth 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.010
 A) Yes 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.200
 and then we had it 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.200
 for the beaten egg 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.470
 so also that everything is mixed with him 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.780
 with the beaten egg and finally what 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.780
 we went on the hard shovel 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.900
 in the hard corduroy and so we do all the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.080
 chicken prey until they can carry 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.710
 to a pot with enough oil to 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.710
 that remain 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.320
 well fried, we really do it well 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.040
 fries that are very crispy 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.250
 golden 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.900
 we can accompany these potatoes 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.410
 to be with chips a salad 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.080

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.860
 and some potato chips 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.590
 something delicious fast that does not take you 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.080
 a lot of time in preparing it we are 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.440
 watching us in a little bit to make you laugh 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.460
 the chickens here I have the cut potatoes 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:02.890
 in little squares little fingers 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:06.390
 Thick and thick fingers 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.390
 and here and I'm living 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.519
 to become aware also 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.549
 potatoes to be crispy here 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.159
 I have the chicken already ready off with the 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.080
 flour in the new hard corduroy and is 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.010
 waiting their turn to go next door to 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.510
 tate 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.340
 look, I already have the chicken in 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.780
 enough oil like a chicken is already 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.780
 cooked you need it 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.560
 we will always be on paper because 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.460
 goes for alcohol and not for example true 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.460
 so 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.570
 we go to it and we take out because it is already 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.960
 ready and in dollars winds stick you 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.960
 we take out 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.420
 for this 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.330
 only the last one there was you 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.830
 writing for you to see as you already 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.260
 is cooked with more violence since 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.910
 then you do not need to have it very well 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.700
 with the oil because it is already cooked 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.470
 commented then the only thing that touches us 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.330
 to do is to get with a client 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.330
 can nothing else 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.169
 here is the salad that I told you 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.770
 a moment ago that has tomato that I'm going 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:37.660
 to do it 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:40.570
 pepper, chopped celery, very small 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.840
 the vinegar a little bit the same juice 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:47.110
 lemon a little bit of salt and oil 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.650
 very rich olive this super healthy salad 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.080
 natural to accompany the chicken that goes to 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.820
 fried then not because of the fat then 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.670
 we can not put so many things 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.520
 fried and this recipe is like for 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.040
 do it from time to time not always for 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.280
 the fat that the chicken has when frying is 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.860
 just like the farc 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.040
 and so we have the chicken broaster ready 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:16.230
 with the chips and salads that I 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.960
 it looks like a very rich dish quickie 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.050

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.180
