which is an upcoming tablet from Samsung

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.200 
which is an upcoming tablet from Samsung
it's<00:00:13.679> part<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.070> their<00:00:14.190> note<00:00:14.519> series<00:00:14.849> which

it's part of their note series which

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.029 
it's part of their note series which
means<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.630> get<00:00:15.839> all<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.289> those<00:00:16.440> note

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
means you get all of those note

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.370 
means you get all of those note
optimized<00:00:17.760> features<00:00:18.300> things<00:00:18.990> like<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
optimized features things like the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.679 
optimized features things like the
included<00:00:19.920> stylus<00:00:20.550> or<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.000> whatever<00:00:21.420> it's

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
included stylus or the whatever it's

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.779 
included stylus or the whatever it's
called<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.020> S<00:00:22.140> Pen<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.769> think<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.550> Samsung

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
called the S Pen I think is what Samsung

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.300 
called the S Pen I think is what Samsung
likes<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.359> call<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> stylus<00:00:25.019> as<00:00:25.170> well<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
likes to call a stylus as well as the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.970 
likes to call a stylus as well as the
full<00:00:26.490> digitizer<00:00:27.119> built<00:00:27.539> into<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.260> display

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
full digitizer built into the display

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.740 
full digitizer built into the display
itself<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.699> that's<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.119> be<00:00:30.210> extremely

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
itself so that's going to be extremely

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.749 
itself so that's going to be extremely
useful<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:31.619> users<00:00:31.769> who<00:00:31.949> want<00:00:32.219> more<00:00:32.520> than<00:00:32.730> just

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
useful for users who want more than just

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.420 
useful for users who want more than just
the<00:00:33.149> on/off<00:00:34.140> functionality<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.250> get

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
the on/off functionality that you get

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.799 
the on/off functionality that you get
with<00:00:35.579> most<00:00:35.969> touchscreens

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
with most touchscreens

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.810 
with most touchscreens
so<00:00:37.170> instead<00:00:37.530> you're<00:00:37.800> actually<00:00:38.129> able<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.399> apply

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
so instead you're actually able to apply

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.150 
so instead you're actually able to apply
distinctly<00:00:39.780> different<00:00:40.140> amounts<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.860> pressure

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
distinctly different amounts of pressure

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.639 
distinctly different amounts of pressure
so<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:41.700> great<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:41.940> for<00:00:42.899> sketching<00:00:43.350> for

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
so it's great for for sketching for

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.190 
so it's great for for sketching for
things<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.510> what<00:00:45.510> else<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.780> think<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.989> gave<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
things like what else I think I gave a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.450 
things like what else I think I gave a
couple<00:00:46.410> examples<00:00:46.980> when<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.129> did<00:00:47.340> this

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
couple examples when I did this

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.770 
couple examples when I did this
rehearsal<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.090> can't<00:00:48.300> remember<00:00:48.450> any<00:00:48.719> of

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
rehearsal but I can't remember any of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.720 
rehearsal but I can't remember any of
them<00:00:48.899> now<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.469> point<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> want

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
them now the point is that if you want

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.220 
them now the point is that if you want
to<00:00:50.789> draw<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.239> your<00:00:51.390> tablet<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.930> want<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
to draw on your tablet if you want it to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.529 
to draw on your tablet if you want it to
be<00:00:52.320> useful<00:00:52.440> for<00:00:52.800> more<00:00:53.129> than<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.969> for<00:00:54.120> artists

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
be useful for more than just for artists

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.760 
be useful for more than just for artists
you<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:54.870> you're<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.379> want<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
you know if you're on the go you want to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.500 
you know if you're on the go you want to
draw<00:00:56.370> something<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.030> want<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> actually

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
draw something and you want to actually

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.060 
draw something and you want to actually
move<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.750> over<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.079> computer<00:00:58.379> later<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.859> know

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
move that over to computer later I know

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.090 
move that over to computer later I know
for<00:00:59.489> example<00:00:59.520> here<00:01:00.210> at<00:01:00.329> tech<00:01:01.079> tips<00:01:01.320> we'd<00:01:01.800> love

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
for example here at tech tips we'd love

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.770 
for example here at tech tips we'd love
to<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> tablet<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.239> digitizer

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
to have a tablet with the digitizer

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.660 
to have a tablet with the digitizer
because<00:01:04.290> when<00:01:04.920> we're<00:01:05.040> doing<00:01:05.280> things<00:01:05.519> like

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
because when we're doing things like

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.370 
because when we're doing things like
storyboarding<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.750> episodes

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
storyboarding for episodes

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.080 
storyboarding for episodes
it'd<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.770> great<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.189> able<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.430> draw<00:01:09.060> on

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it'd be great to be able to draw on

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.730 
it'd be great to be able to draw on
something<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.840> looks<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.260> little<00:01:10.380> bit<00:01:10.590> more

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
something that looks a little bit more

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.980 
something that looks a little bit more
sophisticated<00:01:11.400> than<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.850> lines<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.600> terms

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
sophisticated than just lines in terms

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.149 
sophisticated than just lines in terms
of<00:01:13.170> performance<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.830> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
of performance it's going to have a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.640 
of performance it's going to have a
quad-core<00:01:14.460> a9<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.479> an<00:01:15.659> 8-inch<00:01:16.020> tablet<00:01:16.470> so

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
quad-core a9 it's an 8-inch tablet so

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.550 
quad-core a9 it's an 8-inch tablet so
you've<00:01:16.799> got<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.310> 1280<00:01:17.850> by<00:01:18.090> 800<00:01:18.360> resolution<00:01:19.110> so

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
you've got a 1280 by 800 resolution so

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.390 
you've got a 1280 by 800 resolution so
you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.860> watch<00:01:20.509> 720p<00:01:21.509> HD<00:01:21.869> content<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.619> its<00:01:23.009> at

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
you can watch 720p HD content in its at

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.399 
you can watch 720p HD content in its at
native<00:01:23.729> resolution<00:01:24.299> but<00:01:24.479> 1080p<00:01:24.960> content

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
native resolution but 1080p content

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.380 
native resolution but 1080p content
would<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.590> down<00:01:25.890> scaled<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.700> overall<00:01:27.030> look<00:01:27.240> at

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
would be down scaled the overall look at

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.240 
would be down scaled the overall look at
the<00:01:27.479> device<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.020> pretty<00:01:28.619> much<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.070> got<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the device is pretty much it's got a

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.800 
the device is pretty much it's got a
white<00:01:29.430> back<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.909> particular<00:01:30.420> one<00:01:30.630> although

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
white back this particular one although

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.080 
white back this particular one although
I<00:01:31.170> guess<00:01:31.439> actually<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.490> no<00:01:32.610> idea<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:32.970> it's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
I guess actually I have no idea if it's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.340 
I guess actually I have no idea if it's
gonna<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.360> available<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.810> different<00:01:33.840> colors

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
gonna be available in different colors

beautiful<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.690> mean<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.930> viewing<00:04:40.169> angles<00:04:40.470> are

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
beautiful I mean the viewing angles are

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.800 
beautiful I mean the viewing angles are
outstanding<00:04:40.979> and<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:42.210> other<00:04:42.360> thing<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.660> I

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
outstanding and the other thing that I

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.990 
outstanding and the other thing that I
missed<00:04:43.050> before<00:04:43.199> is<00:04:43.620> that<00:04:44.070> is<00:04:44.280> an<00:04:44.490> IR<00:04:44.820> emitter

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
missed before is that is an IR emitter

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.670 
missed before is that is an IR emitter
which<00:04:45.570> means<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:46.080> you<00:04:46.139> should<00:04:46.320> be<00:04:46.440> able<00:04:46.530> to

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
which means that you should be able to

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.140 
which means that you should be able to
use<00:04:46.889> this<00:04:47.070> as<00:04:47.250> a<00:04:47.280> universal<00:04:47.820> remote

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
use this as a universal remote

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.210 
use this as a universal remote
among<00:04:48.479> all<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.780> other<00:04:48.810> functionalities<00:04:49.650> that

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
among all the other functionalities that

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.920 
among all the other functionalities that
you<00:04:50.310> can<00:04:50.460> enable<00:04:50.639> with<00:04:50.910> an<00:04:51.000> IR<00:04:51.180> emitter<00:04:51.300> most

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
you can enable with an IR emitter most

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.919 
you can enable with an IR emitter most
of<00:04:52.080> which<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.380> universal<00:04:52.800> remote
