00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.670
 Final in the Regionalliga West the c-youth of the SG Wattenscheid 09 fights 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.510
 in the fifth league MSV Duisburg still in the league in the 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.029
 highest league 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.760
 but they are dependent on a slip-up of sports fans from Pomerania 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.880
 at the same time on the master large Dormund in only ten kilometers away 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.720
 Play heukamp 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.960
 The Zero Neoners come into play better initially put the opponent under pressure 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.740
 and playing aggressively forward so he could even get through a good ten minutes 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.620
 Clemens GR Ing Hamm indirect free kick from six yards with 1 0 in the lead 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.510
 go 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.620
 completely earned to date 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.450
 but at this time also led the Sportfreunde Hamborn with 1 to 0 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.860
 but now the player chose still pours into the depths where I was getting 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.230
 stronger they showed their playful class and resembled by the msv player 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.240
 Themes not five minutes later 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.770
 good news against from Hamborn the BVB plays likewise missing now 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.770
 Dehner Neuner only a separate goal to relegation 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.290
 black and white was willing to redefine this game but it was 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.200
 the hosts of the MSV who made that happen 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.240
 after just under 20 minutes also earned the lead went 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.680
 the team around Bloom with a counterattack to 2 2 1 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.420
 bitter for only 9 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.650
 until the break, the game rippled and it stayed at 2 2 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.650
 1 for the MSV breaks through 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.470
 for this, everything is going according to plan of the masters from Dortmund before 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.400
 the break with the 2 2 1 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.370
 and in the second half they could even increase the score to 6 to 1 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.560
 so the way was clear for the dream of the league of the Wattenscheider 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.229
 but the game had to be shot at the SV 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.649
 logically, it was the only new ones that increased the pace and in which I am there 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:18.759
 put more and more pressure 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.169
 You can tell the guys to want to go down today by no means 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:28.499
 and so they also made some good choices and one 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:33.919
 Manuel Schiebener used this to 2 2 compensation Giesenfreude the team around 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.919
 Coach Chris today 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.799
 but that was not enough for a goal does not have to achieve black and white food 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.559
 and so the boys continue to fight for survival in the Regionalliga 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:51.499
 and in fact ten minutes from time Dejagah Plan almost gets it 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.509
 Impossible the all-important three to two for Wattenscheid 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.519
 now it's time to keep your nerve and save the victory over time 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.170
 The proverbs here do not show any nakedness and braced themselves against the 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:09.719
 threatening defeat 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.699
 until the pain is scanned, we're only going to continue with nines and that 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.349
 Success after the redeeming final whistle 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.260
 as for guys their emotions 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.669
 a room and celebrated extensively the league 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.880
 With 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.280
 Coach Chris Mulzer congratulated his team following the 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.250
 celebrations 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.969
 for the almost impossible 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:58.079
 after the draw in Hamburg should be about 8 points behind 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.119
 they had not put a chanterelle on them 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:02.480
 but the team spirit 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.779
 It was true and the troupe was loud 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.789
