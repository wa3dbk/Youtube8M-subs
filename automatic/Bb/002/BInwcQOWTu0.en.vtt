which<00:03:52.700> was<00:03:52.820> a<00:03:52.880> huge<00:03:53.120> change<00:03:53.390> from<00:03:53.870> my

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
which was a huge change from my

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.259 
which was a huge change from my
lifestyle<00:03:55.010> before<00:03:55.160> where<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:55.730> was<00:03:55.940> running

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
around all the time so it was actually

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.090 
around all the time so it was actually
nice<00:03:59.299> to<00:03:59.570> get<00:03:59.750> some<00:04:00.350> rest<00:04:00.560> for<00:04:00.920> once<00:04:02.470> but<00:04:03.470> now
