00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.870
 of the total number of vehicles that were in Africa 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.550
 since he does not stay 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.539
 the largest store in the optics of southern brazil 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.269
 questions about how the contest closes tomorrow 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.650
 it takes attitude 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.180
 then the patio that is technical in a land exchange that also with today 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.340
 It is also technical and 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.279
 months 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.800
 will talk about the step 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.579
 and other important tips for the pathetic thank you very much 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.390
 At first we are going to talk about the reef saying this way is not this 

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:34.280
 well balanced is exactly the same as the high moral period if you have not 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.730
 well balanced does not work right so you see I have a propeller that 

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:43.500
 come to fix it is totally damaged she got black the land 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.100
 engine is turned to the rear. 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.330
 that was already wrapped up looked like this 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.390
 then you will see well since he has and we love clicking here, by the way. 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.540
 is the right name the club that is that the more you return to the oven but not 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.590
 quick the boat and temper then reported well told me even more you 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.450
 should wax beja midfielder and tell you if you should quit mc 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.649
 beautiful gets the lesson that you will not happen automatically the engine 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.630
 power that you have with the fuel name another detail all 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.340
 parties should be with equal I say left and balanced exactly equal to one 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.910
 so comfortable period 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.550
 if you do not balance see the ipi context of the whole car 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.500
 milestone on the same thing does not change anything this is an aluminum herbicide now for 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.270
 motors of more power marjah we leave port lc of stainless steel 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.160
 this is the one that was repaired by the square so she hit a stone I 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.890
 I think roma paper with the cpi left it ready, it's already forbidden already 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.070
 with the right field she is already with all peace baishi balanced this is 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.850
 a propeller of notes on day 11 always high performance is for big engines 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.560
 there are also 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.030
 the four legs 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.490
 well I always start from the next principle too if the stb is too 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.180
 damaged sometimes it pays to buy a new one but is usually repaired and 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.890
 this repair comes out much cheaper than buying a new one and just like prass said 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.520
 with r7 is of fundamental importance so that you have nothing to do with 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.130
 security and tranquility that the entity results in the torture of the 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.590
 difference in navigation may even harm the port beyond giving 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.740
 after the Senate fisheries on the subject 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.020
 and I also had it here. 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.240
 for those who do not have to lose if they do not have the redeemer 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.349
 a monetary policy scene 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.939
 just access another 40 because it has name is called against the victory and this 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.700
 culture that does not let enter the box the promoter box 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.700
 is automatically performing preventive maintenance 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:56.699
 will understand 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.409
 from the beginning said 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.409
 in certain states 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:04.339
 the other half 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:08.169
 always going to put the small one but as you will never step on the floor at 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:09.889
 memory reconstruction 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.759
 One more tip Penalty Penalty on the phone Address for anyone who wants to know 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.659
 more or will compensate 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.040
 in terms of imports only a contraction of 3 3 2 98 8 3 1 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.510
 I believe the 71 problem deliverance 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.319
 and if you have some time 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.579
 Come here. I'm trying to get to know you. I'll explain. 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:31.799
 you, what I can 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.669
 and we can exchange networks to take all your doubts this will not 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:36.839
 cost nothing 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:40.930
 this is it here comes to resume dynamic fishing recommended only time 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.260
 but the one recommended by psdb that would come from psd in the technical commission a 'workshop 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.670
 political confidence and now I can go back with the fishery and bet 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.670
 we are going to talk about another very important subject of zÃ© dirceu 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.960
 step today to leave in this extreme case of 24 know that the fans 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.180
 do not notice anything 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.309
 Let's go fishing. 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:04.319
 and thus end the program on another case in Libya months
