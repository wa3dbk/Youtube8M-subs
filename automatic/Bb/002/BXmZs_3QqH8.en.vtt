00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
hands on one and I've to say it's one of

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.390 
hands on one and I've to say it's one of
the<00:00:12.599> most<00:00:12.719> impressive<00:00:13.080> cases<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:14.070> I've<00:00:14.160> had

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
the most impressive cases that I've had

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.599 
the most impressive cases that I've had
chance<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.759> review<00:00:15.179> for<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.870> galaxy<00:00:16.260> s4<00:00:16.609> now

chance to review for the galaxy s4 now

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.150 
chance to review for the galaxy s4 now
this<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.449> one<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.720> slimmest<00:00:19.140> cases<00:00:19.650> that

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
this is one of the slimmest cases that

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.830 
this is one of the slimmest cases that
I've<00:00:20.310> seen<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.880> s4<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.270> combines

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
I've seen for the s4 that combines

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.349 
I've seen for the s4 that combines
excellent<00:00:22.800> protection<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> slim

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
excellent protection with the slim

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.050 
excellent protection with the slim
design<00:00:25.099> you<00:00:26.099> can<00:00:26.220> see<00:00:26.340> from<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.670> angle<00:00:26.760> then

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
design you can see from that angle then

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.269 
design you can see from that angle then
just<00:00:27.359> how<00:00:27.480> thin<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.650> what<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.920> does<00:00:29.099> is

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
just how thin it was and what it does is

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.269 
just how thin it was and what it does is
it<00:00:29.400> combines<00:00:29.580> two<00:00:30.300> layers<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.900> much<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
it combines two layers so much like the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.979 
it combines two layers so much like the
OtterBox<00:00:32.610> Commuter<00:00:32.759> or<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> incipio<00:00:33.719> jewel

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
OtterBox Commuter or the incipio jewel

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.420 
OtterBox Commuter or the incipio jewel
pro<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> number<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.829> other<00:00:34.980> cases<00:00:35.160> that

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
pro or a number of other cases that

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.670 
pro or a number of other cases that
combine<00:00:36.210> two<00:00:36.420> layers<00:00:36.660> what<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.350> does<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.559> it

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
combine two layers what it does is it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.770 
combine two layers what it does is it
keeps<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.129> extremely<00:00:38.910> slim<00:00:39.149> at<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.300> same<00:00:39.480> time

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
keeps it extremely slim at the same time

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.170 
keeps it extremely slim at the same time
so<00:00:40.469> you've<00:00:40.590> got<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.829> durable<00:00:41.280> TPU<00:00:41.760> layer

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
so you've got this durable TPU layer

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.610 
so you've got this durable TPU layer
there<00:00:42.420> that's<00:00:42.930> got<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> matte<00:00:43.350> black<00:00:43.559> finish

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
there that's got a matte black finish

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.560 
there that's got a matte black finish
which<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:45.030> does<00:00:45.210> look<00:00:45.390> really

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
which is it does look really

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.380 
which is it does look really
high-quality<00:00:45.920> being<00:00:46.920> honest<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:48.239> will

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
high-quality being honest and that will

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.090 
high-quality being honest and that will
help<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.899> absorb<00:00:48.989> all<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> shocks<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.010> are

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
help to absorb all the shocks that are

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.830 
help to absorb all the shocks that are
thrown<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.550> phone<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.059> then<00:00:51.719> you've

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
thrown at your phone and then you've

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.450 
thrown at your phone and then you've
just<00:00:52.020> got<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> bumper<00:00:52.620> lighter<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.039> rather<00:00:53.250> than

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
just got a bumper lighter so rather than

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.180 
just got a bumper lighter so rather than
covering<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.910> back<00:00:54.120> adding<00:00:54.570> extra<00:00:54.899> thickness

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
covering the back adding extra thickness

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.400 
covering the back adding extra thickness
it<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.610> covers<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.239> edges<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.930> corners<00:00:58.320> of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
it just covers the edges and corners of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.720 
it just covers the edges and corners of
your<00:00:58.500> phone<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.039> whilst<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.399> not<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.670> to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
your phone so whilst it's not going to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.000 
your phone so whilst it's not going to
give<00:00:59.910> maximum<00:01:00.780> protection<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> back<00:01:01.289> this

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
give maximum protection on the back this

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.009 
give maximum protection on the back this
can<00:01:02.280> still<00:01:02.550> absorb<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.059> shocks<00:01:03.329> scratches

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
can still absorb the shocks scratches

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.810 
can still absorb the shocks scratches
and<00:01:04.140> scrapes<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.680> then<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.220> will<00:01:05.430> double<00:01:05.580> up

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and scrapes and then this will double up

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.580 
and scrapes and then this will double up
on<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.060> most<00:01:06.270> important<00:01:06.780> parts<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.380> phone

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
on the most important parts of the phone

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.789 
on the most important parts of the phone
now<00:01:08.580> you're<00:01:08.729> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.000> need<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.810> apply<00:01:10.049> this

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
now you're going to need to apply this

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.200 
now you're going to need to apply this
back<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.430> can't<00:01:11.670> apply<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.090> two

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
back on you can't apply it in two

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.280 
back on you can't apply it in two
separate<00:01:12.600> layers<00:01:13.490> but<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.479> they

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
separate layers but as you can see they

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.800 
separate layers but as you can see they
go<00:01:16.470> really<00:01:16.650> well<00:01:16.920> together<00:01:17.570> connecting<00:01:18.570> in

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
go really well together connecting in

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.280 
go really well together connecting in
numerous<00:01:19.320> places<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:20.100> ensure<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.400> they<00:01:20.759> are

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
numerous places to ensure that they are

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.950 
numerous places to ensure that they are
fit<00:01:22.290> tightly<00:01:22.590> together<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.720> then<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.869> just

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
fit tightly together and then it's just

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.550 
fit tightly together and then it's just
a<00:01:25.080> case<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.790> applying<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.970> around<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> case

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
a case of applying it around the case

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.530 
a case of applying it around the case
there<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> phone<00:01:28.920> sorry<00:01:29.220> now<00:01:29.790> I've<00:01:29.939> got<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.240 
speeding glass screen protector as well
on<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.740> see<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.100> works

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
on here so you can see that it works

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.039 
on here so you can see that it works
perfectly<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.880> you've<00:01:36.600> got<00:01:36.720> small

perfectly with that you've got small

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.660 
perfectly with that you've got small
ridges<00:01:37.320> around<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.710> edge<00:01:37.799> incredibly<00:01:38.430> small

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670

Ridge<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> were<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.930> drop<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.200> facedown

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
Ridge so if you were to drop it facedown

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.399 
Ridge so if you were to drop it facedown
you<00:01:40.860> might<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.880> good<00:01:42.210> stead<00:01:42.509> should<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
you might be in good stead should it

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.350 
you might be in good stead should it
damage<00:01:43.890> your<00:01:44.040> screen<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.729> should<00:01:44.939> stop<00:01:45.210> it

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
damage your screen or it should stop it

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.060 
damage your screen or it should stop it

from damaging your screen you've got

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.410 
from damaging your screen you've got
cutouts<00:01:47.460> for<00:01:47.640> all<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.060> ports<00:01:48.360> and

cutouts for all of the ports and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
features I'm hoping you can see just how

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.399

slim<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> case<00:01:51.090> actually<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.630> from<00:01:52.259> that

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409

slim the case actually is from that
camera<00:01:52.860> cutout<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.490> adding<00:01:53.759> hardly<00:01:54.090> any

book<00:01:54.649> as<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.680> say<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
book as I say this is one of the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.120 
book as I say this is one of the
slimmest<00:01:56.909> cases<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.450> will<00:01:57.570> find<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> s4

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
slimmest cases you will find for the s4

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.289 
slimmest cases you will find for the s4
that<00:01:59.310> adds<00:01:59.460> good<00:01:59.700> protection

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
that adds good protection

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.330 
that adds good protection

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
too overbearing with that and as I say

if<00:02:17.520> you're<00:02:17.580> looking<00:02:17.640> for<00:02:17.940> maximum<00:02:18.300> protection

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
on the back this isn't going to cut it

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.980 
on the back this isn't going to cut it
but<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.210> going<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.390> give<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.750> lot<00:02:21.930> more

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
but it is going to give a lot more

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.380 
but it is going to give a lot more
protection<00:02:22.650> than<00:02:22.800> 90%<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.880> cases<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.300> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
protection than 90% of the cases on the

protection than 90% of the cases on the
market<00:02:24.750> as<00:02:24.840> well<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:26.210> ultimately<00:02:27.210> this<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.720> one
