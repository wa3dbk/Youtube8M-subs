00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.680
 cydia 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.850

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.470
 sources 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.430

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.600
 That's the one we're going to 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.899
 to install once we have installed 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.899

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.730

 once we have it installed 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.510
 let's go back to sources 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.040
 to add a new one above 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:35.159

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.280
 and once you already have installed 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.400
 let's go in and let's find what 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:08.400
 is 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.230
