it's like here we are we're in an
environment<00:00:47.160> where<00:00:47.640> we've<00:00:47.820> come<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
sound coming from the other room can you

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.479 
sound coming from the other room can you
hear<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:53.820> scan<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
hear it for scan here so we have the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.099 
hear it for scan here so we have the
opportunity<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.120> focusing<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.780> what<00:00:57.989> we're

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
opportunity of focusing on what we're

opportunity of focusing on what we're
doing<00:00:58.140> or<00:00:59.030> focusing<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.390> they're<00:01:00.539> doing

doing or focusing on what they're doing
or<00:01:01.020> focusing<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> fact<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.280> can't

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
or focusing on the fact that we can't

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.770 
or focusing on the fact that we can't
really<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:03.000> we're<00:01:03.120> doing<00:01:03.149> as<00:01:03.480> well<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.690> we

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
really do what we're doing as well as we

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.149 
really do what we're doing as well as we
were<00:01:04.019> before<00:01:04.170> now<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.710> they're<00:01:04.830> doing<00:01:05.040> what

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
were before now that they're doing what

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.800 
were before now that they're doing what
they're<00:01:05.309> doing<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.970> other<00:01:06.090> words<00:01:06.270> there's<00:01:06.630> all

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
they're doing in other words there's all

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.480 
they're doing in other words there's all
kinds<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.229> combinations<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:08.040> things<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.430> we

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
kinds of combinations of things that we

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.640 
kinds of combinations of things that we
could<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> bottom<00:01:09.869> line<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.080> we

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
could do that but the bottom line is we

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.920 
could do that but the bottom line is we
can<00:01:10.799> make<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.130> best<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.580> what's<00:01:11.820> going<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.360> you

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
can make the best of what's going on you

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.899 
can make the best of what's going on you
can<00:01:13.080> make<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.680> that's<00:01:14.130> sort<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.580> where<00:01:14.790> you

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
can make and so that's sort of where you

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.789 
can make and so that's sort of where you
are<00:01:15.090> all<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.450> time<00:01:15.780> you're<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.650> position

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
are all the time you're in a position

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.830 
are all the time you're in a position
where<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.640> make<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.210> best<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.630> where

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
where you just make the best of where

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.630 
where you just make the best of where
you<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.740> look<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.430> positive

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you are you look for the positive

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.730 
you are you look for the positive
aspects<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.509> best<00:01:21.840> as<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.140> find<00:01:22.470> them

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
aspects as best as you can find them

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.620 
aspects as best as you can find them
leaned<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> direction<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.060> what<00:01:24.270> feels

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
leaned in the direction of what feels

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.469 
leaned in the direction of what feels
the<00:01:24.930> best<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:26.070> happens<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.210> just

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the best and what happens is you just

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.810 
the best and what happens is you just
keep<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.110> keep<00:01:28.290> reaching<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
keep as you keep reaching for the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.749 
keep as you keep reaching for the
thoughts<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.240> feel<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> best<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.759> we

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
thoughts that feel the best and and we

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.399 
thoughts that feel the best and and we
have<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> benefit<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.630> sort<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.990> getting<00:01:34.200> this

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
have the benefit of sort of getting this

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.810 
have the benefit of sort of getting this
off<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.860> running<00:01:35.070> before<00:01:35.310> any<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.729> that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
off and running before any of that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.810 
off and running before any of that
started<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:37.500> are<00:01:37.680> not<00:01:37.829> feeling<00:01:38.100> from

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
started and so we are not feeling from

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.789 
started and so we are not feeling from
you<00:01:39.030> any<00:01:39.360> diminishment<00:01:39.960> as<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> result<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.740> that

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
you any diminishment as a result of that

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.800 
you any diminishment as a result of that
because<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> trajectory<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.180> established

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
because the trajectory is established

sound up a little bit although we're not

wanting to interfere with them we want

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.840 
wanting to interfere with them we want
to<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.290> conservative<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:56.159> their<00:01:56.490> point<00:01:56.759> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
to be conservative of their point of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.999 
to be conservative of their point of

view we want to understand their point
of<00:01:59.159> view<00:01:59.219> we<00:01:59.759> don't<00:01:59.939> want<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.180> get<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.479> a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
of view we don't want to get in a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.420 
of view we don't want to get in a

tug-of-war with another point of view

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.580 
tug-of-war with another point of view
and<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.750> matter<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.409> is

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and so it's just a matter of this is

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.830 
and so it's just a matter of this is
sort<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.920> what<00:02:05.130> life<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.670> always<00:02:05.880> about<00:02:06.390> isn't

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
sort of what life is always about isn't

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.240 
sort of what life is always about isn't
it<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.380> when<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.099> realize<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.209> by<00:02:10.009> waking<00:02:11.009> up

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
it so when you realize that by waking up

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.970 
it so when you realize that by waking up
in<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.400> morning

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980

wrong here and I really liked knowing

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.280 
wrong here and I really liked knowing
the<00:02:39.190> power<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.640> focus<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:40.329> I<00:02:40.810> like

the power of focus and I like

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.530

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
and I realized that a lot that I've been

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.990 
and I realized that a lot that I've been
reaching<00:02:46.629> for<00:02:46.870> all<00:02:47.049> along<00:02:47.560> has<00:02:47.799> been<00:02:48.000> clarity

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
and I like finding the thought and

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.569 
and I like finding the thought and
following<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.150> out<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.780> I'd<00:02:52.959> like<00:02:53.200> being<00:02:53.890> so

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
following it out and I'd like being so

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.970 
following it out and I'd like being so
clear<00:02:54.940> minded<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.450> those<00:02:56.349> around<00:02:56.590> me<00:02:56.890> are

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
clear minded that those around me are

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.069 
clear minded that those around me are
feeling<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.549> clarity<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.090> what<00:02:58.180> I've<00:02:58.510> got

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
feeling the clarity of what I've got

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.500 
feeling the clarity of what I've got
going<00:02:59.109> on<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.890> I<00:03:00.129> realized<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.760> all<00:03:00.940> along

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
going on and I realized that all along

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.780 
going on and I realized that all along
anytime<00:03:02.200> I've<00:03:02.530> sort<00:03:02.739> of<00:03:02.769> lost<00:03:02.950> my<00:03:03.250> footing<00:03:03.519> it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
anytime I've sort of lost my footing it

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.059 
anytime I've sort of lost my footing it
was<00:03:04.090> because<00:03:04.390> I'd<00:03:04.599> lost<00:03:04.959> my<00:03:05.170> clarity<00:03:05.859> it<00:03:05.950> was

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
was because I'd lost my clarity it was

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.339 
was because I'd lost my clarity it was
because<00:03:06.400> i<00:03:06.430> was<00:03:06.819> listening<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.629> complaints<00:03:07.780> or
