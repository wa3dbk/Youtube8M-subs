00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
on another thing to keep in mind is the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.670 
on another thing to keep in mind is the
material<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.239> you're<00:02:25.540> running<00:02:25.959> in<00:02:26.110> don't

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680

run<00:02:26.950> in<00:02:27.069> cotton<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.940> because<00:02:28.180> cotton<00:02:28.420> does<00:02:28.780> it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
run in cotton and because cotton does it

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.309 
run in cotton and because cotton does it
wick<00:02:29.500> away<00:02:29.680> moisture<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:30.670> kind<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.180> just<00:02:31.660> hangs

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
wick away moisture it kind of just hangs

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.130 
wick away moisture it kind of just hangs
and<00:02:32.830> so<00:02:33.280> it's<00:02:33.430> not<00:02:33.580> going<00:02:33.819> to<00:02:33.880> keep<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.299> hot

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.420 
yeah so these are made of polyester and
spandex<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.959> guess<00:03:20.260> that's<00:03:20.410> probably<00:03:20.799> what

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
spandex so I guess that's probably what

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.039 
spandex so I guess that's probably what
you<00:03:21.640> should<00:03:21.850> use<00:03:21.880> but<00:03:22.510> it's<00:03:22.690> made

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
you should use but it's made

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.490 
you should use but it's made
specifically<00:03:23.980> for<00:03:24.450> cold<00:03:25.450> weather<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.230> says

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
specifically for cold weather it says

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.520 
specifically for cold weather it says
warmth<00:03:26.920> stays<00:03:27.459> in<00:03:27.790> cold<00:03:28.420> stays<00:03:28.720> out<00:03:28.989> and<00:03:29.260> it

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
warmth stays in cold stays out and it

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.460 
warmth stays in cold stays out and it
wakes<00:03:30.090> wicking<00:03:31.090> wicking<00:03:31.569> material<00:03:32.109> it<00:03:32.260> keeps

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
wakes wicking wicking material it keeps

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.229 
wakes wicking wicking material it keeps
the<00:03:32.590> moisture<00:03:32.769> away<00:03:33.400> so<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.940> stay

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
the moisture away so you stay

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.120 
the moisture away so you stay
comfortable<00:03:34.560> can't<00:03:35.560> wait<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.739> start<00:03:35.799> wearing

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
comfortable can't wait to start wearing

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.750 
comfortable can't wait to start wearing
these<00:03:36.220> they're<00:03:36.430> really<00:03:36.640> soft<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:37.060> me<00:03:37.180> inside

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.399 

and<00:03:39.909> so<00:03:40.480> that's<00:03:40.629> it<00:03:40.780> pretty<00:03:40.900> much<00:03:41.080> for<00:03:41.290> what

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
and so that's it pretty much for what

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:42.690 
and so that's it pretty much for what
you<00:03:41.500> were<00:03:41.590> wearing<00:03:41.890> I<00:03:42.190> think<00:03:42.400> it's<00:03:42.519> kind<00:03:42.670> of

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
you were wearing I think it's kind of

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.580 
you were wearing I think it's kind of
common<00:03:43.000> sense<00:03:43.209> if<00:03:43.480> it's<00:03:43.629> cold<00:03:43.840> wear<00:03:44.140> a<00:03:44.170> lot<00:03:44.349> if

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
common sense if it's cold wear a lot if

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.309 
common sense if it's cold wear a lot if
it's<00:03:44.799> not<00:03:45.010> wear<00:03:45.700> less<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.629> if<00:03:46.810> there<00:03:46.989> if<00:03:47.170> it's

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
it's not wear less and if there if it's

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.350 
it's not wear less and if there if it's
windy<00:03:47.560> wear<00:03:47.920> like<00:03:48.069> a<00:03:48.099> windbreaker<00:03:48.670> jacket<00:03:48.790> or

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
windy wear like a windbreaker jacket or

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.360 
windy wear like a windbreaker jacket or
something<00:03:50.260> around<00:03:50.680> your<00:03:50.860> neck<00:03:51.040> so<00:03:51.159> you<00:03:51.190> don't

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
something around your neck so you don't

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.610 
something around your neck so you don't
get<00:03:51.459> wind<00:03:51.730> burn<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:52.540> I<00:03:52.569> would<00:03:52.840> suggest<00:03:53.019> before

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
get wind burn so I would suggest before

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.190 
get wind burn so I would suggest before
you<00:03:53.709> run<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.099> get<00:03:54.250> in<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.549> really<00:03:55.090> really<00:03:56.019> good

you run you get in a really really good
warm-up<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.739> not<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:57.069> where<00:03:57.190> you're<00:03:57.340> sweating

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
this is a big thing do not focus on

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.060 
this is a big thing do not focus on
speed<00:04:22.150> in<00:04:22.389> the<00:04:22.539> winters<00:04:22.870> winter<00:04:23.560> is<00:04:23.800> for

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
speed in the winters winter is for

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.420 
speed in the winters winter is for
endurance<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.960> distance<00:04:25.960> not<00:04:26.500> for<00:04:26.800> speed<00:04:27.100> if

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
endurance and distance not for speed if

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.520 
endurance and distance not for speed if
you<00:04:27.550> try<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.820> do<00:04:27.970> speed<00:04:28.330> it's<00:04:28.870> just<00:04:29.110> it<00:04:29.500> doesn't

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
you try to do speed it's just it doesn't

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.650 
you try to do speed it's just it doesn't
really<00:04:30.190> work<00:04:30.550> because<00:04:30.789> your<00:04:31.090> muscles<00:04:31.479> get

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
really work because your muscles get

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.260 
really work because your muscles get
tight<00:04:31.960> when<00:04:32.560> they're<00:04:32.770> cold<00:04:33.039> and<00:04:33.430> so<00:04:34.060> it

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
tight when they're cold and so it

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.570 
tight when they're cold and so it
doesn't<00:04:34.570> give<00:04:34.780> you<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:34.960> flexibility<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:36.100> the

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
doesn't give you the flexibility and the

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.550 
doesn't give you the flexibility and the
like<00:04:36.760> relaxation<00:04:37.120> of<00:04:37.539> your<00:04:37.660> body<00:04:37.900> just<00:04:38.320> start

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
working on speed work also you don't

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.400 
working on speed work also you don't
want<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:40.360> get<00:04:40.449> hurt<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:40.750> don't<00:04:40.990> want<00:04:41.110> slip<00:04:41.289> on
