do have a pretty good memory because

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.720 
do have a pretty good memory because
you've<00:00:18.810> been<00:00:18.900> talking<00:00:19.289> gold<00:00:19.529> big<00:00:19.949> time<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.580> if

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
you've been talking gold big time so if

i don't know how many hundreds of points
you've<00:00:22.500> been<00:00:23.100> right<00:00:23.310> on<00:00:23.340> about<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.630> I

you've been right on about that and I

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.509 
you've been right on about that and I
think<00:00:25.019> we<00:00:25.320> ask<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.650> about<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> possibility

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
think we ask you about the possibility

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.509 
think we ask you about the possibility
of<00:00:26.550> qe3<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:28.140> said<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:29.130> thought<00:00:29.340> their

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
comments and I was hoping you got that

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.670 
comments and I was hoping you got that
we<00:00:35.820> had<00:00:36.000> flushed<00:00:36.300> some<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.530> bad

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
we had flushed some of the the bad

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.260 
we had flushed some of the the bad
feelings<00:00:38.129> out<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.579> think<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:38.969> just

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
feelings out but you think this is just

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.310 
feelings out but you think this is just
the<00:00:39.329> beginning<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.750> something<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.110> could<00:00:40.290> be

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the beginning of something that could be

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.830 
the beginning of something that could be
pretty<00:00:40.500> serious<00:00:42.140> well<00:00:43.140> my<00:00:43.379> view<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.820> the

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
pretty serious well my view is that the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.010 
pretty serious well my view is that the
market<00:00:45.840> has<00:00:46.489> experienced<00:00:47.489> everywhere<00:00:48.149> huge

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
market has experienced everywhere huge

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.090 
market has experienced everywhere huge
technical<00:00:49.649> damage<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:51.140> near-term<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
technical damage and near-term as of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.360 
technical damage and near-term as of
today<00:00:53.460> all<00:00:54.420> markets<00:00:55.230> are<00:00:55.440> extremely

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
today all markets are extremely

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.810 
today all markets are extremely
extremely<00:00:57.030> oversold<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> rebound<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.609> going

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
extremely oversold so rebound is going

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.330 
extremely oversold so rebound is going
to<00:00:59.879> happen<00:01:00.270> today<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.690> tomorrow<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.829> mean<00:01:02.129> on

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
to happen today or tomorrow I mean on

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.219 
to happen today or tomorrow I mean on
Monday<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:04.650> damage<00:01:05.610> technically<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.869> so

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
Monday but the damage technically is so

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.640 
Monday but the damage technically is so
great<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.820> rebound<00:01:09.299> no<00:01:10.080> matter<00:01:10.350> where

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
great that's the rebound no matter where

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.880 
great that's the rebound no matter where
that<00:01:10.680> qe3<00:01:11.460> happens<00:01:12.240> right<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:13.170> it's

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that qe3 happens right here it's

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.539 
that qe3 happens right here it's
unlikely<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:15.000> lift<00:01:15.240> markets<00:01:15.930> above<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.280> may

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
unlikely to lift markets above the may

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.410 
unlikely to lift markets above the may
second<00:01:18.150> high<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.840> SNP<00:01:19.439> at<00:01:19.670> 1370<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.299> i

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
second high on the SNP at 1370 and i

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.100 
second high on the SNP at 1370 and i
think<00:01:21.689> we'll<00:01:21.900> drift<00:01:22.229> lower<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.159> mine<00:01:24.119> say

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
think we'll drift lower and mine say

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.100 
think we'll drift lower and mine say
near-term<00:01:25.920> target<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:27.110> october-november

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
near-term target in october-november

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.179 
near-term target in october-november
would<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:28.950> something<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:30.380> 1110<00:01:31.380> 50<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
would be something like 1110 50 on the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.999 
would be something like 1110 50 on the
SNP<00:01:32.880> then<00:01:33.659> we'll<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.560> where<00:01:34.860> that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
SNP then we'll have to see where that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.170 
SNP then we'll have to see where that
qe3<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.329> QE<00:01:36.630> 4<00:01:36.750> will<00:01:37.380> come<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.009> whether<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
qe3 or QE 4 will come and whether the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.840 
qe3 or QE 4 will come and whether the
Marches<00:01:39.570> will<00:01:39.810> stabilize<00:01:40.350> did<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.340> in

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
Marches will stabilize did you know in

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.990 
Marches will stabilize did you know in
general<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.659> would<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:43.049> using<00:01:43.820> rebounds<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:44.970> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
general I would be using rebounds as a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.289 
general I would be using rebounds as a
selling<00:01:45.450> opportunity<00:01:45.540> yeah<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> all<00:01:47.759> through

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
selling opportunity yeah so all through

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.530 
selling opportunity yeah so all through
the<00:01:48.509> debt<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.670> ridiculous<00:01:51.270> thing<00:01:51.420> we

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
the debt that that ridiculous thing we

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.969 
the debt that that ridiculous thing we
went<00:01:51.689> through<00:01:51.899> over<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.290> all<00:01:52.470> through<00:01:52.710> that

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
went through over here all through that

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.609 
went through over here all through that
you<00:01:53.939> thought<00:01:54.180> Treasuries<00:01:54.990> were<00:01:55.140> rallying

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
you thought Treasuries were rallying

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.959 
you thought Treasuries were rallying
because<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.920> slowing<00:01:58.920> economies<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.729> not

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
because of the slowing economies and not

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.880 
because of the slowing economies and not
just<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> US<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.840> worldwide<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.380> mean<00:02:01.740> that

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
just the US but worldwide I mean that

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.139 
just the US but worldwide I mean that
that<00:02:02.070> was<00:02:02.189> clear<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:02.969> that's

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
that was clear to you that but that's

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.069 
that was clear to you that but that's
what<00:02:03.240> was<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:05.329> think<00:02:06.329> Treasuries<00:02:06.869> are

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
what was going on I think Treasuries are

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.800 
what was going on I think Treasuries are
perceived<00:02:07.920> still<00:02:08.429> as<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:09.110> safe<00:02:10.110> haven<00:02:10.520> because

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
perceived still as a safe haven because

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.680 
perceived still as a safe haven because
everybody<00:02:12.810> knows

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
everybody knows

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.160 
everybody knows
the<00:02:13.780> US<00:02:14.140> has<00:02:14.440> an<00:02:14.620> endless<00:02:15.220> ability<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.870> print

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
the US has an endless ability to print

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.880 
the US has an endless ability to print
money<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.910> interest<00:02:19.330> will<00:02:19.540> be<00:02:19.690> paid<00:02:19.930> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
money so the interest will be paid the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.980 
money so the interest will be paid the
question<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.430> governments<00:02:22.090> can<00:02:22.300> default<00:02:22.720> in

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
question is governments can default in

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.110 
question is governments can default in
two<00:02:23.200> ways<00:02:23.440> either<00:02:23.470> they<00:02:24.100> just<00:02:24.400> stop<00:02:24.880> paying

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
two ways either they just stop paying

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.810 
two ways either they just stop paying
the<00:02:25.450> interest<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:25.990> there<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.230> test

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
the interest and there is a test

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.150 
the interest and there is a test
restructuring<00:02:27.820> like<00:02:28.060> Argentina<00:02:29.160> went

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
restructuring like Argentina went

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.270 
restructuring like Argentina went
through<00:02:30.460> or<00:02:31.120> they<00:02:31.750> just<00:02:31.990> pay<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.830> interest

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
through or they just pay the interest

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.790 
through or they just pay the interest
and<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.910> principal<00:02:34.510> eventually<00:02:35.080> in<00:02:35.650> a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
and the principal eventually in a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.400 
and the principal eventually in a
worthless<00:02:36.010> currency<00:02:36.640> that's<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.750> way<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.110> US

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
worthless currency that's the way the US

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.670 
worthless currency that's the way the US
will<00:02:38.680> likely<00:02:38.920> do<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.430> no<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.960> did<00:02:41.290> one<00:02:41.500> less

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
will likely do it no you did one less

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.230 
will likely do it no you did one less
thing<00:02:41.950> mark<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.370> say<00:02:42.730> people<00:02:42.970> are<00:02:43.060> going<00:02:43.150> to

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
thing mark you say people are going to

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.970 
thing mark you say people are going to
be<00:02:43.360> hoping<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.500> some<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.890> the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
be hoping that that some of the

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.700 
be hoping that that some of the
government<00:02:45.400> numbers<00:02:46.170> will<00:02:47.170> help<00:02:47.410> stem<00:02:47.680> the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
government numbers will help stem the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.400 
government numbers will help stem the
slide<00:02:48.130> as<00:02:48.370> they<00:02:48.550> improve<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.570> do<00:02:50.020> you<00:02:50.140> still

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
slide as they improve and do you still

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.900 
slide as they improve and do you still
think<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:51.040> numbers<00:02:51.400> are<00:02:51.520> eager<00:02:51.700> to

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
think that the numbers are eager to

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.310 
think that the numbers are eager to
continue<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.450> actually<00:02:52.780> get<00:02:52.900> worse<00:02:53.110> before

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
continue to actually get worse before

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.030 
continue to actually get worse before
they<00:02:53.530> get<00:02:53.680> better<00:02:55.560> what<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.590> think<00:02:56.800> there<00:02:56.920> may

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
they get better what I think there may

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.460 
they get better what I think there may
be<00:02:57.070> other<00:02:57.370> factors<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.970> played<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.810> you

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
be other factors that played that you

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.680 
be other factors that played that you
know<00:02:59.590> corporate<00:03:00.130> profits<00:03:00.670> have<00:03:01.000> been<00:03:01.060> very

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
know corporate profits have been very

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.940 
know corporate profits have been very
very<00:03:02.110> good<00:03:02.470> in<00:03:02.830> this<00:03:03.700> recovery<00:03:04.120> since<00:03:04.630> 2009<00:03:05.530> I

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
very good in this recovery since 2009 I

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.980 
very good in this recovery since 2009 I
think<00:03:06.640> maybe<00:03:06.820> in<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.150> second<00:03:07.480> half<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.810> this

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
think maybe in the second half of this

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.310 
think maybe in the second half of this
year<00:03:08.050> corporate<00:03:08.890> profits<00:03:09.340> will<00:03:09.550> somewhat

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
year corporate profits will somewhat

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.980 
year corporate profits will somewhat

before but the understand gold and
silver<00:03:46.120> became<00:03:47.110> over<00:03:47.620> boat<00:03:47.890> and<00:03:48.340> they<00:03:48.910> are<00:03:49.090> due

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
silver became over boat and they are due

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.259 
silver became over boat and they are due
for<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.780> correction<00:03:50.130> like<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.370> US<00:03:51.670> dollar<00:03:52.000> is

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
for a correction like the US dollar is

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.380 
for a correction like the US dollar is
oversold<00:03:52.900> is<00:03:53.230> due<00:03:53.530> for<00:03:53.800> a<00:03:53.830> rebound<00:03:54.250> so<00:03:55.239> we

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
oversold is due for a rebound so we

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.040 
oversold is due for a rebound so we
could<00:03:55.540> have<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.750> period<00:03:56.320> say<00:03:56.650> next<00:03:57.280> week<00:03:57.519> or<00:03:57.820> so

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
could have a period say next week or so

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.440 
could have a period say next week or so
where<00:03:59.050> equities<00:03:59.769> rebound<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.910> gold<00:04:01.180> and

where equities rebound and gold and

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.870

silver<00:04:01.810> correct<00:04:02.140> on<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.500> downside<00:04:02.980> but<00:04:03.820> i

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
silver correct on the downside but i

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.420 
silver correct on the downside but i
mean<00:04:04.120> i've<00:04:04.269> calculated<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.290> gold<00:04:05.709> price<00:04:06.010> at

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
mean i've calculated the gold price at

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.250 
mean i've calculated the gold price at
this<00:04:06.640> level<00:04:06.910> is<00:04:07.120> not<00:04:07.330> particularly<00:04:07.900> expensive

would actually use weakness in gold and

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.760 
would actually use weakness in gold and

opinion with I mean you have a computer

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.260 
opinion with I mean you have a computer
occasionally<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:42.220> computer<00:04:42.700> will<00:04:42.850> crash<00:04:43.240> and

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
occasionally the computer will crash and

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.480 
occasionally the computer will crash and
then<00:04:43.690> you<00:04:43.870> have<00:04:44.080> to<00:04:44.260> reboot<00:04:44.710> it<00:04:44.770> that<00:04:45.280> will

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
then you have to reboot it that will

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.390 
then you have to reboot it that will
happen<00:04:45.700> to<00:04:45.910> the<00:04:46.150> global<00:04:46.570> economy<00:04:46.860> now<00:04:47.860> before

happen to the global economy now before
this<00:04:48.580> happens<00:04:49.210> there<00:04:50.110> will<00:04:50.140> be<00:04:50.320> much<00:04:50.830> more

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
this happens there will be much more

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.570 
this happens there will be much more
money<00:04:51.820> printing<00:04:52.540> because<00:04:52.900> basically<00:04:53.770> the

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
money printing because basically the

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.410 
money printing because basically the
central<00:04:55.180> banks<00:04:55.720> are<00:04:55.900> willing<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.650> do<00:04:56.890> that<00:04:57.420> by

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
central banks are willing to do that by

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.230 
central banks are willing to do that by
printing<00:04:59.140> money<00:04:59.250> problems<00:05:00.250> are<00:05:00.430> not<00:05:00.580> solved

printing money problems are not solved

printing money problems are not solved
but<00:05:01.540> they<00:05:01.690> can<00:05:01.900> be<00:05:01.930> postponed<00:05:02.650> and<00:05:03.130> they

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
but they can be postponed and they

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.610 
but they can be postponed and they
become<00:05:03.760> larger<00:05:04.300> is<00:05:04.420> like<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:04.900> recession<00:05:05.470> in

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
become larger is like the recession in

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.740 
become larger is like the recession in
2001<00:05:07.080> had<00:05:08.080> there<00:05:08.590> not<00:05:08.980> been<00:05:09.390> massive<00:05:10.390> money

2001 had there not been massive money

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.740 
2001 had there not been massive money
printing<00:05:11.440> would<00:05:11.890> have<00:05:12.100> been<00:05:12.450> steeper<00:05:13.450> than

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
printing would have been steeper than

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.800 
printing would have been steeper than
what<00:05:13.930> we<00:05:14.170> had<00:05:14.410> but<00:05:15.340> equally<00:05:15.940> we<00:05:16.510> would<00:05:16.660> have

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
what we had but equally we would have

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.310 
what we had but equally we would have
avoided<00:05:17.110> probably<00:05:17.980> the<00:05:18.160> financial<00:05:18.730> crash<00:05:19.000> in

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
avoided probably the financial crash in

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.980 
avoided probably the financial crash in
2008<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.980> next<00:05:21.310> time<00:05:21.550> we<00:05:21.580> have<00:05:22.030> a<00:05:22.060> global

2008 the next time we have a global

2008 the next time we have a global
economic<00:05:23.800> crisis<00:05:24.280> it<00:05:24.430> will<00:05:24.640> be<00:05:24.760> much<00:05:24.970> worse

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
economic crisis it will be much worse

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.200 
economic crisis it will be much worse
than<00:05:25.750> 2000<00:05:26.530> a<00:05:26.560> date<00:05:26.800> before<00:05:27.370> this<00:05:27.760> happens

than 2000 a date before this happens
there<00:05:28.390> will<00:05:28.420> be<00:05:28.690> money<00:05:28.930> printing<00:05:29.560> and<00:05:29.710> they'll

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
there will be money printing and they'll
