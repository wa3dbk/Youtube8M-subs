one<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.980> main<00:02:15.220> cool<00:02:15.610> things<00:02:15.910> about<00:02:16.150> this

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
one of the main cool things about this

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330 
one of the main cool things about this
is<00:02:16.960> you<00:02:17.200> can<00:02:17.290> actually<00:02:17.380> use<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.830> as<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.950> recipe

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
is you can actually use it as a recipe

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.610 
is you can actually use it as a recipe
book<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:18.880> in<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.570> case<00:02:19.780> where<00:02:19.810> sometimes<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
book so in the case where sometimes the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.650 
book so in the case where sometimes the
recipe<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.340> book<00:02:21.580> mod<00:02:21.910> actually<00:02:22.300> takes

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
recipe of book mod actually takes

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.690 
recipe of book mod actually takes
forever<00:02:22.960> to<00:02:23.440> update<00:02:23.920> or<00:02:24.070> things<00:02:24.250> like<00:02:24.310> any<00:02:24.580> I

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
forever to update or things like any I

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.970 
forever to update or things like any I
take<00:02:25.060> forever<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.690> update<00:02:26.080> this<00:02:26.770> would

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
take forever to update this would

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.500 
take forever to update this would
actually<00:02:27.070> be<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.370> simpler<00:02:27.880> version<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:28.330> that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
actually be a simpler version of that

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.020 
actually be a simpler version of that
and<00:02:28.720> like<00:02:28.960> I<00:02:29.140> would<00:02:29.200> assume<00:02:29.680> would<00:02:30.280> be<00:02:30.340> updated

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
and like I would assume would be updated

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.760 
and like I would assume would be updated
earlier<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.690> well<00:02:31.960> as<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.230> know<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:32.440> has<00:02:32.560> all

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
earlier as well as you know it has all

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.500 
earlier as well as you know it has all
your<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.460> has<00:02:33.580> all<00:02:33.700> your<00:02:33.760> different<00:02:34.150> crafting

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
you can grab the diamond block now if I

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.530 
you can grab the diamond block now if I
wanted<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:23.980> disable<00:03:24.520> that<00:03:24.550> feature<00:03:24.700> for<00:03:25.060> some

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
reason what I could actually do is open

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.940 
reason what I could actually do is open
up<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.630> craft<00:03:28.810> manager<00:03:29.260> look<00:03:29.470> for<00:03:29.650> diamond

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
up the craft manager look for diamond

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.040 
up the craft manager look for diamond
block<00:03:30.130> disable<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.150> now<00:03:31.450> it's<00:03:31.810> going<00:03:31.990> to

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
block disable that and now it's going to

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.780 
block disable that and now it's going to
say<00:03:32.200> three<00:03:32.560> recipe<00:03:33.040> is<00:03:33.130> disabled<00:03:33.580> because<00:03:33.700> I

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
say three recipe is disabled because I

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.060

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
had to disabled before and now that I

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.370 
had to disabled before and now that I
make<00:03:36.310> this<00:03:36.490> it<00:03:36.730> won't<00:03:36.940> enable<00:03:37.510> me<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.690> make

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
make this it won't enable me to make

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.930 
make this it won't enable me to make
another<00:03:38.620> diamond<00:03:38.980> block<00:03:39.190> now<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:39.670> guys<00:03:39.880> are

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
another diamond block now you guys are

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.250 
another diamond block now you guys are
probably<00:03:40.090> saying<00:03:40.390> Nick<00:03:40.630> why<00:03:40.810> is<00:03:40.870> this<00:03:41.080> useful

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260
