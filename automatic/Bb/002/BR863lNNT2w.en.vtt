00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
all the pop up note functionality it is

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.930 
all the pop up note functionality it is
now<00:00:39.570> called<00:00:39.930> action<00:00:40.350> memo<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:41.100> has<00:00:41.309> been<00:00:41.640> moved

now called action memo it has been moved

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.510 
now called action memo it has been moved

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
away from the S note app and you do it

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.639 
away from the S note app and you do it
all<00:00:44.700> inside<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.450> action<00:00:45.899> memo<00:00:46.230> app<00:00:46.530> right<00:00:46.890> so

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
all inside the action memo app right so

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.990 
all inside the action memo app right so
though<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.890> has<00:00:50.280> been<00:00:50.309> completely

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
though this has been completely

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.049 
though this has been completely
separated<00:00:51.899> from<00:00:52.309> anything<00:00:53.309> related<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.910> s

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
separated from anything related to s

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.090 
separated from anything related to s
note<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.690> manage<00:00:55.050> all<00:00:55.289> your<00:00:55.320> notes<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.890> there

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
note you manage all your notes in there

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.849 
note you manage all your notes in there
and<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.670> accesses<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.629> files<00:00:57.930> really<00:00:58.350> quickly

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
and it accesses the files really quickly

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.279 
and it accesses the files really quickly
so<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> makes<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.430> big<00:00:59.609> difference<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.300> another

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
so it makes a big difference and another

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.380 
so it makes a big difference and another
thing<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.739> has<00:01:02.129> been<00:01:02.370> moved<00:01:02.670> away<00:01:02.850> from<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
thing that has been moved away from the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.469 
thing that has been moved away from the
S<00:01:03.539> note<00:01:03.680> you<00:01:04.680> used<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.309> able<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.640> long<00:01:06.180> tap

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
S note you used to be able to long tap

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.320 
S note you used to be able to long tap
on<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.900> shape<00:01:07.229> icon<00:01:07.770> called<00:01:08.460> productivity

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
on this shape icon called productivity

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.260 
on this shape icon called productivity
tools<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.170> click<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.270> function

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
tools and then click on the function

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.410 
tools and then click on the function
icon<00:01:12.720> function<00:01:13.710> button<00:01:14.010> there<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.270> used

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
icon function button there then you used

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.399 
icon function button there then you used
to<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.720> able<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:21.960> could

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
to be able to do this and then you could

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.210 
to be able to do this and then you could
do<00:01:22.759> search<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.330> then<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.229> used<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.710> open<00:01:26.100> up

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
do search and then it used to open up

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.520 
do search and then it used to open up
Wolfram<00:01:26.759> Alpha<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.509> then<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.840> used<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.350> do

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
Wolfram Alpha and then it used to do

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.210 
Wolfram Alpha and then it used to do
that<00:01:28.710> math<00:01:29.100> equation<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.090> well<00:01:31.220> that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that math equation for you well that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.690 
that math equation for you well that
does<00:01:32.670> not<00:01:32.880> happen<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.110> S<00:01:34.259> note<00:01:34.590> anymore<00:01:35.070> so

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
does not happen on the S note anymore so

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.460 
does not happen on the S note anymore so
you<00:01:35.820> can't<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> Galaxy<00:01:37.290> Note<00:01:37.439> 3

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
you can't do this on the Galaxy Note 3

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.770 
you can't do this on the Galaxy Note 3
but<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.460> really<00:01:38.880> buried<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.600> there

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
but it is just really buried in there

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.999 
but it is just really buried in there
and<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.259> not<00:01:40.290> kidding

go Wolfram Alpha
now<00:02:03.859> that<00:02:04.189> really<00:02:04.670> took<00:02:04.880> some<00:02:05.090> time<00:02:05.299> to<00:02:05.509> find

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
then I'm going to shape it same thing

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.449 
then I'm going to shape it same thing
for<00:03:52.069> here<00:03:52.250> I'll<00:03:52.519> select<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:53.950> transfer<00:03:54.950> an<00:03:55.069> info

for here I'll select it transfer an info

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.839 
for here I'll select it transfer an info
shape<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.269> now<00:03:56.840> there<00:03:57.260> are<00:03:57.379> perfect<00:03:57.950> squares

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
shape and now there are perfect squares

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.909 
shape and now there are perfect squares
and<00:03:59.269> circles<00:03:59.720> or<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.349> guess<00:04:00.620> that's<00:04:00.799> a

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
and circles or I guess that's a

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.039 
and circles or I guess that's a
rectangle<00:04:01.459> so<00:04:02.239> let<00:04:02.450> me<00:04:02.540> show<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:02.720> a<00:04:02.870> hidden

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
rectangle so let me show you a hidden
