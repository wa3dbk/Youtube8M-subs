eating more calories than I need which
is<00:03:50.810> going<00:03:51.110> to<00:03:51.170> cause<00:03:51.500> me<00:03:51.800> to<00:03:51.980> gain<00:03:52.160> weight<00:03:52.190> now

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
is going to cause me to gain weight now

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.180 
is going to cause me to gain weight now
my<00:03:53.480> surplus<00:03:53.990> in<00:03:54.290> calories<00:03:54.740> is<00:03:54.890> not<00:03:55.040> going<00:03:55.130> to

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
my surplus in calories is not going to

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.280 
my surplus in calories is not going to
be<00:03:55.370> so<00:03:55.670> much<00:03:55.940> that<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.210> put<00:03:56.480> on<00:03:56.600> a<00:03:56.630> ton<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:56.960> body

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
be so much that I put on a ton of body

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.010 
be so much that I put on a ton of body
fat<00:03:57.560> at<00:03:58.070> least<00:03:58.250> that's<00:03:58.460> the<00:03:58.520> idea<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:59.450> idea<00:03:59.480> is

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
fat at least that's the idea the idea is

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.900 
fat at least that's the idea the idea is
to<00:04:00.200> give<00:04:00.320> myself<00:04:00.500> more<00:04:00.950> calories<00:04:01.460> than<00:04:01.490> I<00:04:01.700> need

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
to give myself more calories than I need

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.900 
to give myself more calories than I need
so<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.510> I<00:04:02.630> can<00:04:02.690> grow<00:04:03.200> but<00:04:03.830> not<00:04:04.010> have<00:04:04.550> so<00:04:04.760> many

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
so that I can grow but not have so many

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.220 
so that I can grow but not have so many
calories<00:04:05.150> that<00:04:05.480> I<00:04:05.510> throw<00:04:05.720> in<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.870> lot<00:04:05.990> of<00:04:06.080> fat

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
calories that I throw in a lot of fat

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.200 
calories that I throw in a lot of fat
thus<00:04:06.590> is<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:06.860> clean<00:04:07.310> bulking<00:04:07.850> you<00:04:07.970> can<00:04:08.090> do<00:04:08.180> a

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
thus is the clean bulking you can do a

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.940 
thus is the clean bulking you can do a
dirty<00:04:08.510> bowl<00:04:08.780> where<00:04:09.440> you<00:04:09.530> just<00:04:09.680> eat<00:04:09.830> whatever

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
myself to dip into the lower reps and

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.730 
myself to dip into the lower reps and
higher<00:04:55.880> weight<00:04:56.210> but<00:04:56.930> throughout<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.530> years

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
higher weight but throughout the years

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.650 
higher weight but throughout the years
what<00:04:58.100> I<00:04:58.130> found<00:04:58.370> out<00:04:58.550> about<00:04:58.640> my<00:04:59.000> body<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.540> my

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
what I found out about my body and my

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.080 
what I found out about my body and my
training<00:05:00.169> is<00:05:00.380> I<00:05:00.620> get<00:05:01.160> a<00:05:01.190> lot<00:05:01.490> more<00:05:01.550> out<00:05:02.060> of

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
training is I get a lot more out of

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.630 
training is I get a lot more out of
doing<00:05:03.080> moderate<00:05:03.770> weight<00:05:04.070> that<00:05:04.370> mean<00:05:04.490> that's

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
doing moderate weight that mean that's

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.970 
doing moderate weight that mean that's
way<00:05:04.850> that's<00:05:05.090> difficult<00:05:05.270> for<00:05:05.630> me<00:05:05.750> but<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:06.860> know

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
way that's difficult for me but you know

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.700 
way that's difficult for me but you know
not<00:05:07.370> really<00:05:07.640> dropping<00:05:08.150> too<00:05:08.630> far<00:05:09.050> below<00:05:09.350> a

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
not really dropping too far below a

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.620 
not really dropping too far below a
trips<00:05:10.100> now<00:05:10.340> six<00:05:10.610> reps<00:05:10.880> you<00:05:11.060> can<00:05:11.180> do<00:05:11.300> that<00:05:11.450> for

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
trips now six reps you can do that for

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.000 
trips now six reps you can do that for
fun<00:05:11.750> I<00:05:11.810> mean<00:05:11.960> if<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.140> want<00:05:12.320> to<00:05:12.380> lift<00:05:12.470> heavy<00:05:12.680> for

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010

fun I mean if you want to lift heavy for
a<00:05:13.040> day<00:05:13.270> absolutely<00:05:14.270> still<00:05:14.870> have<00:05:15.169> the

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
a day absolutely still have the

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.290 
a day absolutely still have the
opportunity<00:05:15.740> to<00:05:15.800> do<00:05:15.919> that<00:05:16.070> but<00:05:16.640> my<00:05:16.880> main<00:05:17.060> focus

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
opportunity to do that but my main focus

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.790 
opportunity to do that but my main focus
right<00:05:17.510> now<00:05:17.690> is<00:05:17.810> going<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.200> be<00:05:18.290> between<00:05:18.500> the

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
right now is going to be between the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.330 
right now is going to be between the
eight<00:05:19.070> and<00:05:19.510> 12<00:05:20.510> rep<00:05:20.870> ranges<00:05:21.410> and<00:05:21.650> that's<00:05:22.130> going

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
eight and 12 rep ranges and that's going

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.150 
eight and 12 rep ranges and that's going
to<00:05:22.400> allow<00:05:22.520> me<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:23.390> start<00:05:24.080> taxing<00:05:24.500> my<00:05:24.800> muscles

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
to allow me to start taxing my muscles

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.650 
to allow me to start taxing my muscles
in<00:05:25.280> such<00:05:25.460> a<00:05:25.490> way<00:05:25.669> that<00:05:25.700> they<00:05:25.940> respond<00:05:26.419> by

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
in such a way that they respond by

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.020 
in such a way that they respond by
growing<00:05:26.990> and<00:05:27.490> definitely<00:05:28.490> switching<00:05:28.910> my

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
growing and definitely switching my

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.840 
growing and definitely switching my
