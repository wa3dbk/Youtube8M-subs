00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:27.900
 So let's start the bike, of course. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:34.620
 rather for beginners but he also 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:39.260
 suitable lovers as we see the rear 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:44.160

 the bike is pretty good 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.820
 exploiting him more than two weeks to me 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.259
 he left the sea just 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:28.619
 unforgettable sensations despite the fact that 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.350
 the bike is made from a more precise frame 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:38.720
 aluminum 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:43.530
 he keeps himself well and is very acceptable 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:49.679
 So back except the frame we vat 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:55.069
 avi kirov I want to pay attention to 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:55.069
 plug a fork here 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:11.430
 solid good fork sr x 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:16.200
 cd-100 very nice smooth plug here 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.290
 can be customized for stiffness with me 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:24.570
 composed more so smooth and he is so 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:28.380
 say jumps here is not very good 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:32.370
 of course you can see at all he jump pretty 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:41.780
 smooth brakes don't stand still 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:41.780
 both front and back 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:58.640
 shimano front derailleur 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:03:04.410
 Now you are the 40th 42 tons I have a frame size 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:09.209
 20 more precisely 50 centimeters you man is not 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:13.950
 spoke my height is necessary somewhere 18 19 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:16.680
 somewhere so but twenty me too 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.310
 pretty really like 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.680
 I raised a little seat and sat 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.420
 pretty comfortable 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:30.719
 generally I advise everyone to be very good 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:33.450
 bike but something i had like that 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:36.900
 the problem is that the rear wheels and a lot 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:41.670
 let in well now pumped like here 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:48.709
 all right nothing sags everything 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:51.810
 nice everything is perfect so it is necessary to Elspeth 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.079
 roughly 15,000 is the best 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.079
 option 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:17.660
 such a bell sometimes saves 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:22.430
 difficult situations well what about it was a review 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.260
