 people who take the company as their 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.629
 T shirt 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.890
 speaking on the side what do you think if 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:05.070
 we tried but I love love of idea 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.070
 [Music] 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.130
 good if we looked at diego we told 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.260
 the people who are in that part where 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.530
 he held the coffee the jacket of the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.170
 people workers to work there 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.390
 a temperature of minus 25 degrees 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.760
 it is incredible the truth we are very well 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.650
 there we go to maria laura rey 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.600
 is the head of the plant that we saw 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.170
 very warmly its doors that we 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.520
 He also invited to test how we sent from 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.430
 ice creams I like a lot on the side of the 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.470
 people with 53 million like always 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.140
 asked for the same 3 me as always coconut 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.000
 and organized mint clothes and you and then 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.380
 the chocolate with almonds that any 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.150
 kind of chocolate recently take me out 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.910
 over to an inhibition can we be the 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.320
 chocolate basically 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.270
 I started ordering chocolate with almonds 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:04.010
 down and bitter chocolate up because 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:06.830
 not because it's not milk chocolate 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.180
 if you like it because not good if I 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.040
 permitted 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.570
 before this in my beginnings at 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.670
 the beginning of everything is dismissed from it 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.620
 and let me tell you that there is a secret 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.320
 very basic that we comment to people who 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.970
 the harder taste of ice cream goes under and 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.709
 the softest I know because as for 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.530
 example ask for organized milk candy 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.770
 and you ask for coconut and usually the sweet 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.410
 milk organizer to this die harder 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.870
 every thicker and thicker and better is the 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.940
 that goes under and then one the most 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.970
 soft is put up with the spoon 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.130
 so he gives it back and its forms 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.170
 these craft in my family when 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.140
 we make them ask for the ice cream they ask me 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.080
 that has been to everyone else to me 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.720
 like it a lot and have the little bag appeared 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.650
 in the bag and I have the shovel the bad the 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.290
 professional 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.120
 the professional teacher the teacher the 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.160
 difference between the euro and palita 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.050
 professional no no no and as he says 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.210
 alejandro good background products 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.819
 always go the bucket with water 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.740
 to not mix the tastes the hygiene all 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.139
 and so for good let's tell the 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.990
 people who can comment us with 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.940
 bring us your stories about ideas aj 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.860
 clement at 5 ene dotcom 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.889
 and well the idea is always to highlight what 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.960
 Argentine national and the truth I do not use 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.910
 We really appreciate the good company 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.710
 I hope you liked this moment 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.810
 this segment of color that has to do 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.960
 with the Argentine side is artisanal is 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.880
 that ice cream makers do not like this 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.699
 when it comes to a place or in arable 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.430
 take out number not for these five ten 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.889
 twenty minutes waiting and people 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.820
 same recent and likes it when 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:46.900
 the counter arrives because they only hate the 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:49.550
 services to people said before lady 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.080
 we give voice to those who have no voice and 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.360
 so merchants when wineries yes 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.039
 they ask you to try it liked 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.139
 and there are things and I always say that 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.400
 declares sometimes after I'll go back to 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.990
 ask for chocolate with almonds and 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.220
 bitter chocolate but 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:06.190
 this new and good 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.730
 well I think we have to let stretch 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.730
 the double more 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.459
