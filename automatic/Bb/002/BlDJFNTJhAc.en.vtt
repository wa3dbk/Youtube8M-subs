00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Well, good evening. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Say the front comes here yesterday, 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 And because I really came here 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 It was 100% correct. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 I also said that this front line slipped and went out. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Because it was so 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 It was also 100% correct. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 ... in 1923 my grandfather predicted such a cloud. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Well, let's see the forecast for the future. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 This good weather cloud melts in 2033, 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 It will be a bad weather cloud. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 I got a fax saying that I said yesterday that a wolf would come. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 I did not say that. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 The word that I said was "Tomorrow will come. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 It's not the same thing. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Because it was here and there, it was 100% correct again. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 I got a lot of faxes on other themes. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Please do not send faxes anymore. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Especially on Saturdays and Sundays. Email too. I immediately discard my letter. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Let's see the forecast for the north. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Please see here. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 A big wind might come here on the Pannonia plains. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 But, 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 This snow slides down from the top of the Alps. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Well, let's see what was the forecast that I made a mistake yesterday. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Yesterday, I said that I would wait for a letter from Balaton Highlands. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 I was misplaced because I didn't get one. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 I'm sorry. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 But I got a nice picture from Gajor Esmeralda of Siofok. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 There is also a picture title, 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 It was the eclipse I saw. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Poor Esmeralda sent no other pictures. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Thank you for your attention. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 To everyone of stardust, 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 happy, 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 I'm blessed with God.
