00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello in this video it is about the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.089
 inside resistance determination one 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.280
 battery 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.950
 in this case, this is dressed up here 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.830
 Polymer battery of a clamping voltage 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.929
 So an open circuit voltage of 42 volts 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.560
 and a capacity of 820 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.140
 milliole hours around the resistance 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.060
 you need to calculate a load once 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.660
 in this case, the two are parallel 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.510
 switched 27 um resistors 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.969
 you have to know the open circuit voltage and 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.790
 the tension under load here have the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.180
 procedure is the first to be determined 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.940
 determine the open circuit voltage 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.629
 then measure the resistance by 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.149
 and measures just the rl so the last 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.530
 Resistance that is worth an exact 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.660
 if have this sometimes 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.820
 resistances small deviations you 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 always on it also ten percent and thus 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.910
 you get a relatively accurate result 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.480
 Of course you have to get the exact one 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.850
 have resistance then you would have to 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:11.790
 the voltage is under tension 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:14.580
 last 00 o'clock divided by surrendered 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.939
 Danish resistance of the battery sets 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.869
 divided out by rl together 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.610
 I 've had it all before 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.409
 prepared 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.280
 I have already found out the values 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.780
 all measured 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.280
 It could now say that at this 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.750
 However, the values ​​differ slightly 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.270
 I will go with those before 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.890
 calculate data before that because that 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.530
 is much easier now with the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.210
 camera and the video 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.590
 So first you close a multimeter 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:49.590
 to the battery to the multimeter is on 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:53.159
 voltage measurement provided by the lithium 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.299
 battery has an open circuit voltage of 39 52 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:02.880
 I want to have noted here now 39 48 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.710
 volt is the second resistance of the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.329
 resistance of these two in parallel 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.329
 determined resistances 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.990
 First, the battery is disconnected 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.550
 then the multimeter will be connected to the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:28.130
 resistors connected and on and 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.260
 put both connected in parallel 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.210
 Resistors have a resistance value 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.210
 from 13 to 67 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.170
 now the multimeter will be back on the 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:52.670
 voltage measurement and again 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:56.330
 the resistors connected to the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.000
 to determine clamping voltage in the load case 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.860
 is now the lithium battery again 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.860
 Stand connected to the multimeter 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:19.590
 There is a voltage of 3.88 8 volts 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:27.810
 to the tension that I determined before 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:29.460
 I have 38 92 want now one has 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.080
 all the values ​​you need around the 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.080
 resistance of the battery to calculate 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.930
 the current that flows is therefore the last 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.410
 So saves the tension on the 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.990
 resistance in the last case divided by 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:55.650
 the resistance value that would be here then 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:59.640
 Is 02 84 71 ampere, the internal resistance 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.940
 zero so the open circuit voltage - the 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:07.260
 load voltage divided by the current in the 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.780
 last because the resistance of the battery so 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:16.080
 their resistance is here in this 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:17.280
 measurement 0 1 967 small deviations 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.160
 can arise from that 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.420
 For example, no relative measurement 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.850
 was carried out 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:28.530
 as you can see here i have the 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.760
 relatively button pressed previously in the in 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.100
 I pressed the button during the measurement 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.930
 it is only an attitude now 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.110
 adjust thing with the camera in the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.060
 hand and filming 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.180
 It's so easy. It's so important 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.630
 easier that I calculated the previously calculated 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.580
 and take certain warders than last 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.270
 Any linear is actually suitable 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.960
 umschau 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.940
 do not leave the big temperature change 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.160
 So, for example, can learn now 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.860
 No light bulb will be taken as last 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.840
 because the bulb in the cold state one 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.970
 has much lower resistance than 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.320
 in the hot state 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.700
 Also, no semiconductors can be used 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.240
 there will be a constant 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.240
 voltage drops 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:14.030
 yes that was it already want 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.030
 for watching and see you later
