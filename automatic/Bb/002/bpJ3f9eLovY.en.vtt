00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.900
 my name is glass you know me and 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:19.260
 on tier-1 we are led some 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.050
 few but indispensable before 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.789
 make adjustments before we do it 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.590
 Actually game continues to jump 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.289
 We will deal with the absolute basics 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.080
 to the micro and the macro 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.200
 and at the end of Tier1 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.690
 we will even become our very first 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.320
 Men's picture learning the goal of this image 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.360
 it is from a single base 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.180
 an early but very strong one 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.270
 attack and play the opponent early 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.489
 to surprise in apathy 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.180
 but before we do that we will 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.489
 First, a look at the building 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:03.030
 units and abilities leads gentlemen 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:06.510
 throw the 41 we expect 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.890
 start with command center and sc wheat 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.780
 the command center is the main building 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.740
 Here is the thermal worker 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.920
 So the scs produce it pointed collect 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.439
 minerals and westin gas and give 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.280
 these resources at the main building so 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.189
 at the command center as well 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.320
 Build it building 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.200
 If you give a building in order you have to 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.570
 suv over the entire construction period at the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.009
 construction site remain 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.590
 a command center granted in the player 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.350
 By the way, eleven free supply points 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.939
 the command center is very expensive and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.920
 so we do not always have a new one 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.439
 must direct command center when we 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.659
 new supply points are needed 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.770
 with every other breed a supply 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:00.500
 generator at the terranern is that that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.820
 Supply depot through this building 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.640
 we get eight after completion 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.409
 additional free supply points which we 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.710
 then fill again with units 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.830
 can 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.750
 our zivis can minerals 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.100
 just like that 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.230
 just send one to 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.060
 Minerals field and the rest happened 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.720
 quite automatically, but we are out of gas 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.690
 can win cash in the wasps gas 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.190
 we need there first a building at 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.300
 The Terrans is called the building 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.790
 Refinery need a refinery on one 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.880
 wasps gasquet them before we set up 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.580
 can send there to gas 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.489
 So we can collect minerals 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.360
 we honored we can harvest gas and we 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.459
 can generate supply points 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.570
 after we finish a supply depot 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.620
 we can also have the first one 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.310
 production building of the terrans 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.920
 this is called barricks we have 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.410
 We can produce a barracks there 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.530
 Produce our first name younes 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.330
 as soon as you have finished a barracks 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.600
 lets the command center become one 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.280
 Remove robot command 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.989
 when the expansion is completed 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.120
 our main building now energy 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.940
 this energy is regenerated over time 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.680
 all alone 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.000
 and we can apply it to ours 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.739
 capabilities of the document 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.030
 the most important skill is for us 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.489
 First of all, the trouble in July is a 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.850
 additional worker we on our 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:45.360
 Minerals can be sent at 50 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.950
 Energy and increase our minerals 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.200
 income for the life of the 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.230
 Julian buildings can be so-called 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.200
 Addons produce there are exactly two 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.290
 addons the tray and the reactor 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.090
 Let's put a pÃ¤ckli barricks 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.090
 There are additional unit types 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.030
 then unlocked in barricks 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.430
 can produce, we use against 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.940
 We can have a reactor there 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.650
 Two units at once produce the 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:23.110
 Capacities thus increase by 100 percent 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.419
 however, technip and reactors can be used 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.840
 do not combine that means we 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.600
 Can with home reactor only units 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.979
 twice as fast produce no 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:39.400
 In addition, tablets may be needed 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.460
 imtech lab upgrades for the units 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.410
 you can produce, however, 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.930
 Next we'll throw one 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.130
 look at the poor units we often see 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.919
 Produce here once in the barricks 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.630
 first of all there is the mary whom he 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.700
 it is the absolute basis of the 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.690
 terraner and he has one 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:04.750
 Distance attack marines can be on ground 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.060
 and on air units shoot that 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.810
 beautiful marin is that he is in progress 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.669
 of the game continues to improve 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.870
 so he even in late gameplay 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:19.419
 strong marines can be left without 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.250
 produce daily with docked 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.410
 Reactor can be in barricks so 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.070
 produce two marines simultaneously 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:32.110
 the second unit in the mountain is the 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:34.060
 Killers endure more than marines and 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.920
 make bonus damage went armored 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.780
 so poverty young 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.630
 Broder can only be helped out of a box 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.820
 docked tekla production in 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.160
 Opposite to the marines can or only 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.600
 on ground units shoot the third 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.080
 unit on which we still have a look 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:55.620
 throw is the rapper ifa 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.230
 is mostly only the very early game 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.180
 so produced in the early game and 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.150
 used to find out where the enemy is 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.040
 is and first information about the 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.590
 strategy of the opponent to be able to collect 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.350
 it is suitable for especially as he 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.000
 very fast and he is over one 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.060
 has more special features 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.400
 namely cliffs jumping up and down 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.970
 which is why he is particularly easy in 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.800
 to reach the opponent's base 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.650
 reaper can be produced without text 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.390
 As last 7 we get the first upgrade 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.840
 So the first improvement 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:35.040
 which we will explore on 41 namely 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:37.710
 the commercials leave this upgrade 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.250
 in a tackling to explore the 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:44.220
 a barricks docked it raises the 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.180
 life points our marys leaving these 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.180
 to endure more
