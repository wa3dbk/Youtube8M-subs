00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
was absolutely amazing and I'll put up

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.440 
was absolutely amazing and I'll put up
some<00:05:15.919> pictures<00:05:16.430> and<00:05:16.880> it<00:05:16.970> was<00:05:17.060> still<00:05:17.270> pretty

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
some pictures and it was still pretty

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.050 
some pictures and it was still pretty
defined<00:05:18.020> you<00:05:18.410> can<00:05:18.440> without<00:05:18.890> using<00:05:19.400> a<00:05:19.490> style<00:05:19.790> or

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
defined you can without using a style or

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.820 
defined you can without using a style or
so<00:05:20.240> I<00:05:20.270> thought<00:05:21.050> that<00:05:21.200> was<00:05:21.260> awesome<00:05:21.410> like<00:05:21.680> in

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
so I thought that was awesome like in

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.990 
so I thought that was awesome like in
the<00:05:21.890> morning<00:05:22.160> I<00:05:22.190> sprayed<00:05:22.520> some<00:05:22.550> water<00:05:22.820> on<00:05:22.940> my

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
the morning I sprayed some water on my

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.880 
the morning I sprayed some water on my
hair<00:05:23.240> and<00:05:23.630> I<00:05:23.840> didn't<00:05:24.169> even<00:05:24.290> do<00:05:24.440> my<00:05:24.560> hair<00:05:24.770> all

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
hair and I didn't even do my hair all

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.760 
hair and I didn't even do my hair all
day<00:05:25.070> because<00:05:25.280> I<00:05:25.520> felt<00:05:25.790> like<00:05:25.880> it<00:05:26.630> you<00:05:27.230> know<00:05:27.350> felt

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
day because I felt like it you know felt

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.510 
day because I felt like it you know felt
good<00:05:27.950> and<00:05:28.250> it<00:05:28.400> looks<00:05:28.580> good<00:05:29.770> so<00:05:30.770> I<00:05:30.800> think<00:05:31.160> that

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
good and it looks good so I think that

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.610 
good and it looks good so I think that
this<00:05:31.669> is<00:05:31.820> an<00:05:31.970> awesome<00:05:32.210> moisturizer<00:05:32.990> it

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
this is an awesome moisturizer it

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.310 
this is an awesome moisturizer it
doesn't<00:05:34.160> it<00:05:34.400> defines<00:05:34.940> curls<00:05:35.419> a<00:05:35.510> bit<00:05:35.750> it

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
doesn't it defines curls a bit it

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.080 
doesn't it defines curls a bit it
doesn't<00:05:36.650> really<00:05:36.770> provide<00:05:37.160> a<00:05:37.310> lot<00:05:37.430> of<00:05:37.610> pumping

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
doesn't really provide a lot of pumping

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.240 
doesn't really provide a lot of pumping
I<00:05:38.240> think<00:05:38.510> that's<00:05:38.750> because<00:05:39.230> it's<00:05:39.410> more<00:05:39.530> creamy

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
I think that's because it's more creamy

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.790 
I think that's because it's more creamy
base<00:05:40.490> rather<00:05:41.000> than<00:05:41.270> water<00:05:41.960> base<00:05:42.230> at<00:05:42.470> least<00:05:42.590> on

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
base rather than water base at least on

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.680 
base rather than water base at least on
my<00:05:42.950> hair<00:05:43.220> I<00:05:43.430> get<00:05:43.669> more<00:05:43.970> clumping<00:05:44.450> when

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
my hair I get more clumping when

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.590 
my hair I get more clumping when
something<00:05:45.140> is<00:05:45.260> worried<00:05:45.950> rather<00:05:46.910> than<00:05:47.270> if<00:05:47.419> it's

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
something is worried rather than if it's

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.710 
something is worried rather than if it's
creamy<00:05:47.930> so<00:05:48.320> I<00:05:48.669> think<00:05:49.669> that's<00:05:50.120> why<00:05:50.450> that

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
creamy so I think that's why that

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.470 
creamy so I think that's why that
happened<00:05:51.169> but<00:05:51.740> I<00:05:51.770> mean<00:05:52.160> definitely<00:05:52.820> use<00:05:53.180> this

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
happened but I mean definitely use this

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.800 
happened but I mean definitely use this
if<00:05:53.900> you<00:05:53.960> want<00:05:54.800> to<00:05:54.890> do<00:05:55.100> any<00:05:55.460> kind<00:05:55.970> of<00:05:56.150> protective

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
if you want to do any kind of protective

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.540 
if you want to do any kind of protective
styles<00:05:57.530> because<00:05:57.830> it's<00:05:58.040> supposed<00:05:58.220> to<00:05:58.280> be<00:05:58.340> for

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
styles because it's supposed to be for

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.450 
styles because it's supposed to be for
fine<00:05:58.790> and<00:05:58.820> thin<00:05:59.360> hair<00:05:59.630> okay<00:06:00.290> my<00:06:00.770> hair<00:06:01.010> is<00:06:01.250> not

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
fine and thin hair okay my hair is not

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.900 
fine and thin hair okay my hair is not
fine<00:06:01.970> and<00:06:02.390> it's<00:06:02.870> not<00:06:02.960> fun<00:06:03.440> at<00:06:03.919> all<00:06:03.950> and<00:06:04.669> it<00:06:04.790> was

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
fine and it's not fun at all and it was

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.530 
fine and it's not fun at all and it was
still<00:06:05.590> moisturizing<00:06:06.590> enough<00:06:06.919> for<00:06:07.280> my<00:06:07.790> hair<00:06:08.030> so

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
still moisturizing enough for my hair so

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.240 
still moisturizing enough for my hair so
I<00:06:08.570> think<00:06:08.720> it<00:06:09.230> would<00:06:09.320> be<00:06:09.440> great<00:06:09.650> if<00:06:09.980> you<00:06:10.100> were

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
I think it would be great if you were

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.180 
I think it would be great if you were
like<00:06:10.460> I'm<00:06:10.700> transitioning<00:06:11.600> and<00:06:12.530> I<00:06:12.830> can<00:06:13.010> feel

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
like I'm transitioning and I can feel

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.500 
like I'm transitioning and I can feel
like<00:06:13.400> a<00:06:13.460> light<00:06:13.730> hair<00:06:14.000> dresser

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
like a light hair dresser

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.720 
like a light hair dresser
way<00:06:14.690> down<00:06:14.900> your<00:06:15.050> hair<00:06:15.080> too<00:06:15.440> much<00:06:15.470> or<00:06:15.920> you<00:06:16.610> know

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
if you were doing twist bantu knots

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.940 
if you were doing twist bantu knots

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
would I feel like this would be an

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.660 
would I feel like this would be an
awesome<00:06:23.410> braid<00:06:24.410> cream<00:06:24.860> even<00:06:25.310> if<00:06:25.400> you<00:06:25.520> were

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 
awesome braid cream even if you were

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.130 
awesome braid cream even if you were
just<00:06:25.700> like<00:06:25.940> putting<00:06:26.540> your<00:06:26.630> hair<00:06:26.780> in<00:06:26.870> a<00:06:26.930> French

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.140 
just like putting your hair in a French

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.350 
just like putting your hair in a French
braid<00:06:27.350> because<00:06:27.710> the<00:06:28.280> consistency<00:06:28.610> kind<00:06:29.210> of

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
braid because the consistency kind of

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.930 
braid because the consistency kind of
reminds<00:06:29.810> me<00:06:29.960> of<00:06:30.170> a<00:06:30.650> hair<00:06:30.920> lotion<00:06:31.370> but<00:06:31.700> just

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
reminds me of a hair lotion but just

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.450 
reminds me of a hair lotion but just
thicker<00:06:32.270> so<00:06:32.990> I<00:06:33.440> don't<00:06:33.740> know<00:06:33.860> I<00:06:33.890> think<00:06:34.130> it's

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
thicker so I don't know I think it's

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.150 
thicker so I don't know I think it's
great<00:06:34.760> and<00:06:34.970> because<00:06:35.810> of<00:06:35.840> the<00:06:36.470> ingredients

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160
