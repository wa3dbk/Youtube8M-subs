00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.939 
a 7 out of 10
I<00:06:21.699> think<00:06:22.699> the<00:06:22.789> wit<00:06:23.030> creamy<00:06:23.650> marshmallow<00:06:24.650> thing

I think the wit creamy marshmallow thing

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:26.469 
I think the wit creamy marshmallow thing
on<00:06:25.070> the<00:06:25.130> inside<00:06:25.430> needed<00:06:25.849> to<00:06:25.940> be<00:06:26.090> solid

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
on the inside needed to be solid

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.839 
on the inside needed to be solid
marshmallow<00:06:26.990> and<00:06:27.310> that<00:06:28.310> that<00:06:28.550> would<00:06:28.699> be

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
marshmallow and that that would be

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:30.490 
marshmallow and that that would be
really<00:06:29.360> sort<00:06:29.570> of<00:06:29.599> taken<00:06:29.960> up<00:06:30.050> to<00:06:30.169> the<00:06:30.199> next

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
really sort of taken up to the next

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.500 
really sort of taken up to the next
level<00:06:30.770> but<00:06:30.949> I<00:06:31.160> really<00:06:31.729> do<00:06:31.880> like<00:06:32.060> that<00:06:32.270> and<00:06:32.450> I

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
level but I really do like that and I

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.390 
level but I really do like that and I
can<00:06:32.690> understand<00:06:33.229> why<00:06:33.289> those<00:06:33.620> would<00:06:33.800> be<00:06:33.919> really

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
can understand why those would be really

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.150 
can understand why those would be really
really<00:06:34.669> sort<00:06:35.030> of<00:06:35.590> popular<00:06:36.590> if<00:06:36.710> they're<00:06:36.860> only
