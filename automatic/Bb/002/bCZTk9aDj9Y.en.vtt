00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
really know that much about it didn't

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.860 
really know that much about it didn't
know<00:05:28.910> where<00:05:29.060> they<00:05:29.150> came<00:05:29.360> from<00:05:29.540> if<00:05:29.690> they<00:05:29.810> were

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
know where they came from if they were

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.420 
know where they came from if they were
authentic<00:05:30.200> anything<00:05:30.710> else<00:05:30.860> so<00:05:30.980> the<00:05:31.100> entire

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
authentic anything else so the entire

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.580 
authentic anything else so the entire
class<00:05:31.490> was<00:05:32.150> based<00:05:32.420> around<00:05:32.660> these<00:05:32.960> it's<00:05:33.290> 12

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
class was based around these it's 12

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.710 
class was based around these it's 12
students<00:05:34.130> and<00:05:34.910> we<00:05:34.970> each<00:05:35.180> got<00:05:35.360> a<00:05:35.420> different

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
students and we each got a different

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.270 
students and we each got a different
research<00:05:36.050> topic<00:05:36.500> and<00:05:36.620> it<00:05:36.890> was<00:05:37.010> research

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
research topic and it was research

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.340 
research topic and it was research
having<00:05:37.520> said<00:05:37.760> no<00:05:38.000> we<00:05:38.180> nobody<00:05:38.810> knew<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.080> answer

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
having said no we nobody knew the answer

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.580 
having said no we nobody knew the answer
so<00:05:39.530> we<00:05:39.650> are<00:05:39.740> the<00:05:39.860> only<00:05:40.070> ones<00:05:40.430> we<00:05:40.760> are<00:05:40.790> the

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
so we are the only ones we are the

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.290 
so we are the only ones we are the
leading<00:05:42.590> experts<00:05:43.190> in<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.370> world<00:05:43.430> about<00:05:44.030> these

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
leading experts in the world about these

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.520 
leading experts in the world about these
