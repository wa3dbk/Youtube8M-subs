00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.600 
yeah I didn't use the tape that came
feels<00:03:54.170> like<00:03:54.350> more<00:03:54.590> stretch<00:03:54.920> because<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.430> don't

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
feels like more stretch because I don't

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.550 
feels like more stretch because I don't
really<00:03:55.880> want<00:03:56.240> to

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
really want to

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.729 
really want to
I'm<00:03:58.400> still<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.540> know<00:03:59.590> debating<00:04:00.590> with<00:04:00.709> myself

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
I'm still you know debating with myself

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.089 
I'm still you know debating with myself
about<00:04:01.280> that<00:04:01.550> and<00:04:02.200> anyway<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.260> was<00:04:03.500> just<00:04:03.560> trying

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
about that and anyway I was just trying

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.850 
about that and anyway I was just trying
it<00:04:04.190> on<00:04:04.280> top<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:05.810> use<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.709> combs<00:04:06.980> here<00:04:07.520> and<00:04:07.760> here

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
it on top I use the combs here and here

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.610 
it on top I use the combs here and here
there<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.240> don't<00:04:10.300> really<00:04:10.690> like<00:04:11.020> the<00:04:11.290> way<00:04:11.410> it

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
there and I don't really like the way it

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.490 
there and I don't really like the way it
looks<00:04:11.950> just<00:04:12.250> Center<00:04:12.670> down<00:04:13.140> Center<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.290> reduce

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
looks just Center down Center and reduce

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.729 
looks just Center down Center and reduce
Falls<00:04:14.770> so<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.540> rolled<00:04:16.540> these<00:04:16.810> two<00:04:17.140> little<00:04:17.440> twist

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
Falls so I rolled these two little twist

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.870 
Falls so I rolled these two little twist
on<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:18.040> side<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:19.170> I<00:04:20.170> seem<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.739> like<00:04:20.980> it<00:04:21.250> better

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
on the side and I seem to like it better

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.900 
on the side and I seem to like it better
that<00:04:22.030> way<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.830> I<00:04:23.860> think<00:04:24.010> whenever<00:04:24.490> I<00:04:24.700> wear<00:04:24.850> the

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
that way so I think whenever I wear the

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.850 
that way so I think whenever I wear the
wave<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.540> just<00:04:25.690> wear<00:04:25.930> like<00:04:25.960> this<00:04:28.440> but<00:04:29.440> other

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
wave and just wear like this but other

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.790 
wave and just wear like this but other
than<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:31.630> know<00:04:31.660> I<00:04:31.960> notice<00:04:32.350> that<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.560> wig

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
than that you know I notice that the wig

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.100 
than that you know I notice that the wig
is<00:04:33.100> did<00:04:33.520> shed

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.550 

each<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.620> lot<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.280> know<00:04:39.310> it<00:04:40.000> did<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.480> it<00:04:41.350> really

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
each a lot you know it did and it really

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.350 
each a lot you know it did and it really
reminded<00:04:42.190> me<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.630> weave<00:04:43.630> hair<00:04:43.990> definitely

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
reminded me of weave hair definitely

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.570 
reminded me of weave hair definitely
Loutre<00:04:46.360> specifically<00:04:47.110> as<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:47.980> run<00:04:48.160> my<00:04:48.310> hands

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
Loutre specifically as I run my hands

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.540 
Loutre specifically as I run my hands
through<00:04:48.790> and<00:04:49.350> same<00:04:50.350> feeling<00:04:50.830> feels<00:04:51.190> just<00:04:51.490> like

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
through and same feeling feels just like

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.760 
through and same feeling feels just like
human<00:04:52.000> hair<00:04:52.150> except<00:04:52.510> you<00:04:52.630> really<00:04:52.990> don't<00:04:53.620> want

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
human hair except you really don't want

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.230 
human hair except you really don't want
to<00:04:53.800> waste<00:04:53.950> the<00:04:54.070> time<00:04:54.280> to<00:04:54.460> curl<00:04:54.700> this<00:04:54.790> anyway

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
to waste the time to curl this anyway

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.060 
to waste the time to curl this anyway
because

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.070

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
a little bit

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.040 
a little bit
this<00:06:29.490> is<00:06:29.580> one<00:06:29.730> of<00:06:29.760> all<00:06:30.000> mines<00:06:30.240> like<00:06:30.480> leave<00:06:30.780> here

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
this is one of all mines like leave here

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.520 
this is one of all mines like leave here
I<00:06:31.080> used<00:06:31.560> to<00:06:31.680> use<00:06:31.770> a<00:06:31.950> Fantasia<00:06:32.580> sir

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
I used to use a Fantasia sir

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.710 
I used to use a Fantasia sir
and<00:06:34.740> it<00:06:35.190> didn't<00:06:35.460> shed<00:06:35.670> as<00:06:35.820> much<00:06:36.000> my<00:06:36.210> use<00:06:36.540> that

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
and it didn't shed as much my use that

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.610 
and it didn't shed as much my use that
so<00:06:36.990> I<00:06:37.020> think<00:06:37.139> I'm<00:06:37.560> gonna<00:06:37.919> Rob<00:06:38.190> Iceland<00:06:38.790> and<00:06:39.620> use

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
so I think I'm gonna Rob Iceland and use

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.460 
so I think I'm gonna Rob Iceland and use
that<00:06:40.940> but<00:06:41.940> for<00:06:42.300> now<00:06:42.360> I<00:06:42.780> think<00:06:42.840> I'm<00:06:43.169> gonna<00:06:43.320> just

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
that but for now I think I'm gonna just

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.960 
that but for now I think I'm gonna just
put<00:06:43.620> it<00:06:43.710> back<00:06:43.830> in<00:06:43.950> the<00:06:44.010> box<00:06:44.220> and<00:06:44.550> wear<00:06:44.820> it<00:06:44.850> again

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
put it back in the box and wear it again
