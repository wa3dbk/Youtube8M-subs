00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.770
 and advice but that are of the best is 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.230
 that the samur in another video of better 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.140
 cars for your home if the second 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.670
 chapter but the chapter episode like 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.590
 they want to tell you but before you start 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.989
 I want to tell you a couple of things 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.390
 happy New Year 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.600
 happy new year and Christmas devastated and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.980
 good having said that we started the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.020
 first car is a car called the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.050
 balonmÃ¡n to one of my favorites 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.730
 apart from being the classic sports car 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.070
 like it a lot because of the way it can be 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.080
 have can be studied by very very 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.699
 beautiful and if you put the color that is 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.309
 that I have it right now on screen 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.230
 Well, you can see it very beautiful apart 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.960
 It can be put as a style could 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.640
 metallic on the sides 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.630
 and also an engine compartment 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.580
 of the engine motor that gives it a touch 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.979
 special to this car is one of my 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.960
 preferred and I will always have my garage what 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.580
 you can find around these 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.550
 saints custom 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.800
 and I do not see the location because it appears 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.050
 randomly and if maybe they were going 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.600
 on this road here you can 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.610
 find is a miracle because this 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.710
 car is very difficult to find the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.290
 second car is a gas street called 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.930
 dincap lists a name that's super weird 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.700
 but apart from being a bit chubby having 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.580
 the back very chubby I like 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.020
 a lot because you can not have very nice 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.940
 in what you can have very nice 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.770
 but it looks very nice if you 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.990
 you can study very nice also like 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.370
 there may be here you can study it 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.750
 little then to the Chinese style then and the 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.190
 back of the back is the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.020
 you can put it you can change it very 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.400
 well alike that forward and one that 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.740
 more I like this car is that you 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.690
 you can change the part of the engine if 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.820
 this part of up here that is 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.100
 so you can put very well and give you the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.440
 special touch to that car for all the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.110
 car we have the saber turbo one of my 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.060
 favorite cars because good all my 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.160
 favorite charges this car it is 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.170
 special because you can put on the 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.900
 compartment engine engine 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.670
 similar to balÃ­n mÃ¡laga but in case 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.880
 this what the truck lights 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.270
 It's similar to the one 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.070
 of 'fast and furious' is very similar 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.620
 seemed just that the color that the 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.320
 exposed is not very similar but gives 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.540
 just like that more just this car like 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.230
 can see is the front part that 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.630
 you can put it as saying no no no 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.370
 a word comes out now as it is not me 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.050
 name right now but you can 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.510
 put past the last car is a 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.100
 car than another one that I like the most 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.530
 but I do not have it in my garage because I do not 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.810
 I have space is a car called karim 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.710
 soccer what I like most about this case 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:07.040
 is the car car that I do not speak well is 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:09.710
 the spoiler alegrÃ³n people who have more the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.620
 exhaust pipe that is the eo room so for 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.660
 outside and it's very big and this is 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.550
 very well in this car apart that no 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.200
 you can study is worth the location of 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.660
 this car is randomly you can 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.580
 find just that you enter to 27 online 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.620
 you can see it where it wants to be and this 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.480
 it was all people I hope the state we 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.430
 we see in the next video do not forget how 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.430
 to live and to another 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.819
 3
