any<00:01:29.120> priority<00:01:29.840> they<00:01:29.960> know<00:01:30.320> if<00:01:30.650> we<00:01:30.740> didn't<00:01:30.980> have

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
any priority they know if we didn't have

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.780 
any priority they know if we didn't have
ABS<00:01:31.400> on<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.610> what<00:01:31.730> would<00:01:31.760> it<00:01:31.850> do<00:01:33.520> so<00:01:34.520> if<00:01:34.580> you<00:01:34.670> hit

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
ABS on it what would it do so if you hit

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.890 
ABS on it what would it do so if you hit
the<00:01:34.850> brakes<00:01:35.000> hard<00:01:35.240> like<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:35.480> did<00:01:35.690> there<00:01:35.810> we

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
the brakes hard like you did there we

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.190 
the brakes hard like you did there we
would<00:01:36.020> say<00:01:36.290> bsp<00:01:37.360> anti-lock<00:01:38.360> braking<00:01:38.870> system

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
would say bsp anti-lock braking system

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.890 
would say bsp anti-lock braking system
stopping<00:01:39.710> yet<00:01:40.310> look<00:01:40.520> stop<00:01:41.360> yeah<00:01:41.600> it's<00:01:41.720> not<00:01:41.780> on

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
stopping yet look stop yeah it's not on

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.100

steer that's all it does steering wheels

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.080 
steer that's all it does steering wheels
more<00:01:48.230> than<00:01:48.440> just<00:01:48.620> steering<00:01:48.860> it's<00:01:49.580> it's<00:01:49.910> a<00:01:49.970> way

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
more than just steering it's it's a way

have a couple of times I do yeah
probably<00:01:54.200> I'm<00:01:54.380> doing<00:01:54.590> we're<00:01:55.220> gonna<00:01:55.330> figure<00:01:56.330> of

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
probably I'm doing we're gonna figure of

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.260 
probably I'm doing we're gonna figure of
eight<00:01:56.630> yep<00:01:57.530> follow<00:01:58.070> demonstrate<00:01:58.910> we<00:01:59.120> need<00:01:59.210> a

eight yep follow demonstrate we need a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.540 
eight yep follow demonstrate we need a

from<00:02:03.650> skidding<00:02:04.070> completely<00:02:04.460> okay<00:02:05.240> this<00:02:05.420> stops

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
from skidding completely okay this stops

from skidding completely okay this stops
you<00:02:05.750> why<00:02:06.290> would<00:02:06.410> I<00:02:06.470> stop<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:06.740> from<00:02:06.800> skidding

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
you why would I stop you from skidding

mister<00:02:42.249> what<00:02:42.730> we're<00:02:42.849> going<00:02:42.969> to<00:02:43.030> do<00:02:43.180> now<00:02:43.329> to

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:43.389 
mister what we're going to do now to

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.479 
mister what we're going to do now to
have<00:02:43.599> a<00:02:43.629> demonstration<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.469> when<00:02:44.859> city<00:02:45.189> stop

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
have a demonstration of when city stop

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.670 
have a demonstration of when city stop
works<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.239> laser<00:02:46.450> reflects<00:02:47.170> back<00:02:47.409> and

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
works that the laser reflects back and

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.410 
works that the laser reflects back and
it<00:02:47.799> takes<00:02:48.069> over<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> braking<00:02:48.790> for<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.359> if

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
it takes over the braking for you and if

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.479 
it takes over the braking for you and if
if<00:02:49.659> I<00:02:49.780> if<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.049> go<00:02:50.230> through<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.859> barrier<00:02:51.040> then

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
if I if I go through the barrier then

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.220 
if I if I go through the barrier then
does<00:02:51.879> that<00:02:51.909> mean<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.209> I'm<00:02:52.810> more<00:02:52.840> intelligent

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
does that mean that I'm more intelligent

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.879 
does that mean that I'm more intelligent
you<00:02:53.680> progress<00:02:54.370> I'm<00:02:54.489> not<00:02:54.879> going<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.090> crash

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
you progress I'm not going to crash

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.030 
you progress I'm not going to crash
progress<00:02:57.419> shake<00:02:58.419> on<00:02:58.569> it

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
progress shake on it

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.890 
progress shake on it
it's<00:03:00.040> like<00:03:00.189> ABS<00:03:00.669> if<00:03:00.849> you<00:03:00.909> use<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.180> B<00:03:01.419> I<00:03:01.450> think<00:03:01.540> I

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
it's like ABS if you use a B I think I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.599 
it's like ABS if you use a B I think I
never<00:03:02.109> use<00:03:02.290> ABS<00:03:02.680> car<00:03:02.889> guys<00:03:03.069> don't<00:03:03.310> you're

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
never use ABS car guys don't you're

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.550 
never use ABS car guys don't you're
driving<00:03:03.939> towards<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.269> car<00:03:04.540> as<00:03:05.230> if<00:03:05.379> we're<00:03:05.530> a

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
driving towards the car as if we're a

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.780 
driving towards the car as if we're a
driving<00:03:05.889> in<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.010> city<00:03:08.250> don't<00:03:09.250> touch<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.579> brake

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
driving in a city don't touch the brake

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.390 
driving in a city don't touch the brake
don't<00:03:10.060> touch<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.329> rain<00:03:10.540> don't<00:03:10.810> touch<00:03:10.959> right

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.319 

you're<00:03:18.400> pretty<00:03:18.609> shocked<00:03:18.819> about<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.150> right

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
you're pretty shocked about that right

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.509 
you're pretty shocked about that right
yeah<00:03:19.750> does<00:03:20.109> that<00:03:20.230> mean<00:03:20.439> that<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.650> 5:1<00:03:21.280> as<00:03:21.459> a

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
yeah does that mean that I 5:1 as a

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.699 
yeah does that mean that I 5:1 as a
human<00:03:21.879> so<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.239> idea<00:03:22.599> of<00:03:22.659> this<00:03:22.780> exercise<00:03:22.840> is<00:03:23.319> to

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
human so the idea of this exercise is to

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.580 
human so the idea of this exercise is to
get<00:03:23.829> round<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.579> course<00:03:24.900> not<00:03:25.900> as<00:03:26.049> quickly<00:03:26.349> as

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
get round the course not as quickly as

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.209 
get round the course not as quickly as
you<00:03:26.620> can

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:27.219 
you can

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:29.520 
you can
but<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> speed<00:03:27.819> you<00:03:28.569> know<00:03:28.689> relatively<00:03:29.230> safe

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
but a speed you know relatively safe

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.929 
but a speed you know relatively safe
what<00:03:29.859> what<00:03:30.010> sort<00:03:30.159> of<00:03:30.250> things<00:03:30.310> distract<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:30.849> on
