00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
niche within our tool tutorial and today

niche within our tool tutorial and today
we're<00:00:15.929> going<00:00:16.080> through<00:00:16.410> experiment<00:00:17.070> ties<00:00:17.670> with

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
we're going through experiment ties with

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.900 
we're going through experiment ties with
the<00:00:18.210> muscle<00:00:18.720> tool<00:00:18.930> what<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.010> does<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the muscle tool what this does is it

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.570 
the muscle tool what this does is it
makes<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> two<00:00:21.539> props<00:00:21.960> go<00:00:22.859> towards<00:00:23.340> each

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
makes the two props go towards each

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.490 
makes the two props go towards each
other

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
other

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.269 
other
you<00:00:25.500> see<00:00:27.080> anyways<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.710> stop<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.070> by

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
you see anyways you can stop this by

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.089 
you see anyways you can stop this by
pressing<00:00:29.490> C<00:00:29.880> which<00:00:30.630> also<00:00:31.019> opens<00:00:31.380> my<00:00:31.590> control

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
pressing C which also opens my control

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.770 
pressing C which also opens my control
and<00:00:32.369> physically<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:36.030> expansion<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
and physically and the expansion it

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.479 
and physically and the expansion it
means<00:00:37.050> how<00:00:37.260> far<00:00:37.530> away<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> props<00:00:38.190> are<00:00:38.309> from

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
means how far away the props are from

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.340 
means how far away the props are from
each<00:00:38.610> other<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.300> put<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.719> for<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
each other so if I put this for like a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.940 
each other so if I put this for like a
thousand<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:43.160> very<00:00:44.160> far<00:00:44.489> away<00:00:44.579> from<00:00:44.879> each<00:00:44.969> other

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
thousand a very far away from each other

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.910 
thousand a very far away from each other
but<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.879> can<00:00:48.000> also<00:00:48.149> choose<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> time<00:00:49.110> for

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
but you can also choose to time for

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
but you can also choose to time for
example<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.579> put<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.120> -<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.989> saw<00:00:52.170> it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
example if I put it on - you saw it

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.720 
example if I put it on - you saw it
before<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.920> put<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.280> stand<00:00:54.739> it<00:00:55.739> will

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
before and if I put it on stand it will

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.650 
before and if I put it on stand it will
do<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> very<00:00:57.090> fast<00:00:58.820> you<00:00:59.820> see<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.300> fast<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
do it very fast you see so fast you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
do it very fast you see so fast you
can't<00:01:00.840> even<00:01:00.930> see<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:03.739> fixed<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.040> means

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
can't even see it and fixed this means

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.140 
can't even see it and fixed this means
that<00:01:06.140> if<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.580> activated<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:08.790> make<00:01:09.119> sure

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
that if it's activated it will make sure

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.060 
that if it's activated it will make sure
that<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.659> prop<00:01:09.869> doesn't<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.320> around<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.860> so

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
that the prop doesn't go around it so

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.390 
that the prop doesn't go around it so
wild<00:01:11.640> through<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.880> marshal<00:01:12.390> thing<00:01:13.100> if<00:01:14.100> this

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
wild through the marshal thing if this

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.060 
wild through the marshal thing if this
was<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:14.790> activated<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.630> will<00:01:15.780> screw<00:01:16.590> itself

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
was not activated it will screw itself

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.679 
was not activated it will screw itself
up<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.549> could<00:01:17.909> show<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.180> an<00:01:18.330> example<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:21.630> this

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
up I could show you an example and this

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.730 
up I could show you an example and this
seems<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.830> bit<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:24.119> stop<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> bit<00:01:24.689> let's<00:01:25.530> try

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
seems just a bit to stop a bit let's try

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.310 
seems just a bit to stop a bit let's try
again<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:27.150> see<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.360> socially<00:01:28.020> screw<00:01:28.200> up

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
again you see it socially screw up

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.679 
again you see it socially screw up
themself<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> does<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.060> makes<00:01:30.299> them

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
themself so what it does it makes them

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.010 
themself so what it does it makes them
go<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.759> does<00:01:32.909> make<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.150> turn<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:33.689> it

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
go so that it does make it turn up it

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.749 
go so that it does make it turn up it
does<00:01:34.170> make<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> props<00:01:34.710> turn<00:01:34.890> around<00:01:35.130> its<00:01:35.640> own

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
does make a props turn around its own

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.780 
does make a props turn around its own
axis<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.530> solid<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
axis and here is the solid if it is

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
axis and here is the solid if it is
selected<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.780> marshal<00:01:40.259> will<00:01:40.710> activate

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
selected the marshal will activate

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.609 
selected the marshal will activate
immediately<00:01:41.759> when<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.810> selected<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> do

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
immediately when you have selected to do

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.330 
immediately when you have selected to do
props<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.420> not<00:01:45.659> selected<00:01:46.340> you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
props but if it's not selected you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.130 
props but if it's not selected you
actually<00:01:47.670> started<00:01:47.909> yourself<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.780> anyways

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
actually started yourself but anyways

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.700 
actually started yourself but anyways
this<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.680> weight<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.490> not<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.320> how<00:01:52.320> thick

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
this is the weight or not and how thick

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.859 
this is the weight or not and how thick
the<00:01:53.070> rope<00:01:53.310> what<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.670> wanted<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.329> for

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
the rope what you wanted to be for

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.469 
the rope what you wanted to be for
example<00:01:55.110> if<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.290> put<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.619> at<00:01:55.939> one<00:01:56.939> point<00:01:57.149> five

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
example if I put it at one point five

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.690 
example if I put it at one point five
two<00:01:58.140> will<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.100> very<00:01:59.340> small<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.049> if<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.549> put<00:02:02.549> it

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
two will be very small and if I put it

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.570 
two will be very small and if I put it
at<00:02:02.990> twice<00:02:04.040> it'll<00:02:05.040> be<00:02:05.159> very<00:02:05.610> very<00:02:05.790> thick<00:02:06.299> and

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
at twice it'll be very very thick and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.479 
at twice it'll be very very thick and
you<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.700> also<00:02:09.440> choose<00:02:10.440> which<00:02:10.770> start<00:02:11.160> off<00:02:11.280> rope

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
you can also choose which start off rope

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.210 
you can also choose which start off rope
you<00:02:11.580> want

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
you want

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.880
