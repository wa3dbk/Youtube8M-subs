00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
sometimes in binocular terminology is

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.660 
sometimes in binocular terminology is
roof<00:00:11.730> prism<00:00:12.030> or<00:00:12.330> Porro<00:00:12.660> prism<00:00:13.280> those<00:00:14.280> are<00:00:14.519> the

two most popular prism styles used in
binoculars<00:00:18.930> nowadays<00:00:20.029> what<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.210> means<00:00:21.630> is

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
binoculars nowadays what that means is

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.529 
binoculars nowadays what that means is
um<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.340> physical<00:00:23.699> geometry<00:00:24.480> of

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
um it's it's the physical geometry of

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.839 
um it's it's the physical geometry of
the<00:00:24.750> prism<00:00:25.170> that's<00:00:25.350> inside<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.189> binocular

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
the prism that's inside the binocular

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.910 
the prism that's inside the binocular
that<00:00:27.480> determines<00:00:27.960> whether<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.439> roof<00:00:28.650> or<00:00:28.890> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
that determines whether it's a roof or a

lenses now why is it important to know
the<00:01:00.149> differences<00:01:00.570> between<00:01:00.719> those<00:01:01.320> well

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
the differences between those well

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.410 
the differences between those well
practically<00:01:04.979> speaking<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.729> roof<00:01:06.180> prism

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
practically speaking a roof prism

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.649 
practically speaking a roof prism
binocular<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.740> more<00:01:08.040> compact

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
binocular is going to be more compact

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.910 
binocular is going to be more compact
generally<00:01:09.659> lighter<00:01:09.900> weight<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.380> generally

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
generally lighter weight and generally

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.640 
generally lighter weight and generally
it's<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> better<00:01:12.260> it's<00:01:13.260> easier

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
it's going to have a better it's easier

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.280 
it's going to have a better it's easier
to<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> better<00:01:14.460> build<00:01:14.760> quality<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.570> it's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
to have a better build quality and it's

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.340 
to have a better build quality and it's
easier<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.390> waterproof<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.659> binocular

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
easier to waterproof the binocular

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.160 
easier to waterproof the binocular
however<00:01:20.250> there's<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.670> some<00:01:21.210> trade-off<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:21.930> well

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
however there's a some trade-off as well

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.210 
however there's a some trade-off as well
because<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.280> roof<00:01:23.490> prism<00:01:23.759> system<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.950> light

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
because in a roof prism system the light

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.090 
because in a roof prism system the light
actually<00:01:26.850> goes<00:01:27.060> through<00:01:27.090> six<00:01:27.869> different

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
actually goes through six different

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.350 
actually goes through six different
reflections<00:01:29.100> when<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.759> bouncing<00:01:30.299> around

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
reflections when it's bouncing around

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.929 
reflections when it's bouncing around
inside<00:01:30.780> those<00:01:31.259> prisms<00:01:31.829> whereas<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> Porro

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
inside those prisms whereas a Porro

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.270 
inside those prisms whereas a Porro
prism<00:01:33.030> only<00:01:33.689> goes<00:01:33.869> through<00:01:33.900> four<00:01:34.530> reflections

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
prism only goes through four reflections

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.090 
prism only goes through four reflections
and<00:01:35.630> that's<00:01:36.630> important<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.259> each<00:01:37.680> time

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
and that's important because each time

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.219 
and that's important because each time
the<00:01:38.579> light<00:01:38.790> reflects<00:01:39.329> off<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> those

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the light reflects off of one of those

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.410 
the light reflects off of one of those
surfaces<00:01:40.530> inside<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> prison<00:01:41.759> you're<00:01:41.909> losing

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
surfaces inside the prison you're losing

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.870 
surfaces inside the prison you're losing
a<00:01:42.509> small<00:01:42.840> fraction<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> light<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> fewer

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
a small fraction of light so the fewer

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.149 
a small fraction of light so the fewer
reflections<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.590> more<00:01:46.890> light

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
reflections you have the more light

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.649 
reflections you have the more light
that's<00:01:47.430> transmitted<00:01:48.119> through<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> binocular

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that's transmitted through a binocular

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.280 
that's transmitted through a binocular
so<00:01:49.320> generally<00:01:50.280> speaking<00:01:50.420> it's<00:01:51.420> easier<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
so generally speaking it's easier and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.859 
so generally speaking it's easier and
cheaper<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.860> make<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.430> Porro<00:01:53.820> prism<00:01:53.939> binocular

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
cheaper to make a Porro prism binocular

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.730 
cheaper to make a Porro prism binocular
have<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:56.060> brighter<00:01:57.060> image<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.840> better<00:01:58.140> optical

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
have a brighter image and better optical

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.850 
have a brighter image and better optical
quality<00:01:59.340> than<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> roof<00:02:00.479> prism<00:02:00.780> binocular<00:02:01.619> um

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
quality than a roof prism binocular um

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.719 
quality than a roof prism binocular um
however<00:02:02.729> nowadays<00:02:03.570> um<00:02:04.040> with<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.250> popularity

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
however nowadays um with the popularity

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.270 
however nowadays um with the popularity
of<00:02:05.939> roof<00:02:06.299> prisms<00:02:06.780> manufacturers<00:02:07.590> have<00:02:07.770> really

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
of roof prisms manufacturers have really

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.800 
of roof prisms manufacturers have really
been<00:02:08.780> put<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> lot<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.200> R&amp;D<00:02:10.530> into<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.220> roof

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
been put a lot of R&amp;D into the roof

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.260 
been put a lot of R&amp;D into the roof
is<00:02:11.870> InDesign<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.580> can<00:02:13.760> still<00:02:14.060> get

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
is InDesign and so you can still get

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.930 
is InDesign and so you can still get
roof<00:02:14.510> prisms<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:14.959> are<00:02:15.200> very<00:02:16.069> high-end<00:02:16.700> and

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
roof prisms that are very high-end and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.940 
roof prisms that are very high-end and
very<00:02:17.390> good<00:02:17.660> quality<00:02:17.930> it's<00:02:18.349> just<00:02:18.650> you're<00:02:18.860> going
