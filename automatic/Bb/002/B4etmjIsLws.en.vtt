00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
last episode and that's because we hit a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.519

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
thing we really didn't think through and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.589 
thing we really didn't think through and
that<00:00:25.019> was<00:00:25.289> her<00:00:25.529> cage<00:00:25.859> design<00:00:26.400> as<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:27.480> may

on<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.010> cage<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.550> much<00:00:44.730> as<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.030> had

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
on with this cage as much as we had

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.850 
on with this cage as much as we had
hoped<00:00:45.360> she<00:00:46.020> would<00:00:46.110> spend<00:00:46.260> more<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.710> her<00:00:46.829> time

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
hoped she would spend more of her time

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.310 
hoped she would spend more of her time
underground<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.059> stopped<00:00:48.539> playing<00:00:48.930> she<00:00:49.289> was

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
underground and stopped playing she was

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.560 
underground and stopped playing she was
eating<00:00:49.860> less<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.340> was<00:00:50.730> really<00:00:51.120> worrying<00:00:51.449> about

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
eating less I was really worrying about

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.000 
eating less I was really worrying about
her<00:00:51.899> because<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.260> couldn't<00:00:52.500> seem<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.800> ever

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
her because we couldn't seem to ever

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.520 
her because we couldn't seem to ever
find<00:00:53.430> her<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.270> had<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.660> many<00:00:54.809> scares<00:00:55.320> from

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
find her and I had so many scares from

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.410 
find her and I had so many scares from
her<00:00:55.680> when<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:55.949> didn't<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.430> her<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:57.030> several

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
her when we didn't see her for several

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.510 
her when we didn't see her for several
days<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.899> several<00:00:58.260> nights<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.190> thought

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
days and several nights that I thought

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.700 
days and several nights that I thought
she'd<00:00:59.730> either<00:00:59.850> escaped<00:01:00.390> or<00:01:00.510> passed<00:01:01.079> away<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
she'd either escaped or passed away and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.529 
she'd either escaped or passed away and
at<00:01:02.010> first<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.489> didn't<00:01:02.940> think<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.300> was<00:01:03.359> because

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
at first I didn't think it was because

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.539 
at first I didn't think it was because
of<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> cage<00:01:04.199> since<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.860> hadn't<00:01:05.129> had<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> very

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
of the cage since we hadn't had a very

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.980 
of the cage since we hadn't had a very
long<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.270> thought<00:01:06.390> maybe<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:06.930> just

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
long I just thought maybe it was just

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.350 
long I just thought maybe it was just
her<00:01:07.290> personality<00:01:07.470> coming<00:01:08.130> through<00:01:08.220> then<00:01:09.180> we

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
her personality coming through then we

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.240 
her personality coming through then we
changed<00:01:09.750> up<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.960> Beach<00:01:10.350> extension<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.220> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
changed up the Beach extension for a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
changed up the Beach extension for a
different<00:01:11.729> more<00:01:11.939> enclosed<00:01:12.360> extension<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
different more enclosed extension and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.289 
different more enclosed extension and
swapped<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.100> sand<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.640> some<00:01:14.790> carefresh

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
swapped up the sand for some carefresh

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.240 
swapped up the sand for some carefresh
that<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.540> had<00:01:15.750> shipped<00:01:16.049> over<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> try<00:01:17.189> it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
that I had shipped over just to try it

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.730 
that I had shipped over just to try it
out<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.180> change<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.750> amylases<00:01:19.170> behavior

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
out and the change in amylases behavior

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.640 
out and the change in amylases behavior
was<00:01:19.950> very<00:01:20.340> dramatic<00:01:20.780> she<00:01:21.780> moved<00:01:22.080> into<00:01:22.350> her

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
was very dramatic she moved into her

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.770 
was very dramatic she moved into her
extension<00:01:23.189> cage<00:01:23.369> stopped<00:01:23.759> using<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.330> natural

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
extension cage stopped using the natural

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.660 
extension cage stopped using the natural
style<00:01:24.960> cage<00:01:25.290> altogether<00:01:25.920> she<00:01:26.159> never<00:01:26.430> seemed

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
style cage altogether she never seemed

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.640 
style cage altogether she never seemed
to<00:01:26.729> go<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.000> there<00:01:27.210> she<00:01:27.659> started<00:01:27.900> eating<00:01:28.229> more

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
to go in there she started eating more

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.190 
to go in there she started eating more
started<00:01:29.130> playing<00:01:29.430> more<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:30.210> saw<00:01:30.450> her<00:01:30.600> every

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
started playing more we saw her every

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.649 
started playing more we saw her every
single<00:01:31.740> day<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.640> having<00:01:32.820> realized<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
single day so having realized that the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.569 
single day so having realized that the
natural<00:01:34.110> themed<00:01:34.290> cage<00:01:34.560> was<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.340> not

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
natural themed cage was just not

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.249 
natural themed cage was just not
something<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.090> went<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.630> her<00:01:36.780> personality

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
something that went with her personality

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.130 
something that went with her personality
for<00:01:37.770> whatever<00:01:37.979> reason<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:39.240> made<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> decision

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
for whatever reason we made the decision

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.350 
for whatever reason we made the decision
to<00:01:40.170> move<00:01:40.470> her<00:01:40.619> into<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> lack<00:01:41.250> cage<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.850> she's

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
to move her into the lack cage and she's

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.120 
to move her into the lack cage and she's
been<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.630> there<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.320> over<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.710> week<00:01:43.740> and

hamster<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.770> different<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.850> despite<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
hamster is so different but despite the
