 the boss georgsheim fall aok system that 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.100
 System works via a wire 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.270
 loop in the ground this in a cave 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.360
 milled the wire is there 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.140

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.170
 Battery The bus has a front grinder 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.380
 and the otherwise to the co-system contact 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.440
 this is followed by a magnet 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.780
 loop always holds the wire in the ground 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.200
