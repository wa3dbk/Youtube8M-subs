a look at how to repair your Master Boot
Record<00:00:27.050> which<00:00:27.380> is<00:00:27.560> your<00:00:27.680> MBR<00:00:28.099> if<00:00:28.340> it<00:00:28.910> has<00:00:29.060> an

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.239 
Record which is your MBR if it has an

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.089 
Record which is your MBR if it has an
infection<00:00:29.779> on<00:00:29.869> it<00:00:29.989> or<00:00:30.169> maybe<00:00:30.560> it's<00:00:30.800> a<00:00:30.919> case

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
infection on it or maybe it's a case

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.310 
infection on it or maybe it's a case
it's<00:00:31.310> got<00:00:31.520> corrupted<00:00:31.849> now<00:00:32.540> it<00:00:32.689> also<00:00:32.840> may<00:00:33.260> be

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
it's got corrupted now it also may be

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.380 
it's got corrupted now it also may be
the<00:00:33.559> case<00:00:33.739> that<00:00:34.010> you<00:00:34.100> can't<00:00:34.460> boot<00:00:34.699> up<00:00:34.879> windows

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
the case that you can't boot up windows

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.960 
the case that you can't boot up windows
and<00:00:35.660> you're<00:00:36.170> stuck<00:00:36.559> okay<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.550> MBR<00:00:37.940> is

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
and you're stuck okay and the MBR is

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.060 
and you're stuck okay and the MBR is
broken<00:00:38.329> and<00:00:38.629> you<00:00:38.720> need<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:39.019> fix<00:00:39.230> it<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:39.589> of

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
broken and you need to fix it and of

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.979 
broken and you need to fix it and of
course<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.519> worst<00:00:40.670> case<00:00:40.940> scenario<00:00:41.390> is<00:00:41.480> some

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
course the worst case scenario is some

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.720 
course the worst case scenario is some
people<00:00:42.379> don't<00:00:42.409> even<00:00:42.680> have<00:00:42.949> a<00:00:42.980> Windows<00:00:43.430> CD

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
people don't even have a Windows CD

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.850 
people don't even have a Windows CD
which<00:00:44.329> thing<00:00:44.600> causes<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.079> few<00:00:45.409> more<00:00:45.589> problems

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
which thing causes a few more problems

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.860 
which thing causes a few more problems
so<00:00:46.309> I<00:00:46.730> thought<00:00:46.909> I'd<00:00:47.000> make<00:00:47.030> a<00:00:47.180> quick<00:00:47.300> video<00:00:47.690> to

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
so I thought I'd make a quick video to

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.319 
so I thought I'd make a quick video to
show<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:48.290> how<00:00:48.650> to<00:00:48.710> rewrite<00:00:49.699> the<00:00:49.879> Master<00:00:50.210> Boot

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
show you how to rewrite the Master Boot

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.200 
show you how to rewrite the Master Boot
Record<00:00:50.510> with<00:00:51.199> horns<00:00:51.590> boot<00:00:51.859> CD<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:52.910> let's<00:00:53.090> get

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
Record with horns boot CD so let's get

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.330 
Record with horns boot CD so let's get
started<00:00:53.570> here<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.440> as<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:54.590> can<00:00:54.649> see<00:00:54.739> here<00:00:55.129> I've

got a Windows 7 operating system you can

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.069 
got a Windows 7 operating system you can
do<00:00:57.890> this<00:00:58.070> with<00:00:58.699> Windows<00:00:59.149> XP<00:00:59.719> and<00:00:59.989> Windows

ok<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:07.850> I'm<00:01:08.000> going<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:08.210> quickly<00:01:08.710> scan<00:01:09.710> for<00:01:10.009> this

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
ok so I'm going to quickly scan for this

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.980 
ok so I'm going to quickly scan for this
and<00:01:10.399> just<00:01:10.550> show<00:01:10.759> you<00:01:13.539> let's<00:01:14.539> just<00:01:14.690> put<00:01:14.869> the

ticks in here my mouse is playing up

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.340 
ticks in here my mouse is playing up
there<00:01:16.789> we<00:01:16.910> go<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.270> then<00:01:17.990> we're<00:01:18.140> going<00:01:18.259> to

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
there we go and then we're going to

there we go and then we're going to
quickly<00:01:18.500> run<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.950> scan<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.369> I'll<00:01:19.460> show<00:01:19.670> that

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
quickly run the scan and I'll show that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.450 
quickly run the scan and I'll show that
the<00:01:20.000> actual<00:01:20.149> Master<00:01:20.690> Boot<00:01:20.810> Record<00:01:20.990> is<00:01:21.470> in<00:01:21.770> fact

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
the actual Master Boot Record is in fact

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.359 
the actual Master Boot Record is in fact
infected<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:23.299> we<00:01:23.600> need<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.990> remove<00:01:24.320> it<00:01:24.530> now

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
infected and we need to remove it now

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.609 
infected and we need to remove it now
assuming<00:01:25.939> you<00:01:26.270> can't<00:01:26.600> get<00:01:26.780> on<00:01:26.900> your<00:01:27.110> desktop

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
assuming you can't get on your desktop

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.060 
assuming you can't get on your desktop
like<00:01:28.009> I<00:01:28.189> can<00:01:28.460> here<00:01:28.939> this<00:01:29.869> is<00:01:30.049> a<00:01:30.079> good<00:01:30.350> method<00:01:30.590> to

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
like I can here this is a good method to

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.469 
like I can here this is a good method to
actually<00:01:31.220> rewrite<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:31.880> Master<00:01:32.180> Boot<00:01:32.299> Record

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
actually rewrite the Master Boot Record

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.960 
actually rewrite the Master Boot Record
if<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.200> haven't<00:01:33.560> got<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:33.770> CD<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:37.250> let's<00:01:37.460> let

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
if you haven't got a CD so let's let

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.880 
if you haven't got a CD so let's let
this<00:01:38.090> finish<00:01:38.390> its<00:01:38.689> skin<00:01:39.079> and<00:01:41.530> there<00:01:42.530> you<00:01:42.680> can

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
this finish its skin and there you can

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.889 
this finish its skin and there you can
see<00:01:43.420> rootkit<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:46.130> it's<00:01:46.610> on<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.939> system<00:01:47.360> ok

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
see rootkit and it's on the system ok

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.840 
see rootkit and it's on the system ok
you<00:01:48.469> can<00:01:48.619> see<00:01:48.829> there<00:01:49.009> it's<00:01:49.130> been<00:01:49.310> changed<00:01:49.759> now

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
you can see there it's been changed now

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.130 
you can see there it's been changed now
I'm<00:01:50.000> not<00:01:50.180> going<00:01:50.329> to<00:01:50.390> cure<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.780> I'm<00:01:50.869> going<00:01:51.079> to

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
I'm not going to cure it I'm going to

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.560 
I'm not going to cure it I'm going to
skip<00:01:51.409> it<00:01:51.439> ok<00:01:51.860> because<00:01:52.280> I<00:01:52.430> want<00:01:52.579> to<00:01:52.670> use<00:01:52.969> the

skip it ok because I want to use the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.060 
skip it ok because I want to use the
actual<00:01:53.719> hyerin's<00:01:54.320> boot<00:01:54.530> C<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.890> do<00:01:55.009> this

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
actual hyerin's boot C to do this

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.249 
actual hyerin's boot C to do this

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
and we're now back at our desktop and we

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.110 
and we're now back at our desktop and we
can<00:04:38.690> do<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.840> quick<00:04:39.080> scan<00:04:39.380> with<00:04:39.680> tdsskiller<00:04:40.310> just

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
can do a quick scan with tdsskiller just

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.790 
can do a quick scan with tdsskiller just
to<00:04:41.210> make<00:04:41.389> sure<00:04:41.419> that<00:04:42.139> that<00:04:42.289> has<00:04:42.440> been<00:04:42.620> removed

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
to make sure that that has been removed

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.800 
to make sure that that has been removed
now<00:04:43.520> obviously<00:04:43.940> if<00:04:44.060> you<00:04:44.180> was<00:04:44.300> at<00:04:44.419> the<00:04:44.539> desktop

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
now obviously if you was at the desktop

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.350 
now obviously if you was at the desktop
you<00:04:45.110> could<00:04:45.349> use<00:04:45.530> tdsskiller<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.669> maybe<00:04:46.880> remove

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
you could use tdsskiller to maybe remove

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.350 
you could use tdsskiller to maybe remove
that<00:04:47.599> for<00:04:48.470> you<00:04:48.680> but<00:04:49.520> we're<00:04:49.669> assuming<00:04:49.910> that<00:04:50.120> you

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
that for you but we're assuming that you

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.749 
that for you but we're assuming that you
couldn't<00:04:50.690> get<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.080> desktop<00:04:51.490> so<00:04:52.490> let's
