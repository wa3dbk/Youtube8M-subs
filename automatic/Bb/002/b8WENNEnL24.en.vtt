00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
ahead and lets me see it at fifty

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.890 
ahead and lets me see it at fifty
percent<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:10.820> i<00:01:10.850> can<00:01:11.060> see<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.360> position<00:01:11.479> much

extract to lure thing let's go ahead

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.940 
extract to lure thing let's go ahead
just<00:02:15.690> use<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.990> blend<00:02:16.260> mode<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.500> bring<00:02:16.800> these

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
just use the blend mode to bring these

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.979 
just use the blend mode to bring these
two<00:02:17.070> together<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.640> will<00:02:18.120> change<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.630> normal

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
two together I will change the normal

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.530
