00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.660
 Harare I know that we finally have time to finally make it to 38 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.500
 Rolf reached two years ago were ultimately the unions go 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.180
 Sanader he stories in the worst case he says that the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.689
 Jurisprudence into water over 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.019
 that's the name of the hero 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.820
 the performers we really put water as well as really rely so 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.719
 I do not know any more so I would not really know what that 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:35.149
 but Elisabeth is the German newspaper I promise that I am my role 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.789
 simply shepherd before it brings no idea 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:42.550
 that does not happen every day maybe i should do that 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.399
 and even Sebastian Freis as so bad luck techniques will be replaced 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.200
 till 8 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.150
 can get first tests there are days when the user then a late 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.110
 Man or friend alone can 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.320
 I think this is a very good defense 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.810
 market reaction 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.889
 Strongly attract attention at the lake to congestion vehicle has noticed 

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:06.539
 No, China is one 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:07.299
 space 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.439
 the HSK climbs and she's at it so she just air dried 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.750
 Our Savior Is Saying "Now I have to achieve the goal is a great one 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.730
 Message just makes me already difficult 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.750
 But the guests are not called into the sea for a long time 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.700
 and then it was so easy and casual it also makes it even harder to 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.400
 recognize 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.800
 that's why laziness easy way to ask your questions directly 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.340
 witnessed or 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.340
 everything is going to be different 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.710
 The deadline should be it works right all over the world almost no matter how it works 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.329
 can be his annoyance about the orgy 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.679
 Lawyer and others have also he gave to no real 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.810
 Hardliner in the last days on the last day 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 I could say no, no 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.510
 I admit I am suddenly ill he did 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.119
 And while a proper language for wastewater practice let rapper go to court 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:03.610
 tug 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.680
 well 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.720
 AlgoSec was just normal later Mata of Germania were surfaces too 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.449
 inquiry 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.649
 2 billion 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:15.889
 yes we can see everything well 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:21.769
 not quite normal in three so also count on Kolberg 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.379
 and clubs the former all alone without normal so outside in the middle 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.819
 Secretary of State 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.130
 outside in the blender and there is more often classical fabric rhythmically 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.410
 Trägerervereins is one of the best way to find hackers in the middle 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.769
 has fit 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.299
 so that he described this culprit 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.720
 he said i think and the cheap airline but only in 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.840
 Middle Franconia is if you can find out with the nerd and 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:53.169
 Therefore, the name and trading ranges comes into the middle, that's easy 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:54.000
 free 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.409
 further ahead 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.099
 and take another track that he can not use 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.549
 which would have increased 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.639
 and that was already a miracle of technology 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.039
 just try the dfb pick three we have 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.699
 because electro-boxster they pack in Münster 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:15.189
 and goes too much from Tyrol to a few others as in the classic braid 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:17.899
 as well as easy 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.899
 in Nice 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.129
 we are down here would remain the lovers so far i will 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.379
 then leave the place easy 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.649
 And if that was another step left untouched, it's easy in Whistler too 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:34.659
 So one last time 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.779
 I want to get here now at the Springer she just grabs Rüter 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.779
 incidentally have the two French spicy 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:46.659
 Blatter in the world of the oblique here in front 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.659
 But he does not do that with him but just simply drops him 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:51.859
 and the more of the 4 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.509
 some Striedinger and - health instead in the middle 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:00.329
 and so it could completely head back through a retirement home or 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.509
 Algae yes I do not know where to do land or as I said 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:07.409
 it is quite a bit according to the information you were looking for 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.989
 All surfaces can do it with this technique and the researchers splashed 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.839
 Advertisements and I hope that is understandable one finds that one 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:17.340
 show at the time 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.150
 so i hate them after testing and should try to pay it is 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.669
 not so great a Bambi has seen in many videos 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.970
 my hair just does not give it anymore 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.180
 but I think I am an ideal partner 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.000
 and here my kids are not skipping this aspiration you can 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.129
 which can be seen quite clearly 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.189
 the nets came up around a fake 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.799
 if the Dortmunder these days for other applications for example 

00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:47.560
 if you can not remember that ever 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.120
 Here is a trivializing antivirus animal much on it 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.020
 I think a change is not a specialist for you 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.810
 it is really difficult 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.480
 Euro so initially it is empty in the early morning was formal 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.639
 but just a little bit worse 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.510
 from Agnes 2 bn 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.000
 but this is for you with my husband Hans thinks better into life 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.809
 merge and so on 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:15.489
 that is why we have it, even if it can not understand this "from our 

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:18.490
 View we have one in theater in court 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.809
 and then finally see 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:24.580
 Lisicki is working and wants to sleep 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.810
 Siemens can also be called Marlies is a vehicle that never was 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.680
 written 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.360
 every animal here 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.419
 by Erhard Kurlemann 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.340
 After all, it is very clear that all of these techniques count for a short time 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.099
 The same could be said about a survey based on our photo series 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.790
 Said Ehler goes 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.159
 and you could still go a little bit better in Sweden 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.580
 all other trips if it is really easy 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.240
 I decide I would rather stay limited I understand her 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.050
 what i was twelve years ago and after a couple tv tv appearance 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.110
 dreadful 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.689
 it is easy to make a famous one 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.289
 Sharp and be in her late 20s
