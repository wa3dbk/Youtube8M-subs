00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.470
 another way for 172 this nickname is up 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.780
 now the best map good how to do 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.060
 the installation easily let's go to the 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.660
 link below the admission I'm going 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.930
 to leave 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.850
 this finishes a good see the map more or 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.530
 less good what it has to be for 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.059
 download it they will have 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.250
 bolt box the map is called let's give it 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.110
 complicate here will not govern a page 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:49.120
 from mediafire what it does to download 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.250
 download this will unleash a window or 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.239
 where you have it predetermined its 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.800
 browser 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.660
 I put it on the desk because it 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.160
 makes it more comfortable although I already have it 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.519
 downloaded is downloaded in an instant not 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.519
 import 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.950
 the usual windows app percent by 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.950
 cent for good 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.299
 I've got it I will believe this 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.729
 when they once have good and that's 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.310
 everything now has more than basically 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.479
 appears on the lip the review of more or 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.610
 less like this is the reason 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.150
 we find good I come to show you 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.119
 the map that bolt ex I think it's called 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.890
 good to goodness good this is the month 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.720
 good so far the best map for 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.200
 for all students and also helped us 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.350
 minimum root for the 17th and 17th 10 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.140
 none of the versions of currently 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.729
 well what are we going to do I'm going to 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.539
 demonstrate more or less how it works 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:54.020
 well we press to select a 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:58.039
 we press the at the same time and 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.180
 example we put what I know home and then 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.990
 we can choose the color 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.760
 in the long blue blue since it leaves you 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.940
 coordinates 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.990
 and it's accepted and there it is 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.990
 you go far after 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.420
 about your house of pÃ©rez and where the fuck 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.420
 it's from my house 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.780
 and it's there 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.190
 for example when I'm in this block 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.569
 and you see that the house is or that 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.310
 excelled not good 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.250
 is 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.459
 to configure it your way by 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.110
 example press the my key here 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.470
 several things appear if we want to have 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.209
 the coordinates shown here below 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.190
 injured as I want to hide in the 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.830
 minimal but I do not think you want to do 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.830
 that but good the size until small 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.569
 half I think it gave me recommendable north 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.860
 old this I do not know very well but this one I notice 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.740
 that activates the coordinate mode if here the 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.960
 waypoint 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:09.020
 we leave you both like this 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.300
 here what what round square the 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.680
 location in case you want to place it in 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.680
 some corner I said it by default 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.140
 and here several things show hostile in 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.359
 the map mods and here everything you 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.549
 you want to see on the map what 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.680
 active and if you do not want to do this this is 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.049
 all this is all this and so 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.120
 successively but if you were looking for a 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.540
 wolf deactivated and you will find what 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.950
 that will appear on the map and good and 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.189
 have controls icon set pam pam pam 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.689
 here operating detail is here 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.879
 all of you can configure it to your 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:51.760
 way and good guys this all the video 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:54.169
 tutorial showing how the map is and 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.129
 so far this is the best map that 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:04:00.319
 there is for the 172 and when it leaves for the 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:04.689
 17 10 also enters my channel up 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.689
