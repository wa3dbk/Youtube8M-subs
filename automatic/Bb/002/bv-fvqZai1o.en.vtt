00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.309
 hello people with you without hands guard 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.430
 today I have a vidosik about grandfather zap 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.130
 ninth level out of 8 first wanted 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.279
 talk a little about the tanks itself but 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.099
 having reached iso 8 are greatly disappointed in 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.590
 This tank has its tactics 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.310
 very different from the previous game 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.830
 cars 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.460
 This is especially felt after imba 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.250
 armor troika a of 8 fast serious 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.550
 gun on weak armor the problem is 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.829
 that eterna flow screens isa third 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.469
 whom we are so accustomed to on the eighth 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.420
 much less and therefore roll back 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.640
 reverse diamond from the corners of buildings 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.940
 the enemy is more likely to beat us on the cheek 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.489
 the chip gets us in the cheater screen 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.949
 let's go back to the battle immediately see us and that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.769
 chick thrown on wash away the entire collective farmers 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.320
 Yuri topchi and also see what they have 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.300
 only one medium tank and the composition is very 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.790
 slow so we are in their places 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.549
 Eighth, calmly we can take 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.850
 positions from pawns of course we are going to 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.640
 the mountains on line e now let's talk about the most 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.670
 map we have several directions 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.180
 The first is the beach in my travels there 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.619
 only people with tunnel thinking 2 this 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.960
 hillock on the center too huang oil and 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.400
 the third most important area 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.799
 corridor mountains on line e 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.040
 it is here that big should hang out 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.829
 half the team is surprisingly in this fight 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.399
 I got a good enough team 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.700
 and everyone went well and now I 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.790
 I will explain why on this map at the beginning 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.680
 fight worth a little bit need 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.200
 wait a while 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.409
 impatient opponents dumped on 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.990
 you first and your team will earn with 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.149
 the beginning of the fight a slight advantage 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.560
 and after that you can safely 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.380
 press the enemy 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.200
 now wanted to talk about the importance of my 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.510
 the positions from here are excellent shot 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.630
 lowland center also from there 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.069
 controlled departure to my flank and yet 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.920
 can calmly rest direction 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.189
 and the beach if the enemy breaks there then 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.040
 line 7 you can safely shoot them 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.680
 rush and by the way here there is a cheater 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.079
 a bush rolled away from which you even 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.139
 will not glow after the shot 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.909
 that is why you are the center or the beach 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:39.609
 you won't lose anything 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:42.489
 but if you merge on line e then 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:45.730
 Chances to zadefitsya on the base will be small 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.760
 code mahadev but back to the battle in wash 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.900
 collective farmer Yuri merges I pass on to him 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.900
 hi wang 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.989
 he decided that if of 8 tank breakthrough then 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.819
 need to roll out a few trunks 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.269
 grab a couple of plops in exchange for your 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.760
 it is wrong to stand better 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.609
 rising to his crustaceans and waited for 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.239
 the opponent himself look at him goals a 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:13.659
 would have never finished like an enemy 75 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:17.969
 and the hamster which I am sending to twist 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.969
 the wheel in his cell in the hangar 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:32.770
 and then finished on I see that on 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.790
 center begins to active and 101 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.490
 I will lay out here 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.590
 but some strange micro bumps do not give 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.080
 my trunk drop down 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.420
 we and so bad and aiming angles so 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.400
 there is also some kind of terrain 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.730
 so trying to find where the gun 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.760
 go down hanging and you go 1 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.760
 rest in the hangar further I understand that 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.970
 there is nothing more to catch on the center 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:04.870
 emily stuyer I think maybe I can 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:08.990
 get right out of here well ka well ka 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.140
 kert my allies sharply kill immediately 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.900
 several enemies, I understand that pressure 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.650
 growling and on the floor otherwise nothing yummy 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.940
 there will be no sweet lion here 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.270
 with her ass 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.210
 get in srandel farther she faces on 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.060
 me and on recharge we exchange 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.660
 shots only the lion is already in 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.300
 hangar 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.420
 also notice that the enemy and drying 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:39.080
 picks up our to 5 and so poteshki 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.840
 stand on your shelves inside so i am 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.360
 I decide not to pull fate by the balls calm 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.730
 from glow behind the slide 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.670
 from shone and give them forward armor 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:54.950
 strong and our tanks are fast 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:57.890
 killed by tyazh and artilleryman break 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.830
 all sorts of barrels on our road and 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.800
 we shine enemy and drying standing to 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:07.070
 we are creeping a little closer 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.190
 departing the projectile board continued not 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.950
 and come close someone makes her shot for 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.660
 by the way and by the way, me and reloading 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.180
 I'm just getting 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.740
 and this is the fifth frag and drying by the way 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.680
 somewhere did not break us 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.990
 here's a cardboard and out of 8 I 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.200
 Soviet armor does not break through 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.620
 even the most formidable guns are shorter than the clean 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.800
 ron 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.100
 I have it 5 francs and therefore I wanted 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.770
 would the warrior wonder Fedya be lighted up 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.680
 from such a distance only after the shot 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.990
 on reloading roll out and Fedi also 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.930
 panther closes me 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.060
 have to shoot at him as not 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.669
 revenge your abuser 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.400
 while being on recharge almost lost 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.400
 medal warrior but my allies were 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.790

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.889
