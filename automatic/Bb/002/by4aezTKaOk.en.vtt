 that we're really going to 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.530

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.229

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.869

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.640

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.000
 I found it very cool initiative of 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.670
 Saints and I came here with effect and 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.440
 I 'm going to win I'm never going to take much 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.440
 I enjoyed this trip that I did 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.410
 This was the first one this was the first 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.220
 village boys camp 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.460
 held in January in July 2011 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.440

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.910
 now the team has come, it 's a 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.390
 very cool opportunity because I am 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.790
 hence they are good people it is tiring to 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.670
 train in two periods but the life of 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.090
 professional players five worst but 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:49.520
