00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.679
 anti-aircraft missile systems with 400 triumph 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.949
 today for the first time in history preparing for 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:15.749
 missile launch in full scale 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.460
 military exercises so far they are only 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.660
 have been tested and these launcher 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.269
 installations are now deployed on 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.739
 Ashuluk range in the Astrakhan region 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.939
 even participated in the parade on the red 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.619
 squares but as full combat 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.990
 units they still 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.990
 didn't shoot 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.290
 Launch and guided missiles 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.560
 preceded by a search for conditional targets with 400 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.109
 able to detect targets 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:42.379
 within a radius of six hundred kilometers in many 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.559
 parameters analog domestic 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.690
 the complex is nowhere else in the world 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.050
 This is another novelty from that complex 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.120
 armor with on the basis of four bridge 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.629
 Kamaz with automatic 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.809
 gearbox good speed 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.550
 and travel anywhere 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.380
 i don't know zen rocket life 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.420
 complex shell and so generally new 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.210
 the word Gorodetsky drum bore a surname 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.250
 complex with 400 triumph much more on 10 m 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.640
 stage 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.970
 In April, Azar is less, but in this segment 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.360
 there is a combat vehicle of this size 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.170
 weapons and such capabilities to 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.940
 there was no bank at all 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.590
 no technology 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.840
 the portrait of the teaching is also premiere 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.720
 unexpressed class guns and rockets 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.909
 ground air 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.130
 Now the commander expect tasks that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.700
 It is necessary to solve the course of the first exercises 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.479
 faster feet in the head 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.870
 numbers 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.610
 a lot of time 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.360
 request for kilometers 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270
 besides this year 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.420
 teachings other than funds 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.630
 air defense missile 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.930
 defense preparing and ground forces 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.360
 the crew of this company wear a uniform is different 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.549
 tired of Russian allowed 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.020
 This Belarusian tanks stand but on this 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.700
 isotov construction is only Russian 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.570
 speech 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.520
 prevent the breakthrough of infantry tanks 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.909
 adversary in direction 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.340
 landmark high 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.060
 the height is clear put him maximum 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.100
 losses hold the line 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.920
 maintain combat capability 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.190
 gate 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.100
 in the framework of the Russian-Belarusian exercises 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.690
 shield of the union 2011 military men of two 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.110
 countries work together 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.409
 assigned tasks 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.620
 Belarusian tank crew drives tanks t 72 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.400
 Now they are disguised 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.120
 trenches ready for defense 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.450
 exercise interaction 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.610
 practiced not only on the ground 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.610
 but out of the game 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.560
 from the military airfield Volga aircraft 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.530
 usually leave in pairs it allows 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.920
 save time on stars 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.370
 Belarusian pilot controls 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.300
 fighter aircraft instant 29 russian fly on 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.389
 newest aircraft su 34 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:39.570
 they also participate in the exercises for the first time 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.900
 so multifunctional 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900
 fighter bombers 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.889
 su 34 is armed with five hundred kilogram 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.169
 bombs guided missiles with laser 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.209
 homing head 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.719
 to exclude detection 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.670
 enemy aircraft bombers 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.609
 fly to the hit area 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.589
 at the utmost low altitude 90 sailors 125 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:02.190
 shoots 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.709
 unguided rockets 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.749
 speaker crash 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:08.049
 but not Bagdad by Stakhanov 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.259
 polygon belongs not only 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:11.419
 by plane in the air a dozen drums 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.889
 helicopters and night hunters I am 28 UAH and 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.639
 ka 52 are controlled by two pilots 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.909
 by ourselves 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:21.659
 these helicopters not only performs 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.659
 the air real tricks but also suggests 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.639
 fear on the enemy with your shock 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.639
 armament 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:31.599
 flight training program is one of the most 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.559
 saturated indeed the most spectacular 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:34.739
 aircraft 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.700
 returning to the airfield is considered 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.439
 what earlier 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.439
 as previously known 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.329
 all episodes will be played again 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.289
 at the same time in a single plan 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:48.589
 exercises center 2011 using all 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:51.009
 air defense weapons due to 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:52.059
 dense troops 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:53.859
