00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.020
 Hello, I'm calling alone. 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:37.170
 I'm here presenting a model one 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.340
 school work a sustainable home 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.720
 here we try to represent the best 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.210
 form 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.710
 the model that was requested by the 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.600
 student in the whole house made with 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.460
 ecological brick represented in 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.400
 rubber eva glass even cut here in 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.199
 local 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.360
 so we had the intention to 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.860
 I was at home the best way to enjoy it. 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.869
 this external luminosity 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:11.280
 then only the inner walls of the house that 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.280
 I'm in the place the rest is all glass 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.810
 trying to use the white color for the 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:21.220
 best use of light lighting 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.479
 LED in the upper part of the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.479
 lower part of the entrance hall 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.009
 enough use of plants to 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.670
 to lower the internal humidity in the 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.670
 residence 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.820
 here we have a roof that is made 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.330
 all in micro corrugated paper and is in color 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.680
 green to be able to represent the roof 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.680
 made from vegetable fibers 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.719
 here the side part only works 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.130
 here is the bathroom of the residence 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.630
 a room 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.230
 here the bottom part 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.370
 roof collects the water from the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.340
 rain falls products here is enough 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.080
 reservoir for reuse 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.570
 at home as a woman download 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.500
 garden and yard surplus wheels 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.230
 this turbine to generate energy 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.420
 that will stay on stationary batteries 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.020
 here inside the engine room 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:48.610
 the battery as you prefer and also 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:52.030
 we have a wind turbine and also make the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.730
 capture of energy to be able to 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:02.890
 also used for residence here in 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:05.040
 part of the background there is a vegetable garden and here 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.770
 we'll be seeing from another angle 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.660
 everything working remembering that this 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.290
 work is a group of young people from 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.030
 18 in just eight years group of children 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.090
 and was tried not to use energy 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.730
 so that there is no damage to the 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.940
 no one then any functioning of that 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:30.760
 prototype is stacked in both the 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:33.730
 externally and at the top that 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.880
 feeds that are all in 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.360
 operation 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.220
 so I hope this video helps the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.000
 work of some people there that we have 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.800
 a difficulty to find on the internet 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.720
 ideas to be able to make the 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.080
 the work models , I hope that 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.540
 this will help and also if someone 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.740
 I need to be there to give you ideas. 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:06.470
 suggestions and clarify doubts on the 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:08.270
 from the bottom here is the force on the floor above 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.590
 a balloon that would be a reservoir of 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:16.070
 methane gas that this stored gas is 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.090
 used to heat any water 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.090
 thing inside the residence 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.030
 and here the television is represented by a 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.910
 mp4 player is already off 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.890
 he plays the role of television 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:43.240
 gilad every electrical part of the residence 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:47.500
 is made upon rival the fortress with 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.500
 on top are wooden doors
