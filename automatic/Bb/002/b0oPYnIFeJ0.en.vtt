actually<00:01:13.710> slight<00:01:14.070> gaps<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.970> between<00:01:15.030> their

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
actually slight gaps in between their

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.260 
actually slight gaps in between their
potion<00:01:16.200> drinking<00:01:16.680> which<00:01:17.340> will<00:01:17.640> eventually

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
potion drinking which will eventually

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.039 
potion drinking which will eventually
lead<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.290> their<00:01:19.439> death<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.090> pop<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.900> guy

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
lead to their death so if I pop this guy

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.200 
lead to their death so if I pop this guy
back<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.220> bet<00:01:23.549> he<00:01:23.729> probably<00:01:24.000> won't

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210

even be dead by the end of this video

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.569 
even be dead by the end of this video

but these guys will drink potions to
heal<00:01:29.880> themselves<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.880> actually<00:01:33.090> end

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
heal themselves and you can actually end

up killing them with water lava or block
suffocation<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.409> takes<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:37.799> long

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
suffocation it just takes a really long

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.960 
suffocation it just takes a really long
time<00:01:38.610> because<00:01:39.680> due<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:40.950> potion<00:01:41.250> drinking

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
actually recording on a computer and

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.840 
actually recording on a computer and
that<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.890> can't<00:01:50.189> see<00:01:50.399> any<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
that you can't see any of the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.399 
that you can't see any of the
gesticulation<00:01:51.360> I'm<00:01:51.780> doing<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.320> it's

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
gesticulation I'm doing and it's

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.410 
gesticulation I'm doing and it's
completely<00:01:52.740> useless<00:01:53.070> all<00:01:53.850> you're<00:01:54.090> doing<00:01:54.329> is

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
completely useless all you're doing is

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.539 
completely useless all you're doing is
staring<00:01:54.810> at<00:01:54.930> an<00:01:55.140> unchanging<00:01:55.890> screen<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.490> I

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
staring at an unchanging screen so I

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.920 
staring at an unchanging screen so I
need<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.790> move<00:01:56.909> around<00:01:57.060> small<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.719> make<00:01:57.840> this

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
need to move around small and make this

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.200 
need to move around small and make this
visually<00:01:58.350> interesting<00:01:58.619> shake<00:01:59.130> seizure<00:01:59.430> okay

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
visually interesting shake seizure okay

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.560 
visually interesting shake seizure okay
so<00:02:00.689> they<00:02:01.500> only<00:02:01.619> lose<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.149> half<00:02:03.390> a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
so they only lose you know like half a

already let me reiterate highly

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.160 
already let me reiterate highly
inefficient<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.420> kill<00:02:17.600> them<00:02:17.750> these<00:02:17.900> ways

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
inefficient to kill them these ways

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.580 
inefficient to kill them these ways
although<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.770> can<00:02:19.100> be<00:02:19.520> done<00:02:20.020> it's<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.170> stupid

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
although it can be done it's a stupid

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.240 
although it can be done it's a stupid
thing<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.920> do

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
thing to do

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.980 
thing to do
it's<00:02:22.640> going<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:22.970> take<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.210> half<00:02:23.480> an<00:02:23.600> hour<00:02:23.720> to

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
it's going to take you half an hour to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.200 
it's going to take you half an hour to
kill<00:02:24.110> one<00:02:24.320> stinking<00:02:24.890> witch<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:25.400> way<00:02:25.640> the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
kill one stinking witch this way the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.199 
kill one stinking witch this way the
only<00:02:27.080> reliable<00:02:27.620> way<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.370> have<00:02:28.730> found<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.970> kill<00:02:29.180> a

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
only reliable way I have found to kill a

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.140 
only reliable way I have found to kill a
witch<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.690> from<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.290> twenty<00:02:30.680> eight<00:02:30.890> block<00:02:31.520> drop

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
witch is from a twenty eight block drop

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.350 
witch is from a twenty eight block drop
that<00:02:32.900> will<00:02:33.200> instantly<00:02:33.860> kill<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.160> witch<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:34.910> if<00:02:35.209> I

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
that will instantly kill a witch so if I

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.160 
that will instantly kill a witch so if I
just<00:02:35.660> pop<00:02:36.080> them<00:02:36.320> up<00:02:36.380> there<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:37.070> Chapleau<00:02:37.550> dunk

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
just pop them up there and Chapleau dunk

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.949 
just pop them up there and Chapleau dunk
there<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.380> go<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:41.680> what<00:02:43.330> he<00:02:44.330> drunk<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.720> potion

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
there you go and what he drunk a potion

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.640 
there you go and what he drunk a potion
on<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.440> way<00:02:45.590> down<00:02:46.840> that's<00:02:47.840> never<00:02:48.170> happened

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
on the way down that's never happened

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.740 
on the way down that's never happened
before<00:02:48.709> let<00:02:49.400> me<00:02:49.459> let<00:02:49.850> me<00:02:49.880> go<00:02:50.120> try<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.450> again

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
before let me let me go try that again

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.280 
before let me let me go try that again
that's<00:02:51.290> odd<00:02:51.530> odd<00:02:52.430> odd<00:02:52.489> odd<00:02:54.220> let's<00:02:55.220> see<00:02:55.489> here

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
that's odd odd odd odd let's see here

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.100 
that's odd odd odd odd let's see here
donk<00:02:57.670> donk<00:02:59.590> what<00:03:00.730> did<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.820> make<00:03:02.390> this<00:03:02.600> one<00:03:02.900> too

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
donk donk what did I make this one too

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.780 
donk donk what did I make this one too
short<00:03:05.680> dude<00:03:08.110> yeah<00:03:09.110> this<00:03:09.920> one<00:03:10.340> might<00:03:10.550> have<00:03:10.700> been

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
short dude yeah this one might have been

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.120 
short dude yeah this one might have been
27<00:03:11.300> instead<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.810> 28<00:03:12.140> blocks<00:03:12.440> let<00:03:12.680> me<00:03:12.739> test<00:03:12.980> that

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
27 instead of 28 blocks let me test that

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.650 
27 instead of 28 blocks let me test that
out<00:03:13.160> yep<00:03:14.090> there<00:03:14.299> we<00:03:14.390> go

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
out yep there we go

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
out yep there we go
um<00:03:14.840> I<00:03:15.650> just<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:16.280> just<00:03:16.760> didn't<00:03:17.060> count<00:03:17.209> right<00:03:17.680> it

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
um I just I just didn't count right it

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.880 
um I just I just didn't count right it
is<00:03:18.980> 28<00:03:19.580> for<00:03:19.850> sure<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.390> am<00:03:20.750> did<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.320> lot<00:03:21.530> of<00:03:21.560> testing

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
is 28 for sure I am did a lot of testing

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.289 
is 28 for sure I am did a lot of testing
beforehand<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.580> then<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:22.730> just<00:03:22.940> built<00:03:23.180> this

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
beforehand and then I just built this

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.600 
beforehand and then I just built this
little<00:03:23.570> set<00:03:23.750> afterwards<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:25.070> didn't

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
little set afterwards I just didn't

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.380 
little set afterwards I just didn't
build<00:03:25.820> this<00:03:26.030> correctly<00:03:26.420> 28<00:03:27.350> so<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.400> takes<00:03:28.730> 28

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
build this correctly 28 so it takes 28

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.300 
build this correctly 28 so it takes 28
blocks<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:31.370> kill<00:03:31.880> a<00:03:32.269> witch<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.680> let<00:03:33.980> me<00:03:34.130> just

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
blocks to kill a witch so let me just

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.340 
blocks to kill a witch so let me just
show<00:03:34.549> you<00:03:34.580> again<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.360> prove<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:36.320> that

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
show you again and prove to you that

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.850 
show you again and prove to you that
this<00:03:37.040> now<00:03:37.610> works<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:39.019> which<00:03:39.200> followed<00:03:39.680> know

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
this now works the which followed know

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.830 
this now works the which followed know
there<00:03:40.100> you<00:03:40.220> go<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:41.170> so<00:03:42.190> this<00:03:43.190> is<00:03:43.489> some<00:03:44.150> higher

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
there you go and so this is some higher

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.690 
there you go and so this is some higher
than<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:46.209> mobs<00:03:47.209> drop<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:48.410> can<00:03:48.440> see<00:03:48.920> it's<00:03:49.340> one

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
than the mobs drop you can see it's one

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.319 
than the mobs drop you can see it's one
two<00:03:50.090> three<00:03:50.540> four<00:03:50.900> five<00:03:51.230> blocks<00:03:51.739> higher<00:03:52.329> maybe

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
two three four five blocks higher maybe

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.050 
two three four five blocks higher maybe
it<00:03:53.540> is<00:03:53.660> actually<00:03:53.989> 29<00:03:54.440> hmm<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.579> must<00:03:55.970> have

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
it is actually 29 hmm I must have

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.880 
it is actually 29 hmm I must have
miscounted<00:03:56.360> in<00:03:56.660> my<00:03:56.780> testing<00:03:57.670> so<00:03:58.900> Wow<00:03:59.930> updates

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890

the<00:04:23.670> skeletons<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.180> really<00:04:24.390> bad<00:04:24.540> example<00:04:24.660> cuz

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
the skeletons a really bad example cuz

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.580 
the skeletons a really bad example cuz
it<00:04:25.200> was<00:04:25.290> burning<00:04:25.620> but<00:04:26.520> you<00:04:26.760> get<00:04:26.940> what<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.090> mean

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
it was burning but you get what I mean

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.520 
it was burning but you get what I mean
so<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:29.820> takes<00:04:30.060> five<00:04:30.270> blocks<00:04:30.570> higher<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.290> kill<00:04:31.500> a

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
so it takes five blocks higher to kill a

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.570 
so it takes five blocks higher to kill a
witch<00:04:31.830> then<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:33.000> normal<00:04:33.420> mob<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:34.380> only<00:04:34.830> problem

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
witch then a normal mob the only problem

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.940 
witch then a normal mob the only problem
with<00:04:36.480> this<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.170> a<00:04:37.410> lot<00:04:37.560> of<00:04:37.620> people

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
with this is that a lot of people

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.460 
with this is that a lot of people
speculate<00:04:38.400> that<00:04:38.880> witches<00:04:39.330> will<00:04:39.600> be<00:04:39.750> spawning

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
speculate that witches will be spawning

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.470 
speculate that witches will be spawning
inside<00:04:41.040> of<00:04:42.470> strongholds<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.590> it<00:04:44.580> may<00:04:44.910> be<00:04:44.970> hard

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
inside of strongholds and it may be hard

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.190 
inside of strongholds and it may be hard
to<00:04:45.630> make<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:46.170> good<00:04:46.620> mob<00:04:47.250> dropper<00:04:47.940> as<00:04:48.180> far<00:04:49.170> down

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
to make a good mob dropper as far down

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.620 
to make a good mob dropper as far down
as<00:04:49.470> strongholds<00:04:50.220> are<00:04:50.310> I'm<00:04:50.460> not<00:04:50.520> sure<00:04:50.910> if<00:04:51.150> in<00:04:51.540> a

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
as strongholds are I'm not sure if in a

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.050 
as strongholds are I'm not sure if in a
stronghold<00:04:51.930> you'll<00:04:52.320> have<00:04:52.620> 29<00:04:53.220> blocks

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
stronghold you'll have 29 blocks

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.760 
stronghold you'll have 29 blocks
downwards<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:55.080> go<00:04:55.290> from<00:04:55.590> there<00:04:55.860> because

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
downwards to go from there because

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.680 
downwards to go from there because
strongholds<00:04:58.770> tend<00:04:58.980> to<00:04:59.040> be<00:04:59.130> kind<00:04:59.880> of<00:05:00.210> farther

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
strongholds tend to be kind of farther

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.640 
strongholds tend to be kind of farther
down<00:05:01.050> near<00:05:01.470> bedrock<00:05:02.240> you<00:05:03.240> may<00:05:03.510> have<00:05:03.780> 29<00:05:04.170> blocks

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
down near bedrock you may have 29 blocks

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.980 
down near bedrock you may have 29 blocks
to<00:05:04.860> go<00:05:05.010> down<00:05:05.310> I'm<00:05:05.490> not<00:05:05.640> really<00:05:05.880> sure<00:05:06.180> but<00:05:06.210> you

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
to go down I'm not really sure but you

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.750 
to go down I'm not really sure but you
know<00:05:07.020> that's<00:05:07.530> just<00:05:07.650> up<00:05:07.980> in<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.130> air<00:05:08.250> because

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
know that's just up in the air because

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.360 
know that's just up in the air because
we<00:05:08.970> really<00:05:09.450> don't<00:05:09.840> know<00:05:10.230> where<00:05:10.560> what<00:05:10.830> where

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
we really don't know where what where

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.310 
we really don't know where what where
and<00:05:11.700> how<00:05:11.850> witches<00:05:12.270> are<00:05:12.390> even<00:05:12.660> going<00:05:12.900> to<00:05:13.020> spawn

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
and how witches are even going to spawn

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.560 
and how witches are even going to spawn
yet<00:05:13.620> I<00:05:13.860> mean<00:05:14.370> for<00:05:14.550> all<00:05:14.640> we<00:05:14.670> know<00:05:15.000> they<00:05:15.150> may<00:05:15.180> not

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
yet I mean for all we know they may not

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.360 
yet I mean for all we know they may not
be<00:05:15.780> like<00:05:15.990> with<00:05:16.230> their<00:05:16.380> skeletons<00:05:16.920> they<00:05:17.130> may<00:05:17.310> be

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
be like with their skeletons they may be

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.910 
be like with their skeletons they may be
like<00:05:17.970> villagers<00:05:18.600> and<00:05:18.900> they<00:05:19.230> spawn<00:05:19.500> little

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
like villagers and they spawn little

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.400 
like villagers and they spawn little
decrepit<00:05:20.370> houses<00:05:20.820> it's<00:05:21.660> all<00:05:21.930> completely

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
decrepit houses it's all completely

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.140 
decrepit houses it's all completely
speculation<00:05:23.160> at<00:05:23.280> this<00:05:23.310> point<00:05:23.550> but<00:05:23.940> I<00:05:24.030> was<00:05:24.120> just

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
speculation at this point but I was just

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.610 
speculation at this point but I was just
doing<00:05:24.510> some<00:05:24.690> prep<00:05:24.930> work<00:05:25.170> in<00:05:25.670> case<00:05:27.620> witches

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
doing some prep work in case witches

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.800 
doing some prep work in case witches
would<00:05:28.770> be<00:05:28.950> farmable<00:05:29.400> so<00:05:30.030> I<00:05:30.060> thought<00:05:30.420> I'd<00:05:30.630> just

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
would be farmable so I thought I'd just

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.870 
would be farmable so I thought I'd just
pass<00:05:31.200> this<00:05:31.380> information<00:05:31.590> on<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.130> you<00:05:32.280> guys<00:05:32.490> so

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
pass this information on to you guys so

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.450 
pass this information on to you guys so
you<00:05:32.910> would<00:05:33.150> know<00:05:33.420> it<00:05:33.990> is<00:05:34.290> a<00:05:34.320> myth<00:05:34.650> that<00:05:34.980> witches

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
you would know it is a myth that witches

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.240 
you would know it is a myth that witches
cannot<00:05:35.730> die<00:05:35.910> in<00:05:36.060> lava<00:05:36.300> water<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:36.840> block

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
cannot die in lava water and block

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.980 
cannot die in lava water and block
suffocation<00:05:38.280> it<00:05:38.520> just<00:05:39.030> takes<00:05:39.240> how<00:05:39.480> really

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
suffocation it just takes how really

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.770 
suffocation it just takes how really
freaking<00:05:40.590> a<00:05:40.710> long<00:05:40.890> time<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.820> the<00:05:42.600> most
