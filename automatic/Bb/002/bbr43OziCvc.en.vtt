 your first memory related to 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.199
 kitchen 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.740
 my first good memory if I remember 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:34.960
 something my grandmother used to do when 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:38.649
 I was going to see her my grandfather had in the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.589
 field had a farm had the goats to 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.379
 my grandmother after the newly hen 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.989
 done and it made me passion is our 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.460
 passions that is just the yolk is enough with 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.289
 a whipped with sugar 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.329
 so he's grown up Christian watching 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:58.030
 a dish that you remember that for you 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.749
 small was important if you like it goes 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.659
 much the lasagna of mom mom I follow 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:07.240
 having a letter here and that is one of 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.000
 the theoretical dishes and what I keep doing 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.280
 my mother's dresser 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.460
 but when he comes here to Madrid 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.260
 see me makes her better I do not know yet 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.110
 I 'm not, I'm not, I 'm cheating, I'm not 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.870
 says everything in the end something in fact when 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.310
 I confused me moment I assure you that no 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.600
 it's the same but no no no no kidding is 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.270
 true she still has some dish 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.390
 that you avoid something that you say not this not in 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.570
 my letter could not be 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.700
 no no because actually my concept 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.409
 is that from there the window does not 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.770
 Nothing comes out that I can not eat all 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.810
 what I like is in letter 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.479
 and I like it in the same way because if 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.240
 it's not good you do not know what your type of 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.049
 favorite food 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.049
 the correct 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.860
 there are two types of food the market 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.360
 it was supermarket I like the one in 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.940
 market and be a capo or Spanish or 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.100
 I do not care about Africa 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.660
 tuition you gave me the good food the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.670
 bad food gave the food to increase 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.470
 those kitchens or do you prefer them to cook 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.140
 for you when you're not at home outside 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.300
 of the restaurant kitchens at home cook 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.090
 for you I do not cook only for my children in 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.790
 home when he asks me daddy I want pasta 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.340
 then he did the kitchen because but not 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.280
 at home not only cook the day that 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.140
 that I can leave the restaurant 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.090
 I usually go out to eat with my wife 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.360
 see friends as they come to 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.370
 see me some confessional trick inside 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.049
 of your kitchen 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.370
 it does not cook me so transparent many 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.140
 times I 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:53.260
 my client tells me I do not believe that the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.450
 customers in kitchen and we do it together 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.599
 you 'll see that you realize one thing 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.569
 the tomato I never count too when 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:05.379
 I give some kind of cooking is a secret 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:09.519
 of family and I never ask myself 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.829
 also ferra they liked it and not what 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.440
 we tell is a family secret that 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.709
 they kill us to be more a promise 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.870
 familiar that a trick that ingredients 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:25.690
 can not miss on your table or at my table 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.460
 the bus bonus several several good I am 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.600

 the wheat the flour this is fundamental 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.350
 I am a lover of truffles 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.530
 that's why they call me trufar the megane 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.530
 Tumbarello drink is usual inside 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.350
 your meals from restaurants on 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:50.040

 drink to look at me I love champagne not 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.370
 He took a lot of water, not water, 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.380
 I have to choose from a champagne and a 1080 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.209
 when it's a restaurant outside eating in 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.620
 that you usually see that for you is what 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:10.319
 most important in a restaurant 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.360
 the service and care food and 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.340
 good 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.890
 you like it a little when you entered the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.510
 who know you this while walking 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.170
 at the end of the meal 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.560
 it's a moment where I'm familiar with 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.930
 business many times but 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:33.270
 one who goes in a restaurant names for 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:35.730
 put to feed is going to enjoy 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.000
 what do you prefer to eat at the table when 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:42.960
 you are going to eat by there in table or tapas 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.689
 great if you can see before the most in 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.180
 tapas tables 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:54.130

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:57.680
 I love tapas I love it I love it 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.840
 but normally when I go out to eat 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.479
 with my wife I love a little less 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.229
 it was not too good to eat food 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.669
 fast when you eat out is not not 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.820

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.870
 missing a plate in your menu 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:37.930
 but you have to write 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:39.820
 well this depends that is a menu with 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.280

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.550
 make faces are all individual 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.470
 of assembly and you can not do it in the 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.740
 restaurant is low some carbonara 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.500
 but the real charcoal without cream or 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.140
 without seeing that you consider yourself a showman of 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.530
 the kitchen does not business a person so 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.720
