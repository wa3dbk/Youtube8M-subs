the<00:02:43.620> side<00:02:43.800> here<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.040> take<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.220> look<00:02:44.280> at<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.610> I

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
the side here and take a look at that I

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.210 
the side here and take a look at that I
also<00:02:45.360> noticed<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.960> wing<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.770> little

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
also noticed that the wing is a little

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.400 
also noticed that the wing is a little
larger<00:02:47.550> longer<00:02:47.850> than<00:02:48.120> normal<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.870> reason<00:02:49.230> for

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
larger longer than normal the reason for

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.770 
larger longer than normal the reason for
that<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.710> that<00:02:49.740> DP<00:02:50.610> spect<00:02:51.000> out<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.360> wing<00:02:51.570> to

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
that is that DP spect out this wing to

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.840 
that is that DP spect out this wing to
allow<00:02:52.080> for<00:02:52.110> larger<00:02:52.860> intercoolers<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.730> be

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
allow for larger intercoolers to be

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.820 
allow for larger intercoolers to be
installed<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.420> car<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:55.500> course<00:02:55.709> this

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
installed on the car and of course this

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.260 
installed on the car and of course this
wing<00:02:56.040> gives<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.370> an<00:02:56.459> additional<00:02:56.940> four<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.240> a

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
wing gives you an additional four and a

wing gives you an additional four and a
half<00:02:57.330> inches<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.050> back<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.920> allow<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.190> to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
half inches to the back to allow you to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.640 
half inches to the back to allow you to
use<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.700> full<00:02:59.940> width<00:03:00.180> intercooler<00:03:01.050> that's<00:03:01.320> also

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
use a full width intercooler that's also

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.580 
use a full width intercooler that's also
longer<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.490> length<00:03:02.959> how<00:03:03.959> does<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.200> body<00:03:04.350> work

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
longer in length how does the body work

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.140 
longer in length how does the body work
it<00:03:04.740> says<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.100> course<00:03:05.160> design<00:03:05.580> plastics<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.090> the

yeah<00:03:14.190> very<00:03:15.150> close<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.600> fiberglass<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.790> as<00:03:17.790> you

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
yeah very close to fiberglass and as you

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.850 
yeah very close to fiberglass and as you
can<00:03:18.150> see<00:03:18.180> they<00:03:18.540> actually<00:03:18.989> mold<00:03:19.260> these<00:03:19.470> parts

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
can see they actually mold these parts

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.060 
can see they actually mold these parts
into<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.190> metal<00:03:21.090> body<00:03:21.360> work<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.810> car<00:03:22.070> now

the turbos of that era running I think

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.310 
the turbos of that era running I think
three<00:03:25.200> threes<00:03:26.180> what<00:03:27.180> was<00:03:27.300> this<00:03:27.420> running<00:03:28.170> here

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
three threes what was this running here

the output of this engine at the
flywheel<00:03:30.239> according<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.810> roof<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.200> just<00:03:31.470> a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
flywheel according to roof is just a

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.940 
flywheel according to roof is just a
little<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.100> 400<00:03:32.700> horsepower<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:34.410> the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
little of a 400 horsepower and the

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.120 
little of a 400 horsepower and the
typical<00:03:35.550> 3.3<00:03:36.239> euro<00:03:36.540> engine<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.380> era<00:03:37.560> was

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
typical 3.3 euro engine of that era was

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.190 
typical 3.3 euro engine of that era was
putting<00:03:38.430> out<00:03:38.489> around<00:03:38.730> 300<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:39.900> it's<00:03:40.019> just

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
putting out around 300 so it's just

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.810 
putting out around 300 so it's just
about<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.440> hundred<00:03:40.680> horsepower<00:03:41.100> more<00:03:41.519> with<00:03:41.790> a

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
about a hundred horsepower more with a

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.410 
about a hundred horsepower more with a

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
very good usable torque spread it's a

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.940 
very good usable torque spread it's a
little<00:03:45.780> bit<00:03:45.870> larger<00:03:46.019> displacement<00:03:46.440> and

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
little bit larger displacement and

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.250 
little bit larger displacement and

compression<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.010> factory<00:03:50.400> did<00:03:50.640> so<00:03:51.030> this

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
compression and the factory did so this

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.600
