00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
brill but LASIK alee what it would do it

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.729 
brill but LASIK alee what it would do it
would<00:01:00.449> make<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.020> live<00:01:01.170> forever<00:01:01.320> basically

sending you to the middle like paradise

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.570 
sending you to the middle like paradise
it<00:01:06.630> would<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.380> would<00:01:08.189> go<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
middle of the earth and basically live

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.500 
middle of the earth and basically live
forever<00:01:10.470> something<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.159> now<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
forever something like that now it's the
