gun where you think reduce recoil will
come<00:01:02.060> in<00:01:02.210> handy<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:02.829> that's<00:01:03.829> it<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.759> hardest

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
come in handy and that's it the hardest

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.819 
come in handy and that's it the hardest
part<00:01:05.360> about<00:01:05.420> kick<00:01:05.810> is<00:01:05.990> deciding<00:01:06.439> whether<00:01:06.560> your

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
part about kick is deciding whether your

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.550 
part about kick is deciding whether your
primary<00:01:07.340> actually<00:01:07.820> needs<00:01:08.119> this<00:01:08.420> ability<00:01:08.689> most

primary actually needs this ability most

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.440 
primary actually needs this ability most
primaries<00:01:10.189> have<00:01:10.340> six<00:01:10.640> proficiencies<00:01:11.299> in

primaries have six proficiencies in

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579

recommendation that will work for every

recommendation that will work for every
player<00:01:17.810> out<00:01:18.079> there<00:01:18.109> to<00:01:18.829> one<00:01:19.039> person<00:01:19.490> on<00:01:19.579> a

player out there to one person on a

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
particular gun kick will seem like a

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.679 
particular gun kick will seem like a
waste<00:01:21.710> but<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.549> next<00:01:22.880> it's<00:01:23.060> a<00:01:23.210> mandate

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
waste but to the next it's a mandate

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.870 
waste but to the next it's a mandate
still<00:01:24.319> here's<00:01:24.679> some<00:01:24.859> good<00:01:25.069> general<00:01:25.460> tips<00:01:25.670> that

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
still here's some good general tips that

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.510 
still here's some good general tips that
have<00:01:25.969> worked<00:01:26.210> for<00:01:26.420> me<00:01:26.569> in<00:01:27.259> my<00:01:27.530> opinion<00:01:27.829> kick<00:01:28.369> is

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
have worked for me in my opinion kick is

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.550 
have worked for me in my opinion kick is
best<00:01:28.819> when<00:01:28.969> used<00:01:29.210> on<00:01:29.389> the<00:01:29.509> SMGs<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.200> the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
best when used on the SMGs and the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.260 
best when used on the SMGs and the
majority<00:01:31.069> of<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.310> assault<00:01:31.579> rifles<00:01:32.030> I

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
majority of the assault rifles I

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.209 
majority of the assault rifles I
realized<00:01:32.960> this<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.350> very<00:01:33.740> general

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
realized this is a very general

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.520 
realized this is a very general
statement<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:34.819> I<00:01:35.060> will<00:01:35.299> clarify<00:01:35.539> in<00:01:36.109> the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
statement so I will clarify in the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.859 
statement so I will clarify in the
assault<00:01:36.829> rifle<00:01:37.189> tier<00:01:37.460> I<00:01:37.670> think<00:01:37.999> the<00:01:38.119> CM<00:01:38.420> 901

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
assault rifle tier I think the CM 901

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.199 
assault rifle tier I think the CM 901
and<00:01:38.899> the<00:01:39.200> g36<00:01:39.979> stand<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.399> gain<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:40.609> most<00:01:40.759> from

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
and the g36 stand to gain the most from

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.199 
and the g36 stand to gain the most from
reduced<00:01:41.539> recoil<00:01:41.869> guns<00:01:42.829> like<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.219> m4a1<00:01:43.819> Skaar

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
reduced recoil guns like the m4a1 Skaar

ACR ak-47 the mark 14 and the fa d also
benefit<00:01:49.280> from<00:01:49.310> kick<00:01:49.670> but<00:01:49.999> not<00:01:50.479> quite<00:01:50.810> as<00:01:50.990> much

I<00:01:59.179> tried<00:01:59.840> kick<00:02:00.109> them<00:02:00.289> both<00:02:00.499> and<00:02:00.889> I<00:02:00.979> thought<00:02:01.219> it

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
I tried kick them both and I thought it

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.269 
I tried kick them both and I thought it
was<00:02:01.490> an<00:02:01.609> awful<00:02:02.060> thing<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.229> clap

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:04.279 
was an awful thing you a clap

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
much as the first three I mentioned as

much as the first three I mentioned as
for<00:02:32.359> the<00:02:32.450> mp7<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:33.379> will<00:02:33.829> argue<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.159> kick<00:02:34.549> is<00:02:34.790> a

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
for the mp7 I will argue that kick is a

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.119 
for the mp7 I will argue that kick is a
decent<00:02:35.120> choice<00:02:35.480> but<00:02:35.930> even<00:02:36.290> I'll<00:02:36.439> admit<00:02:36.799> I'm

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
decent choice but even I'll admit I'm

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.099 
decent choice but even I'll admit I'm
probably<00:02:37.549> in<00:02:37.909> the<00:02:38.030> minority<00:02:38.180> on<00:02:38.659> this<00:02:38.870> one

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
probably in the minority on this one

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.229 
probably in the minority on this one
since<00:02:39.680> we're<00:02:39.859> on<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.099> topic<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.609> the<00:02:40.730> SMGs

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239

since we're on the topic of the SMGs
here's<00:02:41.599> one<00:02:41.810> more<00:02:42.019> tip<00:02:42.079> if<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:42.950> pick<00:02:43.189> the

here's one more tip if you pick the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.399 
here's one more tip if you pick the
rapid<00:02:43.640> fire<00:02:43.790> attachment<00:02:44.409> definitely

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
rapid fire attachment definitely

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.039 
rapid fire attachment definitely
consider<00:02:45.829> this<00:02:45.890> proficiency<00:02:46.790> kick<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.720> rapid

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049
