00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.349
 the rite and today I 'm not bringing a 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.150
 channel gameplay because the following is me 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.640
 I was seeing there on the internet is one of the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.439

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.680
 many are buying and also the 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.500
 Strict and the people do not know. 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.850

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.780

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.900

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.520
 I even thought about selling the game 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.100
 How did I buy it because I could not 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:57.070
 find a room and could play in what 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:00.980
 It's called the room, no way. 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.079
 with the smallest and written in the key 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.289
 When the game was going to start, it was not a mistake. 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.470
 there is a balance available in rock 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:12.140
 he gave a mistake and if there was a room he would 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.100
 the trap was too high too high and 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.509
 I was not going to make a mistake and I was not going to play. 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.350
 I'll show you how it's going. 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.180

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.599
 happened every time the model reboot 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.099

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.599
 I have to do this again there is 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.060

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.050
 You liked the galley. 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.700

 next game play then this is going to be the 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.590

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.260
 channel 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:34.120
