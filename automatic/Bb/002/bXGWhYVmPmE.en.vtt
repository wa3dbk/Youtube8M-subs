00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:18.590
 the tenth success for audi is the goal 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:21.000
 and he's supposed to be a fan of the audi r18 tdi 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.650
 most striking feature after about ten 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.640
 years he is the first closed 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.260
 lmp1 sports car of the ingolstÃ¤dter 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.750
 aerodynamically effective aggressive in 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.750
 design and agile in the curves 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.520
 a new car is always something 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.140
 special it is a closed car 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.600
 and so attracts the interest of the whole 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.190
 world to be but we must ride in 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.460
 I have experience with closed 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.129
 cars from spring audi built a 1999 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.739
 But this is the first right-hand drive 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.780
 it's sleek very fast a big one 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:03.199
 challenge and makes a lot 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:06.710
 fun drive and mystery of the 9th 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.960
 the heart of a 3.7 liter v6 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.850
 tdi motor a significant reduction 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.850
 compared to the previous model 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.400
 and yet in spite of drastic 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.830
 ruling changes for 2011 are held 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.830
 at the victorious diesel concept 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.100
 That's not the case with decision- making processes 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.680
 just like the last one 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.810
 years because the alternative gasoline too 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.400
 it was due to the rules situation 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.740
 which are here to the disadvantage of diesel 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.920
 has changed over the last few years yes 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.810
 but given so that even a ottomotor 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.390
 home question would have come 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.830
 but we have a diesel 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.930
 decided because it's still on 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.170
 believe that the diesel engine the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.970
 most efficient at tripolis and we on 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.650
 there is still considerable room for this 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.200
 development potential see that when 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:06.840
 ottomotor actually already largely 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:09.509
 to have grazed believe efficiency 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.810
 ever the keyword at the concept 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.580
 the r18 tdi the lightweight construction is 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.150
 an example of the spirit of innovation 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.650
 the developer 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.989
 because what is behind the name audi 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.600
 Ultra hides is basically one 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.930
 simple consideration a light car 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.120
 is always an efficient car 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.020
 and that should be the hope carrier 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.760
 watch directly 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.230
 because of the fact that the basis 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.200
 weight of the vehicles over the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.780
 previously reduced again 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.220
 Do you know you are so important 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:50.280
 lightweight construction in extreme shape 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.470
 that fits very well with audi 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.500
 Ultra technology is ours too 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.720
 series vehicles more and more in 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.430
 the future in the spotlight 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.200
 should 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.940
 and it therefore has the design completely 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.250
 simply the wish is that one the 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.390
 lightweight construction in any form in the design 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.910
 can make visible 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.620
 on the one hand, that suits one 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.800
 tries a relatively bad design 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.650
 and that you can also see it clearly 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.630
 that's just what makes this car 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.920
 Carbon fiber is built from one 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.150
 Material of unique kind 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.710
 low weight and high strength 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.640
 combines everything new on the vehicle and yet 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.440
 everything with the old in things fahrerkader 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.980
 the teams of the le mans triple victory 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.630
 2010 will continue unchanged in 2011 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.459
 title hunt 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.020
 much to the joy of the well-rehearsed 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.020
 crews in the cockpit 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.420
 very special and you do not have that 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.129
 all days that you are exactly with the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.840
 same team with the one in the 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.930
 last year celebrated such a huge success 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.030
 just the overall victory in the 24 500 exactly 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.250
 with the same team is on it 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.890
 in the same team can start again and 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.440
 this is something unique and there is one 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.810
 special feeling because you just stop 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.879
 indeed, one has to the success of the 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.310
 background one has so much positive 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.299
 moment experienced together and there is 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.459
 just trust 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.199
 start free for a total of three 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.840
 driver teams with the prospect of the 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.660
 Tenth le Mans victory on behalf of the four 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.790
 rings 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.830
 Perfect conditions for that 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.600
 most legendary of all long distance races in the 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.600
 year 2011
