00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.740
 much more easily than expected 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.240
 pulled out the reale ademar his party 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.670
 before the revelation of the league the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.430
 eighth academy which he thrashed for a 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.680
 forceful 30 19 after some excellent 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.720
 40 minutes in which with the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.150
 Antonio García and Andreu as principals 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.249
 stylets left at 10 goals 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.529
 rent and they allowed the last room 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.720
 of time you could rotate and try things 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.790
 He had started already well set 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.560
 Leon doing a lot of damage from the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.600
 pivot and preventing the whole 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.730
 Galician surprise start as they have 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.070
 made other teams this year in the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.990
 palace so those of Isidoro sent 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.730
 from the first bars and started 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.280
 to open right when he entered match 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.140
 Antonio Garcia who seemed to keep the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.120
 excellent line of shock to the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.610
 copenhagen and with three such bombs 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.620
 consecutive puts 95 and forced 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.510
 Enrique Dominguez to ask for time to 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.060
 prevent them from leaving very soon 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.800
 encounter got it momentarily 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.110
 the octavio thanks above all to a 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.030
 ademar player specifically to raul 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.430
 nantes who plays as loan at the club 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.600
 Galician since its extra motivation and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.890
 a dose of success in the launch 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.110
 made him 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.000
 four goals that a team held 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.800
 before forest and bull who lived 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.260
 a dead time that would end up marking 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.970
 the party and that is from him came the 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.190
 Marist set with an extra point in 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.380
 defense what allowed him to run for 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.900
 first time in the game and with live 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.240
 lykov hammering the rival goal and what 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.369
 to be without conceding a goal in 7 minutes 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.420
 with which they would take 7 goals of income that 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.710
 they would keep until 18 11 of the rest 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.420
 löscher has been successful 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.820
 we have thrown darn wrong in those 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.200
 situations so clear and good to start 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.259
 hence, he has always been playing 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.630
 with wide markers and that has 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.360
 allowed to play comfortable and especially me 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.729
 I say the cons the actions of 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.259
 transition defense-attack years 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.970
 exploiter and there was the meeting 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.770
 on track and it became 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.380
 sentenced at the start of the second 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.780
 half thanks to came the being that 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.580
 stopped everything and fit only one goal in the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.380
 first ten minutes what allowed 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.840
 that the one of marc opened based on 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.030
 counterattacks an already irremovable rent 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.690
 of 10 goals or not been more comfortable than 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.230
 what 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.540
 Was expected 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.159
 and we have come out very serious since 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.440
 beginning in the first time and we're going 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.849
 with a difference of 7 and if then 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.959
 also in the second half we have been 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.420
 able to expand that difference that 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.940
 many times it is difficult because you can 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.980
 come a relaxation and so on from 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.870
 that 22 12 and with the victory already in the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.150
 pocket isidoro began to try 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.069
 less usual situations but that 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.980
 they can become routine with the low 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.810
 for the entire montoro season as well 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.150
 there were many minutes of deep walks in 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.980
 pod attack in defense or play 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.110
 two pivots that did not make the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.989
 difference would be resented and arrived 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.989
 with a blunt 30 19 to the final whistle
