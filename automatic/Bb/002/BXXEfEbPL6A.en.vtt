 very cool from the videos thank you today 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
 brings a lot of things first thing 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.590
 everything before you start is a bot for 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.779
 survival in the desert is worth it and what 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.490
 means that on top of the water or 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.039
 on top of the earth we will leave a 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.960
 block of these piggy worth is to say what 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.810
 you are looking over the crops to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.189
 times the cultures of the villages apart 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.859
 the doors the windows closed with the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.360
 material of this green color and some 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.540
 the calls that are already out there you do not see the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.530
 crops there that come out with stone 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.950
 transform what is made for you 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.350
 you die of that so that you have a bad time or 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.300
 be this fact bet everything do not have 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.300
 The food that is made powder is worth 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.710
 weird things in this way that brings what 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.660
 good that you will be able to capture 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.949
 any tool with the stone is 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.960
 in agreement you already know that to get 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.719
 this stone or you will find it there or 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.340
 you think so calmly with a 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.050
 little bit of sand 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.810
 well done this can make you 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.570
 spades back peaks shovels hoes 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.180
 et cetera et cetera et cetera i saw 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.070
 then well we do not see at the beginning with 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.900
 a cactus finally agree the cactus 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.270
 is going to have real utility and not the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.460
 green dye that I currently had with a 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.800
 cactus will give us three of this wood 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.310
 It is worth 1 2 and 3 as same wood 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:27.300
 cool I like this sula valen is very 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.030
 cool and then if you put sand together and 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.350
 gravel you're going to get three of the cement 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.100
 this one that then kitchen we go we 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.530
 you remember 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.840
 if we take sand here we put an agreement 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.250
 let's get what is being the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.350
 artificial 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.580
 since we can not get it in the 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.540
 desert the wool we can get it 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.640
 here 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.190
 superchule 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.760
 if we put together four cactus we are going to 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.130
 get 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.560
 the cactus fruit that is a species 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.940
 of apple according green and 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.490
 that the good thing is that 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.920
 will give us 8 worth saying with 4 cactus 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.960
 we got 8 apples of these 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.880
 then we have to if we get three 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.420
 so we will be able to make us a 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.510
 fairy tiles of light is worth as you see 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.510
 here 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.020
 but that you can not upload one another 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.180
 which is a bit shabby in agreement but 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.489
 good is what there is 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.760
 most perfect you can not ask a 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.409
 good boat that out there after we have 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.849
 that if we do this we will catch some 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.370
 stairs that we hope they do not come 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.960
 Exact played well played that well 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.420
 vaults for all 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.200
 and there we have some pretty and 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:44.090
 lovely green green stairs 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.090
 pistacho also have great 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.170
 there it is cool and it is already there 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.920
 that more than more than more tools is 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.920
 just another 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.650
 blog that is a bit everything does not add 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.980
 nothing else here adds something else not 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.519
 no no 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.970
 worth here the swords are worth 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.950
 I tried maybe for new here are the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.720
 new tools in agreement are going to be 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.500
 like wooden tools then 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.420
 It's worth as you see 32 until you see 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.750
 there as well as to be like two tools 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.629
 of stone in agreement so it's good x 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.940
 is progressing and this chick have the 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.650
 question of how much you will generate a 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.989
 apple hear because look what we buy 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.450
 right now we put this we see it well 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.730
 in difficult to be spent before what 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.870
 that the food is coming and we are going to 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.829
 run the atmosphere around the town to 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.829
 lower the thighs 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.010
 to see come 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.440
 I think that not very smart not fall 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.510
 I know why the mod maybe does not go down 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.180
 the thighs of you imagine there is already 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.620
 is going down a good one has already lowered a 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.510
 little bit let's see if they give another turn 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.680
 to the lower town look you see how much 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.160
 lowered already lower others more 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.720
 quickly and until two come the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.270
 third is already dotted in terms of 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.750
 go down a little bit more everything we started 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.750
 eat fruit 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.420
 and we check 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.730
 how much will give us an apple of 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.480
 food for how much would be equivalent will be 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.890
 as normal apple will be more will be less 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.060
 well we see it now let's go down a 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.060
 little bit more food 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.270
 come and go down a little bit more 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.300
 yes 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.940
 worth note two musicians as you see 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.830
 and ready 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.420
 the ticos because that's all if you like 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.260
 the video alain south 7 and tomorrow more and 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.260
 better until later
