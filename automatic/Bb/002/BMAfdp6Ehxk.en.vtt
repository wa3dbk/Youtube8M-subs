00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
lot let's see if we've still got the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.170 
lot let's see if we've still got the
wraparound<00:03:04.940> system<00:03:05.569> that<00:03:05.690> we<00:03:05.780> had<00:03:05.930> before<00:03:07.180> we

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
wraparound system that we had before we

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.080 
wraparound system that we had before we
don't<00:03:08.390> seem<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:08.989> have<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.580> text<00:03:10.580> wrap<00:03:10.790> around

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
don't seem to have the text wrap around

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.080 
don't seem to have the text wrap around
but<00:03:11.330> i<00:03:11.360> must<00:03:11.569> confess<00:03:11.810> this<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.440> an<00:03:12.590> early

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
but i must confess this is an early

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.420 
but i must confess this is an early
early<00:03:14.090> test<00:03:14.480> build<00:03:14.750> of<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:14.989> rom<00:03:15.250> but<00:03:16.250> that's

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
early test build of the rom but that's

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.860 
early test build of the rom but that's
just<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.940> quick<00:03:17.299> look<00:03:18.200> at<00:03:18.620> browsing<00:03:19.599> we<00:03:20.599> can<00:03:20.750> use

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
just a quick look at browsing we can use

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.330 
just a quick look at browsing we can use
a<00:03:20.900> back<00:03:21.140> button<00:03:21.349> by<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.590> way<00:03:21.799> to<00:03:21.860> go<00:03:22.069> back<00:03:22.310> and

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
a back button by the way to go back and

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.920 
a back button by the way to go back and
we've<00:03:22.670> got<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.879> full<00:03:23.000> screen<00:03:23.299> browsing<00:03:23.780> on

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
we've got the full screen browsing on

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.750 
we've got the full screen browsing on
the<00:03:25.480> touch<00:03:26.480> diamond2<00:03:27.730> sure<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.849> same<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:30.760> oh

and also we've got the google maps of

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.089 
and also we've got the google maps of
course<00:03:34.099> which<00:03:34.609> is<00:03:34.640> always<00:03:34.910> very<00:03:36.099> useful

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
course which is always very useful

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.319 
course which is always very useful
indeed<00:03:37.220> I'm<00:03:37.819> just<00:03:38.000> going<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.209> fire<00:03:38.390> that<00:03:38.569> up

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
indeed I'm just going to fire that up

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.470 
indeed I'm just going to fire that up
and<00:03:41.329> what<00:03:41.480> I'll<00:03:41.599> do<00:03:41.810> I'm<00:03:42.290> going<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.530> run<00:03:43.480> let's

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
and what I'll do I'm going to run let's

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.280 
and what I'll do I'm going to run let's
see<00:03:44.599> if<00:03:44.659> I<00:03:44.810> find<00:03:45.170> it<00:03:47.319> let's<00:03:48.319> just<00:03:48.379> run<00:03:50.049> up<00:03:51.049> quick

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
see if I find it let's just run up quick

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.430 
see if I find it let's just run up quick
GPS<00:03:51.829> in<00:03:52.010> here<00:03:52.750> let's<00:03:53.750> have<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:53.959> look

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.950 

there's<00:03:59.370> quick<00:03:59.640> GPS<00:04:00.030> I'm<00:04:00.480> just<00:04:00.660> gonna<00:04:00.750> load

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
there's quick GPS I'm just gonna load

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.360 
there's quick GPS I'm just gonna load
quick<00:04:01.200> GPS<00:04:01.620> that's<00:04:01.800> going<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.100> get<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
quick GPS that's going to get the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.720 
quick GPS that's going to get the
satellites<00:04:02.910> are<00:04:03.180> nearest<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.570> me<00:04:03.720> because<00:04:04.020> sir

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
satellites are nearest to me because sir

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.220 
satellites are nearest to me because sir
it<00:04:05.730> looks<00:04:05.910> like<00:04:06.030> it's<00:04:06.270> already<00:04:06.480> downloaded

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
it looks like it's already downloaded

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.440 
it looks like it's already downloaded
the<00:04:07.610> data<00:04:08.610> that<00:04:08.970> are<00:04:09.000> need<00:04:09.330> automatically

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
the data that are need automatically

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.580 
the data that are need automatically
quick<00:04:12.450> GPS<00:04:12.900> should<00:04:13.080> run<00:04:13.320> in<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.470> background

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
quick GPS should run in the background

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.710 
quick GPS should run in the background
anyway<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:15.030> then<00:04:15.240> we<00:04:15.360> are<00:04:15.450> hot<00:04:15.660> back<00:04:15.900> to

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
anyway and then we are hot back to

I'm<00:04:25.530> going<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.800> say<00:04:26.060> use<00:04:27.060> GPS<00:04:27.630> again<00:04:27.960> we've<00:04:28.140> got

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
I'm going to say use GPS again we've got

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.100 
I'm going to say use GPS again we've got

previous<00:04:36.720> reviews<00:04:37.350> that<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:39.140> interface<00:04:40.140> HTC

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
previous reviews that the interface HTC

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
previous reviews that the interface HTC
of<00:04:40.890> bills<00:04:41.100> feels<00:04:41.430> like<00:04:41.700> just<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.210> sort<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.480> a

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
of bills feels like just a sort of a

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.650 
of bills feels like just a sort of a
icing<00:04:44.820> on<00:04:44.940> top<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.360> firm<00:04:46.280> instead<00:04:47.280> of<00:04:47.340> a

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
icing on top of the firm instead of a

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.690 
icing on top of the firm instead of a
cake<00:04:48.660> almost<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.410> in<00:04:49.920> this<00:04:50.130> case<00:04:50.340> it<00:04:50.580> looks

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
cake almost and in this case it looks

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.720 
cake almost and in this case it looks
like<00:04:50.910> HTC<00:04:51.060> have<00:04:51.930> gone<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.650> lot<00:04:52.890> deeper<00:04:53.160> into<00:04:53.610> the

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
like HTC have gone a lot deeper into the

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.480 
like HTC have gone a lot deeper into the
cake<00:04:53.940> if<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.510> will<00:04:54.750> if<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.560> maintain<00:04:56.010> that<00:04:56.040> cake

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
cake if you will if I maintain that cake

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.310 
cake if you will if I maintain that cake
and<00:04:58.640> analogy<00:04:59.640> now<00:05:00.300> it's<00:05:00.510> still<00:05:00.780> looking<00:05:01.140> for

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
and analogy now it's still looking for

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.810 
and analogy now it's still looking for
the<00:05:01.440> GPS<00:05:02.310> satellites<00:05:03.919> and<00:05:04.919> just<00:05:05.130> see<00:05:05.340> if<00:05:05.520> we

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
the GPS satellites and just see if we

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.710 
the GPS satellites and just see if we
can<00:05:06.030> locate<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:08.550> not<00:05:08.820> actually<00:05:09.120> I<00:05:09.150> money<00:05:09.330> near

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
can locate and not actually I money near

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.630 
can locate and not actually I money near
a<00:05:09.750> window<00:05:10.050> so<00:05:10.500> this<00:05:10.650> may<00:05:10.830> take<00:05:11.040> a<00:05:11.100> while<00:05:11.220> and<00:05:11.580> it

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
a window so this may take a while and it

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.000 
a window so this may take a while and it
may<00:05:11.790> only<00:05:11.820> find<00:05:12.300> one<00:05:12.600> satellite<00:05:13.530> I<00:05:13.680> could<00:05:13.919> do

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
may only find one satellite I could do

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.310 
may only find one satellite I could do
with<00:05:14.160> doing<00:05:14.340> this<00:05:14.430> outside<00:05:15.980> but<00:05:18.200> that's<00:05:19.200> just

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
with doing this outside but that's just

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.600 
with doing this outside but that's just
one<00:05:19.440> we<00:05:19.770> wait<00:05:19.950> for<00:05:20.250> that<00:05:22.010> what<00:05:23.010> street<00:05:23.340> view<00:05:23.580> of

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
one we wait for that what street view of

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.890 
one we wait for that what street view of
course
