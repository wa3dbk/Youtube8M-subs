00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.519
 most dny tank tanks in the game that is about 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.060
 tanks with the highest damage rate in 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.000
 minute these tanks are especially popular in 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.940
 current realities random where only dp 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.780
 lets you do a lot of damage bye 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.140
 your allies are not completely merged I 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.520
 I will affect all the classes of technology and level 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 starting from 8 in the maximum configuration 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.170
 without additional equipment and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.490
 modules and you can see each 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.250
 tank by read more 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:59.400
 clicking on the annotation while viewing well 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:02.790
 Well let's go by itself we start with the 8th 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.700
 level and there we have three heavy tanks 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.640
 oddly allocated premium tank 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.009
 which is already withdrawn from sale 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.990
 sq-5 damage per minute he is already 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.689
 two thousand one hundred 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.119
 what a great figure for hard 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.960
 tank of the eighth level in second place 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.950
 After it comes from 6 with indicator 2001 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.280
 easier to say among tt on the eighth level 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.100
 Premium tanks stand out however among 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.039
 level 8 walls stand out with serious 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.920
 atrem object 416 with damage per minute in 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:43.259
 2400 very specific tank not for 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.950
 each as the tower he does not spin 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.939
 completely and with annie impressive however 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.420
 the gun is just fine from artillery 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.729
 most dp at the eighth level su-14 2 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.999
 but the difference with others is not so much 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.610
 significant among the top lt on you 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:06.340
 moore 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.860
 better b dpm in t49 2375 damage per minute 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.340
 provided that the EC has faded away and will 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.790
 stabling the most unusual lt 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.880
 of all as for me and long slanting 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.840
 Hulk Baba will enjoy far 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.940
 not every pt on level 8 dpm itself 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.000
 on I was far from the most pleasant 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.300
 in circulation su-101 with uranium a minute in 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.670
 2867 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.330
 almost unattainable figure for 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.390
 the rest but pt itself is one of the worst 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.690
 terrible in veins do not give us themselves 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.850
 feel comfortable 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.170
 go to level nine here 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.630
 allocated congress dpm 2284 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.510
 recharging quickly pounding hurts 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.310
 breakdown good tank many like however 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.820
 armor as such is not enough and 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.610
 punch us often among the hassles on 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:08.350
 ninth wins m46 patton sd catching 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:13.750
 2516 what is a great indicator 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:18.549
 for st9 feel recent about izard and 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:23.470
 9 catching dpm shield is at 3805 s 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:26.680
 damage per minute 2555 separation from fellow 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.549
 small but superiority is 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.660
 and at 9 pt as you all know the winner 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:37.269
 top toys 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:41.680
 same cake 3380 damage per minute 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:43.690
 that is just a record figure for it and 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.480
 love this pt 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.360
 and now we have reached tenths 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.760
 levels it is time to choose the best dpm 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:58.780
 Yshchikov from tops the most dpn and tt10 have 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:02.430
 t57 heavy with his damage 3096 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:07.390
 minute is an excellent indicator and this is it 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:11.620
 the main advantage and among st10 best 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.310
 after apa became object 430 with damage in 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.430
 minute 3000 to 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.180
 in an unusual machine with her 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.400
 artillery features on the tenth 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.780
 French drum stand out 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.880
 artillery shots urn per minute 3063 when 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.490
 provided that land mines will be stable 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.710
 punch but really there 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.690
 It turns out less because the breakdown of the mine is not 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:45.410
 always enough and finally the most dpm on i 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:48.680
 pt 10 level object 263 separation from waffles 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.620
 her small but still there and she herself 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.479
 potter is quite unusual and can normally 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.740
 bend in capable hands 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:59.510
 and on this video comes to an end write 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.750
 in the comments whether to write 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.360
 similar selection but in smaller 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.900
 levels of course subscribe to my 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.200

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.440
