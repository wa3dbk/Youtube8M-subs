here<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:06.990> go<00:01:07.229> there<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.950> immanuel<00:01:08.580> pretty

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
here we go there is the immanuel pretty

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.990 
here we go there is the immanuel pretty
basic<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.350> would<00:01:10.560> assume<00:01:10.920> I'm<00:01:11.549> not<00:01:11.610> gonna<00:01:11.850> go

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
basic I would assume I'm not gonna go

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.550 
basic I would assume I'm not gonna go
through<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.840> know<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.140> mean<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.470> an

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
through it but you know I mean it's an

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.370 
through it but you know I mean it's an
alarm<00:01:13.770> clock<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.520> should<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.880> pretty<00:01:15.060> simple

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
alarm clock it should be pretty simple

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.690 
alarm clock it should be pretty simple
there's<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.500> power<00:01:16.680> adapter<00:01:17.009> because<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.580> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
there's a power adapter because like I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.010 
there's a power adapter because like I
said<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.210> charge<00:01:18.420> your<00:01:18.450> phone<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.840> this

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
said you can charge your phone on this

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.950 
said you can charge your phone on this
using<00:01:19.380> USB<00:01:19.740> which<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.100> pretty<00:01:20.340> cool<00:01:20.720> but<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
using USB which is pretty cool but of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.910 
using USB which is pretty cool but of
course<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.320> do<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.590> plug<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> in

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
course you do have to plug it in

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.969 
course you do have to plug it in
although<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.299> check<00:01:24.600> out<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.930> Expo<00:01:25.650> it's

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
although if you check out this Expo it's

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.340 
although if you check out this Expo it's
kinda<00:01:26.159> hard<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.340> read<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:26.729> says<00:01:27.180> xbb<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
kinda hard to read but says xbb you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.800 
kinda hard to read but says xbb you
which<00:01:28.619> means<00:01:28.890> extreme<00:01:29.579> battery<00:01:30.119> backup<00:01:30.509> which

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
which means extreme battery backup which

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.450 
which means extreme battery backup which
is<00:01:30.990> pretty<00:01:31.500> nice<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.860> case<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.220> power<00:01:32.369> goes

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
is pretty nice in case the power goes

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.190 
is pretty nice in case the power goes
out<00:01:32.700> or<00:01:32.850> something<00:01:33.180> although<00:01:33.750> I'm<00:01:33.900> sure<00:01:33.960> it's

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
out or something although I'm sure it's

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.480 
out or something although I'm sure it's
probably<00:01:34.380> not<00:01:34.650> gonna<00:01:34.770> charge<00:01:35.040> your<00:01:35.189> phone<00:01:35.340> as

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
probably not gonna charge your phone as

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.640 
probably not gonna charge your phone as
well<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:35.939> they<00:01:36.630> don't<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.320> know<00:01:37.439> get

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
well but they don't like you know get

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.710 
well but they don't like you know get
you<00:01:37.799> up<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.040> everything<00:01:38.400> also<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> cool<00:01:39.570> design

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you up and everything also a cool design

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.870 
you up and everything also a cool design
I<00:01:39.869> think<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.320> bottom<00:01:40.680> thing<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> light<00:01:41.280> I'm

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
I think that bottom thing is a light I'm

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.219 
I think that bottom thing is a light I'm
pretty<00:01:42.150> sure<00:01:42.360> that's<00:01:42.479> what<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> picture

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
pretty sure that's what the picture

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
pretty sure that's what the picture
looked<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.530> online<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.909> kind<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.119> a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
looked like online so it's kind of a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.109 
looked like online so it's kind of a

not<00:02:32.460> really<00:02:32.520> sure<00:02:32.820> I'll<00:02:32.940> check<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.270> out<00:02:33.360> and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
not really sure I'll check that out and

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.880 
not really sure I'll check that out and
I'll<00:02:33.540> put<00:02:33.570> an<00:02:33.780> annotation<00:02:33.930> annotation<00:02:34.770> on<00:02:34.830> the

I'll put an annotation annotation on the
video<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.370> not<00:02:36.240> really<00:02:36.420> sure<00:02:36.630> what<00:02:36.810> TST

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
video that not really sure what TST

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.250 
video that not really sure what TST
stands<00:02:37.830> for<00:02:38.270> USB<00:02:39.270> charging<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.050> looks

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
stands for USB charging and it looks

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.170 
stands for USB charging and it looks
like<00:02:40.350> there<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.100> USB<00:02:41.550> port<00:02:41.760> right<00:02:41.790> there<00:02:41.880> and

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
like there is USB port right there and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.990 
like there is USB port right there and
there's<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.450> little<00:02:42.540> flip<00:02:42.810> switch<00:02:43.820> maybe<00:02:44.820> to

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
there's a little flip switch maybe to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.120 
there's a little flip switch maybe to
turn<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.270> on<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.540> off<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.870> guess<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.410> then

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
turn it on and off I guess and then

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.160 
turn it on and off I guess and then
there's<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.400> DC<00:02:47.910> power<00:02:47.940> going<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:48.960> pretty

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
there's a DC power going in so pretty

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.990
