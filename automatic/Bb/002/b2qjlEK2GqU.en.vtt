anyways<00:01:01.699> all<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.820> got<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.629> dodge<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
anyways all you got to do to dodge the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.690 
anyways all you got to do to dodge the
homing<00:01:04.409> now<00:01:04.530> chase<00:01:04.799> or<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.280> your<00:01:05.430> target

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.850 
homing now chase or with your target
quickly<00:01:06.390> because<00:01:07.020> when<00:01:07.170> you're<00:01:07.290> quite<00:01:07.560> close

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
quickly because when you're quite close

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.190 
quickly because when you're quite close
to<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.700> homing<00:01:09.030> launcher<00:01:09.060> will<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.840> fly

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
to it the homing launcher will just fly

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200 
to it the homing launcher will just fly
by<00:01:10.439> because<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.950> can't<00:01:11.310> aim<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.790> your<00:01:11.939> flying

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
by because you can't aim in your flying

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.020 
by because you can't aim in your flying
path<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:13.110> an<00:01:13.260> RPG<00:01:13.470> okay<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.670> but

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
path like with an RPG okay you can but

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.609 
path like with an RPG okay you can but
if<00:01:15.180> you're<00:01:15.360> getting<00:01:15.750> locked<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.409> mate

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
if you're getting locked on and mate

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.920 
if you're getting locked on and mate
doesn't<00:01:16.770> make<00:01:17.009> sense<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:18.299> that's<00:01:18.689> why<00:01:18.840> it

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
doesn't make sense and that's why it

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.370 
doesn't make sense and that's why it
will<00:01:19.080> only<00:01:19.229> fly<00:01:19.650> by<00:01:20.159> by<00:01:20.659> dipping<00:01:21.659> down<00:01:21.960> really

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
will only fly by by dipping down really

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.450 
will only fly by by dipping down really
quickly<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.580> close<00:01:24.240> only<00:01:24.900> auto<00:01:25.229> shot<00:01:25.590> also

here's again me orbiting a target homing

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.810 
here's again me orbiting a target homing
launcher<00:04:25.240> missed<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:26.440> if<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.550> would<00:04:27.730> have

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
I'm flying again at two boards my enemy

and he's shooting a homing now at me to
be<00:04:47.980> said<00:04:48.370> if<00:04:48.820> he's<00:04:49.150> gonna<00:04:49.570> like<00:04:49.990> shoot<00:04:50.800> in<00:04:50.980> the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
be said if he's gonna like shoot in the

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.310 
be said if he's gonna like shoot in the
middle<00:04:51.190> like<00:04:51.610> would<00:04:52.120> have<00:04:52.240> hit<00:04:52.480> you<00:04:52.510> anyways

middle like would have hit you anyways

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.890 
middle like would have hit you anyways
without<00:04:53.620> locking<00:04:54.580> on<00:04:54.850> to<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.210> you're<00:04:55.780> pretty

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
without locking on to you you're pretty

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.870 
without locking on to you you're pretty
much<00:04:56.080> fun<00:04:56.380> so<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:56.770> need<00:04:57.160> to<00:04:57.310> have<00:04:57.460> an<00:04:57.580> eye<00:04:57.670> on

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
much fun so you need to have an eye on

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.140 
much fun so you need to have an eye on
it

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
it

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.620 
it
so<00:04:58.630> you<00:04:58.690> can<00:04:58.930> touch<00:04:59.080> it<00:04:59.850> but<00:05:00.850> the<00:05:01.360> thing<00:05:01.600> is

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
so you can touch it but the thing is

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.960 
so you can touch it but the thing is
when<00:05:02.290> you're<00:05:02.410> getting<00:05:02.710> shot<00:05:03.310> by<00:05:03.490> a<00:05:03.520> homing

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
when you're getting shot by a homing

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.700 
when you're getting shot by a homing
launcher<00:05:04.000> from<00:05:04.510> behind<00:05:04.960> there's<00:05:05.290> no<00:05:05.500> way<00:05:05.650> to

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
launcher from behind there's no way to

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.620 
launcher from behind there's no way to
dodge<00:05:05.980> it<00:05:06.220> so<00:05:06.400> you<00:05:06.490> need<00:05:06.610> to<00:05:06.730> make<00:05:06.880> passive<00:05:07.240> net

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
dodge it so you need to make passive net

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.610 
dodge it so you need to make passive net
method<00:05:08.200> I<00:05:08.470> was<00:05:09.220> talking<00:05:09.760> in<00:05:09.850> another<00:05:10.180> tutorial

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
method I was talking in another tutorial

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.530 
method I was talking in another tutorial
but<00:05:11.620> watch<00:05:11.830> out<00:05:12.040> if<00:05:12.100> it's<00:05:12.820> exploding<00:05:13.390> before

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
but watch out if it's exploding before

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.390 
but watch out if it's exploding before
it's<00:05:13.870> actually<00:05:14.050> hitting<00:05:14.410> you<00:05:14.650> on<00:05:14.860> your<00:05:15.040> screen

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
it's actually hitting you on your screen

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.790 
it's actually hitting you on your screen
like<00:05:15.580> if<00:05:15.730> it's<00:05:15.910> all<00:05:16.060> there

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
like if it's all there

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.090 
like if it's all there
there<00:05:18.610> are<00:05:18.700> ways<00:05:18.970> to<00:05:19.000> dodge<00:05:19.420> it<00:05:19.630> well<00:05:20.440> not

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
there are ways to dodge it well not

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.130 
there are ways to dodge it well not
really<00:05:21.370> just<00:05:21.970> when<00:05:22.120> you<00:05:22.210> incredibly<00:05:22.780> lucky

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
really just when you incredibly lucky

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
back you can see here every time I

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.240 
back you can see here every time I
watched<00:05:28.840> homing<00:05:29.260> laughter<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:29.740> besides<00:05:30.040> if

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
watched homing laughter and besides if

came<00:05:30.490> from<00:05:30.700> behind<00:05:31.000> I<00:05:31.360> tried<00:05:31.900> to<00:05:32.080> analyze<00:05:32.590> it

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
came from behind I tried to analyze it

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.110 
came from behind I tried to analyze it
and<00:05:33.100> try<00:05:33.370> to<00:05:33.430> recreate<00:05:35.250> when<00:05:36.250> it<00:05:36.430> happens<00:05:36.850> and

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
try to dodge it many many times but

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.700 
try to dodge it many many times but
there's<00:05:40.030> just<00:05:40.210> no<00:05:40.420> legit<00:05:40.780> way<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.200> and<00:05:41.500> I

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
there's just no legit way and and I

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.320 
there's just no legit way and and I
don't<00:05:41.770> really<00:05:42.130> get<00:05:42.520> the<00:05:42.790> homing<00:05:43.180> light

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.890 
but if it gets nerfed a little bit just
acts<00:05:56.290> like<00:05:56.470> a<00:05:56.650> normal<00:05:57.010> homing<00:05:57.670> rocket<00:05:58.120> who

acts like a normal homing rocket who
