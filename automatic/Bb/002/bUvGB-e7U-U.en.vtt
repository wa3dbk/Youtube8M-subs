00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.950
 Yes too 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.160
 Well, it's zero since before last time 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.710
 This time in we continued to Zoro is here 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:18.750
 I would like to introduce Glamen 30 ridge 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:23.090
 Since this has already been opened already, I would like to introduce it immediately 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.480
 Yes is the emergence of 33 Yes 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.480
 Don 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.810
 Yes 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.740
 It went out 03:00 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.690
 How is it already at this point 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.050
 It says even fucking cool 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.050
 this 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:52.280
 It is a true top level among figures of 3 o'clock already 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.280
 That's the result, this face is first 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:04.320
 That Grameen 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:07.519
 Well 15 æ¦´12 30 Maybe it's pretty was good also that personally it more to the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.519
 Good face this face 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.920
 Youmu 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:20.860
 Guramen also I'd have been collected from scratch 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.280
 I wonder if I came here 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.290
 Oite to another all I feel 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.990
 Creative and 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:34.840
 It is Hanai that I see it every time I show it on this face 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.950
 How similar it is to som 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.950
 Including that point 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.460
 Oh no 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.080
 This too 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.080
 Really it is a commercially available 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.140
 It is also 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.909
 Isn't it a thing? 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.800
 Also this belt 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.950
 this 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.120
 I say it 's not a real metal 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.110
 Much of 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.850
 Can be realistic 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.140
 is not it 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:13.009
 10 questions really fine 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.009
 I wonder if this really decor to this here 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.670
 By this 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:23.069
 I guess I have to have something like a bazooka 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.060
 Bazooka also this book and wood grain gold 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.060
 It looks like something 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.280
 Overall it is great 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:38.420
 3:00 is itself stylish 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:41.940
 This cat's awesome fur coat 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.760
 This is really fine and well done 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.150
 Yes 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.629
 It is amazing this 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.560
 Somewhat delicately some place matting is being dumped and something is coming out 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:03:00.630
 The 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:02.100
 Wonder if part of whether that what or pretty or that sharp of a certain kind of paint coating so 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.310
 Something 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.610
 And say, Dondake fighting spirit is N and Nun' 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.420
 It's really awful I'm feeling so bad when it comes here 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.420
 The work is too good 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.900
 reconstruction 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.450
 This also Fumo Fu why I did not put the tofu luffing Naa attached in Guramen 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.930
 I suppose 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.930
 I wonder if there is only a small amount of fall 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.930
 Well this time 14 really Sanji is like this 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.880
 Matcha was a little hit 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.280
 It's quite big 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:47.530
 For a while 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:53.720
 And Toka Manami were z 0 of the z Toma Gurareiri of Guramen 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:57.200
 I think I'm thinking about the cost of stature, but I will arrange it with other figures 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.849
 I was given a salvation impression 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.180
 Take a little this way and once Zoro also I will come closer Zoro So also other Guramen 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.180
 I will 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.080
 Yes, this is an image day 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.080
 It is a woman 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.950
 I know I will go here or not 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.620
 Long time no logger 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.490
 Is it small? 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.750
 After all this is the principle 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:42.930
 So much even compared to principle was something 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.130
 It differs a little change height 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.130
 It is a little hard to see everyone 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.720
 Fairly both away with the Toka Hancock in the box land ye the solve 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.590
 Sorry 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.000
 Yes 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.330
 Would you try it looks like a little calculation 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.330
 eh 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.060
 Yes 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.060
 Certainly I'd Bankuni huge in the original 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:19.050
 Oh dear 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.050
 It's a little small. 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.030
 Hey, since you such a difference 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.050
 Well it is about Hen Chocola or so strange do Speaking of anxious 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:41.249
 It will softening and got to appear the Erie of the not the other guys at the 3 o'clock 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:42.729
 History 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:48.509
 Door Well 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.509
 I am worried about something like a slightly cautious day 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.409
 Anyway, this disaster is 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:57.029
 It's perfect 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.029
 Nothing to say 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.190
 Grameen 6 Cum Here 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.139
 It is a member machine, but in the opposite sense 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.460
 Yes 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:15.280
 3 assistant professors have introduced here 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:17.200
 By all means here's Road 30 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.840
 Because it is the best 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.180
 By all means 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.180
 I want you to aim
