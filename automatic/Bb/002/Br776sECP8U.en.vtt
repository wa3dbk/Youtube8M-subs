00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:15.590
 air temperature is now -28 Yandex 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:18.390
 shows us a -29 multimeter shows 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.029
 oil temperature -26 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.160
 Well, your personal thermometer which 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.320
 shows me 28 i believe more therefore 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.130
 the end of the multimeter we 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.130
 add 2 degrees before running 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.989
 pedagogy would like to show tension 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.700
 on the battery terminals cumulation me 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.380
 had to change since my six year old 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.750
 watch already stopped keeping him 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.690
 the battery is completely charged 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.910
 unfortunately how much is its density 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 and I can not say because I do not have 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.640
 diameter 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.860
 therefore, we will focus only on 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.469
 voltage battery stood 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.629
 night and this network territory which 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.910
 now that is minus 29 minus 28 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.699
 its voltage at terminals 12 is that 12 2 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.830
 30 minutes after scanning will finish 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.049
 his work let's see what it will be 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.720
 how much voltage will rise 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.390
 battery case konig we are now 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:19.939
 let's run hydronic also for 30 minutes as 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.939
 and doing or previous elm so 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.530
 930 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.310
 while hydronic is working 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.560
 show the fluidity of that oil which 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.260
 flooded at the moment I have now in 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.230
 or rather the beginning before 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.030
 the beginning of all this long term 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.240
 there is an introductory video I talked about 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.760
 that i have liquidated moth 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.930
 optimal 75 you 40 its fluidity me and 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.220
 embarrassed that what I decided to let the whole down 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.260
 this long-term test 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.260
 so let's see his fluidity 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.180
 Well 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.850
 Well, to be honest with honey 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:38.190
 yes that is now on the street minus 28 she 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:39.020
 already in principle not what voltage 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.490
 terminals 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.230
 after hydronic has stopped its 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:50.460
 work is something to show you because 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.850
 was at 11 2 literally in 20 seconds she 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.770
 here rose and wait 12 volts so 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.770
 watch the oil temperature 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:31.670
 oil temperature is above -6 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.470
 forget showing you throw a lesson 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.790
 the outstanding fluid for me has already become 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.850
 tradition, therefore, correct this defect 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.620
 coolant temperature arrow 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.930
 by and large, she stayed with her 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.900
 and this time the excuse is that I have 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.000
 was how to open the hood I have a rule 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.570
 fascist if he doesn't stop so 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.570
 okay waiting 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.740
 in a 10-minute straight oil spooks 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:07.400
 oil temperature rose from above to 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:10.390
 minus 2 at the moment after 10 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.390
 minutes and oil temperatures 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.870
 Garbage to want to show all weather 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.870
 let's see now the temperatures below 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.400
 Inter just below 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.729
 -18 well, to be honest, I think that 30 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.470
 minute warm up in such frost then 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.960
 there is already close temperatures from minus 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.259
 thirty is frankly not enough because 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.620
 what did I remember last winter you yourself were given 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:52.169
 well, hard for 40 minutes with the same 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.410
 the temperature was very much 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.150
 well then there was more you can 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.520
 it was telling us removed I'm already further 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.729
 no feelings between 30 minutes and 40 minutes 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.759
 the difference is just like in my opinion 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:08.669
 huge but since the whole test we have on 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.650
 30 minutes will build it by itself 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.419
 move away from these rules we will not 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.820
 start up honestly I would at this 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.190
 cooked temperature cooker which 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.780
 I heated hydronic I would not wait 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.210
 following cold snaps well and by itself 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.000
 intermediate temperatures as minus 25 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.620
 and minus 14 on which there was no tester 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.620
 summed up everything bye
