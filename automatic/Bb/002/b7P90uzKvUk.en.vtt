00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.560
 by stem cells are cells that 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.930
 we have in the body that have the 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.030
 ability to develop in any 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.280
 cell type are cells that like 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.100
 want a baby or a baby 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.330
 they have can develop into cells 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.940
 of the skin in tissue cells 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.010
 connective that the muscles and so on 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.890
 they occupy in aesthetics mainly for 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.890
 strengthen the skin and its structures 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.050
 the stem cells have the 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.390
 characteristic that if one injects this 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.670
 this liquid with cells enriched in 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.130
 the connective tissue of the skin these 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.830
 tend to develop in cells of the 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.310
 skin that produces a lot more collagen and 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.510
 that generates a facial rejuvenation is 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.790
 that's why he 's dealing with the 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.790
 aesthetics with excellent results 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.159
 the procedure is a procedure 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.259
 simple ambulatory where we 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.360
 we need to extract stem cells 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.640
 mainly the fatty tissue tissue 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.280
 fat has this remnant of cells 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.840
 that when they extract it they are around 80 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.750
 science of fat and we extract 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.030
 and this fat is sent to the laboratory 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.880
 for the process to be done in which 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.649
 the stem cells are concentrated and that 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.130
 it is the product of what we 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.130
 we work 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.030
 the procedure is not complex and a 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.200
 procedure that if you have to 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.880
 perform in a pavilion is a 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.689
 outpatient procedure that is done 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.549
 with local anesthesia where as we saw 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.360
 previously they are extracted between 80 and 100 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.040
 66 fat and with that one gets 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.500
 the product to work that are the 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.960
 normal and also in fats in the case 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.980
 who wants to graft or enhance some 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.980
 trait of meat 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.930
 it's a growth with a very low risk 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.659
 because obviously his procedures 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.370
 minors with a local anesthetic where 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.379
 there is a small extraction of fat and 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.950
 the risks are tremendously bounded is 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.950
 of very low risk 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.060
 the stem cells have a potential 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:34.400
 incredible the truth that you can occupy 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.579
 both in aesthetics and in some 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.829
 systemic diseases you can not 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.209
 play mainly in aesthetics about 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.340
 everything for facial rejuvenation not 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.689
 it's something that one does is enhance all 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.329
 the structure of the face with these 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:50.000
 cells enriched so that there is a 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.709
 remarkable rejuvenation in quality 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.810
 of the skin and its structure as 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.040
 I can also do olic grafts later 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.450
 or fat grafts in small 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.790
 different amounts area of ​​the face 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.069
 to also have the greatest naturalness 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.069
 and the best long - term outcome 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.530
 the effect that one expects in cells 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.840
 mother is medium and long term because 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.610
 because what do you do when you indicate these 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.110
 stem cells that are going to go 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.120
 differentiating into specific solutions 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.460
 of the skin is precisely that is 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.620
 support the skin that one already has with 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.780
 is with these new cells so 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.940
 both one has to wait around 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.800
 three and six months for the cells 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.720
 that one injects differentiates environment 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.640
 throughout the structure of the skin and that 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.410
 result endures in time as 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.700
 any zeal of the organism has a 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.410
 aging process but it 's long 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.080
 term therefore the result of the 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.080
 aesthetics is medium and long term
