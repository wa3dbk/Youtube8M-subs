00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 all the boys are the terror of the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.509
 planet gaming staff and I'm here at 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.849
 introduce me the best tactic for 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.090
 win all the games on online 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.150
 social manager I call it see you what 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.150
 is 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:31.410
 then I currently play with the as 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:34.220
 rome is the tactic with which I am winning 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.220
 all the matches 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.250
 a 4 3 3 b that is not a normal 4 3 3 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.629
 because as you can see 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.980
 there are various types of training and 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.309
 in the last period they had not arrived 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.050
 also several you have to do 4 3 3 b like 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.630
 central tip you have to put yours 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.880
 chief gunner yours for a long time 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.820
 weight and right kurtz yacob I could 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.000
 put borriello I decided that karst 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.800
 he had more attack strength as outsiders 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.899
 we very fast that they have also on 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.090
 midfield two strikers who have 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.600
 made a lot of the shots I put right and of 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.020
 aisha as an offensive midfielder a 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.330
 midfielder who has a lot of over all 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.820
 of attack and a true low the defensive 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.360
 I decided to put feet like i 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.740
 defenders midfielders reflexes of 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.060
 strootman and de rossi 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.090
 that defense the strongest defender 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.119
 put behind is more scarce in front like 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.330
 I did with burdisso and venice like 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.710
 goalkeeper de santis then then attacks 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.259
 that you must go and do extreme or in 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.229
 easier regular games so you don't 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.409
 tire players tastes take advantage of 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.330
 bands only attack 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.670
 now I stop for a while 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.490
 these deployment tactics then 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.950
 attackers with only attack not 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.980
 they will have to go back to defense, so 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.080
 when the offensive midfielder ie 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.050
 pjanic milan there was a ball will be 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.330
 ready on the wings especially to go 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.090
 to score goals 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.680
 sorry for the sore throat and in defense 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.860
 so we can cover the four 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.620
 defenders though we never have with 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.320
 leaps that are offensive defenders 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.150
 then they will remain in defense 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.370
 advanced tactics as tactics 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.800
 you have to put defense in the area 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.800
 because of marking to man is not convenient 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.690
 and offside trap no because with 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.930
 offside trap you can 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.640
 risks many goals on the counterattack 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.610
 opponent plays counterattack then the 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.980
 mentality offensive thick network rhythm of 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.890
 passages and at one hundred percent 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.750
 we confirm in our facts why 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.790
 this tutorial to win easily 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:01.269
 on football managers it's all good terror 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.700
