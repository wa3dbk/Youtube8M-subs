00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.380

 is said milk that is in the dm 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.250
 that's the taste with vanilla now 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.680
 There are also quite neutral with it 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.739
 calcium still without calcium and im 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.620
 Kaufland is available from the company drink 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.780
 sony this also very much also costs 99 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.879
 cent is also very good if he 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.260
 but rather in aldi purchase then 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.629
 I have to disappoint you unfortunately 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.379
 on the soymilk german 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.420
 tasteless was completely for me 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.340
 terrible was so a mixture of 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.260
 flour so old flour and water so 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.939
 if there are the first attempts with 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.439
 soy milk were and they say okay 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.700
 People will never be like that again 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.439
 then I can understand that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.420
 ripe drinks incredibly happy that here 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.920
 with chocolate flavor is also in 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.430
 The vanilla does not like to order 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.700
 to bake 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.830
 but I can not do that with coffee 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.250
 recommend that was so allergic 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.900
 There are cases of very delicious 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.189

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.829
 very delicious but can be 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.970
 Unfortunately not dream so check it the 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.320

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.329
 but here is a little tip and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.490
 His reformers exist on the basis 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.530
 again not with replacement products 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.000
 nuts oscar academy or hazelnut 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.850
 or almond and that leaves 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.950
 dream reasonably well 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.020
 that was the theme of cocoa and coffee now 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.460

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.510
