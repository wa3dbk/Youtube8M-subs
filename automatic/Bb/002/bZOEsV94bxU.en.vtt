00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.020
 and as not my name is Carmen Pelat 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.390
 sotomayor we are here in the city 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.410
 proceeds to scatter now that we have 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.540
 title since 1782 as a city and 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.730
 a great city because the processes 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.750
 important men who went out for the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.170
 history of mexico in 1977 was added 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.989
 to the name of the city process east this 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.680
 cemetery is functioning since 1827 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.110
 but here is the bread that no hair 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.900
 arispe we have their conjugates of hills 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.650
 what we call the crestón el pelón was 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.829
 a good juste I have to report that 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.790
 we have found fossils from the period 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.369
 Cretaceous 320 60 million years ago 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.899
 they have found mastodons in a vacuum 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.030
 here but before that we have the 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.970
 fossils from that time between 120 and 60 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.910
 millions of years later between 10 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.790
 and 20 thousand years in those hills of 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.940
 that of the northern part was the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.940
 mastodon in the emptiness 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.600
 now we have to give a one accuracy 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.570
 why the river starts from 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.220
 sonora do not say you rivers are hours 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.430
 the sound river 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.220
 look at the river that comes from Bacanuchi 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.460
 together there the noise that comes from bacoachi 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.050
 but low now it has occurred to them 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.940
 someone to you it happened to him that nobody and 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.950
 of the water logo of the village's arballo 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.900
 but they are born in the highlands beyond 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.580
 de san antonio is born in the land of 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.610
 garlic is born in the sierra of the public 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.940
 etcetera etcetera then sound river 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.740
 it is called here and here and curiously 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:06.260
 now in 1900 in 1780 in drawing that is 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.830
 in the london bridge bookstore explains 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.140
 where some rivers meet because they are two 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.970
 rivers but unfortunately now the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.270
 cow fight and we have stopped the water 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.820
 ask why good and here nothing else 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.620
 the one that comes under 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:26.989
 bankwatch and 200 years later then 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.820
 last year it came back together to very 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.970
 close here of edge in the 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.770
 completion of 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.420
 and that's where it comes together in past years 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.770
 I was gathering much higher 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.740
 then in that plane they made of 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.020
 1780 we see another few lands of 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.650
 agriculture that we had 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:54.750
 information of all of them from 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:57.000
 1780 then the 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.240
 land because then 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.770
 there have been very droughts 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.630
 extraordinary still last year 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.270
 we had an extraordinary drought and this 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.910
 year who knows how they are reading us 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.930
 good to be here clear that we have 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.500
 a pleiad of generals and men 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.840
 important for the sound history 9 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.840
 well we know that here they killed 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.550
 to the Apaches cortines and vipers although 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.740
 they could not stand them, they were brought 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.480
 from the sierra de chiricahua but also 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.670
 they had to kill because they had not 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.920
 forgiven four or five times at 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.680
 Mayos and the Yaquis among them put here 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.810
 I have gone gutierrez lore as the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.000
 ba christened the Apaches and 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.459
 then they killed them but to those who 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.040
 they came from the Cajeme region and the 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.290
 May well that's not that they were already Christians 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.350
 those they confessed anyway and 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.540
 he was killed they are also buried 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.020
 many other personalities but I'm going to 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.300
 go through all the personalities 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.930
 important to highlight one 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.580
 main to the general and engineer pedro 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.210
 garcia count 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.780
 this great man was born here in arispe in 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:12.440
 1808 has a lucid lucid trajectory 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.709
 or lucid as it is but it happens 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:20.160
 no one remembers him went 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.100
 child from here the uncle from him the gene the 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.290
 Mr. Diego Garcia Earl was the one 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.390
 really started the Mexican army 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.030
 yesterday I was seeing that they are 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.550
 celebrating 100 years of the army 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.400
 Mexican but this man Diego Garcia 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.500
 Garcia count who came from Ceuta although he 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.680
 he was native to italy he had one of 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.690
 ceuta etcetera etcetera 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.060
 and that the first military school in it in 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.100
 mexico in the federal district and gave the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.180
 chance they say is the 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.550
 beginning of the Mexican army then the 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.920
 general engineer pedro garcía conde 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.200
 had other very lucid brothers not just 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.700
 how were governors of chihuahua their 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.520
 brother francisco de chihuahua de 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.090
 coahuila de tamaulipas una unas 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.249
 Unique unique personalities then 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.709
 that's why I've highlighted 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:13.619
 the life of this great man who came 

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:16.289
 here to heal and curiously in the house 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:19.769
 My great-grandfather rented him two rooms there 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:23.249
 where I live two rooms one 

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:25.319
 when with many difficulties I was 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:28.649
 working to draw the line 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:30.899
 divide between mexico and usa 

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:33.329
 first it was enemy let's say 

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:35.369
 santana but at the time that there was 

00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:39.989
 started selling our territory that 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:41.699
 ominous president gave the chance of 

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:45.059
 that it was agreed that he was the most capable 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:47.159
 but he never remembered that he ate and that 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:50.939
 I had to do expenses and for shame 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:53.999
 because of his of his money from his said of 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:55.499
 his pecuniary and did all the expenses in the 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:57.659
 time that was there so that it does not 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:06:00.059
 the Americans would tell of that 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:02.639
 they say the Americans to everything 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:04.559
 trance wanted to go out to sea 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.139
 then we will have communication 

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:10.019
 with sound ground to baja california and 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.929
 says oral tradition to whoever arisps 

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:14.020
 because he knows because he came here to 

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:16.660
 cure 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.090
 got sick being in those in the 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.150
 desert with colds with heats with 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.370
 hungry with everything came to heal and 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.169
 rented as I said my grandparents for two 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.599
 months but before the two dead they 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.849
 died in 1851 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:33.430
 but before the Americans came 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.199
 to pay a visit they appreciated it a lot 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.479
 Although he had to say that 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:41.139
 get drunk with champagne because 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:42.699
 gringos wanted to go out to sea then no 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:44.249
 there would have been communication by land 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:48.629
 of blood 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:51.389
 vegetable I am sometimes very impulsive 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:55.019
 to talk but I like the truth 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:58.219
 historical then I'm composed now 

00:06:55.019 --> 00:07:02.219
 with all the people who want and me 

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:04.169
 I share my little knowledge of 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:06.029
 historical research because I 'm not 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.729
 historian I am the municipal chronicler 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:11.209
 of arins then honor to the next city 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:11.209
 nothing else
