00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.540
 hello everybody I was a video a 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.150
 very good video a video of the 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.190
 characteristic of my channel struggling with 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.799
 of the train to be able to stop it by saying what 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.349
 others in this case we will use a titan 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.420
 these big to place it on the way 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.200
 that to see if this way the train peta or makes 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.090
 something good then take the plane and we 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.960
 we go to point here is not the 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 train track tunnel 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.410
 good as they are 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.419
 and the hardest thing is to use it we have 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.160
 a little space and do not support curling by 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.810
 what we do is crash the most 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.940
 near the tunnel like this 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.750
 bursts but stays put 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.820
 perfectly into the path of train Look 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.070
 it's a bit of a botched method but it's 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.370
 pretty effective, fix that 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.850
 billions of 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.199
 all the fuselage on the train track 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.520
 just when the train passes you will have to 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.040
 hit by balls 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.450
 and the train is expected to come and see 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.450
 how to react against the titan 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.400
 let's see this time 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.490
 and this train is heard in the background 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.670
 see how the plane drags it 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.670
 drag 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.409
 as if they do not give me life as served 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.990
 a piece of paper in life as well 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.460
 not even a giant military aircraft does not change 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.240
 can do anything against a train 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.470
 unstoppable 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.080
 proven several times that he is unstoppable 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.570
 and unstoppable at all 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:41.540
 and well you can stop but 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.540
 based on bombs in another video and austria 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.640
 but titans nothing 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.150
 now fixed as you raise it is 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.150
 amazing 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.780
 he is dragged by the commonwealth as he wants 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.540
 to see the next 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.430
 here I say that it bothers me a little what 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.680
 what do you want 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.080
 I hope it is not now that it will come 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.260
 The good part 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.040
 and this train is normal car it 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.040
 star against the plane 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.790
 with the 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.069
 mika instead of staying 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.599
 so he has screwed up 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.700
 has been stuck in the corner of 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.370
 the mountain 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.069
 of that variety what can reach 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.049
 press this train 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.879
 can get to that pete game before 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.879
 for incredible 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.270
 now go down lion 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.129
 we can try them by putting another plane 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.079
 for another plane 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:14.420
 and well well they will not bring it on track 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.420
 you already hear I think see there comes 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.930
 good good has killed us but now 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:24.579
 we have placed a second train to see 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.579
 I do not get to see it I do not get to see it 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.660
 fix the stumbles that stick 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.800
 to see how it has been placed is that 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.800
 it looks like it's taking fire 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.260
 look you can hear the noise and everything 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.190
 what it does is stuck between the wall of 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.190
 fixed plane 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.480
 good to make this video has made me 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.180
 helped mine mine saves from 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.700
 galactic is called to devote as 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.730
 you always have to make video games and I 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:07.459
 that I'm here then trying 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.459
 make for train with cities 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.130
 more to do so we can say that what 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.130
 we want to derail 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.570
 I like the sound 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.150
 of the plane against the wall 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.810
 well there are so many planes half placed 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.630
 to see if another train is coming now and what 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.730
 ends petar everything 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.730
 there is galactic salva mary carrillo 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.749
 it seems that the train is coming 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.150
 there is train 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.980
 he had a pity and this is the plane 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.980
 fixed is flying 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.830
 holy god has placed them in a 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.850
 corner with its perched there 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.850
 hooked against the wall 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.260
 and he 's shooting with rocket launchers but 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:24.750
 it seems that what they bring 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.750
 you can not even place missiles 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.020
 he had a good 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.289
 the explosion or whatever you want to call it 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.289
 stumbled all 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.420
 incredible truth 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:44.980
 it's in firemen see 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.470
 to help us but good 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.260
 fuck nor with the weight of airplane on top of 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.009
 train manages to make the minimum buoy 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.120
 hard 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:57.040
 you have to show strength that has the 3 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.200
 and good is going to teach how the 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.450
 airplane 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.800
 Well, if you do not see before, I have not seen it 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.389
 well I show you as third plane 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.430
 in the life of the train that has to do 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:11.139
 is to bring it slower than you can and 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:13.460
 crashed against the tunnel like this 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:17.440
 it looks like a movie 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.440
 it looks good but you have to make this one 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.610
 will explode but will be placed on the site 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.710
 who plays and nothing if everything is the video 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:28.590
