00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 by the beautiful river bridge gives to have a 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.460
 idea of ​​the volume of water and the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.160
 left on the road also god help 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.330
 Who better not to improve? 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.059
 to be difficult for us 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.060
 according to the driver he has never seen so much 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.520
 Water how it's fallen now is difficult. 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.150
 another day out and not go out because they do not 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.369
 you can leave 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.010
 on graph with 2 detected without anyone 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.130
 leave here we notice the trail of the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.960
 Soybean production that is dumped 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.340
 of trucks but this is normal happens 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.130
 even on asphalt 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.110
 the point is that on the other side we see 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.879
 the production of soy and we will come back here 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.120
 who does what is more or less here 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.309
 a pod never to advance dinho look 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.860
 here the grains are practically 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.890
 point of harvest is not 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.449
 could even accelerate dececa this area 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.030
 to speed up the race in a few days 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.489
 but no one is going to do it 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.030
 waiting as long as possible to see if 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.270
 give a peek, it's soybeans everywhere 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.600
 as well as water also talking about it 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.810
 Look what a strange tractor around here. 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.850
 now that soy is just getting started 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.400
 are six tires and lots of force 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.240
 lately used not for another 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.369
 thing but to unmask machines 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:32.130
 harvesters now I will not say 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:34.710
 the edge to the old one is more in 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.170
 rural union to the recognition of 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.930
 difficulties in disposing of production 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.049
 remembering that in the rainy season 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.619
 coincides with the piracema of wood or 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.970
 period of prohibition as it is 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.860
 for fishing 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.590
 but the soy is exactly the opposite 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.079
 when it rains in the state, the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.659
 harvest is just beginning 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.759
 today the municipality walks around 50 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.799
 thousand hectares of cultivated area with rice 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.229
 or with soybeans 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.270
 only that the existing roads in the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.610
 municipality of not only marcelândia but also 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.300
 north and middle of the state 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.570
 they are not suitable 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.850
 to withstand heavy traffic on 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.390
 volume of trucks by volume of weight 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.190
 precisely in the rainy season of the year 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.040
 so we have points that are not 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.650
 designed to withstand and if this flow 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.710
 of bi-trains that flow of 9 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.420
 and with this with this rapid increase with 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.150
 this increase in production 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.210
 of the municipality and this rain that binds 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.240
 normal by our withdrawals in the 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.560
 last 15 years we do not have a month of 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.560
 February so rainy
