that was amazing I've never seen
anything<00:02:18.310> like<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:19.150> don't<00:02:19.330> think<00:02:19.660> you

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
anything like that I don't think you

anything like that I don't think you
would<00:02:19.930> ever<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:21.550> for<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:21.970> idea<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.110> pot

would ever and for the idea of the pot

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.600 
would ever and for the idea of the pot
is<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.070> m<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.810> creates<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:27.280> it

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
is that it m is that it creates so it

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.010 
is that it m is that it creates so it

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.220 
holds it all the steam from the bread
itself<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.190> wood-fired<00:02:30.520> oven<00:02:31.230> most

these<00:02:40.060> tricks<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.870> home<00:02:41.470> baker<00:02:41.680> uses

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
these tricks that the home baker uses

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.960 
these tricks that the home baker uses
but<00:02:43.290> as<00:02:44.290> we<00:02:44.800> talked<00:02:45.070> about<00:02:45.160> in<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.459> fan<00:02:45.640> for<00:02:45.790> some

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
but as we talked about in a fan for some

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.580 
but as we talked about in a fan for some
you<00:02:46.120> lose<00:02:46.270> a<00:02:46.330> lot<00:02:46.600> of<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:46.810> steam<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.530> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
you lose a lot of that steam so that the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.320 
you lose a lot of that steam so that the
advantage<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.040> casserole<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:49.050> creates

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.250

so<00:02:53.800> maximize<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.430> spring<00:02:54.670> secondly<00:02:55.420> all<00:02:55.959> the

so maximize the spring secondly all the

I have evolved in using a flexible board

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.680 
I have evolved in using a flexible board
to<00:03:11.440> transfer<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.430> dough<00:03:12.700> into<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.269> pot<00:03:13.450> makes

to transfer the dough into the pot makes

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.160 
to transfer the dough into the pot makes
it<00:03:14.040> substantially<00:03:15.040> easier<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.840> we're<00:03:17.019> going

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
it substantially easier and we're going

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.770 
it substantially easier and we're going
to<00:03:17.230> leave<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:18.340> dog<00:03:18.610> in<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:18.940> pot<00:03:19.060> for<00:03:19.540> about

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
to leave that dog in the pot for about

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.910 
to leave that dog in the pot for about
half<00:03:20.170> an<00:03:20.320> hour<00:03:20.410> before<00:03:22.680> taking<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.739> lid<00:03:23.890> off

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
half an hour before taking the lid off

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.250 
half an hour before taking the lid off
and<00:03:24.010> what<00:03:24.340> we'll<00:03:24.519> find<00:03:24.790> is<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.090> it'll<00:03:25.390> done

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
and what we'll find is that it'll done

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.900 
and what we'll find is that it'll done
it's<00:03:26.620> springing<00:03:27.160> at<00:03:27.220> that<00:03:27.340> point<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:27.730> within

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
it's springing at that point and within

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.650 
it's springing at that point and within
don't<00:03:28.870> need<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.880> steam<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.090> peppers<00:03:31.390> steam

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
don't need the steam and peppers steam

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.110 
don't need the steam and peppers steam
at<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:32.019> point<00:03:32.290> will<00:03:32.470> tend<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.400> stop<00:03:33.940> the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
at that point will tend to stop the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:04:01.750 
at that point will tend to stop the
crust<00:03:34.420> from<00:03:34.720> hardening

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:26.900 

that's<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.940> session

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.370 

do<00:04:27.910> that<00:04:28.030> against<00:04:28.300> me<00:04:28.360> dot<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.930> have<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.230> zoom

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
do that against me dot you have to zoom

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
do that against me dot you have to zoom
in<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.680> then<00:04:32.770> everything<00:04:32.950> microphone

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
in and then everything microphone

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.540 
in and then everything microphone
figured<00:04:33.700> up<00:04:33.820> me<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.650> what<00:04:35.650> you<00:04:35.770> can<00:04:35.950> hear<00:04:36.220> is

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
figured up me and what you can hear is

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:50.750 
figured up me and what you can hear is
the<00:04:37.860> surface<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:39.040> it<00:04:39.160> crackin

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:05:00.739 

that's<00:04:51.760> fantastic

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:00.749 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:03.719 

this<00:05:01.749> is<00:05:01.960> this<00:05:02.379> is<00:05:02.499> a<00:05:02.620> better<00:05:03.159> time<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.580> had

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
this is this is a better time that had

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.629 
this is this is a better time that had
for<00:05:04.029> dough<00:05:04.449> proving<00:05:04.990> in<00:05:05.110> it<00:05:05.229> and<00:05:06.039> I<00:05:06.159> usually

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
for dough proving in it and I usually

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.820 
for dough proving in it and I usually
just<00:05:07.110> check<00:05:08.110> it<00:05:08.259> out<00:05:08.409> back<00:05:09.249> up<00:05:09.430> on<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.639> shelf<00:05:09.879> I

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
just check it out back up on the shelf I

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.210 
just check it out back up on the shelf I
don't<00:05:11.830> do<00:05:11.919> anything<00:05:12.129> more<00:05:12.430> fancy<00:05:12.849> than<00:05:12.879> it
