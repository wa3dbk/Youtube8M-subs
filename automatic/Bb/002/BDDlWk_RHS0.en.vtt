00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 hi friends today we will make a mini pump 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.200
 of homemade water 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.530
 ah 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.920
 to build it we will use the 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:25.240
 following materials a source of 12 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:28.779
 volts a silicone cream container 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.480
 hot a container lid we make a 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.080
 hole in the center and another on the edge 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.080
 from the top 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.500
 a 12 volt motor 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.620
 one glue pulley instantly three 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.080
 small square plates we cut it 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.100
 of the plastic containers and two 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.380
 thin hoses let's start the hole 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.170
 from the center of the lid has to have the 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.390
 same measurement of the motor shaft not so 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.079
 loose or too tight 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.930
 we make three cuts on the pulley 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.409
 we heat a knife and cut only 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.409
 a little 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.020
 and then we introduce the sheets of 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.710
 plastic in the cuts to keep them 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.520
 together we will use the glue we make 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.520
 two more cuts 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.909
 and we started to join the sheets to the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.909
 pulley 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.920
 we introduce it inside the lid 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.420
 the sheets do not have to edge 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 from the top 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.950
 we cut a little the ends of each 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.950
 blade just a little 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.989
 we join the lid with the motor 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.989
 we throw silicone to join 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.910
 we put the pulley and the blades 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.330
 we put one of the hoses in the 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.330
 hole of the lid edge 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.060
 and we sealed it 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.160
 we open the container 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.670
 and we remove all the edge 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.630
 ah 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.630
 we make a hole in the center 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.970
 we help each other with a punch or any 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.340
 another thing 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.970
 we will make the hole with the same measure 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.970
 from the hose 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.759
 and we sealed it 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.110
 we unite the two covers in such a way 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.930
 and we sealed it 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.220
 it was called closing everything small 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.220
 hole that can be seen 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.940
 this part we will put it to some well of 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.590
 water and for this other the water will come out 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.260
 Pressure 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.740
 I put it in a glass to serve me 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.740
 of well 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.620
 we connect the 12 volts 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.430
 and we pour water into the well 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.539
 do not 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.539
 and how they see our mini water pump 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.539
 works 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.990
 good friends if they liked and served them the
