of course Brady's been been there for

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.760 
of course Brady's been been there for
Adam<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.340> push<00:00:35.520> him<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:36.120> training<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:36.770> Brady's

a<00:00:37.800> great<00:00:38.520> paddler<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:38.940> his<00:00:39.059> own<00:00:39.210> right<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.629> k1

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
a great paddler in his own right in k1

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.479 
a great paddler in his own right in k1
he<00:00:40.110> did<00:00:40.230> very<00:00:40.379> well<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.770> our<00:00:40.860> selection<00:00:41.309> trials

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
he did very well at our selection trials

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.389 
he did very well at our selection trials
and<00:00:41.940> coming<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.690> second<00:00:43.620> Adam<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.160> course

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
and coming in second Adam and of course

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.250 
and coming in second Adam and of course
that<00:00:44.610> makes<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:45.000> great<00:00:45.090> k2<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> risk<00:00:46.170> of

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
that makes for great k2 but the risk of

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.290 
that makes for great k2 but the risk of
immediate<00:00:46.579> Adams<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.760> front<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.149> bait

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
immediate Adams in the front of the bait

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
immediate Adams in the front of the bait
and<00:00:48.600> he's<00:00:48.780> been<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> very<00:00:49.110> slow<00:00:49.260> slow<00:00:49.950> slow

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and he's been a very slow slow slow

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.860 
and he's been a very slow slow slow
stroke<00:00:50.670> back<00:00:50.789> normally<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.629> challenge

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
stroke back normally is that a challenge

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.569 
stroke back normally is that a challenge
order<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.379> square<00:00:52.590> d<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.949> adapt<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.460> as

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
order to square d have to adapt to it as

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.959 
order to square d have to adapt to it as
Adam<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> speed<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.320> well<00:00:55.489> no<00:00:56.489> good<00:00:56.670> point

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
Adam have to speed up well no good point

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.660 
Adam have to speed up well no good point
I<00:00:57.149> think<00:00:57.600> largely<00:00:57.960> brady<00:00:58.320> has<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.010> adapt<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
I think largely brady has to adapt and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.049 
I think largely brady has to adapt and
the<00:00:59.760> key<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.480> Brady's<00:01:01.670> getting<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> same

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the key is that Brady's getting the same

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.270 
the key is that Brady's getting the same
impulse<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> paddle<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:04.500> Adam<00:01:04.979> would<00:01:05.129> be

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
impulse on the paddle as Adam would be

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.660 
impulse on the paddle as Adam would be
so<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.210> point<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.810> he<00:01:06.990> can't<00:01:07.520> cut<00:01:08.520> off<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
so the point is he can't cut off a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.370 
so the point is he can't cut off a
stroke<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.240> anything<00:01:09.420> he<00:01:09.750> has<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.020> make<00:01:10.170> sure

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
stroke or anything he has to make sure

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.929 
stroke or anything he has to make sure
that<00:01:10.650> he's<00:01:10.860> getting<00:01:11.040> every<00:01:11.549> ounce<00:01:11.700> of

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
that he's getting every ounce of

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.190 
that he's getting every ounce of
pressure<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> blade<00:01:12.689> throughout<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
pressure on the blade throughout the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.580 
pressure on the blade throughout the
same<00:01:13.470> stroke<00:01:14.400> distance<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.060> Adam<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.590> teams

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
same stroke distance that Adam is teams

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.039 
same stroke distance that Adam is teams

long time moved there for 29 I call for

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.010 
long time moved there for 29 I call for
32<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.119> reporting<00:01:54.390> use<00:01:54.509> Beckett's<00:01:54.869> tan

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
32 is that reporting use Beckett's tan

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.480 
32 is that reporting use Beckett's tan
but<00:01:55.229> they<00:01:55.290> they'll<00:01:55.860> probably<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.250> putting

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
but they they'll probably be putting

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.420 
but they they'll probably be putting
some<00:01:56.640> good<00:01:56.820> stuff<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.119> there<00:01:58.100> well<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.310> sure

well we almost have two races going on

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.290 
well we almost have two races going on
here<00:03:34.690> there's<00:03:35.370> those<00:03:36.370> three<00:03:36.640> crews<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.209> the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
front there that are leading and then

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.290 
front there that are leading and then
the<00:03:38.709> rest<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.099> pack<00:03:39.310> is<00:03:39.550> bunched<00:03:39.879> up<00:03:40.030> there

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
the rest of the pack is bunched up there

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.199 
the rest of the pack is bunched up there
so<00:03:40.680> third<00:03:41.680> fourth<00:03:42.069> fifth<00:03:42.160> six<00:03:42.670> is<00:03:42.879> going<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.120> be

didn't<00:05:00.170> talk<00:05:00.290> much<00:05:00.440> about<00:05:00.620> that<00:05:00.740> but<00:05:00.950> I'd<00:05:01.040> say

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
didn't talk much about that but I'd say

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.530 
didn't talk much about that but I'd say
there<00:05:01.340> that<00:05:01.370> they<00:05:01.580> wanted<00:05:01.790> a<00:05:01.880> pedigree<00:05:02.300> team

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
there that they wanted a pedigree team

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.350 
there that they wanted a pedigree team
so<00:05:02.870> they<00:05:02.990> are<00:05:03.670> pretty<00:05:04.670> good<00:05:04.880> performance<00:05:05.330> that

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
so they are pretty good performance that

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.840 
so they are pretty good performance that
absolutely<00:05:06.260> you<00:05:06.530> know<00:05:06.860> as<00:05:07.340> we<00:05:07.490> said<00:05:07.670> though

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
absolutely you know as we said though

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.530 
absolutely you know as we said though
early<00:05:08.120> on<00:05:08.270> there<00:05:08.540> sometimes<00:05:10.240> crews<00:05:11.240> like<00:05:11.420> the

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
early on there sometimes crews like the

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.090 
early on there sometimes crews like the
Russians<00:05:11.870> with<00:05:11.990> all<00:05:12.140> their<00:05:12.290> experience<00:05:12.800> and

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
Russians with all their experience and

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.130 
Russians with all their experience and
maybe<00:05:13.880> just<00:05:14.150> take<00:05:14.330> a<00:05:14.360> little<00:05:14.540> time<00:05:14.780> through

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
maybe just take a little time through

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.690 
maybe just take a little time through
the<00:05:15.230> heats<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.590> make<00:05:15.710> sure<00:05:15.860> they<00:05:16.010> qualify<00:05:16.490> and

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
the heats to make sure they qualify and

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.040 
the heats to make sure they qualify and
then<00:05:16.730> they<00:05:16.910> put<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.180> big<00:05:17.660> race<00:05:17.840> together

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
then they put the big race together

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.770 
then they put the big race together
where<00:05:18.590> matters<00:05:19.190> most<00:05:19.460> in<00:05:19.730> the<00:05:19.880> final<00:05:20.240> my

continue<00:05:55.340> throughout<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:55.640> weekend<00:05:56.000> I<00:05:56.180> don't

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
continue throughout the weekend I don't

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.140 
continue throughout the weekend I don't
know<00:05:57.080> I<00:05:57.350> think<00:05:57.800> I<00:05:57.860> got<00:05:58.010> lucky<00:05:58.130> but<00:05:58.520> I<00:05:58.790> think<00:05:59.090> the

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
know I think I got lucky but I think the

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.300 
know I think I got lucky but I think the
point<00:05:59.420> is<00:05:59.540> that<00:05:59.840> those<00:06:00.320> crews<00:06:00.710> that<00:06:00.950> we<00:06:01.070> saw

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
point is that those crews that we saw

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.480 
point is that those crews that we saw
that<00:06:01.550> had<00:06:02.410> just<00:06:03.410> didn't<00:06:03.680> have<00:06:03.800> the<00:06:03.950> lead<00:06:04.190> but

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
that had just didn't have the lead but

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.040 
that had just didn't have the lead but
they<00:06:04.610> also<00:06:04.760> looked<00:06:05.120> very<00:06:05.240> comfortable<00:06:05.870> the

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
they also looked very comfortable the

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.630 
they also looked very comfortable the
rates<00:06:06.290> were<00:06:06.440> under<00:06:06.650> control<00:06:06.830> and<00:06:07.340> they<00:06:07.400> looked

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
rates were under control and they looked

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.820 
rates were under control and they looked
strong<00:06:07.910> I<00:06:08.150> did<00:06:08.360> I<00:06:08.510> think<00:06:08.570> it<00:06:09.080> was<00:06:09.170> more<00:06:09.410> like<00:06:09.650> I

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
strong I did I think it was more like I

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.650 
strong I did I think it was more like I
felt<00:06:10.160> they<00:06:10.280> wouldn't<00:06:10.580> die<00:06:10.700> so<00:06:11.000> much<00:06:11.180> as<00:06:11.360> a<00:06:11.390> crew

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
felt they wouldn't die so much as a crew

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.740 
felt they wouldn't die so much as a crew
that<00:06:11.810> was<00:06:11.930> really<00:06:12.200> struggling<00:06:12.470> to<00:06:12.650> hang<00:06:12.830> on

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
that was really struggling to hang on

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.170 
that was really struggling to hang on
and<00:06:14.750> how<00:06:15.020> much
