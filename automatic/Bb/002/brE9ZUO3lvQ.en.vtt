because<00:02:02.169> let's<00:02:02.380> face<00:02:02.469> it<00:02:02.619> it's<00:02:02.950> been<00:02:03.189> several

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
because let's face it it's been several

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.129 
because let's face it it's been several
years<00:02:03.609> since<00:02:03.849> the<00:02:04.060> new<00:02:04.149> 52<00:02:04.389> started<00:02:04.869> so<00:02:05.020> it's

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:05.139 
years since the new 52 started so it's

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:06.659 
years since the new 52 started so it's
not<00:02:05.289> really<00:02:05.529> new<00:02:05.679> anymore<00:02:05.889> plus<00:02:06.310> they<00:02:06.489> don't

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:06.669 
not really new anymore plus they don't

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:08.249 
not really new anymore plus they don't
have<00:02:06.759> 52<00:02:07.060> titles<00:02:07.419> anymore<00:02:07.719> so<00:02:07.899> there's<00:02:08.110> that

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
have 52 titles anymore so there's that

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.779 
have 52 titles anymore so there's that
at<00:02:08.800> least<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.039> don't<00:02:09.130> think<00:02:09.340> they<00:02:09.429> do<00:02:09.550> since

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
at least I don't think they do since

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:10.859 
at least I don't think they do since
they're<00:02:09.910> always<00:02:10.030> changing<00:02:10.270> their<00:02:10.569> lineups

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
they're always changing their lineups

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.600 
they're always changing their lineups
and<00:02:10.959> titles<00:02:11.230> they<00:02:11.500> could<00:02:11.709> but<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.370> don't<00:02:12.430> think

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
and titles they could but I don't think

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.460 
and titles they could but I don't think
they<00:02:12.700> do<00:02:12.760> again<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.420> main<00:02:13.599> earth<00:02:13.810> will<00:02:14.110> still

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
they do again the main earth will still

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.370 
they do again the main earth will still
be<00:02:14.740> earth<00:02:14.980> prime<00:02:15.460> /<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.120> new<00:02:16.300> 52<00:02:16.660> renditions

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
be earth prime / the new 52 renditions

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.780 
be earth prime / the new 52 renditions
even<00:02:17.710> though<00:02:17.860> they<00:02:18.040> seem<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.400> be<00:02:18.490> going
