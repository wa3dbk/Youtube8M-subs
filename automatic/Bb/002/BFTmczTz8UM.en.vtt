00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
feel the retwist parts it's usually more

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.520 
feel the retwist parts it's usually more
squishy<00:02:20.389> it<00:02:21.389> usually<00:02:21.930> feels<00:02:22.049> like<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.319> when

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
squishy it usually feels like this when

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.170 
squishy it usually feels like this when
I<00:02:22.560> feel<00:02:22.859> my<00:02:22.980> interlocked<00:02:23.489> price<00:02:23.819> is<00:02:24.060> usually

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
I feel my interlocked price is usually

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.690 
I feel my interlocked price is usually
like<00:02:26.359> like<00:02:27.359> it's<00:02:27.540> like<00:02:27.959> it's<00:02:28.139> stiffer<00:02:29.069> I<00:02:29.219> don't

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
like like it's like it's stiffer I don't

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.009 
like like it's like it's stiffer I don't
know<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:29.879> I<00:02:29.909> mean<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.120> right<00:02:30.239> word<00:02:30.389> is<00:02:30.569> stiffer

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
know if I mean the right word is stiffer

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.000 
know if I mean the right word is stiffer
and<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:32.219> um<00:02:32.689> when<00:02:33.689> you<00:02:33.780> we<00:02:33.930> twist<00:02:34.200> your<00:02:34.379> here

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
and so um when you we twist your here

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.709 
and so um when you we twist your here
you<00:02:35.969> give<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.359> a<00:02:36.389> hair<00:02:36.719> space<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.680> open<00:02:38.719> up

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
you give you a hair space to open up

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.080 
you give you a hair space to open up
again<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.590> don't<00:02:40.950> know<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.310> twist<00:02:41.639> your<00:02:41.819> hair

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
again I don't know you twist your hair

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.929 
again I don't know you twist your hair
it<00:02:42.299> just<00:02:42.329> opens<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:44.129> when<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.459> when<00:02:44.760> it's

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
it just opens and so when you when it's

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.119 
it just opens and so when you when it's
able<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.299> open<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:46.019> feels<00:02:46.530> as<00:02:46.680> if<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:46.919> thicker

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
able to open it feels as if it's thicker

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.809 
able to open it feels as if it's thicker
so<00:02:47.669> the<00:02:48.090> palm<00:02:48.299> trying<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.569> make<00:02:48.689> is<00:02:49.819> interlaken

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
so the palm trying to make is interlaken

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.300 
so the palm trying to make is interlaken
is<00:02:51.030> good<00:02:51.569> because<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.260> keeps<00:02:52.439> you<00:02:52.680> here<00:02:53.099> in

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
you continue interlock here only

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.789 
you continue interlock here only
you're<00:03:03.449> here<00:03:03.719> what<00:03:03.930> could<00:03:04.049> just<00:03:04.560> feel

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
you're here what could just feel

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.149 
you're here what could just feel
condensed<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.699> the<00:03:06.689> lights<00:03:06.900> will<00:03:07.199> feel<00:03:07.680> um

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
condensed and the lights will feel um

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.990 
condensed and the lights will feel um
firm<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.900> will<00:03:10.680> gets<00:03:10.919> some<00:03:11.639> reason<00:03:11.909> it

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
firm and it will gets some reason it

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.089 
firm and it will gets some reason it
gets<00:03:12.030> smaller<00:03:14.120> like<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.239> gets<00:03:15.650> more<00:03:16.650> condensed

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
gets smaller like it gets more condensed

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.420 
gets smaller like it gets more condensed
which<00:03:17.669> makes<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.209> feel<00:03:18.239> thick<00:03:18.689> like<00:03:19.019> thinner

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
which makes it feel thick like thinner

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.999 
which makes it feel thick like thinner
it's<00:03:20.430> hard<00:03:20.639> to<00:03:20.759> explain<00:03:21.060> but<00:03:22.049> um<00:03:22.109> let<00:03:22.889> me<00:03:22.919> know
