 also star kitchen for the home 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.600
 Unless it's extremely simple that's exactly what 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.369
 is the point 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.990

 steinmann and also the honest one with you 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.539
 that is what a simple kitchen really means 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.670
 expensive ingredients not necessarily or not 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.840
 absolutely good the totality of the muslim 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.360
 it does not have to be 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.830
 be absolutely organic what i totally 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.619
 interesting is very important 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.649
 seasonal cuisine or seasonal ingredients 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.660
 and regional to all things so it 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.039
 then give the strawberries when strawberry time 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.450
 is and everything else and that too 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.399
 is also what you are with you in the 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.959
 cook courses mediates or offers because 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.879
 The people want that too 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:03.970
 but also so easy and so 

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:06.489
 uncomplicated as possible we have that 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:12.000
 even more minerals more salt is easy 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:14.709
 just when coarser is a bit and 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.769
 there is an incredible amount of money spent 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.019
 salt but often I do not think so 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.390
 rightly so just because for 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:27.690
 me at least only the sea ​​salt so 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:30.040
 they were right thrones are 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.459
 ask lemon juice but always directly 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.030
 enter 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.030
 but okay 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.880
 The grill pan is a great thing 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.110
 we had only very briefly seared that 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.580
 a bit of color gets the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.690
 worst is for me at least if 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.790
 I'm on vacation somewhere like doing 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:52.530
 order and this thing is in harmless 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:54.480
 by birth and dust- dry parsley 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.170
 ago maybe a few chilis of length 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.680
 cut in half 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:07.620
 and then I get there where you can 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.960
 clearing out will give with in the pan 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.490
 or so I 've got everything ready for you here 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.890
 cut you are allowed to serve then 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:22.250
 what is needed there we can do everything now 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:26.840
 so enter garlic and chili 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:31.050
 patil now it will be a bit 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.280
 a google we lie again afterwards 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.280
 neat oil to 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.180
 and now you have only salt on the tuna 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.070
 then just one and the only has to 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.070
 also garlic a light roast 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:55.430
 get aggressive way and now 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.430
 tidy 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:07.050
 that's okay I'm a completely approved 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.790
 yes and now we go right again 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:24.430
 nice olive oil you have to here 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:26.590
 very carefully that is good but that is 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.030
 yes I mean whenever I buy because 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.260
 yes not such a good bottle for 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.390
 I might then give one to others 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:05:10.060
 but others are still taking it 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:05:12.280
 bit of crisis or the quick recipe 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.650
 in the turbogang the first sound for 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.450

 then refine can be done 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.720
 a little baguette bread is quite sufficient 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.300
 side of the tuna with the spicy 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.580
 vinaigrette is a complex one in itself 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.819
