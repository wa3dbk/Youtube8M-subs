kind<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.080> ski<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.350> was<00:00:16.619> called<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.890> carbon

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
kind of a ski that was called the carbon

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.310 
kind of a ski that was called the carbon
last<00:00:17.460> year<00:00:17.640> but<00:00:17.880> has<00:00:17.970> made<00:00:18.300> some<00:00:18.840> numerous

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
last year but has made some numerous

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.779 
last year but has made some numerous
updates<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.890> model<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.310> year<00:00:20.520> yes

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
updates this model this year yes

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.670 
updates this model this year yes
absolutely<00:00:21.050> absolutely<00:00:22.050> still<00:00:22.230> has<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> full

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
absolutely absolutely still has a full

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.710 
absolutely absolutely still has a full
wood<00:00:22.890> core<00:00:23.060> still<00:00:24.060> has<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> lot<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> same

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
wood core still has a lot of the same

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.259 
wood core still has a lot of the same
shape<00:00:25.109> type<00:00:25.859> features<00:00:26.039> but<00:00:26.369> we've<00:00:26.939> added<00:00:27.090> a

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
shape type features but we've added a

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.359 
shape type features but we've added a
basalt<00:00:27.570> airman<00:00:27.960> lad<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.220> we've

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
basalt airman lad to it so what we've

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.640 
basalt airman lad to it so what we've
done<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.580> you've<00:00:30.210> got<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:31.019> basalt<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
done is you've got the basalt in the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.139 
done is you've got the basalt in the
airmen<00:00:31.949> kind<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.309> combined<00:00:32.610> together<00:00:32.790> are

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
airmen kind of combined together are

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.400 
airmen kind of combined together are
going<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> are<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> really<00:00:33.960> quiet<00:00:34.260> this

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
going to are going to really quiet this

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.780 
going to are going to really quiet this
ski<00:00:34.590> down<00:00:34.770> they're<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.280> take<00:00:35.370> out<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> lot

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
ski down they're going to take out a lot

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.150 
ski down they're going to take out a lot
of<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.750> vibrations<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.469> give<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.770> better<00:00:37.950> on

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
of the vibrations and give you better on

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.400 
of the vibrations and give you better on
snow<00:00:38.460> contact<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.570> still<00:00:39.780> gives<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.079> ski<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> lot

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
snow contact it still gives a ski a lot

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.110 
snow contact it still gives a ski a lot
of<00:00:40.530> energy<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.890> lot<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.219> life<00:00:41.370> yeah<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.910> notice

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
of energy a lot of life yeah we notice

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.819 
of energy a lot of life yeah we notice
that<00:00:42.180> we're<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.540> testing<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> skis<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.710> know

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that we're up testing the skis you know

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.310 
that we're up testing the skis you know
last<00:00:44.129> spring<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.510> squeeze<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
last spring that this is squeeze the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.889 
last spring that this is squeeze the
skis<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.680> share<00:00:46.860> much<00:00:47.219> quieter<00:00:48.059> much<00:00:48.329> smoother

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
skis to share much quieter much smoother

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.990 
skis to share much quieter much smoother
it<00:00:49.410> seemed<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.829> lot<00:00:50.039> more<00:00:50.070> contact<00:00:50.879> with

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
it seemed to be a lot more contact with

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.330 
it seemed to be a lot more contact with
the<00:00:51.090> snow<00:00:51.329> because<00:00:51.539> I'm<00:00:52.350> guessing<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> large

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the snow because I'm guessing a large

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.729 
the snow because I'm guessing a large
part<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.329> pissant<00:00:54.750> core<00:00:55.020> absolutely

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
part to the that pissant core absolutely

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.740 
part to the that pissant core absolutely
so<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.399> we've<00:00:56.520> also<00:00:56.640> got<00:00:56.969> some<00:00:57.270> unique

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
so and then we've also got some unique

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.420 
so and then we've also got some unique
features<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> oversized<00:00:58.829> side<00:00:59.070> cut<00:00:59.309> on

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
features like the oversized side cut on

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.819 
features like the oversized side cut on
this<00:00:59.579> ski<00:01:00.059> yep<00:01:00.449> yep<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:01.500> we're<00:01:01.649> doing

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
this ski yep yep and so what we're doing

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.439 
this ski yep yep and so what we're doing
with<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> oversized<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.640> essentially<00:01:03.420> what

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
with the oversized is essentially what

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.399 
with the oversized is essentially what
we're<00:01:03.629> doing<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.899> we're<00:01:04.019> putting<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.229> very

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
we're doing is we're putting a very

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.280 
we're doing is we're putting a very
oversized<00:01:05.220> tip<00:01:05.489> profile<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.390> tail<00:01:06.810> profile

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
oversized tip profile and tail profile

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.440 
oversized tip profile and tail profile
on<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.650> which<00:01:08.310> will<00:01:08.490> help<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.790> ski<00:01:09.030> really

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
on that which will help the ski really

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.149 
on that which will help the ski really
kind<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.840> get<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.470> term<00:01:10.680> super

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
kind of get in and out of the term super

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.880 
kind of get in and out of the term super
quick<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.299> also<00:01:12.450> widen<00:01:13.020> up<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.350> mid<00:01:13.710> body

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
quick but we also widen up the mid body

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.740 
quick but we also widen up the mid body
of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> ski<00:01:14.430> which<00:01:14.880> gives<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.210> little<00:01:15.360> bit<00:01:15.450> more

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
of the ski which gives a little bit more

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.960 
of the ski which gives a little bit more
of<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.930> stable<00:01:16.259> platform<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:17.040> aids<00:01:17.340> into<00:01:17.790> that

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
of a stable platform and aids into that

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.910 
of a stable platform and aids into that
that<00:01:18.390> ease<00:01:18.600> into<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> term<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.380> really<00:01:19.680> quick

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that ease into the term so really quick

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.100 
that ease into the term so really quick
easy<00:01:20.189> turn<00:01:20.580> initiation<00:01:20.630> yep<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.930> feel

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
turn on this yep yep so on that well the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.560 
turn on this yep yep so on that well the
power<00:01:29.369> turn<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:29.850> going<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.270> referring

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
power turn that's going to be referring

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.600 
power turn that's going to be referring
to<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> kind<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.110> camera<00:01:31.470> okay<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:32.159> lot<00:01:32.579> of

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
to the kind of the camera okay a lot of

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.219 
to the kind of the camera okay a lot of
rocker<00:01:32.850> stuff<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.570> there<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
rocker stuff going on there but the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.899 
rocker stuff going on there but the
power<00:01:34.439> turn<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.890> essentially<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:35.640> hundred
