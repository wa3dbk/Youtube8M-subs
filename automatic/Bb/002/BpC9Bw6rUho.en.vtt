00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.969 
of the other tablets I've reviewed
recently<00:01:09.180> although<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.960> tablet<00:01:10.320> comes<00:01:10.650> with

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
recently although the tablet comes with

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.190 
recently although the tablet comes with
32<00:01:11.400> gigabytes<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.939> storage<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.540> an<00:01:12.869> SD<00:01:13.170> card

slot to expand it the system only
recognizes<00:01:16.320> 22<00:01:17.280> gigabytes

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
recognizes 22 gigabytes

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.880 
recognizes 22 gigabytes
out<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.210> box<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.689> only<00:01:18.960> 11<00:01:19.470> gigabytes

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
out of the box and only 11 gigabytes

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.039 
out of the box and only 11 gigabytes
that<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.280> actually<00:01:20.610> usable<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.570> reason<00:01:21.960> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
that is actually usable the reason is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.289 
that is actually usable the reason is
because<00:01:22.409> about<00:01:22.740> 10<00:01:23.250> gigabytes<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.210> is

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
because about 10 gigabytes of it is

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.570 
because about 10 gigabytes of it is
hidden<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.900> recovery<00:01:25.380> partition<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.369> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
hidden in a recovery partition but you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.850 
hidden in a recovery partition but you
can<00:01:26.909> remove<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> full<00:01:28.650> capacity

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
can remove this to get the full capacity

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.730 
can remove this to get the full capacity
of<00:01:29.310> 32<00:01:29.670> gigabytes<00:01:30.210> back<00:01:30.500> alternatively<00:01:31.500> you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
of 32 gigabytes back alternatively you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.340 
of 32 gigabytes back alternatively you
could<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.280> buy<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> micro<00:01:32.939> SD<00:01:33.270> card<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
could just buy a micro SD card the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
could just buy a micro SD card the
device<00:01:34.590> comes<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.159> HDMI<00:01:35.970> output<00:01:36.509> which<00:01:36.689> is
