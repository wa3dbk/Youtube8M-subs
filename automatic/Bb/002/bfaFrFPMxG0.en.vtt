00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
of steps with this part now I've sped up

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.630 
of steps with this part now I've sped up
this<00:01:45.380> copy<00:01:45.590> process<00:01:46.040> because<00:01:46.280> I'm<00:01:46.340> sure<00:01:46.549> you

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
this copy process because I'm sure you

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.200 
this copy process because I'm sure you
guys<00:01:46.820> don't<00:01:47.030> want<00:01:47.119> to<00:01:47.270> watch<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:48.460> 4<00:01:49.460> gigs<00:01:50.000> and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
guys don't want to watch the 4 gigs and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.120 
guys don't want to watch the 4 gigs and
change<00:01:50.510> where<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.869> files<00:01:51.110> come<00:01:51.560> across<00:01:51.860> so

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
change where the files come across so

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.460 
change where the files come across so
obviously<00:01:52.460> it's<00:01:52.610> not<00:01:52.760> read<00:01:53.000> as<00:01:53.150> fast<00:01:53.439> now<00:01:54.439> I

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
obviously it's not read as fast now I

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.380 
obviously it's not read as fast now I
mentioned<00:01:54.890> this<00:01:54.950> can<00:01:55.130> work<00:01:55.220> with<00:01:55.400> any<00:01:55.610> modern
