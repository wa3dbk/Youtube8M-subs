00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.410
 hi guys how are you welcome to 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.599
 point 5 x 1 today as it says in the title 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.509
 let's comment 10 things you knew 

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:12.160
 of the ipod if generally one of those 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.389
 products that we love the most and what else 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.620
 honey, we keep everything 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.070
 it meant the story of apulco 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.070
 we start 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.960
 the first iPad was released on 23 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.300
 October 2001 its cost was 399 dollars 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.540
 and it had a disk space of 5 gigs and 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.340
 his available color was white 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.260
 steve jobs when he presented the ipad what 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.210
 presented as the only mp3 player 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.949
 of the market and that was false but yes 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.559
 It is true that it differed from the 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.800
 competition on three key points the ipad 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.750
 it was an idea idea was an original idea 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.980
 from tony fadel you will surely have 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.080
 heard about this man because 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.339
 as I say it had a lot of weight is what today 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.980
 we know as an ipod the itouch 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.110
 etcetera more than anything because this idea 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.969
 in the originated and created it in his head 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.280
 before going into trouble was when 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.590
 showed this to those responsible when 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.360
 They hired him and after all 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.430
 has a place to this product so 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.050
 true that Tony Fadel worked in the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.030
 development from the time to the second 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.619
 generation since the third was the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.780
 jonathan team there are who 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.250
 worked until what we know today as 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.900
 The importance 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.790
 the ipod is a music player 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.250
 maybe for the curious you want to know 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.330
 what was the first song that rang in 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:32.170
 an ipod and it was neither more nor less than robbie 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.180
 hit the soft ellis bextor this happened 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.430
 also in the series of journalists of the 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.900
 ipod when good when they let you try 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.670
 the teams after hurting the 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.000
 journalists in the outer saga 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.280
 event and well it is said that still by 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.510
 keep those devices so so 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.690
 characteristic that so much history 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.860
 will have many years to come 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.720
 to capture the original idea of ​​what 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.390
 did an ipod steve jobs gave each 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.250
 10 venues music journalist iPhone 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.899
 and a copy of itunes so that it 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.090
 they really knew the experience of 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.009
 be able to move from an mp3 to an ipad and carry 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.100
 the hundreds of songs that fit in 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.229
 that apple device took a year in 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.640
 be able to support users of 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.650
 windows that would like to buy an ipod 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.690
 really also novation through a 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.000
 program that was called music match e 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.680
 it even created the fact of power 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.800
 market an ipod that was called 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.540
 ipod by windows is totally 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.690
 difference and both the software level 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.740
 as well as audio quality 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.510
 in 2003 the popularity of the voice was 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.180
 uncontrollable to the point that a 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.610
 octopuses devised how to make a 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.200
 fast legal way and even easier the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.250
 made to get music that was the 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.370
 creation of itunes 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.990
 In addition, many experts say it was 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.500
 the third generation epoch that 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.380
 marked as a second air in the 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.910
 music industry and the introduction of 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.830
 iphone to the tactile world was 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.420
 precisely thanks to lay people this 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.550
 device had a wheel that 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.200
 rotated and that allowed us to navigate between 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.760
 the different menus yes that's true 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.410
 that it was a wheel that I had as a 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.600
 mechanical movement is to say that it rotated 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.520
 as if it were a flyer but then 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.780
 because with the passage of time the evolution 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.540
 in what we know now as 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.210
 touch with so that the iphone will reach 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.860
 Europe to point had to abide by a 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.350
 European regulation that obliged him to 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.810
 limit the volume level of your 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.300
 devices the iphone update 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.040
 arrived until 2009 with what we know 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.750
 like the second classic ipod 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.050
 generation that has a capacity neither 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.340
 more or less than 160 gb of storage 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.980
 until that date it was sold 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.650
 more than 220 million units winning 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.100
 74 percent of the world market for 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.350
 the players almost nothing 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.870
 in short guys here this video of 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.940
 curiosities about apple and about the ipod 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.410
 concretely hope that I have 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.120
