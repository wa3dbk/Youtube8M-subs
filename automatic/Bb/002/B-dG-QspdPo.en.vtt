the<00:00:01.350> problem<00:00:01.860> is<00:00:02.040> that<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.460> rhinoceros

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
the problem is that the rhinoceros

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.120 
the problem is that the rhinoceros
beetle<00:00:03.540> targets<00:00:03.990> coconut<00:00:04.500> treats<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:05.040> if

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
beetle targets coconut treats and if

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.070 
beetle targets coconut treats and if
they<00:00:05.250> continue<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.879> reproduce<00:00:06.150> there<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.049> a
