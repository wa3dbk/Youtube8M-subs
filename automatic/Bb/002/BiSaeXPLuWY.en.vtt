could say in the game because trading

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.550 
could say in the game because trading
and<00:01:53.460> playing<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.909> pretty<00:01:54.780> different<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.320> trade

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and playing is pretty different on trade

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
sandwich spike wrap around I mean it's a

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.270 
sandwich spike wrap around I mean it's a
completely<00:02:03.360> different<00:02:03.659> game<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.649> still<00:02:04.979> it's

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
completely different game but still it's

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.570 
completely different game but still it's
the<00:02:05.460> same<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.990> think<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.710> together<00:02:08.009> with

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the same and I think that together with

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.790 
the same and I think that together with
the<00:02:08.849> frequent<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.840> frequent<00:02:10.319> updates<00:02:10.440> that

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
keeping it alive it's kind of like

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.520 
keeping it alive it's kind of like

295 what is it 1998 I think I could be
wrong<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:31.389> if<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.990> let's<00:04:32.500> say<00:04:32.680> just<00:04:32.710> that's

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
wrong but if it let's say just that's

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.029 
wrong but if it let's say just that's
the<00:04:33.220> case<00:04:33.370> that's<00:04:33.520> 16<00:04:34.150> years<00:04:34.539> and<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:35.530> mod<00:04:35.800> is

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
the case that's 16 years and the mod is

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.710 
the case that's 16 years and the mod is
still<00:04:36.310> being<00:04:36.520> updated<00:04:36.880> there's<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.419> mod

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
still being updated there's a mod

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.900 
still being updated there's a mod
forward<00:04:38.139> that<00:04:38.620> alters<00:04:39.099> the<00:04:39.310> game<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.580> little

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
forward that alters the game a little

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.850
