00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.010
 tha 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.020
 hello my name is annie casamayou and 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.820
 I am a naturopath 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.789
 today I explain to you how 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.280
 have very very shiny hair 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.680
 dream all one dreams all one to have some 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.930
 very shiny hair that will capture the 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.300
 light that will have nice reflections 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.940
 to do this it's not very complicated 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.980
 no need to invest in products 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.020
 stylists who would instead rather 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.170
 tendency to weigh down the hair 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.660
 it is often the rinsing that is not key 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.150
 after shampooing or rinsing 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.940
 one of the key gestures of your shampoo 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.100
 you must consensually rinse your 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.530
 hair must at the end of the rinse 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.829
 your hair since staying under the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.230
 fingers 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.140
 and then finally rinsing we will use 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.880
 vinegar, preferably vinegar 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.470
 cider 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.540
 before entering my shower i'm going 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.110
 prepare a container in which I 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.659
 will put a liter of lukewarm water and in 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.079
 this liter of warm water I'm going to pour a 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:11.140
 tablespoon of cider vinegar and 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:13.810
 so at the end of my rinse I'm going 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.479
 use this mixture to pour it on 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.060
 the hair and especially do not rinse 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.390
 then the vinegar will allow to 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.479
 restore the ph of the hair he goes 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.210
 also eliminate all traces of 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.310
 shampoo all the residue and then he has 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.350
 also the advantage of eliminating limestone 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.350
 water or we know very well that our 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.360
 water here is very limestone and it's a 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.250
 big factor of tarnishing 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.070
 hair do not be surprised 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.830
 the mixture without necessarily a little bit 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.510
 vinegar but you will see when your 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.180
 hair will dry the smell is going 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.979
 totally disappear to conserve 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.100
 healthy hair 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.070
 avoid treatments too aggressive the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.409
 brushings too hot the colors the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.200
