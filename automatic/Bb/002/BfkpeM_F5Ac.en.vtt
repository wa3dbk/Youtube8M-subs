 crisis in mali through a process 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.710
 consensual policy I encourage 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.439
 Malian authorities implement the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.439
 roadmap and drive the 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.930

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.409
 at the same time we have to bring back 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.649
 security north of mali in order to 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.340

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.739
 moved to guinea-bissau our 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.170
 The conference welcomes the efforts of 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.000
 transition authorities for 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.670
 improve the socio-political situation 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.010
 in this brother country 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.380
 we encourage guinea-bissau to 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.660
 stay on the path of normalcy 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.280

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.050
 indeed the will of psg is 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.050
 to accept the outstretched hand of the authorities 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.320
 transition and participate in the 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.970
 ongoing process is a very good 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.130
 thing 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.130
 I would like to this winter and in the name of the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.840
 conference hailed convergence of view 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.730
 that the cedeao shares with the MCpl a 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.970
 african united nations and the union 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.340
 European Commission on the management of 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.380

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.150
 press conference that followed the end 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.370
 works president alassane 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.710
 Ouattara emphasized the situation at 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.490
 mali which for him is one of the 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.400
 its priorities the misma unfolds in 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:31.140
 almost every day yesterday I have you 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.320
 indicated that we were 73% you 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.920
 will also remember that initially we 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.310
 had 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.010
 a goal of 3300 that needed 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.670
 add I round the numbers to which 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.250
 it was necessary to add the air of 1250 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.180
 Chadian know is that they gave 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.360
 numbers the 5550 and now we 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.010
 went to 8000 and maybe even 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.890
 that we can go beyond 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.840
 depends on funding opportunities 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.600
 so at today's date the misma 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.489
 is deployed to three quarters 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.890
 that's still a very 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:13.030
 good performance and in the days to 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.610
 come the deployment will therefore make 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.989
 complete way since we said 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.209
 with the countries that had the 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.300
 troop transport difficulties 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.669
 we solved his problems to match 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.280
 of our conference so me deployment 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.770
 to be done normally within a time limit 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.160
 I consider exceptional and us 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.210
 seemed satisfied immediately renewed 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.160
 immediately at work 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.900
 the president alassane ouattara proceeded 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.790
 at the start of work for the 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.710
 building a factory in the frame 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.390
 from the fight against malaria to 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.300
 through the discovery of the plate 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.430
 on these projects a joint project 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.000
 at the cedeao and two countries of america 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.620
 south namely venezuela and cuba after 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.479
 the in who will be implanted in hill 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.700
 of ivory two others will be born 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.169
 respectively in Ghana and Nigeria 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.780
 for the cedeao 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.240
 these are reflected in this partnership 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.860
 the regional willingness to eradicate 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.860
 totally malaria
