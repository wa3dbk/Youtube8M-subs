00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
you hit a button on a widget and it just

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.959 
you hit a button on a widget and it just
takes<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.710> second<00:00:47.070> listens<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.730> what's<00:00:47.910> going

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
takes a second listens to what's going

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.430 
takes a second listens to what's going
on<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.450> environment<00:00:48.690> around<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.200> device

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
on in the environment around the device

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.260 
on in the environment around the device
and<00:00:49.649> figures<00:00:50.280> out<00:00:50.430> what<00:00:50.760> you're<00:00:50.940> supposed<00:00:51.210> to

although<00:01:03.930> we'll<00:01:04.110> get<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.710> little

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
although we'll get to that in a little

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.280 
although we'll get to that in a little
bit<00:01:04.979> however<00:01:05.519> XD<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> member<00:01:06.510> as<00:01:06.659> doofuses

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
bit however XD a member as doofuses

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.350 
bit however XD a member as doofuses
decided<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.369> was<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.850> good<00:01:09.150> enough

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
decided that that was not good enough

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.120 
decided that that was not good enough
for<00:01:09.570> him<00:01:09.750> he<00:01:10.170> figured<00:01:10.470> out<00:01:10.560> how<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> pull<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
for him he figured out how to pull the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.190 
for him he figured out how to pull the
APK<00:01:11.670> off<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.060> jellybean<00:01:12.390> system<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.080> make

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
APK off of a jellybean system and make

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.870 
APK off of a jellybean system and make
it<00:01:13.350> work<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:13.950> about<00:01:14.070> any<00:01:14.369> ice<00:01:14.580> cream

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
it work on just about any ice cream

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.249 
it work on just about any ice cream
sandwich<00:01:15.299> ROM<00:01:15.479> that's<00:01:15.689> out<00:01:15.810> there<00:01:15.990> so

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
sandwich ROM that's out there so

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.450 
sandwich ROM that's out there so
essentially<00:01:16.710> if<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> device<00:01:17.430> that's

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
essentially if you have a device that's

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.039 
essentially if you have a device that's
running<00:01:17.820> ice<00:01:18.000> cream<00:01:18.240> sandwich<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.750> any<00:01:18.900> way

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
running ice cream sandwich in any way

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.690 
running ice cream sandwich in any way
shape<00:01:19.229> or<00:01:19.409> form<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.860> actually<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.310> happen<00:01:20.670> to

shape or form and actually I happen to
have<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.880> droid<00:01:21.090> x<00:01:21.330> that's<00:01:21.509> doing<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.140> so

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
have a droid x that's doing just that so

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.899 
have a droid x that's doing just that so
I<00:01:22.439> may<00:01:22.650> try<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> minute<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.729> grab

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
I may try here in a minute you can grab

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.850 
I may try here in a minute you can grab
the<00:01:24.060> apk<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.780> associated<00:01:25.200> library<00:01:25.650> file

specifically<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.509> verizon<00:01:57.990> version<00:01:58.020> though

it<00:02:02.579> does<00:02:02.790> definitely<00:02:03.030> work<00:02:03.600> however<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.350> I

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
it does definitely work however like I
