it<00:02:06.330> so<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.690> people<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.110> manipulate<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.770> or

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
it so that people can manipulate it or

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.309 
it so that people can manipulate it or
we<00:02:08.099> can<00:02:08.280> change<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.750> why<00:02:09.750> don't<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:09.929> bring<00:02:10.080> back

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
we can change it why don't we bring back

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.050 
we can change it why don't we bring back
Blood<00:02:10.799> Gulch<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.280> carve<00:02:11.549> it<00:02:11.670> all<00:02:11.760> up<00:02:11.909> into

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
Blood Gulch and carve it all up into

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.869 
Blood Gulch and carve it all up into
pieces<00:02:12.299> so<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.810> people<00:02:13.620> can<00:02:13.879> start

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
pieces so that people can start

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.910 
pieces so that people can start
manipulating<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:15.930> interesting<00:02:16.440> ways<00:02:16.620> and

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
manipulating it and interesting ways and

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.209 
manipulating it and interesting ways and
then<00:02:17.640> sanctuary<00:02:18.480> was<00:02:18.659> the<00:02:18.810> other<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:19.219> the

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
then sanctuary was the other one the

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.580 
then sanctuary was the other one the
cage

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
cage

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.250 
cage
paradiso<00:02:22.850> that's<00:02:23.850> just<00:02:24.060> Chad<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.690> playing

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
paradiso that's just Chad and I playing

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.140 
paradiso that's just Chad and I playing
with<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.470> map<00:02:25.709> editor<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.340> actually<00:02:26.730> building

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
with a map editor and actually building

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.870 
with a map editor and actually building
cool<00:02:27.870> maps<00:02:28.230> within<00:02:28.860> forge<00:02:29.160> world<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.640> mean

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
cool maps within forge world I mean

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.850 
cool maps within forge world I mean
you're<00:02:30.030> doing<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.360> exactly<00:02:30.569> how<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.620> fans

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
you're doing that exactly how the fans

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.240 
you're doing that exactly how the fans
would<00:02:32.010> do<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:33.650> we<00:02:34.650> definitely<00:02:34.800> looked<00:02:35.130> at

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
would do that we definitely looked at

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.190 
would do that we definitely looked at
what<00:02:35.400> we<00:02:35.490> did<00:02:35.580> in<00:02:35.700> Halo<00:02:35.880> 3<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.390> said<00:02:36.990> what<00:02:37.170> can

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
what we did in Halo 3 and said what can

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.110 
what we did in Halo 3 and said what can
we<00:02:37.350> learn<00:02:37.470> from<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.890> it's<00:02:38.640> one<00:02:38.880> thing<00:02:39.060> to

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
we learn from this it's one thing to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.420 
we learn from this it's one thing to
build<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:40.050> stunning<00:02:40.830> amount<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.250> Matt

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
build just a stunning amount of Matt

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.240 
build just a stunning amount of Matt
variants<00:02:41.880> but<00:02:42.300> like<00:02:42.870> nobody<00:02:43.470> was<00:02:43.770> expecting

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
variants but like nobody was expecting

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.860 
variants but like nobody was expecting
for<00:02:44.520> George<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.880> don't<00:02:44.910> think<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.600> was

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
for George I don't think like that was

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.580 
for George I don't think like that was
just<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.170> completely<00:02:46.530> whoa<00:02:47.239> what<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.590> Rube

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
just a completely whoa what the Rube

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.110 
just a completely whoa what the Rube
Goldberg<00:02:49.830> machines<00:02:50.400> yeah<00:02:50.700> those<00:02:50.970> are

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
Goldberg machines yeah those are

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.120 
Goldberg machines yeah those are
everywhere<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:54.110> Halo<00:02:55.110> 3<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.620> was<00:02:55.770> cool<00:02:56.100> that

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
everywhere in Halo 3 it was cool that

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.650 
everywhere in Halo 3 it was cool that
you<00:02:56.489> can<00:02:56.580> move<00:02:56.760> things<00:02:56.940> around<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.570> was

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
you can move things around but it was

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.130 
you can move things around but it was
still<00:02:57.900> kind<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.200> clunky<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:59.120> we're<00:03:00.120> like<00:03:00.269> we

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
still kind of clunky and we're like we

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.530 
still kind of clunky and we're like we
have<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.470> make<00:03:01.650> this<00:03:01.800> better<00:03:02.300> what<00:03:03.300> are<00:03:03.390> some

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
have to make this better what are some

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.699 
have to make this better what are some
of<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.660> tricks<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.110> communities<00:03:04.530> using

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
of the tricks of the communities using

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.759 
of the tricks of the communities using
and<00:03:05.040> how<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.600> we<00:03:06.690> make<00:03:06.840> those<00:03:07.080> not<00:03:07.320> be<00:03:07.470> tricks

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
and how can we make those not be tricks

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.000 
and how can we make those not be tricks
and<00:03:08.070> just<00:03:08.220> make<00:03:08.340> those<00:03:08.519> be<00:03:08.640> tools<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:10.290> we<00:03:10.769> took

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
and just make those be tools we we took

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.520 
and just make those be tools we we took
that<00:03:11.280> stuff<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.030> made<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.080> like<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> real

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
that stuff and made it like a real

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.830 
that stuff and made it like a real
feature<00:03:13.769> there's<00:03:14.310> normal<00:03:14.730> phased<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.480> fixed

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
feature there's normal phased and fixed

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.290 
feature there's normal phased and fixed
so<00:03:16.410> normal<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:16.920> like<00:03:17.250> halo<00:03:17.550> 3<00:03:17.730> style<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.239> know

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
so normal is like halo 3 style you know

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.970 
so normal is like halo 3 style you know
it<00:03:18.450> bumps<00:03:18.720> into<00:03:18.780> stuff<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.320> let<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.500> go<00:03:19.620> it

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
it bumps into stuff and you let it go it

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.650 
it bumps into stuff and you let it go it
falls<00:03:20.220> on<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.489> ground<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:21.030> moves<00:03:21.360> around<00:03:21.540> the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
falls on the ground and moves around the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.860 
falls on the ground and moves around the
stuff<00:03:21.890> fixed<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.910> same<00:03:24.120> thing<00:03:24.390> except

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
stuff fixed is the same thing except

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.270 
stuff fixed is the same thing except
when<00:03:25.050> you<00:03:25.140> let<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.350> go<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.769> stays<00:03:26.040> exactly

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
when you let it go it stays exactly

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.270 
when you let it go it stays exactly
where<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.790> was<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.600> then<00:03:28.079> phase<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.950> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
where it was and then phase is the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.729 
where it was and then phase is the
coolest<00:03:29.600> because<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.989> means<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.440> while

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
coolest because it means that while

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:32.930 
coolest because it means that while
you're<00:03:31.890> editing<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.220> object<00:03:32.579> it's<00:03:32.730> not

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
you're editing the object it's not

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.850 
you're editing the object it's not
actually<00:03:33.360> directing<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.780> environment<00:03:34.200> you

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
actually directing the environment you

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.009 
actually directing the environment you
can<00:03:34.890> put<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.400> through<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.820> wall<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.480> can<00:03:36.600> put<00:03:36.900> it

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
can put it through a wall you can put it

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.680 
can put it through a wall you can put it
you<00:03:37.650> know<00:03:37.739> through<00:03:38.010> other<00:03:38.190> objects<00:03:38.690> which

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
you know through other objects which

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.870 
you know through other objects which
changed<00:03:40.530> everything<00:03:41.040> for<00:03:41.070> forage<00:03:41.640> like

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
changed everything for forage like

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.840 
changed everything for forage like
immediately<00:03:42.450> it's<00:03:43.350> much<00:03:43.620> easier<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:44.549> build<00:03:44.700> a

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
immediately it's much easier to build a

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.330 
immediately it's much easier to build a
force<00:03:45.060> space<00:03:45.299> there's<00:03:45.959> snaps<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.890> rotates

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
force space there's snaps and rotates

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.150 
force space there's snaps and rotates
and<00:03:47.640> degrees<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.900> units<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:49.980> can

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
and degrees and and units that you can

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.630 
and degrees and and units that you can
move<00:03:50.310> things<00:03:50.519> you<00:03:50.700> can<00:03:50.820> be<00:03:50.910> very<00:03:51.120> precise<00:03:52.640> the

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
move things you can be very precise the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.490 
move things you can be very precise the
camera<00:03:53.880> controls<00:03:54.239> it's<00:03:55.019> actually<00:03:55.380> really

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
camera controls it's actually really

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.140 
camera controls it's actually really
good<00:03:55.769> for<00:03:55.920> object<00:03:56.310> placement<00:03:56.519> because<00:03:56.820> like

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
good for object placement because like

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.789 
good for object placement because like
