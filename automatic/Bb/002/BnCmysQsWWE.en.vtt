00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
websites are all of them it I think it's

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.760 
websites are all of them it I think it's
over<00:02:25.710> $400<00:02:26.730> however<00:02:27.780> it's<00:02:28.780> worth<00:02:29.080> every<00:02:29.560> dime

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
over $400 however it's worth every dime

julienne in my dressing room being cared

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.590 
julienne in my dressing room being cared
for<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.260> she's<00:02:44.680> not<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:45.040> messed<00:02:45.400> up<00:02:45.670> now<00:02:46.330> my

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.530 
for and she's not that messed up now my
high<00:02:46.900> heat<00:02:47.230> who<00:02:47.770> costs<00:02:48.280> around<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.940> think<00:02:49.240> it's

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
high heat who costs around I think it's

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.240 
high heat who costs around I think it's
around<00:02:49.660> 200<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:51.400> or<00:02:52.060> maybe<00:02:52.270> it's<00:02:52.600> closer<00:02:52.960> to

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
around 200 so or maybe it's closer to

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.420 
around 200 so or maybe it's closer to
200<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:55.000> 300<00:02:55.720> in<00:02:55.990> that<00:02:56.260> range<00:02:56.620> maybe<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.190> little

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
200 to 300 in that range maybe a little

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.590 
200 to 300 in that range maybe a little
more<00:02:57.640> little<00:02:58.150> less<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.740> has<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.910> mono<00:03:01.270> top

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
more little less and it has the mono top

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.950 
more little less and it has the mono top
