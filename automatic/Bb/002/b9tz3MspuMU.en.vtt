do find this can get a little bit

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.500 
do find this can get a little bit
uncomfortable<00:03:40.980> on<00:03:41.400> my<00:03:41.459> skin<00:03:41.880> as<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.060> day<00:03:42.269> goes

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
uncomfortable on my skin as the day goes

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.660 
uncomfortable on my skin as the day goes
on<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.200> do<00:03:43.290> recommend<00:03:43.739> if<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.130> do<00:03:44.310> have<00:03:44.459> dry

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
on so I do recommend if you do have dry

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.770 
on so I do recommend if you do have dry
skin<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.120> plan<00:03:45.360> on<00:03:45.480> wearing<00:03:45.660> this

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780

skin and you plan on wearing this
foundation<00:03:45.959> all<00:03:46.650> day<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.370> use<00:03:47.519> some<00:03:47.730> sort<00:03:47.940> of

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
foundation all day to use some sort of

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.550 
foundation all day to use some sort of
hydrating<00:03:48.630> primer<00:03:49.019> or<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:50.570> guess<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.780> mix<00:03:52.320> it

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
hydrating primer or I guess to mix it

with<00:03:52.769> another<00:03:53.090> foundation<00:03:54.090> which<00:03:54.209> may<00:03:54.390> be<00:03:54.450> a

with another foundation which may be a
bit<00:03:54.720> more<00:03:54.870> moisturizing<00:03:55.500> or<00:03:56.360> even<00:03:57.360> your<00:03:57.570> own

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
of product but I probably look really

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.890 
of product but I probably look really
sick<00:04:16.859> right<00:04:16.890> now<00:04:17.250> but<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.790> just<00:04:18.390> do<00:04:18.600> it<00:04:18.630> I'm

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
sick right now but I just do it I'm

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.570 
sick right now but I just do it I'm
doing<00:04:19.140> it<00:04:19.320> literally<00:04:19.590> just<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.890> show<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
doing it literally just to show you the

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.570 
doing it literally just to show you the
finish<00:04:21.890> now<00:04:22.890> I<00:04:22.919> don't<00:04:23.039> know<00:04:23.190> whether<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.430> can

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
finish now I don't know whether you can

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.670 
finish now I don't know whether you can
actually<00:04:24.000> see<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.450> makeup<00:04:24.720> on<00:04:25.080> me<00:04:25.260> but<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.620> do

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
actually see the makeup on me but I do

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.470 
actually see the makeup on me but I do
think<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.130> it's<00:04:26.400> quite<00:04:26.700> undeterred

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
think that it's quite undeterred

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.230 
think that it's quite undeterred
along<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.900> skin<00:04:28.230> and<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:29.370> would<00:04:29.850> have<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.060> say

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
along the skin and I would have to say

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.360 
along the skin and I would have to say
in<00:04:30.360> terms<00:04:30.390> of<00:04:30.660> application<00:04:30.840> it<00:04:31.590> dries<00:04:32.010> quite

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
in terms of application it dries quite

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.220 
in terms of application it dries quite
fast<00:04:32.700> so<00:04:32.850> you<00:04:32.910> need<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.240> work<00:04:33.360> quite<00:04:33.660> fast<00:04:33.960> with

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
fast so you need to work quite fast with

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.560 
fast so you need to work quite fast with
it<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:35.190> definitely<00:04:35.370> gives<00:04:35.730> a<00:04:35.910> matte<00:04:36.120> finish

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
it it definitely gives a matte finish

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.080 
it it definitely gives a matte finish
and<00:04:36.840> maybe<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.920> still<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.280> little<00:04:38.520> bit<00:04:38.640> shiny<00:04:38.910> on

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
and maybe a still a little bit shiny on

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.750 
and maybe a still a little bit shiny on
minx<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.450> hasn't<00:04:39.690> fully<00:04:39.840> dry<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.710> dried<00:04:41.460> yet

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.120 
get the darker shade actually because
this<00:05:00.540> is<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.990> little<00:05:01.380> bit<00:05:01.530> too<00:05:01.650> light<00:05:01.860> but<00:05:02.100> I

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
this is a little bit too light but I

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.640 
this is a little bit too light but I
have<00:05:02.400> been<00:05:02.700> using<00:05:02.730> it<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.360> day<00:05:04.290> to<00:05:04.350> day

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
have been using it and day to day

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.440 
have been using it and day to day
actually<00:05:04.980> just<00:05:05.490> in<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.700> centre<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.060> my<00:05:06.240> face

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
actually just in the centre of my face

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.480 
actually just in the centre of my face
and<00:05:06.600> then<00:05:06.660> I've<00:05:06.810> been<00:05:06.930> mixing<00:05:07.410> a<00:05:07.590> darker<00:05:08.280> color

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
and then I've been mixing a darker color

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.570 
and then I've been mixing a darker color
around<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:08.880> outside<00:05:09.390> and<00:05:09.950> so<00:05:10.950> if<00:05:11.010> you're<00:05:11.160> sort

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
around the outside and so if you're sort

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.280 
around the outside and so if you're sort
of<00:05:11.610> sort<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.420> a<00:05:12.480> person<00:05:12.750> that<00:05:12.810> doesn't<00:05:13.020> like<00:05:13.110> to

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
of sort of a person that doesn't like to

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.480 
of sort of a person that doesn't like to
return<00:05:13.590> things<00:05:13.950> where<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:14.220> really<00:05:14.250> just

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
return things where you really just

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.670 
return things where you really just
can't<00:05:14.880> be<00:05:14.970> bothered<00:05:15.150> and<00:05:15.510> it's<00:05:16.440> a<00:05:16.500> good<00:05:16.620> idea

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
can't be bothered and it's a good idea

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.740 
can't be bothered and it's a good idea
to<00:05:17.130> you<00:05:17.340> know<00:05:17.460> use<00:05:17.760> foundations<00:05:18.510> for

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
to you know use foundations for

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.690 
to you know use foundations for
highlighting<00:05:19.170> purposes<00:05:19.710> as<00:05:19.830> well<00:05:20.010> but<00:05:20.220> this

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
highlighting purposes as well but this

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.400 
highlighting purposes as well but this
is<00:05:20.820> a<00:05:20.850> beautiful<00:05:21.120> color<00:05:21.720> I<00:05:21.810> do<00:05:21.900> recommend<00:05:22.260> this

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
is a beautiful color I do recommend this

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.240 
is a beautiful color I do recommend this
kind<00:05:22.560> of<00:05:22.650> view<00:05:22.800> probably<00:05:22.980> and<00:05:23.370> C<00:05:23.880> and<00:05:24.620> C<00:05:25.620> 15<00:05:26.100> I'd

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
kind of view probably and C and C 15 I'd

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.010 
kind of view probably and C and C 15 I'd
say<00:05:26.550> because<00:05:26.760> it<00:05:26.940> is<00:05:26.970> kind<00:05:27.360> of<00:05:27.450> light<00:05:27.600> for<00:05:27.870> me

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020
