00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.100 

so<00:01:26.890> from<00:01:27.160> sidon<00:01:27.430> you<00:01:27.940> can<00:01:28.090> see<00:01:28.330> that<00:01:28.570> side<00:01:28.930> on

backspin or the chop you'll see that his
bat<00:01:34.630> start<00:01:34.990> up<00:01:35.260> that<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:36.220> head<00:01:36.490> level<00:01:37.480> finishes

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
bat start up that a head level finishes

00:01:38.320 --> 00:02:15.300 
bat start up that a head level finishes
down<00:01:38.650> at<00:01:39.130> knee<00:01:39.760> high

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.850 

with<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.610> chop<00:02:17.240> stroke<00:02:17.690> you'll<00:02:18.350> notice<00:02:18.680> that

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
with the chop stroke you'll notice that

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.400 
with the chop stroke you'll notice that
when<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.520> ball<00:02:19.670> comes<00:02:19.850> faster<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.570> Jeff<00:02:20.810> his

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
when the ball comes faster to Jeff his

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.770 
when the ball comes faster to Jeff his
stroke<00:02:21.740> will<00:02:21.950> be<00:02:22.100> more<00:02:22.640> vertical<00:02:22.880> because<00:02:23.600> he

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
stroke will be more vertical because he

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.720 
stroke will be more vertical because he
doesn't<00:02:24.020> need<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.680> forward<00:02:25.070> momentum<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.610> get

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
doesn't need the forward momentum to get

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.510 
doesn't need the forward momentum to get
the<00:02:25.820> ball<00:02:25.970> over<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.330> net<00:02:27.010> when<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.160> ball<00:02:28.340> is

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
the ball over the net when the ball is

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.460 
the ball over the net when the ball is
coming<00:02:29.210> a<00:02:29.450> little<00:02:29.780> bit<00:02:29.870> slower

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
coming a little bit slower

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.100 
coming a little bit slower
Jeff's<00:02:30.830> stroke<00:02:31.220> will<00:02:31.400> come<00:02:31.610> out<00:02:31.790> forward<00:02:32.480> to

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
Jeff's stroke will come out forward to

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.700 
Jeff's stroke will come out forward to
push<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.500> ball<00:02:33.650> over<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.220> net<00:02:34.250> more<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:36.560> this

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
push the ball over the net more so this

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.470 
push the ball over the net more so this
is<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.010> vertical<00:02:37.280> stroke<00:02:37.730> off<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.060> fastball

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
is the vertical stroke off the fastball

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.280 
is the vertical stroke off the fastball
and<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.850> forward<00:02:41.150> stroke<00:02:41.480> off<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.050> slower

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
and the forward stroke off the slower

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.530 
and the forward stroke off the slower
ball
