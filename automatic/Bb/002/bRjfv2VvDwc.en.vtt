00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
if it's right out the gate that's the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.230 
if it's right out the gate that's the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
math involved in quality so if you have

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.990 
math involved in quality so if you have
the<00:03:48.989> time<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:50.070> take<00:03:50.430> your<00:03:50.459> Call<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.760> Duty

weapon stamp charts I have a link to

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.170 
weapon stamp charts I have a link to
them<00:03:55.620> in<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.800> description<00:03:56.000> they're<00:03:57.000> really

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
them in the description they're really

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.000 
them in the description they're really
useful<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.630> it's<00:03:57.720> kind<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:57.900> helpful<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.440> find

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
useful and it's kind of helpful to find

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.640 
useful and it's kind of helpful to find
out<00:03:59.130> like<00:03:59.280> what<00:03:59.340> guns

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
out like what guns

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.860 
out like what guns
and<00:04:01.070> like<00:04:01.640> what<00:04:01.820> guns<00:04:02.030> do<00:04:02.240> and<00:04:02.510> why<00:04:02.660> they

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
and like what guns do and why they

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.690 
and like what guns do and why they
behave<00:04:03.050> the<00:04:03.440> way<00:04:03.560> they<00:04:03.710> do<00:04:03.770> what<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.370> actual

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
behave the way they do what the actual

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.690 
behave the way they do what the actual
in-game<00:04:05.210> statistics<00:04:05.960> show<00:04:06.830> for<00:04:07.160> that<00:04:07.250> gun<00:04:07.490> and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
in-game statistics show for that gun and

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.310 
in-game statistics show for that gun and
I<00:04:07.820> think<00:04:08.000> it's<00:04:08.150> it's<00:04:08.600> all<00:04:08.720> really<00:04:08.930> interesting

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
I think it's it's all really interesting

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.220 
I think it's it's all really interesting
that<00:04:09.440> people<00:04:10.090> kind<00:04:11.090> of<00:04:11.210> get<00:04:11.390> inside<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.960> files

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
that people kind of get inside the files

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.660 
that people kind of get inside the files
of<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.650> game<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.070> find<00:04:13.280> out<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.520> actual

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
of the game and find out the actual

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.940 
of the game and find out the actual
damage<00:04:14.060> per<00:04:14.480> gun<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:14.960> how<00:04:15.080> the<00:04:15.140> bullet<00:04:15.560> system

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
damage per gun and how the bullet system

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.130 
damage per gun and how the bullet system
works<00:04:16.160> especially<00:04:17.060> on<00:04:17.390> things<00:04:17.540> like<00:04:17.600> shotguns

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
works especially on things like shotguns

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.960 
works especially on things like shotguns
and<00:04:18.350> snipers<00:04:18.739> it's<00:04:18.920> really<00:04:19.340> weird<00:04:19.609> and

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
and snipers it's really weird and

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.080 
and snipers it's really weird and
complex<00:04:20.540> how<00:04:20.780> they<00:04:20.930> actually<00:04:21.079> work<00:04:22.090> but

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
complex how they actually work but

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.370 
complex how they actually work but
that's<00:04:23.270> your<00:04:23.480> commando<00:04:23.810> stats<00:04:24.020> right<00:04:24.170> there

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
that's your commando stats right there

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.380 
that's your commando stats right there
for<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.920> on<00:04:25.190> your<00:04:25.220> screen<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:25.790> hope<00:04:26.030> that<00:04:26.240> kind

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
for you on your screen I hope that kind

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.480 
for you on your screen I hope that kind
of<00:04:26.510> makes<00:04:26.720> sense<00:04:26.870> if<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.830> throw<00:04:28.040> a<00:04:28.070> silencer

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
of makes sense if you throw a silencer

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.980 
of makes sense if you throw a silencer
on<00:04:28.610> something<00:04:28.940> it's<00:04:29.090> gonna<00:04:29.180> lose<00:04:29.420> range<00:04:29.720> I

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
on something it's gonna lose range I

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.420 
on something it's gonna lose range I
don't<00:04:30.440> really<00:04:30.590> recommend<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:31.100> command<00:04:31.340> over

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
don't really recommend the command over

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.560 
don't really recommend the command over
the<00:04:31.520> sound<00:04:31.760> of<00:04:31.790> three<00:04:31.940> but<00:04:32.120> I've<00:04:32.210> seen<00:04:32.330> a<00:04:32.390> lot

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
the sound of three but I've seen a lot

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.540 
the sound of three but I've seen a lot
of<00:04:32.690> people<00:04:32.930> use<00:04:33.230> it<00:04:33.410> here<00:04:34.040> it<00:04:34.160> is<00:04:34.250> check<00:04:34.460> this

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
killed that guy capturing and booby

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.970 
killed that guy capturing and booby
trapping<00:04:37.340> crate<00:04:38.170> pick<00:04:39.170> it<00:04:39.290> up<00:04:39.410> right<00:04:39.590> there<00:04:39.800> I

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
trapping crate pick it up right there I

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.910 
trapping crate pick it up right there I
get<00:04:40.760> back<00:04:40.940> up<00:04:41.180> run<00:04:41.780> up<00:04:41.900> here<00:04:42.110> got<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.470> hijacker

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
get back up run up here got the hijacker

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.670 
get back up run up here got the hijacker
and<00:04:43.390> I<00:04:44.390> didn't<00:04:44.630> actually<00:04:44.750> know<00:04:45.110> that<00:04:45.140> when<00:04:45.560> you

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
and I didn't actually know that when you

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.500 
and I didn't actually know that when you
movie<00:04:46.160> traffic<00:04:46.490> site<00:04:46.670> you<00:04:46.760> actually<00:04:47.090> get<00:04:47.240> was

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
movie traffic site you actually get was

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.850 
movie traffic site you actually get was
in<00:04:47.630> it<00:04:47.750> as<00:04:47.870> well<00:04:48.050> so<00:04:48.080> I<00:04:48.350> managed<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.650> get<00:04:48.800> a

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
in it as well so I managed to get a

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.310 
in it as well so I managed to get a
counter<00:04:49.100> spy<00:04:49.340> plane<00:04:49.670> and<00:04:49.940> I<00:04:50.810> think<00:04:51.170> that's

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
counter spy plane and I think that's

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.320 
counter spy plane and I think that's

gameplay and I actually managed to get

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.430 
gameplay and I actually managed to get
that<00:05:04.400> care<00:05:04.940> package<00:05:05.180> explosion<00:05:06.050> fill<00:05:06.290> you

guys all have to check it out in the

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.310 
guys all have to check it out in the
kill<00:05:07.490> feed<00:05:07.669> but<00:05:07.970> I<00:05:08.510> was<00:05:08.780> really<00:05:08.960> proud<00:05:09.110> of<00:05:09.169> that

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
entertaining to see a gameplay like this
