there<00:02:51.750> was<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:51.960> a<00:02:52.110> root<00:02:52.350> growing<00:02:52.710> into<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
there was like a root growing into the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.510 
there was like a root growing into the
house<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.180> back<00:02:54.210> door<00:02:54.560> which<00:02:55.560> scares<00:02:56.310> me<00:02:56.490> a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
house to the back door which scares me a

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.510 
house to the back door which scares me a
little<00:02:56.670> bit<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.680> passing<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:58.980> one<00:02:59.160> even

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
little bit so passing on that one even

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.270 
little bit so passing on that one even
though<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.670> was<00:02:59.850> really<00:03:00.570> nice<00:03:00.690> inside<00:03:01.320> the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
though it was really nice inside the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.830 
though it was really nice inside the
structural<00:03:02.790> part<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.180> is<00:03:03.270> more<00:03:03.450> important

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
structural part of it is more important

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.670 
structural part of it is more important
than<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.980> looks<00:03:05.220> honestly<00:03:05.850> because<00:03:06.680> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
than the looks honestly because the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.490 
than the looks honestly because the
cosmetic<00:03:08.190> issues<00:03:08.520> can<00:03:08.700> be<00:03:08.760> fixed<00:03:09.270> with

trying not to get emotionally attached
to<00:04:12.640> anything<00:04:12.850> because<00:04:13.390> we've<00:04:13.660> been<00:04:13.840> through

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020

to anything because we've been through
this<00:04:14.110> before<00:04:14.320> and<00:04:14.560> obviously<00:04:15.370> we've<00:04:15.610> never

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
this before and obviously we've never

this before and obviously we've never
purchased<00:04:16.239> a<00:04:16.360> house<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:16.890> sometimes<00:04:17.890> it<00:04:18.040> just

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
purchased a house so sometimes it just

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160 
purchased a house so sometimes it just
doesn't<00:04:18.310> work<00:04:18.519> out<00:04:18.760> but<00:04:19.120> topic<00:04:19.840> so<00:04:20.110> we're

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
doesn't work out but topic so we're

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.479 
doesn't work out but topic so we're
going<00:04:20.380> to<00:04:20.500> look<00:04:20.590> at<00:04:20.650> another<00:04:20.920> one<00:04:21.190> it's<00:04:21.400> a

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
going to look at another one it's a

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.220 
going to look at another one it's a
little<00:04:21.760> over<00:04:22.060> our<00:04:22.210> price<00:04:22.240> range<00:04:22.540> but

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
little over our price range but

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.860 
little over our price range but
hopefully<00:04:23.950> you<00:04:24.910> know<00:04:25.000> it's<00:04:25.240> not<00:04:25.360> it's<00:04:25.600> not<00:04:25.660> too
