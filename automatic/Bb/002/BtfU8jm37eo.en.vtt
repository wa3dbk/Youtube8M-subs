00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:09.929
 hello today our video about how 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.200
 remove the side car mirror to 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.370
 example there as in my case it is for 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.820
 replacements 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:21.810
 repeater so I this repeater 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.600
 took off restored and going to him 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.240
 put back what we need first 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.240
 do you need to raise the mirror up 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:41.620
 so that we have access 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:47.210
 to the bottom so here it is still turn 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:50.420
 the right to have a mirror gap 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:55.309
 we have clips our goal 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:59.449
 now up your fingers and a couple clips 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:04.180
 reach them and squeeze them here 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.920
 the seat so we can 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.130
 unchecked remove the mirror so what 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.130
 go 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.490
 all we see mirrors 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:03.210
 I managed to remove unfortunately the second time I 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.680
 broke one latch well in principle it's not 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.540
 fundamentally because there is already 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:15.750
 enough so she 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:18.470
 held and it is desirable to do it when 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.870
 positive temperature is undesirable 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.640
 highly recommend doing to him 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.040
 I will show you further what to do for 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.890
 in order to understand repeat them 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.920
 unscrew the 3 bolts in the swivel 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.920
 the mechanism 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.290
 here we got to the middle of the mirrors 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.830
 you give us a repeater and mount it as 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.830
 your seat 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.620
 and now we know bolted 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.620
 repeater 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:40.010
 we connect it to the wiring back 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.010
 forgettable polarity 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.260
 before we collect check 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.300
 how everything works fine 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.429
 and collect in square order clear 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:11.209
 the thing is that this is a guide for dummies 

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:14.629
 knitting needles will tell fu fuck you shot this 

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:17.059
 video but I for example went through youtube and 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:19.849
 I did not find how to remove the mirror, therefore 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:22.009
 I had to somehow get out myself and 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:25.749
 I got it all thanks to all 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.749
 to new meetings bye
