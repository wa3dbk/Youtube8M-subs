00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.440 
like it on the market then you get the G
X<00:01:42.060> 14<00:01:42.450> soleplate<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.369> stud<00:01:44.369> pattern<00:01:44.729> which<00:01:45.360> is

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
X 14 soleplate and stud pattern which is

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.149 
X 14 soleplate and stud pattern which is
basically<00:01:45.720> features<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.590> their<00:01:46.920> net

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
basically features the their net

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.450 
basically features the their net
breathing<00:01:47.610> system<00:01:48.030> which<00:01:49.189> although<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.280> looks

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
breathing system which although it looks

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.609 
breathing system which although it looks
like<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.759> glass<00:01:50.939> fiber<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
like the glass fiber like you see on the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.060 
like the glass fiber like you see on the
vapor<00:01:53.490> series<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.299> actually<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
vapor series it's not actually a

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.200 
vapor series it's not actually a
fiberglass<00:01:56.070> or<00:01:56.310> carbon<00:01:56.369> fiber<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:56.939> anything

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
fiberglass or carbon fiber or anything

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.149 
fiberglass or carbon fiber or anything
like<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:58.290> actually<00:01:58.680> layers<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
like that it's actually layers and

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.080 
like that it's actually layers and
layers<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.600> this<00:02:00.600> woven<00:02:01.250> mesh<00:02:02.250> made<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.880> some

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
layers of this woven mesh made of some

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.700 
layers of this woven mesh made of some
form<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.479> plastic<00:02:03.719> or<00:02:04.200> metal<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:04.560> not

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
form of plastic or metal I'm not

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.190 
form of plastic or metal I'm not
entirely<00:02:04.950> sure<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:06.149> basically<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.899> to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
entirely sure but basically it is to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.869 
entirely sure but basically it is to
allow<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.829> shoe<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.280> breathe<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> little<00:02:08.759> bit

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
allow the shoe to breathe a little bit

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.990 
allow the shoe to breathe a little bit
better<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.810> air<00:02:10.289> can<00:02:10.319> go<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.190> out<00:02:11.250> but

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
better so air can go in and out but

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.790 
better so air can go in and out but
water<00:02:12.209> can't<00:02:12.540> go<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:12.840> so

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
water can't go in so

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.500 
water can't go in so
it's<00:02:14.280> kind<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.490> difficult<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:15.030> test<00:02:15.210> whether

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
it's kind of difficult to test whether

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.180 
it's kind of difficult to test whether
or<00:02:15.600> not<00:02:15.720> your<00:02:15.930> feet<00:02:16.110> actually<00:02:16.350> stay<00:02:16.740> cooler<00:02:17.100> or

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
or not your feet actually stay cooler or

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.860 
or not your feet actually stay cooler or
when<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.400> do<00:02:17.520> wear<00:02:17.670> these<00:02:17.820> shoes<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.660> can

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
when you do wear these shoes but I can

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.380 
when you do wear these shoes but I can
tell<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.230> water<00:02:19.470> does<00:02:19.710> not<00:02:19.740> go<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.390> so

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
tell you that water does not go in so

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.510 
tell you that water does not go in so
that's<00:02:21.570> definitely<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.960> plus<00:02:22.100> so<00:02:23.100> it

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
that's definitely a plus so it

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.740 
that's definitely a plus so it
definitely<00:02:23.670> does<00:02:23.970> work<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.390> then<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.600> get

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
definitely does work and then you get

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.020 
definitely does work and then you get
this<00:02:24.870> kind<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.110> more<00:02:25.260> traditional

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
this kind of more traditional

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.990 
this kind of more traditional
stipe<00:02:27.690> patterning<00:02:28.140> these<00:02:28.320> conical<00:02:28.740> studs

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
stipe patterning these conical studs

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.460 
stipe patterning these conical studs
really<00:02:30.000> stable<00:02:30.330> stud<00:02:30.480> pattern<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:31.230> soil

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
really stable stud pattern the soil

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.650 
really stable stud pattern the soil
itself<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:31.980> nice<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.400> flexible<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.090> it's

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
itself is nice and flexible and it's

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.940 
itself is nice and flexible and it's
probably<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.170> best<00:02:34.350> stai<00:02:34.590> patterns

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
probably one of the best stai patterns

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.990 
probably one of the best stai patterns
especially<00:02:35.340> if<00:02:35.400> you're<00:02:35.490> gonna<00:02:35.580> be<00:02:35.670> using<00:02:35.820> it

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
especially if you're gonna be using it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.210 
especially if you're gonna be using it
on<00:02:36.120> turf<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.600> really<00:02:37.350> like<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.620> stop<00:02:37.800> pattern<00:02:38.130> I

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
on turf I really like the stop pattern I

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.520 
on turf I really like the stop pattern I
really<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.640> soleplate<00:02:39.200> provide<00:02:40.200> plenty

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
really like the soleplate provide plenty

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.930 
really like the soleplate provide plenty
of<00:02:40.650> stiffness<00:02:40.920> when<00:02:41.190> shooting<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.730> just<00:02:41.880> a

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
of stiffness when shooting it's just a

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.850 
of stiffness when shooting it's just a
great<00:02:42.150> shoe<00:02:42.360> again<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.500> wanna<00:02:43.650> check<00:02:43.740> out

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
great shoe again if you wanna check out

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.290 
great shoe again if you wanna check out

feel that you can only get from a

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.870 
feel that you can only get from a
Diadora<00:03:15.690> shoe<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.430> it's<00:03:17.430> something<00:03:17.760> you

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
Diadora shoe and it's something you

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.430 
Diadora shoe and it's something you
never<00:03:18.030> tried<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:18.390> really<00:03:18.780> recommend<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.200> try

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
never tried I really recommend you try

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.470 
never tried I really recommend you try
it<00:03:19.500> because<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.800> think<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:20.040> lot<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.250> people<00:03:20.580> given

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
it because I think a lot of people given

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.580 
it because I think a lot of people given
that<00:03:21.600> they<00:03:21.690> give<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.170> chance<00:03:22.410> would
