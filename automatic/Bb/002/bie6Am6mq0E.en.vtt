00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.690 
between an adult Holden Caulfield and
that<00:03:03.170> boy<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.230> met<00:03:04.740> in<00:03:04.920> freshman<00:03:05.430> year<00:03:05.460> of

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
that boy you met in freshman year of

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.650 
that boy you met in freshman year of
University<00:03:06.420> who<00:03:06.660> kept<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.110> blog<00:03:07.170> and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
University who kept a blog and

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.600 
University who kept a blog and
chronicled<00:03:09.660> his<00:03:09.840> life<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.440> tried<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.580> like

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
chronicled his life and tried to be like

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.220 
chronicled his life and tried to be like
Charles<00:03:12.360> Bukowski<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:12.930> think<00:03:13.110> that's

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
Charles Bukowski and I think that's

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.600 
Charles Bukowski and I think that's
probably<00:03:13.350> why<00:03:13.620> those<00:03:13.920> boys<00:03:14.160> are<00:03:14.370> like<00:03:14.550> that

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
probably why those boys are like that

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.310 
probably why those boys are like that
cuz<00:03:14.910> they<00:03:15.030> read<00:03:15.180> Charles<00:03:15.450> Bukowski<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:16.020> like

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
cuz they read Charles Bukowski and like

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.320 
cuz they read Charles Bukowski and like
I<00:03:16.470> want<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:16.800> be<00:03:16.890> like<00:03:17.010> him<00:03:17.160> he<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:17.880> symbol<00:03:18.300> for
