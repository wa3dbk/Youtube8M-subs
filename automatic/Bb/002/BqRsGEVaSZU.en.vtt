00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.670 
because the signal coming out of the
xbox<00:04:15.459> is<00:04:15.760> loud<00:04:16.060> enough<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.630> we<00:04:17.140> can<00:04:17.169> hear<00:04:17.530> it's

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
xbox is loud enough so we can hear it's

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.080 
xbox is loud enough so we can hear it's
not<00:04:17.830> quiet<00:04:18.099> it's<00:04:18.310> actually<00:04:18.640> pretty<00:04:18.849> decent

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
not quiet it's actually pretty decent

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.300 
not quiet it's actually pretty decent
like<00:04:19.780> volume<00:04:20.020> coming<00:04:20.380> out<00:04:20.620> so<00:04:21.099> you<00:04:21.190> know<00:04:21.250> if

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
like volume coming out so you know if

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.800 
like volume coming out so you know if
they<00:04:21.400> have<00:04:21.459> your<00:04:21.640> stereo<00:04:22.120> on

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
they have your stereo on

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.500 
they have your stereo on
authorities<00:04:23.650> on<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.860> adapters<00:04:24.400> um<00:04:24.760> so<00:04:25.300> I<00:04:25.330> use

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
authorities on the adapters um so I use

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.600 
authorities on the adapters um so I use
that<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:26.139> only<00:04:26.230> time<00:04:26.500> you<00:04:26.560> might<00:04:27.370> need<00:04:27.550> a

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
that the only time you might need a

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.760 
that the only time you might need a
amplifier<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:29.110> if<00:04:29.230> you're<00:04:29.350> gonna<00:04:29.470> watch<00:04:29.650> a

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
amplifier is if you're gonna watch a

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.800 
amplifier is if you're gonna watch a
movie<00:04:29.800> because<00:04:30.460> movies<00:04:30.910> on<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.150> Xbox<00:04:31.570> are

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
movie because movies on the Xbox are
