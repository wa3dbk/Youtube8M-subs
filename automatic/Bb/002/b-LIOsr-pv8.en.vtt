 Move the left shoulder to the left of the target direction in the direction you want to strike from the position of 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:23.170
 Be aware that the left shoulder moves parallel to the ground when moving the left shoulder to the left 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:31.420
 Let's do it so slowly

 Nature and waist when the Tokama is left move the left shoulder in this or left will also target direction moving this 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:40.600
 There is no problem at all, but from the top position absolutely downswing from the waist 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.440
 Please be careful not to start it 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.440
 Would you lift 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:54.640
 Also natural and hips because the left shoulder is moved to the left or of the target direction from the position of the top 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.400
 Move towards the target direction 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:04.590
 It is the point that I want you to be careful here , but can I get it back again 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.780
 When moving the left shoulder toward the target from the top position , another top 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:13.100
 Please say 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:16.009
 Even if the left shoulder is moved toward the target direction, it will absolutely target the raised bone at the base of the neck 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:22.100
 Be careful not to move in the direction 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:25.800
 Many people try to move the left shoulder toward the target from the top position 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.050
 The raised bones of the neck of the neck also flow to the left 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.390
 This must not be 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.060
 It is of course back 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.509
 Shall we go to the top ? 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:44.970
 Drink the left shoulder parallel to the ground from the top position and move it to the left toward the left target direction 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:50.909
 Even if the raised bones at the base of the neck are moved, they are moved while consciously 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.080
 Then, when it comes to this side , the left shoulder can move to the left or in the target direction. 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.760
 I can stop here 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:02.750
 After that , it will be an image that will rotate more naturally than left 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.240
 It seems like this is good I downswing from the top position even when doing a swing 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:11.180
 Please be aware of the movement of the start firmly 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.970
 From top position without starting downswing from waist rotation without using arms 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.370
 Move the left shoulder towards the target 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.180

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:25.450
 Do you now and you'll see from the front nice I am again now Motofu 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:30.790

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.810
 Was born 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:52.030
 Right elbow does not extend too This right elbow does not extend when viewed in the image from behind here 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:56.280
