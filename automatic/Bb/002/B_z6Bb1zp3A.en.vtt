00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.799
 new bidet and with the saw in the title 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.139
 trick to fly and float super easy in 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.120
 big auto online then we're going to 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.889
 start and as in all the videos them 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.080
 I have asked for a sum of likes this video 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.449
 I would love it to reach the amount 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.910
 of 300 likes and many thanks for 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.220
 everything ok anyway a hug and a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.080
 greeting then let's start and another 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.150
 What I wanted to tell you was many 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.609
 thanks for the 40 thousand subscribers that 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.740
 now we are in the channel and asia another thing 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.969
 let's start with the first video 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.460
 thing that we will have to do to 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.469
 perform this trick will come to this 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.020
 part of the map that I am teaching you 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.690
 that there is right next to what you are doing 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.870
 the game death by teams number 50 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.730
 it seems to me and there we will just have to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.100
 place ok here in this location where 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.690
 I am giving them and once we have 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.699
 reached what is making that area 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.250
 simply what we will need before 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.500
 to arrive will be a helicopter either a 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.420
 bus or the helicopter that I am yo 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.250
 suggestion I tell them to call him what 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.159
 that is doing pegasus or I say 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.270
 merriweather and ask for this helicopter 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.399
 not an extraction 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.770
 helicopter and they are simply coming to 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.840
 this area is not the easiest way to 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.939
 get a helicopter and just 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.549
 here as you see there will be as a kind of 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.890
 pool something weird and they just have 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.020
 to put the helicopter in there as they see it 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.670
 I have already put the helicopter and once 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.770
 that they have put the helicopter will leave 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.899
 the doors barred and it simply 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.149
 they will leave as they can see the helicopter 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.610
 they will kill them and now what we will have to 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.579
 to do will be to direct ourselves to that same 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.740
 pool ok then here I'm just going 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.420
 to take my character and we 're going to go to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.829
 the areas where the truth died that this 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.349
 it's a trick and the truth is that it's pretty 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.030
 easy to do then here the only thing 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:47.069
 what we are going to have to do will be 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.810
 direct us to the part of the pool and 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.959
 here when you have reached this part 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.670
 what we will have to do is move to 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.229
 these stairs so have something of 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.179
 careful so that our character does not 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.280
 nobody so they just fall into those 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.409
 we will have to take out a weapon 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.479
 I do not know how we will recharge right in this wall and 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.549
 is and you will see that our character here 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.349
 will be with your assault rifle any 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.179
 weapon that has in drawn and 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.009
 we will simply have to point as 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.110
 you will see the character start to float 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.060
 nothing and if it makes them 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.040
 that the trick has been done once 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.810
 that the trick has already come out 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.430
 they have to do is just walk 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.530
 in front of what the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.660
 helicopter and here the only thing they will have 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.820
 what to do is try to get to the part 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.160
 from above the helicopter there is a 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.710
 once they have reached the part of 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.540
 above you will see that something will have happened 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.030
 strange and we can already start 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.680
 walk or float ok but here we have not 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.510
 come to the part of up and 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.850
 this is when I get to the part of up 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.800
 above that the best way to get there is 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.720
 in the back and here the only 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.850
 What I'm going to do is run and 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.920
 as you can see we are already floating 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.810
 this method is not much easier than the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.190
 previous method so guys I hope 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.980
 you liked today's video as 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.780
 come is a trick and here as I see it already 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.760
 I'm right in what the 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.100
 city not the truth that is pretty 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.290
 well and you can do this a lot 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.450
 better with friends and the truth that they leave 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.800
 to have a lot more fun, do not go 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.480
 which kill from the sky and any 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.280
 thing and this did not like the video
