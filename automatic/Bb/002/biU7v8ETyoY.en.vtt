00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.100
 and warm and not heavy added 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.599
 this office 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.080
 I make the bell, Spain, it's good, let's go 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.449
 to start dancing the armed yes but 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.519
 before I'll show you the mold and I 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.580
 I was forgetting about the mold lady 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.740
 leave in a corner of simple mold is 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.599
 the mold of the tight shirt that 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.050
 you already have size one or that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.059
 we did with hair last year in the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.129
 neck or several more also sleeves 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.320
 cut three quarters good but for 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.090
 review has a length of 60 centimeters 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.739
 obviously the length varies according to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.629
 a long that you want gives the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.850
 neckline is small because now they will see 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.379
 that we are going to bend that neckline 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.480
 then to the tier of these the neckline 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.850
 It will be 6 centimeters and a bajadita 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.699
 of 1 nothing else do not worry about the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.350
 neckline that is small after a dug 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.090
 in the front of course I would 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.630
 installed if you can do instead 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.480
 if they want 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.180
 it's simple 20-inch armholes 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.560
 small with a waist of one centimeter and 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.930
 medium if the sleeve is with little cup no 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.160
 it has too much we go down 11 centimeters 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.690
 simply and in the fist will carry 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.880
 analytical or 10 centimeters because it's 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.770
 adjusted you saw already just the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.869
 good model now if we go to the armed 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.869
 good as soon as he will do more let's start 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.280
 with your back you can see the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.289
 material is very cute if you look for it 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.990
 because they are already in business 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.460
 I got it but it has already started and it looks and 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.110
 there are several tones as I told him to live 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.799
 let's start with the back that what 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.380
 What we did is a film on the neckline 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.450
 and I already started working as you 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.390
 you can see your row mos fold i chamosa 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.880
 one centimeter and there we sew with a 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.979
 straight stitching simply straight stitching 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.049
 or if you want they can also be 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.420
 a very loose zig zag 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.429
 we leave the neckline of the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.170
 back in this way you can see 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.869
 the right how it is if we work with 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.090
 thread to the good tone remember that when 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.650
 they are going to cut these pieces because they have 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.989
 hair always have to place the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.540
 molds in the same direction yes that yes 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.959
 Well, if the color does not change, we leave this 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.790
 in a corner and we go to the forwards 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.410
 how are we going to work, let's start 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.070
 sighing 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.820
 come back from the views in this way with 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:36.510
 thread to the tone if we overcome both views and 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.140
 let's cross it to the front body if 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.660
 we win we go to the sewing machine 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.310
 we only know this view 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.890
 facing the rights to the neckline 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.080
 only the neckline not shoulder or 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.720
 continuing the body to the neckline there 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.680
 let's go to the machine yes and we will perform 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.760
 a straight seam then prepare the 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.620
 machines placing straight seam because 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.890
 here is the stitch of the girls and in 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.040
 Our wonder of easy point machine 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.650
 let's carry the line yes and in this 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.980
 case we are going to perform a zig zag to this 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.530
 of 5 the stitch has to be big 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.060
 where possible 7 and remember that the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.530
 attention has to be loose in this 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:27.160
 case is also in 7 then now yes 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.720
 let's sew the neckline the view of the 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.540
 neckline there is with a zigzag 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.080
 it can be straight posture too that's 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.380
 as it was said 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.130
 to these we sew in this way there what 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.670
 can see crop the surplus and now 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.670
 If we leave 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.480
 to the table we continue working 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.640
 Once we have this so I already 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.739
 I have done because of course tele 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.060
 point it is advisable to use another but 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.670
 if you do not have them replace them with 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.280
 a sixth and a surf spinning if there is 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.400
 can see then now if we join the 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.190
 back and front by the shoulders 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.970
 We place it in your order 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.970
 this way 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.699
 facing the rights but it is 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.340
 the little secret so that we have one 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.949
 Good that is neat so much upside down 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.330
 as of the right they will know well 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.780
 facing me in fact men but 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.889
 they will wrap their eyes 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:34.979
 in this way they wrap and there we sew 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.560
 and then I'll show how 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.750
 we are left with this, the pincushion went 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.690
 I wanted to run out of mind to 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.960
 this one once we have this like this 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.710
 likewise the other shoulder we turn and 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.500
 you can see how this is 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.460
 that the one of petro elect of the right and 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:01.070
 they are neat now they are going to see upside down 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:03.900
 there you can see a good ending 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.360
 there is what happens that these crimes 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.250
 they go they move us but there they are 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.070
 can see right now let's go to the 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.240
 placement of the closure with regard to 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.600
 close that is what we are going to do 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.850
 prepare both or both shoulders like this in the 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.920
 in closing we will face the 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.320
 right of the views and we're going to 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:26.080
 get the closure in your order 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.150
 we open of course in this case what 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.530
 I do in a dark tone so that 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.810
 you can notice the details but 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.370
 the closure has to be high they are not going to 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.230
 harass first they will decide the width 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.810
 of the hem in this case can be of 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.130
 three centimeters then in sight and 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.220
 to do him of course the same 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.510
 hem three centimeters then one 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.590
 once they have determined the 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:53.980
 we're going to sew 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.780
 well in this way we face the right 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.920
 of sight 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:02.560
 we know the closure like that in that way 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.110
 let's sew let's put the other 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.300
 end like that and we cook it from the same 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.770
 way I know that you in closing comes out 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.130

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.210
 can see is the closure placed and 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.550
 We take the views like this in this way 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.460
 going around and how the 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.620

 we always close the lower sleeves 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:40.750
 sides and double say the garment to 2 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.420
