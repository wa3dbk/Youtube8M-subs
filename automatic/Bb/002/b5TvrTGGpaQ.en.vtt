since I first started buying the stuff
it<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:07.960> guess<00:01:08.960> it<00:01:09.710> makes<00:01:09.950> sense<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:10.460> that

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
it I guess it makes sense that that

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.260 
it I guess it makes sense that that
there's<00:01:11.630> a<00:01:11.780> shortage<00:01:12.320> or<00:01:12.590> II<00:01:12.850> into<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.000> supply
