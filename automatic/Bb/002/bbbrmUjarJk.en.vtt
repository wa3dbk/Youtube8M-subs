00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.790
 generous space offer sustainable 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.610
 Consumption values ​​of under two and a half 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.770
 liters on 100 kilometers and to the 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.869
 increased entry position of bmw 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.210
 concept active tour is and really 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.980
 something for bmw friends of all ages and 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.140
 have when they sit only once in there then 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.210
 They compact everything at a glance and 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.050
 but also a right one 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.050
 pleasant room feeling 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.149
 I'm terribly sorry to have it 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.739
 unfortunately he is not yet I can do it 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.190
 but already betrayed how he arrives 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.050
 I am glad that bmw functional 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.420
 Vehicles with the domestic vehicles 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.610
 with the design of bmw combines that 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.870
 bmw sometimes with traditions I break 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.610
 the other knows to the front 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.560
 that brings a lot of space to the chamber 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.630
 So bikes really invite you 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.750
 great vehicle so very convincing 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.270
 conclusively beautiful beautiful sexy his beautiful 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.950
 in tyria the whole theme is true that me 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.140
 I assume that it is not only 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:22.170
 a design study is but that it 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.310
 something is also what is going to fix in the exposé 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.560
 responsible for this dynamic 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.660
 Appearance is Michael's apartment 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:38.020
 his character's exterior designer 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:40.599
 we visited us in munich 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.090
 important to meet a new trend and 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.780
 We now see that more people are his 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.690
 10 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.759
 and maybe a whole day to day life 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.160
 spend district and we need 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.160
 a car for this albans life 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.860
 the inspiration for this car immediately 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.340
 Agility and how we did it 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.390
 is very very muscular surfaces and very 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.119
 precise lines 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.570
 this interaction gives just this 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.170
 Latvian expression know how to spencer 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.250
 a start blocks waiting for this 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.190
 potential to move forward 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.330
 Third proportion we have very much 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.090
 short overhangs 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.120
 that helps to show agility we have 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.370
 always two lines these mutually 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.970
 support for example on the engine 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.760
 have it around two strong line through this 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.240
 bow lines provided more on width 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.310
 effect as on joints 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.620
 It's surprising because you have the door 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.190
 How much space really opens up 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.440
 Enormously you have this combination 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.650
 space and sportiness 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.110
 It feels when you sit behind the steering wheel 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.329
 this span of mix 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.120
 flexibility and dynamics 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.120
 that's not what the car is about 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.440
 michael de bono about the bmw concept 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.849
 active tura so I say goodbye 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.680
 for today and I'm glad when you return 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.680
