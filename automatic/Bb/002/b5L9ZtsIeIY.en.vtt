00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
runescape is down doesn't mean the end

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.110 
runescape is down doesn't mean the end
of<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.290> world<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.680> happening<00:02:34.860> but<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.880> amount

incredible because some of you guys
seriously<00:02:40.530> think<00:02:40.830> runescape<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.490> over<00:02:41.940> I

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
seriously think runescape is over I

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.090 
seriously think runescape is over I
understand<00:02:43.230> for<00:02:43.590> some<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:43.950> guys

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
understand for some of you guys

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.610 
understand for some of you guys
runescape<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:44.970> your<00:02:45.180> only<00:02:45.510> source<00:02:46.020> of<00:02:46.320> video

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
runescape is your only source of video

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.610 
runescape is your only source of video
game<00:02:46.920> because<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.820> don't<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.090> maybe<00:02:48.450> 360<00:02:49.410> or

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
game because you don't have maybe 360 or

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.910 
game because you don't have maybe 360 or
television<00:02:50.400> or<00:02:50.520> center<00:02:51.000> etc<00:02:51.380> but<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.440> can<00:02:52.770> do

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
television or center etc but you can do

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.160 
television or center etc but you can do
other<00:02:53.160> ships<00:02:53.610> like<00:02:54.180> for<00:02:54.390> example<00:02:54.480> today<00:02:55.020> is

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
other ships like for example today is

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.590 
other ships like for example today is
monday<00:02:55.680> i'm<00:02:55.920> pretty<00:02:56.610> sure<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:57.060> lot<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.360> you

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
monday i'm pretty sure that a lot of you

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.470 
monday i'm pretty sure that a lot of you
motherfuckers<00:02:57.870> are<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:59.040> some<00:02:59.490> type<00:02:59.910> of<00:02:59.940> school

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
motherfuckers are in some type of school

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.630 
motherfuckers are in some type of school
so<00:03:01.320> therefore<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:01.980> probably<00:03:02.310> could<00:03:02.490> do

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
so therefore you probably could do

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.970 
so therefore you probably could do
homework<00:03:03.060> or<00:03:03.270> just<00:03:03.840> do<00:03:04.260> other<00:03:04.560> shit<00:03:04.680> in

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
homework or just do other shit in

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.490
