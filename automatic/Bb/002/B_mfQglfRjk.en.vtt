00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.580 
like I've said in a quick tip Tuesday
before<00:03:24.250> which<00:03:24.730> I<00:03:24.880> will<00:03:25.030> link<00:03:25.209> down<00:03:25.269> here<00:03:25.590> boxes

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
before which I will link down here boxes

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.190 
before which I will link down here boxes
are<00:03:26.769> really<00:03:27.010> complicated<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.989> don't

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
are really complicated and you don't

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.120 
are really complicated and you don't
really<00:03:29.350> know<00:03:29.500> what<00:03:29.650> you're<00:03:29.739> gonna<00:03:29.829> get

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
really know what you're gonna get

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.759 
really know what you're gonna get
there's<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.790> higher<00:03:31.030> ammonia<00:03:31.570> content<00:03:32.109> so

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
there's a higher ammonia content so

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.349 
there's a higher ammonia content so
therefore<00:03:33.160> your<00:03:33.280> hair<00:03:33.489> strand<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:34.030> going<00:03:34.269> to

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
therefore your hair strand is going to

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.780 
therefore your hair strand is going to
be<00:03:34.480> blasted<00:03:35.200> more<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:35.739> as<00:03:36.489> you're<00:03:36.609> doing
