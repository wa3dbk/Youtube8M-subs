sylvans because I just don't see them on
you<00:00:16.740> Jia<00:00:16.920> Pro<00:00:17.100> it's<00:00:17.340> kind<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.580> weird

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910

I<00:00:17.940> still<00:00:18.570> have<00:00:18.750> cyber<00:00:18.960> dragons<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.500> other

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
I still have cyber dragons and other

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.400 
I still have cyber dragons and other
things<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.430> not<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.730> much<00:00:20.850> sylvans<00:00:21.410> I'm

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
things but not so much sylvans I'm

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.200 
things but not so much sylvans I'm
testing<00:00:22.859> out<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.160> course<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.580> newer<00:00:23.850> cards

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
testing out of course the newer cards

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.480 
testing out of course the newer cards
from<00:00:24.630> photon<00:00:25.439> galaxy<00:00:25.800> you'll<00:00:25.920> notice<00:00:26.160> me<00:00:26.279> kind

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
from photon galaxy you'll notice me kind

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.189 
from photon galaxy you'll notice me kind
of<00:00:26.550> reading<00:00:27.090> some<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.359> newer<00:00:27.480> cards<00:00:27.840> and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
of reading some of the newer cards and

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.660 
of reading some of the newer cards and
making<00:00:28.560> sure<00:00:28.800> I'm<00:00:29.039> using<00:00:29.220> them<00:00:29.490> correctly

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
making sure I'm using them correctly

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.299 
making sure I'm using them correctly
because<00:00:30.420> I'm<00:00:30.510> not<00:00:30.599> used<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.199> him<00:00:31.260> too<00:00:31.800> much<00:00:32.009> yet

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
because I'm not used to him too much yet

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.580 
because I'm not used to him too much yet
especially<00:00:32.520> at<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> time<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.210> video

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
especially at the time of this video

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.060 
especially at the time of this video
whenever<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.680> was<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.399> was<00:00:35.969> doing<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.840> duel<00:00:37.070> so

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
whenever I was I was doing this duel so

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.119 
whenever I was I was doing this duel so
yeah<00:00:38.660> I'm<00:00:39.660> still<00:00:39.989> testing<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.559> one<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:40.920> I'm

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
yeah I'm still testing this one out I'm

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.440 
yeah I'm still testing this one out I'm
not<00:00:41.309> sure<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> deck<00:00:41.730> profile<00:00:42.030> will<00:00:42.210> come

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
not sure if the deck profile will come

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.540 
not sure if the deck profile will come
before<00:00:42.600> or<00:00:42.930> after<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.469> I'm<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.190> know<00:00:44.280> count

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
before or after this I'm you know count

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.729 
before or after this I'm you know count
testing<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:44.910> consistent<00:00:45.390> seeing<00:00:45.570> stuff<00:00:45.750> and

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
testing out consistent seeing stuff and

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.930 
testing out consistent seeing stuff and
that<00:00:46.890> turn<00:00:47.100> right<00:00:47.250> there<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.460> probably

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
that turn right there I probably

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.430 
that turn right there I probably
shouldn't<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.420> went<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.899> galaxy-eyes

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
shouldn't have went for galaxy-eyes

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.799 
shouldn't have went for galaxy-eyes
searched<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.550> probably<00:00:51.120> better<00:00:51.449> go<00:00:51.600> for

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
searched for it probably better go for

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.490 
searched for it probably better go for
wizard<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:52.320> something<00:00:52.680> instead<00:00:52.890> because<00:00:54.500> yeah

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
wizard or something instead because yeah

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.139 
wizard or something instead because yeah
I<00:00:55.530> was<00:00:55.829> kind<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.039> thinking<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.730> could<00:00:56.940> draw

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
I was kind of thinking if I could draw

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.910 
I was kind of thinking if I could draw
the<00:00:57.210> baby<00:00:57.840> cloud<00:00:58.170> dragon<00:00:58.379> again<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.829> would

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the baby cloud dragon again that would

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.770 
the baby cloud dragon again that would
really<00:00:59.010> help<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.520> yeah<00:00:59.670> anyway<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.570> also

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
really help out but yeah anyway I also

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.090 
really help out but yeah anyway I also
go<00:01:01.020> ahead<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.289> for<00:01:01.469> Phil<00:01:01.620> Gramm<00:01:01.829> phil

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
go ahead and go for Phil Gramm phil

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.640 
go ahead and go for Phil Gramm phil
gramm's<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> safest<00:01:02.879> rank<00:01:03.120> 8<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.600> know<00:01:03.870> 62

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
gramm's like the safest rank 8 I know 62

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.140 
gramm's like the safest rank 8 I know 62
would<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.280> done<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> lot<00:01:05.489> more<00:01:05.549> damage<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
would have done a lot more damage and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.520 
would have done a lot more damage and
you<00:01:06.240> know<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.630> tachyons<00:01:07.020> really<00:01:07.260> good<00:01:07.409> as

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
you know and tachyons really good as

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.130 
you know and tachyons really good as
well<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.729> feel<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.060> Pell<00:01:09.240> grants<00:01:09.540> still

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
well but I feel like Pell grants still

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840 
well but I feel like Pell grants still
one<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.500> best<00:01:10.710> ranking<00:01:11.340> monsters<00:01:11.729> just

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
one of the best ranking monsters just

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.010 
one of the best ranking monsters just
because<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.420> don't<00:01:12.570> know<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:12.930> in

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
because I don't know what they have in

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.570 
because I don't know what they have in
their<00:01:13.110> hands<00:01:13.380> they<00:01:13.830> could<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.130> dark<00:01:14.340> hole

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
their hands they could have dark hole

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.640 
their hands they could have dark hole
they<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.270> there's<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.720> many<00:01:15.869> scenarios

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
they you know there's so many scenarios

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.810 
they you know there's so many scenarios
out<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:17.040> where<00:01:17.250> they<00:01:17.310> could<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.759> know

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
out there where they could just you know

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.030 
out there where they could just you know
destroy<00:01:18.270> me<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.080> wanted<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> go<00:01:19.830> ahead<00:01:19.890> and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
destroy me so I wanted to go ahead and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.230 
destroy me so I wanted to go ahead and
go<00:01:20.100> fell<00:01:20.310> ground<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.640> way<00:01:20.729> I'd<00:01:20.850> be<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> little

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
go fell ground that way I'd be a little

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.640 
go fell ground that way I'd be a little
bit<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.570> protected<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.229> wouldn't<00:01:22.439> end<00:01:22.530> up

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
bit more protected and wouldn't end up

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.859 
bit more protected and wouldn't end up
being<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.040> huge<00:01:23.280> mess<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.909> they<00:01:24.570> would<00:01:24.750> have

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
being in a huge mess if they would have

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.380 
being in a huge mess if they would have
something<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.259> dark<00:01:25.619> hole<00:01:26.119> even<00:01:27.119> though<00:01:27.270> it

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
something like dark hole even though it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.770 
something like dark hole even though it
is<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> bit<00:01:27.689> weaker<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.170> course<00:01:28.409> than<00:01:28.590> number<00:01:28.860> 62

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
is a bit weaker of course than number 62

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.210 
is a bit weaker of course than number 62

well using all of them you'll notice I'm
kind<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> reading<00:01:33.960> through<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> cards<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.770> on

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
kind of reading through the cards to on

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.039 
kind of reading through the cards to on
sylvans<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> make<00:01:35.820> sure<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.720> like

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
sylvans just to make sure you know like

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.420 
sylvans just to make sure you know like
I<00:01:37.110> said<00:01:37.170> haven't<00:01:37.409> played<00:01:37.590> them<00:01:37.740> really<00:01:38.040> too

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
I said haven't played them really too

I said haven't played them really too
much<00:01:38.579> before<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.299> kind<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.600> I'm<00:01:39.900> reading

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
much before so it's kind of I'm reading

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.510 
much before so it's kind of I'm reading
through<00:01:40.350> making<00:01:40.770> sure<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> understand<00:01:41.430> what

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
through making sure I understand what

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.130 
through making sure I understand what
they're<00:01:41.610> all<00:01:41.729> doing<00:01:41.880> right<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.899> don't

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
they're all doing right just so I don't

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.649 
they're all doing right just so I don't
miss<00:01:43.290> play<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.250> somehow<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.610> mess<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
miss play and like somehow I mess up and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.469 
miss play and like somehow I mess up and
get<00:01:45.810> myself<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.259> real<00:01:46.409> mess<00:01:47.149> just<00:01:48.149> warming

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
get myself in a real mess just warming

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.389 
get myself in a real mess just warming
the<00:01:48.570> field<00:01:48.780> though<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.259> crazy<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.979> don't<00:01:50.130> I

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
the field though like crazy I don't I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.469 
the field though like crazy I don't I
think<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.909> kind<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.270> different

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
think this is kind of a different

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.960 
think this is kind of a different
variants<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.079> sylvans<00:01:52.950> or<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.610> different

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
variants of sylvans or it's different

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.630 
variants of sylvans or it's different
than<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.750> I've<00:01:54.930> seen<00:01:55.399> before

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
than that I've seen before

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.889 
than that I've seen before
so<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.939> was<00:01:57.060> kind<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.240> interesting<00:01:57.420> though<00:01:57.719> I

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
so it was kind of interesting though I

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.300 
so it was kind of interesting though I
liked<00:01:58.229> how<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.409> was<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.619> bit<00:01:58.860> creative<00:01:59.159> it's

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
liked how it was a bit creative it's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.670 
liked how it was a bit creative it's
another<00:01:59.490> reason<00:01:59.670> why<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> wanted<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.680> upload

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
another reason why I wanted to upload

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.999 
another reason why I wanted to upload
this<00:02:01.799> duel<00:02:02.270> in<00:02:03.270> particular<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:04.200> was<00:02:04.770> reading

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
this duel in particular I was reading

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.289 
this duel in particular I was reading
over<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.280> when<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.460> bombs<00:02:05.729> that's<00:02:06.119> why<00:02:06.270> I

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
over that when this bombs that's why I

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.880 
over that when this bombs that's why I
was<00:02:06.479> reading<00:02:06.719> over<00:02:06.810> everything<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.740> that

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
was reading over everything because that

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.740 
was reading over everything because that
one<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.220> destroy<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.910> monster<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.539> field

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
one can destroy a monster in the field

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.690 
one can destroy a monster in the field
so<00:02:10.020> again<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.560> was<00:02:10.800> really<00:02:11.099> glad<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.489> chose

so again I was really glad that I chose

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.660 
so again I was really glad that I chose
fell<00:02:11.940> ground<00:02:12.180> because

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
fell ground because

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.089 
fell ground because
I'm<00:02:12.849> able<00:02:13.120> just<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.420> detention<00:02:14.290> material<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:14.890> go

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
I'm able just to detention material I go

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
use it later on a little easier and that

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.199

way I can protect fail grant you know

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.729 
way I can protect fail grant you know
use<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.510> effect<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:22.840> yourself<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.530> can't<00:02:23.709> be

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
use the effect on yourself you can't be

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.460 
use the effect on yourself you can't be
destroyed<00:02:24.040> by<00:02:24.130> cart<00:02:24.340> effects<00:02:24.610> although<00:02:25.470> they

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
destroyed by cart effects although they

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.830 
destroyed by cart effects although they
have<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.680> monster<00:02:26.890> that's<00:02:27.280> stronger<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:28.630> that's

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
have a monster that's stronger so that's

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.080 
have a monster that's stronger so that's
kind<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.350> negative<00:02:30.250> part<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:30.880> have

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
kind of the negative part to that I have

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.449 
kind of the negative part to that I have
a<00:02:31.450> lot<00:02:31.660> of<00:02:31.690> powerful<00:02:32.200> monsters<00:02:32.650> out<00:02:33.069> on<00:02:33.130> the

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
a lot of powerful monsters out on the

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.260 
a lot of powerful monsters out on the
field<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.480> it's<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.110> bit<00:02:35.350> scary<00:02:35.770> on<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:37.209> of

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
field so it's a bit scary on that so of

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.340 
field so it's a bit scary on that so of
course<00:02:37.390> Pell<00:02:37.600> grant<00:02:37.840> can't<00:02:38.050> keep<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.319> with

course Pell grant can't keep up with

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.770 
course Pell grant can't keep up with
that<00:02:39.090> unfortunately<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.450> know<00:02:40.540> it's<00:02:40.660> too<00:02:40.750> bad

just<00:03:40.870> kind<00:03:41.019> of<00:03:41.049> figure<00:03:41.260> out<00:03:41.290> why<00:03:41.470> not<00:03:41.620> go<00:03:41.769> ahead

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
just kind of figure out why not go ahead

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.420 
just kind of figure out why not go ahead
and<00:03:42.100> use<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:43.380> yeah<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.410> mean<00:03:44.590> 16<00:03:45.160> is<00:03:45.310> like

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
and use it and yeah I mean 16 is like

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.360 
and use it and yeah I mean 16 is like
the<00:03:45.549> longest<00:03:45.730> effect<00:03:46.239> ever<00:03:46.450> by<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.810> way<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:48.310> I

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
the longest effect ever by the way so I

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.280 
the longest effect ever by the way so I
go<00:03:48.489> ahead<00:03:48.820> use<00:03:49.120> its<00:03:49.299> ability<00:03:49.810> just<00:03:50.049> so<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.230> can

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.069 
and then destroy one of my monsters so
this<00:04:08.109> becomes<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.799> bit<00:04:09.010> of<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.220> problem<00:04:09.459> for<00:04:09.670> me

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
this becomes a bit of a problem for me

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.620 
this becomes a bit of a problem for me
because<00:04:11.079> with<00:04:11.950> that<00:04:12.220> of<00:04:12.430> course<00:04:12.609> yeah

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
because with that of course yeah

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.330 
because with that of course yeah
although<00:04:14.170> I<00:04:14.230> do<00:04:14.319> have<00:04:14.410> sort<00:04:14.769> of<00:04:14.799> a<00:04:14.920> Stardust

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
although I do have sort of a Stardust

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.009 
although I do have sort of a Stardust
ability<00:04:15.790> but<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.180> still<00:04:16.389> takes<00:04:16.600> I<00:04:16.780> believe

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
ability but that still takes I believe

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.009 
ability but that still takes I believe
like<00:04:17.200> two<00:04:17.440> turns<00:04:17.769> for<00:04:18.489> it<00:04:18.579> to<00:04:18.639> actually<00:04:19.060> come

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
like two turns for it to actually come

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.140 
like two turns for it to actually come
in<00:04:20.139> handy<00:04:20.289> it's<00:04:20.620> like<00:04:20.769> yeah<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.430> second<00:04:21.849> standby

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
in handy it's like yeah a second standby

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.060 
in handy it's like yeah a second standby
phase<00:04:22.330> after<00:04:22.479> activation<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.169> believe<00:04:23.380> so<00:04:24.039> that

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
phase after activation I believe so that

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.570 
phase after activation I believe so that
kind<00:04:24.520> of<00:04:24.550> put<00:04:24.669> me<00:04:24.760> in<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.880> mess

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
kind of put me in a mess

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.210 
kind of put me in a mess
other<00:04:26.479> than<00:04:26.539> that<00:04:26.599> though<00:04:26.810> he's<00:04:27.020> able<00:04:27.379> to<00:04:27.650> swim

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
other than that though he's able to swim

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.830 
other than that though he's able to swim
the<00:04:28.340> field<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.639> get<00:04:28.819> a<00:04:28.970> few<00:04:29.270> more<00:04:29.419> cards<00:04:29.690> out
