 to complete it 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.429
 what does m 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.299
 the minor 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.829
 they are 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.829
 we're going to have a pain again 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:47.899

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:49.729
 12 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.019
 then there is the g20 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.659
 a year

 The balance 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.639
 monday m 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.659
 here I am disappointed 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.790
 so the hardest of this field does not ring is the rhythmic so I'm going 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.359
 try to explain to you% 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.609
 two different techniques imprinted with those using angeles 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.409
 for the first time 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.409
 so that I threw like that 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.809
 the exit 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:33.080
 the man 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.279
 he speaks 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:37.010
 then I charge a parent 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.150
 ben ammar 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.149
 that's parent 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:43.149
 reims marne 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.409
 programmed at the club 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.059
 the coupe c6 and c5 all the time 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.439
 ben ammar 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.689
 no 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:01.939
 Paris 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.169
 but we do not leave 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.169
 however, it was said that at that time 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.769
 as a result rip iran to our way of playing it c 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.309
 by fear 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:27.309
 for me 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.360
 that in the world so friends that at that time 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.830
 Darques 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.969
 what 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:48.419
 the others I repeat c 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.740
 the barca 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.659
 3 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.559
 see the day is the one that has you most 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:56.469
 as well as for the referais 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.479
 me it's a little different it's the same rhythmic 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.399
 but for that it will have to turn in the right place on the corsa so 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.470
 there it stuck the chorus grieve leave so it's a little bit of his cause 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:08.550
 once 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.590
 and after a health abandonment I left my 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.419
 I left 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.559
 in fact on the parking lot either in the back 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:23.229
 baroin 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.309
 Paris 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:27.309
 so 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.819
 In the evening 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:33.699
 o'hare 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.050
 we do not know if I was clear 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.050
 otherwise there are also damas 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:48.609
