what<00:00:18.900> looks<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.289> me<00:00:19.529> like<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.740> fairly

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
what looks to me like a fairly

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.029 
what looks to me like a fairly
compelling<00:00:20.730> demo<00:00:21.090> here<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.750> I've<00:00:22.529> heard<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
compelling demo here so I've heard the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.529 
compelling demo here so I've heard the
argument<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.730> can't<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.210> tell<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
argument that you can't really tell the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.050 
argument that you can't really tell the
difference<00:00:24.570> between<00:00:25.019> 1080p<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.160> 4k<00:00:26.490> and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
difference between 1080p and 4k and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.120 
difference between 1080p and 4k and
while<00:00:27.480> at<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> very<00:00:28.109> sort<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.769> far<00:00:29.010> away

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
while at a very sort of far away

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.020 
while at a very sort of far away
distance<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:30.390> much<00:00:30.720> may<00:00:30.990> be<00:00:31.050> true<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.030> while

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
distance that much may be true and while

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.330 
distance that much may be true and while
these<00:00:33.270> may<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.809> little<00:00:34.230> bit<00:00:34.440> exaggerated

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
these may be a little bit exaggerated

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.610 
these may be a little bit exaggerated
because<00:00:35.550> their<00:00:35.969> 86<00:00:36.300> inch<00:00:36.870> televisions<00:00:37.469> which

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
because their 86 inch televisions which

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.260 
because their 86 inch televisions which
I<00:00:37.710> think<00:00:37.890> most<00:00:38.070> people<00:00:38.370> aren't<00:00:38.489> running<00:00:38.700> bear

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
I think most people aren't running bear

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.869 
I think most people aren't running bear
in<00:00:39.390> mind<00:00:39.570> guys<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.260> already<00:00:40.500> get<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> 55

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
in mind guys you can already get a 55

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.580 
in mind guys you can already get a 55
inch<00:00:41.910> TV<00:00:42.300> for<00:00:42.480> around<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.020> thousand<00:00:43.469> dollar

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
inch TV for around that thousand dollar

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.650 
inch TV for around that thousand dollar
price<00:00:43.860> points<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:45.030> could<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.270> sooner

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
price points so this could be sooner

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.310 
price points so this could be sooner
than<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.930> think<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:47.129> check<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.460> out<00:00:48.200> you<00:00:49.200> may

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
than you think so check this out you may

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.779 
than you think so check this out you may
have<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.500> zoom<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.129> order<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> make<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
have to zoom in in order to make the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.180 
have to zoom in in order to make the
point<00:00:50.969> from<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.780> cameras<00:00:52.140> perspective<00:00:52.350> we've

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
point from the cameras perspective we've

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.590 
point from the cameras perspective we've
got<00:00:53.370> slick<00:00:53.640> operating<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> camera<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.539> course

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
got slick operating the camera of course

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.750 
got slick operating the camera of course
so<00:00:54.870> look<00:00:56.539> all<00:00:57.539> right<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> 4k<00:00:58.469> TV<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.399> our

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
so look all right so the 4k TV is on our

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.569 
so look all right so the 4k TV is on our
left<00:00:59.969> from<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.199> distance<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.070> guess<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.399> must

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
left from a distance of I guess I must

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.700 
left from a distance of I guess I must
be<00:01:02.640> about<00:01:02.789> 2<00:01:03.090> meters<00:01:03.359> away<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:04.229> comfortably

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
be about 2 meters away I can comfortably

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.980 
be about 2 meters away I can comfortably
read<00:01:05.100> text<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.700> something<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> newspaper

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
read text in something like a newspaper

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.429 
read text in something like a newspaper
article<00:01:07.590> however<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.270> 1080p<00:01:09.720> version<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
article however on the 1080p version the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.010 
article however on the 1080p version the
text<00:01:10.860> has<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> lot<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.610> interpolation<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.840> it's

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
text has a lot of interpolation so it's

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.370 
text has a lot of interpolation so it's
very<00:01:13.229> very<00:01:13.380> difficult<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:14.220> read<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.180> if<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
very very difficult to read so if the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.020 
very very difficult to read so if the
point<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.830> we're<00:01:17.040> trying<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.460> make<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.850> that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
point that we're trying to make is that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.330 
point that we're trying to make is that
it's<00:01:18.210> sharper<00:01:18.740> especially<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> static

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it's sharper especially for a static

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.420 
it's sharper especially for a static
image<00:01:20.430> then<00:01:21.119> point<00:01:21.900> taken<00:01:22.080> Sony<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.799> hard<00:01:23.310> to

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
image then point taken Sony it's hard to

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.620 
image then point taken Sony it's hard to
say<00:01:23.580> how<00:01:23.729> much<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.060> difference<00:01:24.360> you'll<00:01:24.509> be

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
say how much of a difference you'll be

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.149 
say how much of a difference you'll be
able<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.930> tell<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.409> full<00:01:25.619> motion<00:01:25.799> video
