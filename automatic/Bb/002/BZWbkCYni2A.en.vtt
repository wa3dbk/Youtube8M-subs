00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.519
 good afternoon, evening, and indeed any 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.809
 other time of day dear friends with you 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.299
 review zar 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.670
 very soon I set sail by train 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.520
 aeroflot and know before this 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.340
 I was seriously puzzled by the fact 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.300
 what games should you bring some 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.590
 will say well you go to rest coco to 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.449
 to rest 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.669
 but maybe for me the rest is 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.440
 play by the sea or in the yard though 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.420
 a normal person would play 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.090
 bar and in general can be my rest 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.700
 lies in a new setting so or 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.399
 otherwise I decided to present you as myself 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.860
 called the top five traveler and in 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.230
 the next minute you will find out what games 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.460
 for which platforms I would recommend 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.039
 take a trip 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.280
 well, or in extreme cases, rest immediately 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.440
 I would like to say that you did not speak 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.469
 why is this game standing in that place my 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.449
 favorite last places per se in 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.820
 this top will not be at least because 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.299
 games for the most part for different 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.299
 platforms with it understood then went 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.030
 So let's start with one of the most 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.190
 popular platforms namely psp for 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.610
 I recommend this wonderful console 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.320
 you take burnout legends or dominoes and 2 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.229
 better take both 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.420
 I think these are just amazing games. 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.430
 different types of competitions huge 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.530
 the number of cars from the simplest to 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.370
 totally insane like for example 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.290
 Machine mafia games are not very annoying 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.090
 which allows you to stick on them 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.380
 several hours in a row 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.570
 also this mouth is accompanied by a mouth and 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.450
 the destruction of cars by opponents though rock 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.540
 and elimination is observed in every part 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.360
 this wonderful series in general be you 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.650
 in the plane or in the bus or the devil knows 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.280
 where else 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.430
 put on your headphones and nothing can 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.430
 to distract 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.230
 maybe someone is traveling from peak 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.730
 just for these people the next place 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.250
 only recently in the incentive on sale 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.950
 bought a red alert 3 this one probably 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.560
 of the best purchases in my life game 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.470
 completely in Russian and how can it be 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.260
 not in Russian if there is incomparable 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.290
 General Secretary Shcherbinka performed by Tim Curry 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.830
 and the hook general played by andrew 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.470
 divoff 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.620
 before the videos the same time actors it 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.870
 what distinguishes the comand and conqure series from 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.540
 other strategies in games exist 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.940
 such a thing as cranberry krukova 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.519
 this is the term for the most stereotypes 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.800
 and representations of us trans about the Russians 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.580
 and also their embodiment in everyones 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.620
 foreign films and games books and 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.989
 however so here it is cranberries 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.340
 extended to all three fractions a 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:11.430
 It is the USSR alliance with the United States and the Empire 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.500
 the rising sun she is japan what 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.500
 sometimes delivers huge lulz 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.140
 in general, beautiful in my opinion 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.290
 mechanic with interesting and unusual 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.630
 the plot of which you are nowhere exactly 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.440
 will find me this game is unsettled 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.330
 the usual things hours for 20 or even more 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.450
 if you like the same as me 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.940
 there is something special for you 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.950
 supplement called a pricing 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.560
 which gives play for japanese 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.260
 Special Agent Eureka Omega 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.960
 provides three missions for each of 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.300
 parties to the conflict sale incentive already 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.990
 unfortunately ended the game costs about 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.690
 300 rubles without a supplement but if something 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.860
 I think you will find a way to get her 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.860
 this is peck 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.160
 if you have playstation vita then 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.590
 inapplicable take with you and most importantly yourself 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.990
 chart ladies Mortal Kombat he hell 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.010
 will give you a sea of ​​emotions even if you 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.160
 already passed 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.380
 the game before that and more than once it is of course 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.360
 not minekravtov where if you start a new 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.090
 the game is amir pepper and again but also 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.010
 very very cool guys from the left 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.590
 studios but supervised white dock 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.740
 did a great gameplay with nothing 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.110
 inferior to the original on ps3 besides 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.600
 mine is great to play adventure 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.130
 when you yourself are practically in 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.620
 adventures some recursion turns out 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.810
 but what mortal kombat think that this 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.850
 the game needs no introduction 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.130
 just want to say that the game is pretty 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.380
 popular probability that anyone 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.740
 will consoles mortal kombat pretty 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.740
 high 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.070
 And finally, to download this 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.640
 if you say usual iphone or 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.970
 ipad 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:11.270
 or something on android I would answer 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.670
 just swing gata vaysiti 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.670
 roses as if in good old 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.280
 times create a playlist with your 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.830
 favorite music and drive from the police 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.400
 favorite sports car or perform 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.980
 missions 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.410
 nobody has the right to forbid it 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.420
 the same game with Russian subtitles and 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.180
 perhaps the most important thing 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.560
 special difficulty helicopter mission 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.560
 does not cause 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.229
