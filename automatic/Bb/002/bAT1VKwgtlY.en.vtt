00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.140 
to the north you want to bring you want
to<00:01:31.890> save<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> few<00:01:32.340> Wizards<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.759> don't<00:01:32.909> recommend

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
to save a few Wizards I don't recommend

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.660 
to save a few Wizards I don't recommend
saving<00:01:33.479> quite<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:34.020> many<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.470> mmm<00:01:35.159> did<00:01:35.400> here

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
saving quite as many as mmm did here

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.140 
saving quite as many as mmm did here
he's<00:01:36.540> saved<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.990> think<00:01:37.200> eight<00:01:37.380> wizards<00:01:38.150> but

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
he's saved I think eight wizards but

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.149 
he's saved I think eight wizards but
even<00:01:39.270> saving<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.960> four<00:01:40.320> actually<00:01:40.710> would<00:01:41.040> do

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
even saving like four actually would do

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.770 
even saving like four actually would do
the<00:01:41.310> trick<00:01:41.340> as<00:01:41.790> they're<00:01:42.270> going<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.600> able<00:01:42.659> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the trick as they're going to be able to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.420 
the trick as they're going to be able to
pick<00:01:42.899> off<00:01:43.110> these<00:01:43.320> outlying<00:01:43.770> buildings<00:01:44.070> now

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
pick off these outlying buildings now

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.460 
pick off these outlying buildings now
this<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> type<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.000> strategy<00:01:45.329> they're<00:01:46.229> not

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
this is a type of strategy they're not

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.230 
this is a type of strategy they're not
necessarily<00:01:46.649> going<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.640> want<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.970> wait<00:01:48.119> till

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
necessarily going to want to wait till

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.850 
necessarily going to want to wait till
the<00:01:48.360> very<00:01:48.540> end<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.990> snipe<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.500> might<00:01:49.649> might

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the very end to snipe you might might

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.410 
the very end to snipe you might might
want<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.189> some<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.520> sniping<00:01:51.000> during

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
want to do some of your sniping during

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.330 
want to do some of your sniping during
the<00:01:51.570> raid<00:01:51.960> because<00:01:52.590> they'll<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.920> golem

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
the raid because they'll have golem

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.940 
the raid because they'll have golem
cover<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> edges<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.869> very<00:01:55.229> nice<00:01:55.409> radius

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
cover on the edges so very nice radius

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.139 
cover on the edges so very nice radius
maintenance<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> pick<00:01:56.640> off<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.939> last

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
maintenance to pick off that last

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.999 
maintenance to pick off that last
percentage<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.560> want<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.770> bring<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
percentage there and I want to bring you

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.039 
percentage there and I want to bring you
a<00:01:59.100> couple<00:01:59.399> more<00:01:59.579> raids<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.000> one<00:02:00.210> against<00:02:00.689> me

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
a couple more raids this one against me

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.649 
a couple more raids this one against me
yours<00:02:01.439> truly<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.360> one<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.570> my

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
yours truly so this is one of my

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.840 
yours truly so this is one of my
favorite<00:02:03.990> bases<00:02:04.170> as<00:02:04.380> i<00:02:04.469> said<00:02:04.680> before<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:05.670> it

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
favorite bases as i said before but it

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.580 
favorite bases as i said before but it
is<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> little<00:02:06.390> vulnerable<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.200> double

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
is a little vulnerable to this double

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.800 
is a little vulnerable to this double
jump<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.190> must<00:02:08.849> admit<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.300> got<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.509> little

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
jump but I must admit you got a little

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.559 
jump but I must admit you got a little
lucky<00:02:10.140> at<00:02:10.379> least<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.770> think<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.390> see

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
lucky at least I think so you can see

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.340 
lucky at least I think so you can see
he's<00:02:12.750> using

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
he's using

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.600 
he's using
I've<00:02:13.440> columns<00:02:13.860> here<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> only<00:02:14.490> difference

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
I've columns here so the only difference

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.050 
I've columns here so the only difference
in<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.210> strategy<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:16.620> five<00:02:17.460> columns<00:02:17.910> and

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
in this strategy is five columns and

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.180 
in this strategy is five columns and
extra<00:02:18.510> which<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.140> minus<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.800> packet<00:02:20.130> from

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
extra which and minus the packet from

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.460 
extra which and minus the packet from
the<00:02:20.340> first<00:02:20.550> video<00:02:20.820> so<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.840> see<00:02:22.050> as<00:02:22.230> much

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
the first video so you can see as much

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.770 
the first video so you can see as much
less<00:02:22.740> Wizards<00:02:23.220> as<00:02:23.340> well<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> lower

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
less Wizards as well so a lower

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.930 
less Wizards as well so a lower
concentration<00:02:25.310> he<00:02:26.310> does<00:02:26.490> have<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.700> pec<00:02:26.820> in

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
concentration he does have the pec in

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.610 
concentration he does have the pec in
the<00:02:27.000> clan<00:02:27.180> castle<00:02:27.210> my<00:02:27.630> fault<00:02:27.900> but<00:02:28.410> lower

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
the clan castle my fault but lower

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
the clan castle my fault but lower
concentration<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.670> wizards<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:31.490> damage<00:02:32.490> per

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
concentration of wizards and damage per

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.580 
concentration of wizards and damage per
second<00:02:33.000> unit<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.510> can<00:02:33.630> see<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:33.900> second

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
second unit so you can see that second

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.680 
second unit so you can see that second
jump<00:02:34.890> spell<00:02:35.160> right<00:02:35.490> on<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.030> Inferno<00:02:36.450> tower

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
jump spell right on that Inferno tower

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.320 
jump spell right on that Inferno tower
now<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.080> second<00:02:37.470> jump<00:02:37.740> spell<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.250> really<00:02:39.210> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
now that second jump spell is really the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.630 
now that second jump spell is really the
make-or-break<00:02:39.810> point<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.680> these<00:02:40.890> raids<00:02:41.250> guys

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
make-or-break point in these raids guys

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.300 
make-or-break point in these raids guys
because<00:02:42.540> where<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.380> put<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.680> gem<00:02:43.950> spill<00:02:44.220> is

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
because where you put that gem spill is

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.010 
because where you put that gem spill is
going<00:02:44.460> to<00:02:44.520> dictate<00:02:44.670> exactly<00:02:45.060> where<00:02:45.870> your

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
going to dictate exactly where your

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.410 
going to dictate exactly where your
troops<00:02:46.350> go<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.340> if<00:02:47.460> you<00:02:47.580> drop<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:47.880> too<00:02:48.210> far

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
troops go so if you drop it too far

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.480 
troops go so if you drop it too far
south<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:49.020> can<00:02:49.200> split<00:02:49.650> your<00:02:49.680> troops<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.340> this

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
south you can split your troops in this

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.330 
south you can split your troops in this
example<00:02:50.880> if<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.780> drop<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.050> too<00:02:52.350> far<00:02:52.560> north<00:02:52.920> you

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
example if you drop it too far north you

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.340 
example if you drop it too far north you
could<00:02:53.640> just<00:02:53.970> take<00:02:54.510> them<00:02:54.660> away<00:02:54.870> from<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.170> Town

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
could just take them away from the Town

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.520 
could just take them away from the Town
Hall<00:02:55.380> too<00:02:55.890> much<00:02:56.100> now<00:02:56.990> this<00:02:57.990> jump<00:02:58.350> was

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
Hall too much now this jump was

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.620 
Hall too much now this jump was
perfectly<00:02:59.010> executed<00:02:59.550> as<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.240> didn't<00:03:00.450> go<00:03:00.570> too

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
perfectly executed as it didn't go too

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.750 
perfectly executed as it didn't go too
far<00:03:00.960> south<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.860> really<00:03:02.100> want<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.400> just<00:03:02.490> plan

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
far south you really want to just plan

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.880 
far south you really want to just plan
out<00:03:03.060> your<00:03:03.090> jump<00:03:03.450> spell<00:03:03.720> before<00:03:03.930> going<00:03:04.350> in<00:03:04.710> in

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
out your jump spell before going in in

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.040 
out your jump spell before going in in
your<00:03:05.040> head<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.550> when<00:03:06.360> you're<00:03:06.480> planning<00:03:06.930> your

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
your head and when you're planning your

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.330 
your head and when you're planning your
jump<00:03:07.290> spell<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.680> things<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.040> want<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.280> think

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
jump spell the things you want to think

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.410 
jump spell the things you want to think
about<00:03:08.640> are<00:03:09.500> okay<00:03:10.500> what<00:03:11.070> other<00:03:11.340> walls<00:03:11.730> could<00:03:12.270> my

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
about are okay what other walls could my

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.420 
about are okay what other walls could my
troops<00:03:12.750> be<00:03:12.930> lured<00:03:13.200> into<00:03:13.470> other<00:03:13.920> than<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.220> wall

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
troops be lured into other than the wall

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.070 
troops be lured into other than the wall
I<00:03:14.460> don't<00:03:14.970> want<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.450> other<00:03:15.720> than<00:03:15.840> while<00:03:16.050> I

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
I don't want that other than while I

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.010 
I don't want that other than while I
want<00:03:16.410> them<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.710> go<00:03:16.860> over<00:03:17.250> right<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.390> lot<00:03:18.990> of

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
want them to go over right so a lot of

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.390 
want them to go over right so a lot of
people<00:03:19.110> plan<00:03:19.500> their<00:03:19.530> jump<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.100> they<00:03:20.160> plan

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
people plan their jump and they plan

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.430 
people plan their jump and they plan
exactly<00:03:20.760> where<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.150> put<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:21.600> they<00:03:22.110> they
