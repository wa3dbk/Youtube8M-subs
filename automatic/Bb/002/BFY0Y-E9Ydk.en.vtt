not like and wanted house but it's it is

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.440 
not like and wanted house but it's it is
if<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.649> makes<00:00:34.890> sense<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:36.090> i<00:00:36.120> mean<00:00:36.270> by

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
if that makes sense so what i mean by

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.090 
if that makes sense so what i mean by
this<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.079> come<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.530> house<00:00:37.800> and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
this is you come to this house and

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.880 
this is you come to this house and
there's<00:00:38.370> nothing<00:00:38.550> special<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.379> just<00:00:40.379> after

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
there's nothing special but just after

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.369 
there's nothing special but just after
six<00:00:41.219> o'clock<00:00:41.399> that's<00:00:41.910> 1800<00:00:42.780> hours<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.230> says

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
six o'clock that's 1800 hours it says

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.860 
six o'clock that's 1800 hours it says
1807<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.610> that's<00:00:44.789> maybe<00:00:44.969> when<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> spawns<00:00:45.629> in

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
1807 so that's maybe when it spawns in

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
1807 so that's maybe when it spawns in
and<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.950> lasts<00:00:47.460> till<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.469> think<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.620> four

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and it lasts till like I think like four

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.350 
and it lasts till like I think like four
in<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> morning<00:00:50.520> or<00:00:50.640> something<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.180> so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
in the morning or something like that so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.380

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
how that you just walk into them and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.380 
how that you just walk into them and
they<00:01:52.320> die<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.280> your<00:01:53.520> death<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:54.180> that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
makes sense you know death that the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.219 
makes sense you know death that the
character<00:01:57.149> we're<00:01:57.420> not<00:01:57.540> character<00:01:57.960> there

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
character we're not character there

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.969
