00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
vacuuming right so I do believe it is

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.359 
vacuuming right so I do believe it is
part<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.360> our<00:01:21.509> responsibility<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:22.530> humans<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
part of our responsibility as humans to

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.149 
part of our responsibility as humans to
when<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.360> try<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> make<00:01:25.170> others<00:01:25.590> happy<00:01:25.619> if

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
when we can try to make others happy if

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.710 
when we can try to make others happy if
we<00:01:26.310> are<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.580> after<00:01:26.759> yourself<00:01:27.270> someone

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
recently told me that the greatest piece

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.760 
recently told me that the greatest piece
of<00:01:30.689> advice<00:01:30.840> they<00:01:31.290> got<00:01:31.530> was<00:01:31.920> even<00:01:32.490> on

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
of advice they got was even on

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.550 
of advice they got was even on
worse<00:01:32.979> day<00:01:33.430> try<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.450> make<00:01:34.689> it<00:01:34.929> a<00:01:35.049> good<00:01:35.289> day<00:01:35.500> for

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
someone else and I thought that was such

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.560 
someone else and I thought that was such
a<00:01:37.780> great<00:01:38.399> philosophy<00:01:39.399> because<00:01:39.789> there's<00:01:40.090> too

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
a great philosophy because there's too

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.169 
a great philosophy because there's too
much<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:41.469> happens<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.219> not<00:01:42.399> at<00:01:42.579> least<00:01:42.729> speed

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
much that happens to not at least speed

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.779 
much that happens to not at least speed
