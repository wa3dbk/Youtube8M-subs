00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.049
 hello there is alchemy and the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.730
 Powerful song How to become a partner 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.059
 However, it is not ready yet 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.059
 but now I just say it now 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.059
 withdraw 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.699
 so and the punch or who that 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:31.050
 a part worked and the same 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 for example that works 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.199
 now there is me the instructions to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:43.219
 and 200 air masses and then work 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.629
 48 rhine so keep town 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.039
 Of course, the timetables cut you down 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.719
 want them if that will make easy 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.739
 strike market and customer 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.619
 and if you just totally enjoy it 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:59.219
 the 49 travels to you there you leave 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:03.510
 before that, see half- bars and free 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.390
 start only at the 11 that you hold 90 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.229
 Chopsticks have it over it 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.509
 fiftieth row then take the story 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.009
 then women therefore two stitches off so 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:21.119
 to determine the 86 and 180 mesh and 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.780
 the 88 280 ahead together again 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.659
 then again we have at the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.149
 all the frostiest Rhenish if that 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.560
 now believe in me 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:35.880
 so you have the second and third 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.910
 some just put the 250 straight together 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.819
 The disaster of the Rector 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:46.500
 but hector would become entrepreneur again 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:51.420
 Although mesh so if the 380 00 84 and 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.330
 the 85 0 664 develops then we have 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.209
 the 53 3 is then again and again 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.910
 make whether in the four- fiftieth 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:02.929
 to do it again and it makes you share 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.769
 the most expensive yet is pink 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:09.390
 and then the blue ones around 

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:12.050
 directly to me just completely normal without 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.050
 decrease 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.200
 so now we have the two blue ones in 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.140
 as normal and take there 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.160
 also mesh but in the first 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.290
 row orleans only every two to one whole 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.170
 to explore and then we have 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.170
 again in the 290 people 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.570
 so as 190 humans as loÃŸmann of it 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.080
 make five stitches and catch the sixth 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.760
 mesh without the spaces therefore chopsticks 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.800
 come back and forth and 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.020
 jonsdorf made everything by hand 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.900
 in a color of course what you want 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.070
 and the other will be back in there 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.750
 makes me back now altogether 48 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.210
 down and then our job is 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.370
 just as finished sets assets and 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.410
 then the whole thread will be heard 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.950
 yes and then ready something small 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.950
 continues 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.260
 we have our finished part on the 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.330
 back 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.670
 that's the side over the threads 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.420
 landlord so longer on the beautiful 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.200
 pages 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:31.489
 then the style is simply worse 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.069
 including that the blue is around it 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.239
 is it our middle he is from it 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.500
 section and fold the counting machine 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:43.430
 you could still think you left 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.549
 inside and then there is on it and 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.850
 so we can now village the rantumer 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.790
 have taken on it and the 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.489
 plug or more have that hit next 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.110
 and cut this to our homes and 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.110
 I'll say it until then 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:11.099
 so i have my porsche now 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.400
 he sewed down so far he is too 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:19.919
 Well finished and on the neckline 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:26.419
 about 80 masses recorded all around and 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.419
 have had three rows firm 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.890
 so 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.660
 Of course, our porsche are at the 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:54.090
 This year's pretty practical and hood 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:57.380
 although I now have 30 air masses option 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:04.620
 and but the rooms worked chopsticks 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:06.710
 has then altogether until 41 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.150
 incorporated 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:15.330
 the edge is already calculated 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:18.780
 because the 30 meshes and the last four 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.840
 that's why it's got rome there 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.930
 taken off so it has the back out like 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.560
 it was a dwarf cap but with it the 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.970
 I have a rounding 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:36.630
 I have two stitches in each row 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.970
 from number and so there is the round 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.250
 and of course the whole weather unfortunately 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.660
 device or crochet better said 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.100
 to which he has since risen again and 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.250
 thanks always with the rows down 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.090
 so that it looks exactly like that again 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.520
 like the other one 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.980
 the other side then we take that 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:01.700
 all back there to have a great hood 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.700
 then look like this 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:10.520
 Now the hood was on my ground 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.520
 go and then re-election 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:23.619
 so far is now ready and at one 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:26.459
 moped is actually not so much 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:40.269
 how I tie in front of the camera but 

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:43.889
 Just having fun and I'm looking forward to it 

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:43.889
 the next home ready for the 8th
