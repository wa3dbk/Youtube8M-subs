00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.669 
very essential and once in a good old
fence<00:00:12.240> system<00:00:12.660> but<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:12.900> also<00:00:13.110> be<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> cheese

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
fence system but it also be a cheese

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.950 
fence system but it also be a cheese
when<00:00:13.950> used<00:00:14.160> by<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.370> wrong<00:00:14.610> place<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.809> when<00:00:15.929> I

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
when used by the wrong place and when I

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.359 
when used by the wrong place and when I
say<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> wrong<00:00:16.470> play<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.740> say<00:00:16.980> those<00:00:17.130> plays

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
whole game and it's very possible to do

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.060 
whole game and it's very possible to do
so<00:00:21.359> because<00:00:21.619> people<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.740> there's<00:00:22.920> people

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
so because people that there's people

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.859 
so because people that there's people
that<00:00:23.220> set<00:00:23.519> plays<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.060> lead<00:00:24.210> pass<00:00:24.449> and

that set plays for the lead pass and
this<00:00:25.289> be<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:25.830> can<00:00:26.160> find<00:00:26.550> how<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.730> do

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
this be what I just can find how to do

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.250 
this be what I just can find how to do
all<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.210> time<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.630> also<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.930> give-and-go

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
all the time and is also the give-and-go

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.500 
all the time and is also the give-and-go
which<00:00:28.560> leads<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:28.980> leappad<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:30.330> lot

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
which leads to the leappad and a lot

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.669 
which leads to the leappad and a lot
even<00:00:30.689> though<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> give-and-go<00:00:31.230> that's<00:00:31.529> when

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
even though the give-and-go that's when

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.889 
even though the give-and-go that's when
it<00:00:31.769> also<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> cheese<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.550> too<00:00:32.600> so<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
it also the cheese is too so the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.560 
it also the cheese is too so the
federally<00:00:34.410> bleep<00:00:34.739> passing<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.610> system<00:00:36.300> I

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
federally bleep passing is a system I

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.380 
federally bleep passing is a system I
would<00:00:36.719> say<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.320> defend<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.980> when<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.090> see

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
would say this to defend it when you see

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.540 
would say this to defend it when you see
somebody<00:00:39.960> cutting<00:00:40.440> towards<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.920> basket<00:00:41.399> or

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
also you can try playing the zone try to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.910 
also you can try playing the zone try to
play<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.270> 131<00:01:12.869> zone<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.409> person<00:01:13.799> we

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
play in a 131 zone on the person we

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.359 
play in a 131 zone on the person we
passed<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.340> depth<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:16.189> that<00:01:17.189> should

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
passed you the depth and that should

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.980 
passed you the depth and that should
work<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:17.880> once<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.180> once<00:01:18.570> everyone<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
work so then once you once everyone is

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.990 
work so then once you once everyone is
very<00:01:19.259> effective<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> pats<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.850> it's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
very effective on the pats and and it's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.300 
very effective on the pats and and it's
it<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:22.020> um<00:01:22.200> disrupts<00:01:22.710> their<00:01:22.860> they're<00:01:23.159> all

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
it really um disrupts their they're all

it really um disrupts their they're all
offensive<00:01:23.700> scheme<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.180> give<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.960> playing

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
offensive scheme I give you playing

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.050 
offensive scheme I give you playing
somebody<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:26.070> doesn't<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.549> all<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.850> time

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
somebody that doesn't do all the time

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.600 
somebody that doesn't do all the time
that<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.390> know<00:01:27.630> then<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.460> is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that you know then you think that is

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.910 
that you know then you think that is
that's<00:01:29.759> cool<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.900> will<00:01:31.049> work<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.740> not

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that's cool it will work but it's not

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.100 
that's cool it will work but it's not
