I'm saying there's not a scratch on it
got<00:00:22.199> all<00:00:22.560> three<00:00:22.859> whole<00:00:23.100> heads<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.580> it

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
got all three whole heads with it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.679 
got all three whole heads with it
it's<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.869> rattler<00:00:25.199> hp6<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.220> diamond<00:00:26.880> hone<00:00:27.150> with

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
it's a rattler hp6 a diamond hone with

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.220 
it's a rattler hp6 a diamond hone with
water<00:00:28.019> soluble<00:00:28.349> oil<00:00:29.599> what's<00:00:30.599> nice<00:00:30.779> about<00:00:30.810> this

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
water soluble oil what's nice about this

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.639 
water soluble oil what's nice about this
hone<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.859> actually<00:00:32.040> sit<00:00:32.489> finish<00:00:33.239> loads

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
hone is we can actually sit finish loads

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.110 
hone is we can actually sit finish loads
so<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.950> roughing<00:00:35.340> loads<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
so in roughing loads this is in the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.610 
so in roughing loads this is in the
roughing<00:00:36.420> load<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.899> when<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.140> thing<00:00:37.260> feeds

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
roughing load so when this thing feeds

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.549 
roughing load so when this thing feeds
around<00:00:37.829> here<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.219> hits<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.520> zero<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:40.350> goes

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
around here and hits a zero here it goes

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.520 
around here and hits a zero here it goes
down<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> finishing<00:00:42.030> load<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.230> actually

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
down to a finishing load we can actually

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.479 
down to a finishing load we can actually
set<00:00:44.010> where<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.280> want<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.579> stop<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.600> home

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
set where we want to stop the home

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.760 
set where we want to stop the home
honing<00:00:47.489> axe<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.000> other<00:00:48.090> words<00:00:48.440> we<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.559> set

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
honing axe so in other words we can set

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.590 
honing axe so in other words we can set
a<00:00:49.800> roughing<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.280> finish<00:00:50.579> loading<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.180> this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
a roughing and finish loading and this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.150 
a roughing and finish loading and this
is<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> only<00:00:51.960> home<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> industry<00:00:53.039> that
