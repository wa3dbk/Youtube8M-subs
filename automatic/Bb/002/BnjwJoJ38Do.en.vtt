differently I wouldn't have thought so
and<00:01:43.860> I've<00:01:44.009> seen<00:01:44.369> some<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.000> footage

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
and I've seen some of this footage

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.469 
and I've seen some of this footage
myself<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.670> struck<00:01:47.670> me<00:01:47.729> about<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.270> was

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
myself and what struck me about it was

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.109 
myself and what struck me about it was
the<00:01:48.810> way<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.649> appeared<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> change<00:01:50.610> color

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the way that it appeared to change color

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.719 
the way that it appeared to change color
at<00:01:51.720> some<00:01:52.079> stage<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.159> that's<00:01:53.399> quite

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
at some stage and that's quite

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.789 
at some stage and that's quite
interesting<00:01:53.939> i<00:01:54.390> mean<00:01:54.540> i<00:01:54.600> think<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:54.930> ever<00:01:55.200> one

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
interesting i mean i think as ever one

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.709 
interesting i mean i think as ever one
would<00:01:56.009> need<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.640> hold<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.240> original

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
would need to get hold of the original

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.289 
would need to get hold of the original
camera<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.649> original<00:01:59.100> film<00:01:59.430> footage<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.149> do

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
camera the original film footage and do

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.289 
camera the original film footage and do
some<00:02:00.509> proper<00:02:01.130> forensic<00:02:02.130> analysis<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.969> get<00:02:03.149> to

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
some proper forensic analysis to get to

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.789 
some proper forensic analysis to get to
the<00:02:03.390> bottom<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.680> certainly

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the bottom of it but it's it's certainly

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.010 
the bottom of it but it's it's certainly
interesting<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.360> say<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.719> fact<00:02:06.930> that

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
interesting and as I say the fact that

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.900 
interesting and as I say the fact that
it's<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.530> come<00:02:07.770> back<00:02:07.799> over<00:02:08.310> several<00:02:08.580> nights

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
it's it's come back over several nights

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.729 
it's it's come back over several nights
and<00:02:09.270> been<00:02:09.390> seen<00:02:09.660> by<00:02:09.840> many<00:02:10.050> different<00:02:10.200> people

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
and been seen by many different people

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.650 
and been seen by many different people
it<00:02:11.520> makes

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
it makes

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.140 
it makes
quite<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.960> significant<00:02:13.590> sighting<00:02:14.070> one<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:14.970> far

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
quite a significant sighting one as far

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.970 
quite a significant sighting one as far
as<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.300> analysis<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.960> film<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:16.530> intend<00:02:16.860> to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
as the analysis of the film we intend to

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.160 
as the analysis of the film we intend to
do<00:02:17.160> just<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.210> now<00:02:18.360> several<00:02:18.690> people

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
do just that and it's now several people

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.630 
do just that and it's now several people
were<00:02:19.290> being<00:02:19.470> told<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.920> because<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:20.400> has<00:02:20.520> been

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
were being told it because this has been

what do you make of it all well I most

what do you make of it all well I most
UFO<00:02:46.800> sightings<00:02:47.640> do<00:02:48.000> turn<00:02:48.240> out<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.690> have

UFO sightings do turn out to have

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.220 
UFO sightings do turn out to have
conventional<00:02:49.590> explanations<00:02:50.370> they<00:02:50.520> can<00:02:50.850> be

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
conventional explanations they can be

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.160 
conventional explanations they can be
lasers<00:02:52.370> searchlights<00:02:53.750> fireworks<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
lasers searchlights fireworks the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.410 
lasers searchlights fireworks the
Chinese<00:02:56.100> lanterns<00:02:56.700> which<00:02:57.030> are<00:02:57.210> quite<00:02:57.390> popular

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
Chinese lanterns which are quite popular

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.350 
Chinese lanterns which are quite popular
and<00:02:58.170> people<00:02:58.290> let<00:02:58.650> these<00:02:58.830> offered<00:02:59.250> parties<00:03:00.090> and

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
and people let these offered parties and

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.630 
and people let these offered parties and
barbecues<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.470> things<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:01.890> but<00:03:02.340> I

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
barbecues and things like that but I

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.790 
barbecues and things like that but I
think<00:03:02.760> what<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.180> interesting<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.350> these

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
think what is interesting is that these

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.950 
think what is interesting is that these
days<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.280> course<00:03:05.460> almost<00:03:05.820> everyone<00:03:06.420> has<00:03:06.720> a

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
days of course almost everyone has a

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.320 
days of course almost everyone has a
cell<00:03:07.410> phone<00:03:07.470> with<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.340> capability<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.000> take

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
cell phone with the capability to take

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.230 
cell phone with the capability to take
photos<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:10.050> videos<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:11.010> out<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.460> the<00:03:11.730> tens<00:03:12.060> of

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
photos and videos so out of the tens of

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.210 
photos and videos so out of the tens of
thousands<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.840> people<00:03:12.990> who<00:03:13.260> see<00:03:13.500> UFOs<00:03:13.920> each

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
thousands of people who see UFOs each

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.950 
thousands of people who see UFOs each
year<00:03:14.550> we're<00:03:14.730> getting<00:03:14.970> more<00:03:15.210> and<00:03:15.360> more<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.780> this

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
year we're getting more and more of this

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.350 
year we're getting more and more of this
interesting<00:03:16.800> footage<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:17.730> we're<00:03:17.940> more<00:03:18.120> likely

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
interesting footage so we're more likely

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.000 
interesting footage so we're more likely
to<00:03:18.660> get<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.050> bottom<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.380> these<00:03:19.560> sorts<00:03:19.920> of

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
to get to the bottom of these sorts of

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.949 
to get to the bottom of these sorts of
mysteries<00:03:20.520> we<00:03:21.240> certainly<00:03:21.510> hope<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.810> get<00:03:21.900> to

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
mysteries we certainly hope to get to

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.660 
mysteries we certainly hope to get to
the<00:03:22.110> bottom<00:03:22.140> of<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.500> one<00:03:22.740> neck<00:03:22.950> pulp<00:03:23.220> from
