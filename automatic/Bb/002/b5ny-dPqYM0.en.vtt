know I was kind of surprised I thought

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.890 
know I was kind of surprised I thought
Shogun<00:01:20.549> would<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:20.790> more<00:01:21.030> trouble<00:01:21.330> getting

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
Shogun would have more trouble getting

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.210 
Shogun would have more trouble getting
to<00:01:22.080> him<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.619> know<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> would<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:23.009> able<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
to him you know I would be able to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.410 
to him you know I would be able to
establish<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.640> leg<00:01:23.790> kicks<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.240> things

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
establish the leg kicks and the things

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.020 
establish the leg kicks and the things
he<00:01:24.479> did<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> first<00:01:24.990> fight<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.880> thought

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
he did in the first fight and I thought

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.640 
he did in the first fight and I thought
would<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.210> more<00:01:27.420> difficult<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.930> him<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> get

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
would be more difficult for him to get

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.069 
would be more difficult for him to get
to<00:01:28.939> tullio<00:01:29.939> de<00:01:30.030> at<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.299> time<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:30.720> obviously

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
to tullio de at this time but obviously

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.170

it<00:01:31.229> wasn't<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.100> confusing<00:01:32.400> for<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.939> though

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it wasn't is it confusing for you though

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.149

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
interesting but you know I'm not going

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.750 
interesting but you know I'm not going
to<00:04:10.410> mess<00:04:10.530> around<00:04:10.680> in<00:04:10.919> box<00:04:11.160> with<00:04:11.370> this<00:04:11.549> guy<00:04:11.730> that

to mess around in box with this guy that
would<00:04:12.090> be<00:04:12.180> stupid<00:04:12.510> so

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
would be stupid so

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.030 
would be stupid so
now<00:04:14.080> i'm<00:04:14.230> going<00:04:14.349> to<00:04:14.409> figure<00:04:14.680> out<00:04:14.800> a<00:04:14.860> way<00:04:14.980> to

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
now i'm going to figure out a way to

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.710 
now i'm going to figure out a way to
close<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.519> distance<00:04:15.700> get<00:04:16.030> our<00:04:16.120> hands<00:04:16.359> on<00:04:16.540> him

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
close the distance get our hands on him

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.240 
close the distance get our hands on him
and<00:04:16.840> then<00:04:16.930> try<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.139> manipulate<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.859> from<00:04:18.040> there

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
and then try to manipulate it from there

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.909 
and then try to manipulate it from there
no<00:04:19.150> matter<00:04:19.299> how<00:04:19.510> much<00:04:19.690> he<00:04:19.720> does<00:04:20.350> train<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.829> how

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
no matter how much he does train and how

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.350 
no matter how much he does train and how
seriously<00:04:21.310> he<00:04:21.400> does<00:04:21.639> that<00:04:21.850> take<00:04:22.030> this<00:04:22.180> is

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
seriously he does that take this is

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.760 
seriously he does that take this is
there<00:04:22.510> any<00:04:22.660> way<00:04:22.870> for<00:04:22.900> that<00:04:23.229> learning<00:04:23.560> curve<00:04:23.740> to

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
there any way for that learning curve to

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.400 
there any way for that learning curve to
even<00:04:24.190> get<00:04:24.400> close<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.479> point<00:04:26.080> where<00:04:26.199> he<00:04:26.260> can

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
even get close to the point where he can

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.930 
even get close to the point where he can
defend<00:04:26.650> take<00:04:27.070> down<00:04:27.250> from<00:04:27.430> randy<00:04:27.639> coach<00:04:27.790> who

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
defend take down from randy coach who

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.620 
defend take down from randy coach who
are<00:04:28.000> effectively<00:04:28.770> realistically<00:04:30.120> this<00:04:31.120> is

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
are effectively realistically this is

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.820 
are effectively realistically this is
not<00:04:31.780> a<00:04:31.810> lot<00:04:32.020> of<00:04:32.110> chances<00:04:32.410> he's<00:04:32.530> going<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:32.740> be

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
not a lot of chances he's going to be

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.620 
not a lot of chances he's going to be
terribly<00:04:33.190> well<00:04:33.430> rounded<00:04:33.850> by<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.120> end<00:04:34.330> of<00:04:34.479> all

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
terribly well rounded by the end of all

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.840 
terribly well rounded by the end of all
this<00:04:34.660> but<00:04:35.160> hopefully<00:04:36.160> he'll<00:04:36.310> learn<00:04:36.520> enough<00:04:36.820> to

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
this but hopefully he'll learn enough to

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.520 
this but hopefully he'll learn enough to
be<00:04:37.060> effective<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:37.660> to<00:04:37.750> be<00:04:37.930> where<00:04:38.110> he<00:04:38.260> wants<00:04:38.470> to

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
be effective and to be where he wants to

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.680 
be effective and to be where he wants to
be<00:04:38.620> which<00:04:38.889> is<00:04:38.919> obviously<00:04:39.790> at<00:04:39.970> range<00:04:40.240> and

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
be which is obviously at range and

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.610 
be which is obviously at range and
striking<00:04:41.169> so<00:04:41.470> that's<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.370> question<00:04:42.550> and<00:04:42.940> uh

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
striking so that's the question and uh

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.080 
striking so that's the question and uh
I'm<00:04:44.620> willing<00:04:44.979> to<00:04:45.010> put<00:04:45.250> it<00:04:45.370> out<00:04:45.460> there<00:04:45.699> and<00:04:45.820> see

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090
