00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:03.430
 these the teachers 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:09.030
 Learning this story on a day like today you realize first that you 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.559
 can not do without her anymore 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.219
 the daily we came 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.219
 a little bit bigger and warm 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.619
 Press conference yes the first questions 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.319
 there would have been questions today too 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:28.990
 important questions for example the big one of the suitcases is from Harald Stenger 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.090
 that so many different dealers a fitting 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.030
 I'm not a fashion expert singing 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.530
 Peter less to say today 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.300
 no shirt no Stenger no Pixar and that can be four days ahead of Argentina 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.780
 God's confirmed did not need it because I lack any understanding 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.730
 these are 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.160
 and even the players 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.800
 because of no desire for media work the Chinese Lust so very much 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.460
 lust 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.020
 need that feeling 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.480
 And although not always all journalists are so completely in the thing 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.810
 some have been around 1,000 euros more in the morning 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.530
 Italy would be against it 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.620
 So an end 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.630
 a solid picture 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.829
 and there must be at least one question allowed today 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.829
 who took her away? 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.070
 nobody has been Wills of course when she is the Steiner Euro 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.470
 or they counted Mr. Rudolf Dieterle it will be a national failed 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.570
 Many Thanks 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.150
 or about you Mr. Cacau 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.540
 who had to thoroughly out of a confidant is the Lord 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.490
 Cacau should 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.979
 among all he is the Englishman 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.810
 ambush as a cause Act but as related to de Angelis 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.630
 Reason for vocalists is that seems but it should be a bit complicated 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.510
 to become 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.510
 whoever it was was the one to be held accountable 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.210
 For the fatal consequences of this emptiness since my wife is not there, Cuche always has to 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.239
 let's do it 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.729
 Unfortunately, I can imagine worse 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.679
 there is something to change 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.019
 but at least a question 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.129
 But then it clarified after the suitcase with the many Hamm 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.849
 by Harald Stenger 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.300
 this order of magnitude 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.699
 that will probably be the next 20 to 30 years 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:37.569
 the majority have 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.789
 and tomorrow the morning they are back then yes that's a historical 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:42.699
 Day 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:46.040
 the courses as guests of honor could see everything 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.360
 Thanks a lot to the Wars
