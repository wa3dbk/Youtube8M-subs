00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
the chrome and this will knock the big

the chrome and this will knock the big
chunks<00:01:30.039> of<00:01:30.130> rough<00:01:30.369> stop<00:01:30.899> sweat<00:01:38.520> come<00:01:39.520> back

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
chunks of rough stop sweat come back

00:01:39.759 --> 00:02:03.399 
chunks of rough stop sweat come back
over<00:01:40.209> it<00:01:40.360> with<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:46.470> oil<00:01:47.470> here

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:38.390

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.800 

does<00:02:39.400> leave<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> little<00:02:39.880> bit<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.239> film<00:02:40.569> on

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.949 
does leave a little bit of a film on
there<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:42.030> wipe<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.209> off<00:02:43.270> just<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:45.930> show<00:02:46.930> a

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
there so wipe that off just to show a

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.850 
there so wipe that off just to show a
little<00:02:47.050> better<00:02:47.410> on<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.650> camera<00:02:48.130> but<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:49.860> can

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
little better on the camera but you can

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.500 
little better on the camera but you can
still<00:02:51.099> see<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.370> little<00:02:51.550> pitting<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.150> on<00:02:52.300> this

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
still see a little pitting in on this

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.020 
still see a little pitting in on this
piece<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.170> if<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.099> chrome<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.519> thicker<00:02:54.790> and

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
piece but if the chrome is thicker and

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.360 
piece but if the chrome is thicker and
better<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.480> lot<00:02:55.599> of<00:02:55.660> times<00:02:55.959> it'll<00:02:56.140> just<00:02:56.410> knock

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
better a lot of times it'll just knock

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.410 
better a lot of times it'll just knock
the<00:02:57.580> rust<00:02:57.730> off<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.360> not<00:02:58.510> leave<00:02:58.750> any<00:02:58.780> pitting

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
the rust off and not leave any pitting

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.110 
the rust off and not leave any pitting
but<00:03:01.709> obviously<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.980> hundred<00:03:03.640> times<00:03:03.849> better

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
but obviously a hundred times better

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.290 
but obviously a hundred times better
than<00:03:05.310> than<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.400> was<00:03:06.550> before

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
than than it was before

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.289 
than than it was before
I<00:03:07.650> don't<00:03:08.650> know<00:03:08.739> works<00:03:09.069> pretty<00:03:09.220> good<00:03:09.370> give<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.239> a

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
I don't know works pretty good give it a

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.540 
I don't know works pretty good give it a
shot
