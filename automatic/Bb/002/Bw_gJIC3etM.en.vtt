00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.539
 the hedge 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.779
 who manage to kill 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.289
 one of them is a legend yes my 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.689
 name is markus piper i am speaking 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:34.610
 among others as geralt of riva in the 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:38.000
 witcher 3 called the white wolf love 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.930
 I just have to love fantasy 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.070
 find it there because I have mine immediately 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.070
 own pictures in the head 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.309
 I want to introduce you to someone 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.510
 Actually, it's a lot 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.990
 happy man so that is always 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.260
 funny when he comes to the studio and 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:05.540
 but now one speaks one man one feels 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.360
 that he is really into the 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.700
 Character that he is in the character 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.310
 only so that he to the character 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.990
 and of course that's great 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.990
 They call you masters of riva 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.610
 geriva von riva that's one 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.530
 she is not worth telling in novigrad 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.460
 also do not choose where we should still 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.070
 looking for it in any case relative 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.520
 short tailed 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.869
 The baron is on the verge of madness 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.479
 trade so clearly 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.600
 there would be quite a lot for me 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.420
 he is definitely one 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.170
 a positive hero figure tries that 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.170
 to do right 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.829
 I always said 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.860
 I did not say so nice I did 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:09.489
 you preached that and what are you doing yes 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.739
 there are weird beings with dents and 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.269
 any long fingers and and 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.030
 So it's a bit scary 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.620
 there for me in the head but the vision 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.650
 he actually gives me back 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.870
 Trust a little bit because he's so mentor 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.849
 occurs and very sweet but always 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.120
 on the finger always hypo real or always 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.400
 ensures that it runs properly 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.950
 when the wind blows over here 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.260
 pretty long away she is 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.799
 returned 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.959
 siri and me are playing this year 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.519
 I'm such a thing who knows what she wants 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.989
 and can prevail and actually 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.879
 the whole time is on journey and 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.329
 nowhere is home moment and 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.329
 to begin 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.190
 Well, uncle, who will you ever see me ? 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.590
 Well a sound oil still works was now 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.350
 long lost and in the game goes 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.420
 it's about finding me because of me 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.660
 to be followed and to see that it is me 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.660
 goes well 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.640
 Games are getting bigger and bigger 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.440
 already very fast developing 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.930
 that one compares one now 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.130
 the movie takes the I say now 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.290
 times the average 1000 tx may be 1200 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.330
 our computer game and feature there 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.090
 You can easily reach 30 to 40 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.670
 a thousand tips together if we have 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.720
 we finished today only 2003 I have 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.720
 after 10,000 form 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.920
 the nutrition of the premiere is the same 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.380
 werther is interesting because the game is so 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.020
 looks really good and so if you are 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.800
 if you talk to us now 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.040
 record and then the game 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.780
 go in 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.350
 then the characters become now 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.569
 alive and there you finally feel 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.569
 that it's almost done
