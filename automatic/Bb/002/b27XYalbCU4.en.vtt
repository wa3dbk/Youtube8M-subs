wanted<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.140> make<00:00:37.290> sure<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.469> showed<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.070> how

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
wanted to make sure I showed you on how

it<00:00:38.520> looked<00:00:38.850> worn<00:00:39.329> after<00:00:39.989> four<00:00:40.320> or<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.129> hours<00:00:41.640> as

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
it looked worn after four or so hours as

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.670 
it looked worn after four or so hours as
opposed<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.239> how<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.540> looked<00:00:42.570> fresh<00:00:43.050> for

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
opposed to how it looked fresh for

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.750 
opposed to how it looked fresh for
filming<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> video<00:00:44.280> right<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.700> moment

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
filming the video right at that moment

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.660

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
wear when you've had them on your lips

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.380

would say everyday I kind of see a

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.960 
would say everyday I kind of see a
little<00:01:30.570> bit<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.020> our<00:01:31.110> lips<00:01:31.259> skin<00:01:31.710> shed<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.759> I

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
little bit of our lips skin shed but I

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.929 
little bit of our lips skin shed but I
mean<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.890> amount<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.579> my<00:01:38.700> lips

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.300 
mean it just the amount that my lips
shed<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.299> day<00:01:39.450> after<00:01:39.900> then<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.740> worn<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.159> is

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
shed the day after then I worn this is

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.370 
shed the day after then I worn this is
just<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> colors<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.229> had

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
just like that but the colors that I had

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.200 
just like that but the colors that I had
onto<00:01:43.500> my<00:01:43.710> February<00:01:43.890> favorites<00:01:44.549> video<00:01:44.820> was

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
onto my February favorites video was

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.910 
onto my February favorites video was
stoned<00:01:45.630> by<00:01:45.899> itself<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.799> only

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
stoned by itself and this is the only

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.230 
stoned by itself and this is the only
one<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.100> was<00:01:47.280> able<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> wear<00:01:47.610> without<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> liner

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
one I was able to wear without a liner

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.969 
one I was able to wear without a liner
it<00:01:48.509> was<00:01:48.689> pretty<00:01:48.930> creamy<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.560> didn't<00:01:49.770> mind

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
it was pretty creamy and I didn't mind

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.770 
it was pretty creamy and I didn't mind
it<00:01:50.070> because<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> didn't<00:01:50.729> need<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> liner<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
it because I didn't need a liner and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.749 
it because I didn't need a liner and
it's<00:01:51.930> kind<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> nude<00:01:52.740> type<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> color

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
it's kind of like a nude type of a color

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.429 
it's kind of like a nude type of a color
so<00:01:53.880> yeah<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.149> French<00:01:54.450> kiss<00:01:54.689> was<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> bit<00:01:55.140> drier

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
so yeah this French kiss was a bit drier

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.380 
so yeah this French kiss was a bit drier
and<00:01:55.649> consistency<00:01:56.189> than<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> other<00:01:56.820> lipsticks

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
and consistency than the other lipsticks

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.969 
and consistency than the other lipsticks
I<00:01:57.570> don't<00:01:57.780> know<00:01:57.899> why<00:01:58.079> again<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.590> doesn't<00:01:58.770> dry

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
I don't know why again it doesn't dry

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.980 
I don't know why again it doesn't dry
down<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.640> matte<00:02:00.240> or<00:02:00.270> anything<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.930> that

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
down to a matte or anything like that

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.709 
down to a matte or anything like that
but<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.860> does<00:02:02.070> stay<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> bit<00:02:02.820> more<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.119> place<00:02:03.420> as

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
but it does stay a bit more in place as

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.179 
but it does stay a bit more in place as
opposed<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.110> some<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.439> other<00:02:04.560> colors

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
opposed to some of the other colors

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.800 
opposed to some of the other colors
I<00:02:05.219> wish<00:02:05.579> was<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> darker<00:02:06.270> one<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.570> wine<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
I wish was a darker one like wine and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.830 
I wish was a darker one like wine and
dine<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.350> wish<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.950> had<00:02:08.280> dried<00:02:08.610> down<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.239> tad<00:02:09.599> bit

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
dine I wish it had dried down a tad bit

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.600 
dine I wish it had dried down a tad bit
more<00:02:09.869> due<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> fact<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.220> wet

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
more due to the fact that it's a wet

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.120 
more due to the fact that it's a wet
most<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.330> time<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.840> not<00:02:13.620> my<00:02:13.739> completely

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
most of the time like not my completely

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.610 
most of the time like not my completely
slick<00:02:14.640> but<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:14.940> didn't<00:02:15.180> really<00:02:15.269> dry<00:02:15.660> down<00:02:16.019> at

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
slick but it didn't really dry down at

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.220 
slick but it didn't really dry down at
all<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.489> it's<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.360> never<00:02:18.540> set<00:02:18.959> into

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
all so it's not it like never set into

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.630 
all so it's not it like never set into
place<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.650> again<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:19.860> wanted<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.130> use<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.430> more

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
place and again I wanted to use it more

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.610 
place and again I wanted to use it more
so<00:02:20.880> by<00:02:21.030> itself<00:02:21.390> instead<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.110> mixing<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.500> with<00:02:22.590> a

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
so by itself instead of mixing it with a

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.809 
so by itself instead of mixing it with a
lot<00:02:22.769> of<00:02:22.890> other<00:02:23.010> products<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.550> could<00:02:23.700> really

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
lot of other products so I could really

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.449 
lot of other products so I could really
see<00:02:24.090> how<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.840> acted<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.500> its<00:02:25.650> own<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.250> just

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
see how it acted on its own and I just

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.000 
see how it acted on its own and I just
wish<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.819> darker<00:02:27.120> colors<00:02:27.420> were<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> bit

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
wish that the darker colors were a bit

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.890 
wish that the darker colors were a bit
more<00:02:29.310> dry<00:02:29.610> because<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.090> color<00:02:30.269> just<00:02:30.510> more<00:02:30.690> so

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
more dry because the color just more so

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.440 
more dry because the color just more so
stays<00:02:31.319> into<00:02:31.860> place<00:02:32.099> exactly<00:02:33.000> where<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.239> place

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
stays into place exactly where you place

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.370 
stays into place exactly where you place
it<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:33.660> don't<00:02:33.810> have<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.989> really<00:02:34.140> worry<00:02:34.200> about

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
it you don't have to really worry about

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.839 
it you don't have to really worry about
it<00:02:34.560> getting<00:02:34.650> outside<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.220> lines<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.610> your

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
it getting outside the lines of your

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:36.229 
it getting outside the lines of your
lips

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
lips

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.699 
lips
so<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.480> one<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.720> twisted<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.319> this<00:02:37.500> one<00:02:37.680> I

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
so this one is twisted and this one I

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.240 
so this one is twisted and this one I
did<00:02:38.099> wear<00:02:38.340> without<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.239> liner<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.860> realized

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
did wear without a liner and I realized

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.460 
did wear without a liner and I realized
it<00:02:41.580> just<00:02:41.849> needs<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.239> liner<00:02:42.450> again<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.049> one<00:02:43.290> has

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
it just needs a liner again this one has

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.460 
it just needs a liner again this one has
more<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:44.130> creamy<00:02:44.549> consistency<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:46.110> it's<00:02:46.349> not

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
more of a creamy consistency so it's not

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.630 
more of a creamy consistency so it's not
something<00:02:46.830> that's<00:02:46.920> really<00:02:47.099> going<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.400> stay

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
something that's really going to stay

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.210 
something that's really going to stay
within<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.420> lines<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:49.140> your<00:02:49.650> lips<00:02:49.920> if<00:02:50.160> you

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
within the lines of your lips if you

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.390 
within the lines of your lips if you
don't<00:02:50.730> wear<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:50.970> liner<00:02:51.269> with<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.599> so<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.680> really

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
don't wear a liner with it so I really

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.500 
don't wear a liner with it so I really
like<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.730> pigmentation<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.390> these

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
like the pigmentation of these

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.910 
like the pigmentation of these
high-voltage<00:02:54.810> lipsticks<00:02:55.380> NYX<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.709> really

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
high-voltage lipsticks NYX is really

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.229 
high-voltage lipsticks NYX is really
stepping<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.280> game<00:02:56.489> up<00:02:56.610> especially<00:02:56.880> because

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239
