00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
we've already talked at length about

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.049 
we've already talked at length about
aperture<00:00:07.650> and<00:00:07.830> its<00:00:08.010> impact<00:00:08.309> on<00:00:08.490> depth<00:00:08.850> of

that's<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:12.120> focus<00:00:12.299> you've<00:00:13.019> seen<00:00:13.260> how<00:00:13.470> you<00:00:13.530> can

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
that's in focus you've seen how you can

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.740 
that's in focus you've seen how you can
make<00:00:14.010> your<00:00:14.160> aperture<00:00:14.580> larger<00:00:15.180> to<00:00:15.540> make

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
make your aperture larger to make

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.390 
make your aperture larger to make
shallower<00:00:16.410> depth<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.860> field<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.189> that's<00:00:17.250> what

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
shallower depth of field and that's what

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
shallower depth of field and that's what
we're<00:00:17.520> gonna<00:00:17.610> do<00:00:17.790> here<00:00:17.970> we've<00:00:18.150> left<00:00:18.300> the

been here and I want to blur out the
background<00:00:23.759> even<00:00:23.910> though<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.270> this

beautiful Vista back there I want to

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.010 
beautiful Vista back there I want to
shoot<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.939> with<00:00:26.970> shallow<00:00:27.360> depth<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.720> field<00:00:27.779> to

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
shoot it with shallow depth of field to

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.920 
shoot it with shallow depth of field to
bring<00:00:28.200> more<00:00:28.770> focus<00:00:29.250> onto<00:00:29.759> his<00:00:29.880> face<00:00:30.149> now

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
bring more focus onto his face now

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.930 
bring more focus onto his face now
depth<00:00:31.169> of<00:00:31.290> field<00:00:31.500> involves<00:00:32.310> shooting<00:00:32.550> shallow

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
depth of field involves shooting shallow

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.310 
depth of field involves shooting shallow
depth<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.329> field<00:00:33.390> involves<00:00:33.720> more<00:00:34.050> than<00:00:34.110> just

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
depth of field involves more than just

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.139 
depth of field involves more than just
opening<00:00:34.950> your<00:00:34.980> aperture<00:00:35.309> up<00:00:35.579> all<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> way<00:00:35.940> as

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
opening your aperture up all the way as

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.120 
opening your aperture up all the way as
you're<00:00:36.239> about<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> see<00:00:36.600> camera<00:00:37.440> position<00:00:37.920> has

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
you're about to see camera position has

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.220 
you're about to see camera position has
a<00:00:38.160> lot<00:00:38.400> to<00:00:38.580> do<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> perception<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.990> depth

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
a lot to do with the perception of depth

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.780 
a lot to do with the perception of depth
in<00:00:40.380> a<00:00:40.410> scene<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:40.950> I'm<00:00:41.070> gonna<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.430> take<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.580> shot

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
in a scene so I'm gonna just take a shot

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.510 
in a scene so I'm gonna just take a shot
here<00:00:42.000> I've<00:00:42.420> got<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.740> reasonably<00:00:43.740> fast<00:00:44.040> lens<00:00:44.280> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
here I've got a reasonably fast lens I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.430 
here I've got a reasonably fast lens I
can<00:00:44.550> open<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.150> to<00:00:45.210> f/4<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.110> I've<00:00:46.170> got<00:00:46.290> my

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
can open it up to f/4 so I've got my

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.410 
can open it up to f/4 so I've got my
aperture<00:00:46.680> open<00:00:47.040> all<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> way<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.240> is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
aperture open all the way now this is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.820 
aperture open all the way now this is
not<00:00:48.630> a<00:00:48.660> nice<00:00:48.930> thing<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> your<00:00:49.680> friends

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
not a nice thing to do to your friends

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.650 
not a nice thing to do to your friends

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
really wide angles something we haven't

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.360 
really wide angles something we haven't
talked<00:00:53.850> about<00:00:53.970> yet<00:00:54.330> is<00:00:54.630> the<00:00:55.110> effect<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.800> focal

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370

lenses<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:03.000> I'm<00:01:03.329> right<00:01:03.720> on<00:01:03.840> top<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.170> him<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.960 
lenses but I'm right on top of him and
to<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.040> him<00:01:05.159> frame<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> way<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> want<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.939> have

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
to get him frame the way I want I have

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.580 
to get him frame the way I want I have
to<00:01:06.119> go<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.390> pretty<00:01:06.600> wide<00:01:06.810> angle<00:01:07.229> which<00:01:07.409> is

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
to go to a pretty wide angle which is

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590 
to go to a pretty wide angle which is
not<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> most<00:01:08.250> flattering<00:01:08.460> look<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.479> it's

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
not the most flattering look but it's

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.569 
not the most flattering look but it's
gonna<00:01:09.719> work<00:01:09.899> well<00:01:10.109> for<00:01:10.380> our<00:01:10.469> example<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
gonna work well for our example so

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.190 
gonna work well for our example so
obviously<00:01:11.909> our<00:01:12.060> wide<00:01:12.299> angle<00:01:12.659> here<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.899> making

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
obviously our wide angle here is making

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.749 
obviously our wide angle here is making
him<00:01:13.350> look<00:01:13.469> a<00:01:13.590> little<00:01:13.740> goofy<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.340> what<00:01:14.609> we're

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
him look a little goofy but what we're

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.370 
him look a little goofy but what we're
more<00:01:14.939> interested<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.049> depth<00:01:16.259> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
more interested in here is the depth of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.109 
more interested in here is the depth of
field<00:01:16.590> yes<00:01:17.219> it's<00:01:17.429> a<00:01:17.490> little<00:01:17.670> shallow<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.030> it

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
field yes it's a little shallow but it

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.609 
field yes it's a little shallow but it
doesn't<00:01:18.299> look<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.420> shallow<00:01:19.079> I<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.409> still

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
doesn't look that shallow I can still

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.770 
doesn't look that shallow I can still
see<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.889> mountain<00:01:20.130> back<00:01:20.549> here<00:01:20.999> and<00:01:21.210> these

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
see this mountain back here and these

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.020 
see this mountain back here and these
trees<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.979> would<00:01:23.159> rather<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.759> frame

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
trees what I would rather do is frame

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.319 
trees what I would rather do is frame
him<00:01:24.270> tighter<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.340> mountain<00:01:26.969> fills

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
him tighter so that the mountain fills

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.510 
him tighter so that the mountain fills
more<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.929> the<00:01:28.049> back<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.439> frame<00:01:28.649> so<00:01:28.920> I'm<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
more of the back of the frame so I'm to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.340 
more of the back of the frame so I'm to
do<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.939> can't<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:31.229> this

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
do that I can't do that with this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.919 
do that I can't do that with this
wide-angle<00:01:31.859> lens<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.189> need<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.520> zoom<00:01:33.119> more<00:01:33.659> in

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
wide-angle lens I need to zoom more in

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:35.929 
wide-angle lens I need to zoom more in
so<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.319> do<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.740> got<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.069> come<00:01:35.280> back<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.759> so

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
so to do that I got to come back here so

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.109 
so to do that I got to come back here so
if<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.719> come<00:01:36.929> back<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.139> about<00:01:37.560> here<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.310> zoom<00:01:38.909> in

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
if I come back to about here and zoom in

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.779 
if I come back to about here and zoom in
what<00:01:39.450> I'm<00:01:39.539> doing<00:01:39.569> is<00:01:39.929> framing<00:01:40.289> him<00:01:40.619> as<00:01:41.459> close

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
what I'm doing is framing him as close

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.520 
what I'm doing is framing him as close
as<00:01:41.969> possible<00:01:41.999> to<00:01:42.359> the<00:01:42.569> exact<00:01:42.990> same<00:01:43.170> way<00:01:43.319> when

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
as possible to the exact same way when

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.929 
as possible to the exact same way when
it's<00:01:43.679> heading<00:01:43.920> about<00:01:44.069> the<00:01:44.219> same<00:01:44.399> position<00:01:44.789> I

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
it's heading about the same position I

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.819 
it's heading about the same position I
went<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.179> mountain<00:01:45.450> back<00:01:45.600> there<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:46.139> now

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
went the mountain back there and now

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.269 
went the mountain back there and now
when<00:01:47.039> I<00:01:47.069> take<00:01:47.279> the<00:01:47.429> shot<00:01:47.609> I<00:01:47.999> get<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:49.279> same

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:50.279 
when I take the shot I get this same

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:51.980 
when I take the shot I get this same
aperture<00:01:50.609> in<00:01:50.850> both<00:01:51.029> shots<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.539> different

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
aperture in both shots but different

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.239 
aperture in both shots but different
camera<00:01:52.319> positions<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.920> because<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.159> that

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
camera positions and because of that

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:54.800 
camera positions and because of that
different<00:01:53.639> focal<00:01:53.969> lengths<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.389> both<00:01:54.539> shots

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
different focal lengths in both shots

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.469 
different focal lengths in both shots
and<00:01:55.049> as<00:01:55.499> you<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.399> shot<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.270> just

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
and as you can see in this shot it just

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.300 
and as you can see in this shot it just
appears<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.319> have<00:01:58.439> much<00:01:58.649> shallower<00:01:58.889> depth<00:01:59.219> of

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
appears to have much shallower depth of

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.529 
appears to have much shallower depth of
field<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.729> it's<00:01:59.909> kind<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.119> an<00:02:00.240> optical

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
field and it's kind of an optical

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.239 
field and it's kind of an optical
illusion<00:02:00.630> almost<00:02:01.319> because<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.799> mountain<00:02:02.130> is

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249 
illusion almost because the mountain is

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:04.459 
illusion almost because the mountain is
bigger<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:02.880> background<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.899> see<00:02:04.200> much

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
bigger in the background I can see much

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.289 
bigger in the background I can see much
more<00:02:04.499> clearly<00:02:04.709> how<00:02:05.249> much<00:02:05.429> it's<00:02:05.609> defocusing

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
more clearly how much it's defocusing

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.359 
more clearly how much it's defocusing
it's<00:02:06.749> actually<00:02:07.079> defocusing<00:02:07.679> the<00:02:07.829> same<00:02:08.069> amount

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
it's actually defocusing the same amount

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.430 
it's actually defocusing the same amount
in<00:02:08.550> both<00:02:08.849> shots<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.990> because<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
in both shots is just because the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.500 
in both shots is just because the
background<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.979> bigger<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.580> can<00:02:11.940> see<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.390> D

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
background is bigger I can see that D

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.510 
background is bigger I can see that D
focusing<00:02:12.960> more<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.500> second<00:02:13.830> shot<00:02:14.040> so

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
focusing more in the second shot so

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.550 
focusing more in the second shot so
camera<00:02:15.180> position<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.720> focal<00:02:16.170> length<00:02:16.350> are

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
camera position and focal length are

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.200 
camera position and focal length are
critical<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.520> getting<00:02:17.760> shallow

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
critical to getting shallow

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.180 
critical to getting shallow
at<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> field<00:02:18.690> because<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.710> addition<00:02:19.890> to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
at the field because in addition to

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.280 
at the field because in addition to
aperture<00:02:20.790> size<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.900> things<00:02:22.110> that

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
aperture size one of the things that

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.180 
aperture size one of the things that
creates<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.650> sense<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.980> shallow

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
creates a sense of shallow

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.740 
creates a sense of shallow
depth-of-field<00:02:23.550> in<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.940> image<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.480> size

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
depth-of-field in the image is the size

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.660 
depth-of-field in the image is the size
of<00:02:24.930> your<00:02:24.990> background<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:26.010> want<00:02:26.100> background

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
of your background you want background

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.490 
of your background you want background
objects<00:02:27.090> big<00:02:27.390> enough<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:28.050> see<00:02:28.350> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
objects big enough that you can see the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.530 
objects big enough that you can see the
defocusing<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.310> very<00:02:29.850> often<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.240> only<00:02:30.450> way

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
defocusing and very often the only way

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.060 
defocusing and very often the only way
to<00:02:30.600> get<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.440> put<00:02:31.740> on<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.860> more

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
to get that is to put on a more

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.250 
to get that is to put on a more
telephoto<00:02:32.580> lens<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.120> get<00:02:33.330> farther<00:02:33.840> away<00:02:33.960> from

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
telephoto lens and get farther away from

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.830 
telephoto lens and get farther away from
your<00:02:34.410> subject<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.520> people<00:02:36.150> kind<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.780> just

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
your subject so people kind of just

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.570 
your subject so people kind of just
simplify<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.470> down<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.100> if<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.430> want

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
simplify this down to if you want

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.100 
simplify this down to if you want
shallow<00:02:38.850> depth<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.180> field<00:02:39.240> you've<00:02:39.810> got<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.050> be

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
shallow depth of field you've got to be

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.510 
shallow depth of field you've got to be
shooting<00:02:40.320> with<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.620> longer<00:02:40.980> focal<00:02:41.340> length

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
shooting with a longer focal length

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.880 
shooting with a longer focal length
there's<00:02:42.030> not<00:02:42.180> an<00:02:42.270> optical<00:02:42.900> reason<00:02:43.590> for<00:02:43.800> that

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
there's not an optical reason for that

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.220 
there's not an optical reason for that
it's<00:02:44.220> purely<00:02:44.520> about<00:02:44.820> just<00:02:45.180> size<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.900> objects

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
it's purely about just size of objects

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.390 
it's purely about just size of objects
in<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.440> background<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.010> when<00:02:47.100> you're<00:02:47.220> trying

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
in the background so when you're trying
