00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.160
 Welcome to the cashier and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.980
 in another unboxing and that 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.620
 this time it's about the free racings 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.870
 winch I'll show you something 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.009
 there is and how the whole thing in the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.009
 theory is incorporated 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:25.580
 that's how it goes, of course 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.730
 small schema you but directly 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.830
 can forget because I declare it is 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.150
 no big thing in the carton 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.610
 Well carton blister in this blister 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.280
 cards are two parts of the thing 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.860
 real winch there is only 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.950
 a little cable and then again 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.829
 a bun not in this tÃ¼tchen 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.120
 that you do and not on 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.270
 take something by at least 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.579
 can operate 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.730
 in this bag is the controller 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.780
 because this is a wind 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.670
 remote control 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.910
 There is also a bag with it 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:09.560
 screw trend so yes the controller 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:14.090
 this is just such a small board 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.840
 here and that has three connections and 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.240
 a button installation is easy 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.810
 that just adds a thing to it 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.299
 observed and therefore the same time 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.670
 first the winch comes on 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.340
 controller hear the cable and there is 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:36.049
 even just one where it fits is then 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:40.280
 that done before and then this one 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.799
 needs electricity and here comes in 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.829
 your receiver if you the fair 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.399
 We wanted to start controlling it 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:52.729
 to pay tax on the required 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.829
 you one tax the first one 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.670
 third channel and there you go 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:00.530
 here then namely in the receiver 3 and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.820
 Secondly , this third channel needs a 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.920
 to have zero 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.079
 So it's not just a back and forth 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.009
 but one with three 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:14.150
 positions one of the middle 1 0 and there and 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.450
 because in principle something like a steering 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.080
 for us very high if your receiver 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.330
 and send the support then you can 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.760
 you steer and have the winch with it 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.670
 as indicated on zeroing just null and 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.580
 it works on one switch position 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.320
 outside 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.650
 the other switch position is the 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.590
 be pure as I said if you are such a sender 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.640
 I do not know you have to do that yourself 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.860
 know and maybe Googling or in 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.360
 read the manual or whatever 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:52.910
 there is definitely something like that and 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:56.280
 that comes to power here and indeed 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:00.540
 but tolerates the only two there li 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.150
 po or six or seven cells of nickel 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.640
 Metal hydride battery you should there now 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.470
 so in three or four it somehow nico 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.000
 Please do not drive in your car 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.090
 otherwise you can do the thing 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.500
 through then you have the stream of one 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.209
 external further battery take there must 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.360
 her second battery for the Saarland 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.670
 but first of all honestly install the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.310
 Most cars like you drive without 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.010
 winch makes sense he does not build 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.130
 to anyone 6 s train but that comes 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:37.430
 to crawler to the money truck to any 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:40.170
 something to the trailer next to and the 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.650
 cars usually drive on two of them 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:47.070
 So it did not matter if the excel race or the 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.080
 rock roller or alias easy one 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.540
 or whatever the ride is all two 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.730
 it was with me and there I can do the thing 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.120
 So without a problem just here with one 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.220
 clamp and fix it somewhere 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.190
 that comes in the third channel and 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.540
 the thing is done so now there is 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.790
 but still a possibility if you 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.470
 do not have a third channel on yours 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.260
 remote control then you can do the thing 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.670
 Nevertheless, use of it is for that matter 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.560
 this little taste 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.360
 this is not a setup button 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.700
 something or something but just to 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.739
 manual operation of winch if 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.720
 So you do not connect this cable 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.220
 then he simply puts it away and if so 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.930
 you press here then that goes in purely out 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.470
 pressed again it goes in and again 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.370
 you press again stop everything clear 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.169
 So it can be synonymous over here 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.050
 have the disadvantage that you serve 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.320
 then place this controller like this 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.940
 that the car you at the 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.900
 did you even come and you can do it 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.980
 just does not really drive while driving 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.440
 So somewhere it's cool with that 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.000
 remotely control the other way, he is there anyway 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.280
 turn to just here 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.580
 that was also to grab somehow 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.410
 can and hook so well up 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.900
 to your car anyway in you can yes 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.420
 not at ten meters distance saw 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.310
 somehow make it clear, too 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.720
 hence a broken leg it is now 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.250
 not synonymous but there should just see 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.690
 then the thing would have to install that 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:14.050
 you turn and that comes with me 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:17.010
 in my exile ray everything clear so ok servus 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.010
 they say
