00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
messing with the shifter because it was

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.320 
messing with the shifter because it was
head's<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.410> little<00:00:13.440> play<00:00:13.769> in<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.210> want

to get the play out so I took the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.750 
to get the play out so I took the
shifter<00:00:16.590> off<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.250> was<00:00:17.310> putting<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.640> back<00:00:17.699> on

and idiot
I<00:00:21.090> knew<00:00:21.390> messing<00:00:21.720> with<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.840> power<00:00:22.050> valve<00:00:22.230> cover

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
I knew messing with a power valve cover

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.929 
I knew messing with a power valve cover
they<00:00:22.619> said<00:00:22.859> don't<00:00:23.100> ever<00:00:23.250> lay<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> bike<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.789> its

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
they said don't ever lay the bike on its

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.550 
they said don't ever lay the bike on its
left<00:00:24.060> side<00:00:24.269> or<00:00:24.420> if<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.600> do<00:00:24.750> make<00:00:24.960> sure<00:00:25.140> nothing

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
left side or if you do make sure nothing

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.099 
left side or if you do make sure nothing
presses<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> shifter<00:00:26.609> because<00:00:27.019> what<00:00:28.019> will

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
presses on the shifter because what will

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.380 
presses on the shifter because what will
happen<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> shift<00:00:28.949> shaft<00:00:29.269> that<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
happen is the shift shaft that the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.139 
happen is the shift shaft that the
shifter<00:00:30.900> lever<00:00:31.380> rides<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:32.040> will<00:00:32.700> push<00:00:32.910> through

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
shifter lever rides on will push through

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.590 
shifter lever rides on will push through
and<00:00:33.540> screw<00:00:34.110> up<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.410> mechanism<00:00:34.920> here<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:36.030> sure

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
and screw up this mechanism here so sure

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.630 
and screw up this mechanism here so sure
enough<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:37.140> didn't<00:00:37.920> have<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> bike<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> side

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
enough I didn't have the bike on a side

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.729 
enough I didn't have the bike on a side
but<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.480> was<00:00:39.780> messing<00:00:39.960> with<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> shifter<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
but I was messing with the shifter and I

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.709 
but I was messing with the shifter and I
went<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.980> slide<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.149> shift<00:00:42.420> shaft

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
went to slide it on in the shift shaft

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.569 
went to slide it on in the shift shaft
on<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.079> side<00:00:43.320> almost<00:00:43.620> buried<00:00:44.100> itself<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
on this side almost buried itself in the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.340 
on this side almost buried itself in the
case<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.360> heard<00:00:45.510> click<00:00:45.840> over<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.200> was

was like aw you idiot so anyway so
here's<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:52.020> happens<00:00:52.379> when<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.620> push<00:00:52.800> this

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
here's what happens when you push this

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.840 
here's what happens when you push this
out<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:54.360> shift<00:00:54.539> chef<00:00:54.750> comes<00:00:55.020> out<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.530> this

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
out the shift chef comes out and this

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.700 
out the shift chef comes out and this
piece<00:00:56.850> comes<00:00:57.059> off<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.719> actually<00:00:58.590> what

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
piece comes off here and actually what

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.090 
piece comes off here and actually what
happened<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.430> spring<00:00:59.789> came<00:01:00.000> off<00:01:01.100> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
happened is the spring came off and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.789 
happened is the spring came off and
that's<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> click<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.969> heard<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.769> somehow<00:01:04.769> I

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that's the click I heard and somehow I

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.200 
that's the click I heard and somehow I
came<00:01:04.920> off<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.369> think<00:01:05.549> when<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> pulled<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.030> back

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
came off I think when I pulled it back

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.179 
came off I think when I pulled it back
that<00:01:06.420> direction<00:01:06.630> any<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> spring

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
that direction any of that the spring

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.630 
that direction any of that the spring
came<00:01:08.369> off<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:11.210> not<00:01:12.210> very<00:01:12.390> happy<00:01:12.600> about<00:01:12.780> that

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
came off and not very happy about that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.510 
came off and not very happy about that
so<00:01:14.750> how<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.049> back<00:01:16.170> together<00:01:16.369> I'm<00:01:17.369> going

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
so how to get it back together I'm going

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.920 
so how to get it back together I'm going
to<00:01:17.580> show<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.729> at<00:01:18.119> least<00:01:18.270> what<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> did<00:01:18.750> and

comment<00:01:22.590> below<00:01:25.009> this<00:01:26.009> little<00:01:26.450> plastic<00:01:27.450> washer

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
comment below this little plastic washer

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.660 
comment below this little plastic washer
here<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.710> off<00:01:31.159> has<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> little

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
here if I can get it off has a little

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.670 
here if I can get it off has a little
Ridge<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.060> inside<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.900> two<00:01:34.380> different

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
Ridge on the inside it's two different

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.069 
Ridge on the inside it's two different
thicknesses<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.780> inner

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
thicknesses there and so this inner

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.359 
thicknesses there and so this inner
piece<00:01:37.439> goes<00:01:38.280> inside<00:01:38.720> this<00:01:39.890> fork<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.159> if

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
piece goes inside this fork here if

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.760 
piece goes inside this fork here if
that's<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.240> call<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.500> well<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.530> know<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
that's what you call it well I know the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.450 
that's what you call it well I know the
terminology<00:01:44.070> well<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:49.009> we<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.130> get<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
terminology well so we can get it to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.010 
terminology well so we can get it to
index<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:51.290> okay<00:01:52.290> there<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:53.720> all<00:01:54.720> right<00:01:54.810> so

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
index here okay there is all right so

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.980 
index here okay there is all right so
this<00:01:55.799> has<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> be<00:01:56.280> far<00:01:56.579> enough<00:01:56.930> initially<00:01:57.930> I

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
this has to be far enough initially I

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.179 
this has to be far enough initially I
want<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.170> put<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.380> back<00:01:58.560> together<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.920> didn't

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
want to put this back together I didn't

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.800 
want to put this back together I didn't
have<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.490> right<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> was<00:02:00.659> still

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
have it in right and it was still

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.800 
have it in right and it was still
shifting<00:02:01.170> amazingly<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:02.509> this<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.630> white

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
shifting amazingly but this is white

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.410 
shifting amazingly but this is white
washer<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.290> sticking<00:02:04.530> out<00:02:04.740> too<00:02:04.920> far<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.520> this

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
washer was sticking out too far and this

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.749 
washer was sticking out too far and this
piece<00:02:06.600> was<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:07.320> all<00:02:07.439> directions<00:02:07.740> up<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
piece was going all directions up and

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.820 
piece was going all directions up and
down<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.300> without<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.229> washer<00:02:10.649> piece

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
down like this without the washer piece

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
down like this without the washer piece
being<00:02:11.039> there<00:02:11.250> so

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
being there so

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.070 
being there so
I<00:02:13.880> try<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.940> get<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.180> back<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.420> place<00:02:15.630> here<00:02:15.870> there

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
I try to get it back in place here there

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.770 
I try to get it back in place here there
we<00:02:16.140> go<00:02:17.210> okay<00:02:18.710> in<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.890> spring<00:02:20.190> itself<00:02:20.780> this

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
we go okay in the spring itself this

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.210 
we go okay in the spring itself this
bent<00:02:22.170> part<00:02:22.530> goes<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.310> outside<00:02:25.010> at<00:02:26.010> least

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
bent part goes to the outside at least

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.800 
bent part goes to the outside at least
that's<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.400> way<00:02:26.460> my<00:02:26.670> bike<00:02:26.850> came<00:02:27.060> apart<00:02:27.360> and

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
that's the way my bike came apart and

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.980 
that's the way my bike came apart and
these<00:02:31.880> spring<00:02:32.880> levers<00:02:33.180> oppose<00:02:33.570> each<00:02:33.780> other

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
these spring levers oppose each other

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.930 
these spring levers oppose each other
and<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.950> one<00:02:35.160> will<00:02:35.280> stay<00:02:35.460> on<00:02:35.550> top<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.850> this

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
and so one will stay on top of this

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.700 
and so one will stay on top of this
lever<00:02:36.240> this<00:02:36.720> one<00:02:36.900> will<00:02:37.020> actually<00:02:37.050> fold<00:02:37.470> down

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
lever this one will actually fold down

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.220 
lever this one will actually fold down
below<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.250> lever<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:39.330> let's<00:02:39.870> see<00:02:39.960> if<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.080> can

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
below this lever so let's see if I can

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:49.970 
below this lever so let's see if I can
do<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.470> don't<00:02:40.860> screw<00:02:41.190> anything<00:02:41.220> up<00:02:48.920> just<00:02:49.920> a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
do this don't screw anything up just a

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:59.390 
do this don't screw anything up just a
little<00:02:50.070> bit<00:02:55.130> okay<00:02:56.130> there<00:02:56.340> we<00:02:56.400> go<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.250> that's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
little bit okay there we go so that's

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.140 
little bit okay there we go so that's
what<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.670> looks<00:02:59.790> like

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
what it looks like

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.780 
what it looks like
hopefully<00:03:00.570> it'll<00:03:00.690> show<00:03:00.900> up<00:03:01.020> in<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.200> camera

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
hopefully it'll show up in this camera

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.160 
hopefully it'll show up in this camera
and<00:03:03.830> that'll<00:03:04.830> slide<00:03:05.100> easily<00:03:05.750> on<00:03:06.750> each<00:03:06.870> side<00:03:07.080> of

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
and that'll slide easily on each side of

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.650 
and that'll slide easily on each side of
the<00:03:07.230> washer<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:08.090> little<00:03:09.090> bit<00:03:09.210> of<00:03:09.300> pressure<00:03:09.510> here

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
the washer a little bit of pressure here

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.030 
the washer a little bit of pressure here
just<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.080> make<00:03:10.200> sure<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.380> have<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.620> seated

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
just to make sure I have that seated

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.590 
just to make sure I have that seated
well<00:03:16.130> let<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.280> spring<00:03:17.610> seated<00:03:18.060> as<00:03:18.180> far<00:03:18.360> as<00:03:18.480> it

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
well let the spring seated as far as it

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
well let the spring seated as far as it
can<00:03:18.720> go<00:03:18.780> right<00:03:19.080> now<00:03:19.110> okay<00:03:20.120> cool<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.920> now<00:03:27.620> the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
can go right now okay cool so now the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.590 
can go right now okay cool so now the
clutch<00:03:28.800> basket<00:03:29.010> turns<00:03:29.400> counterclockwise<00:03:29.850> in

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
clutch basket turns counterclockwise in

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.390 
clutch basket turns counterclockwise in
Drive<00:03:30.930> when<00:03:31.410> you're<00:03:31.530> going<00:03:31.650> forward<00:03:31.920> huh

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
Drive when you're going forward huh

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.830 
Drive when you're going forward huh
obviously<00:03:32.850> general<00:03:32.970> Reverse<00:03:33.240> so<00:03:33.690> we're

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
obviously general Reverse so we're

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.540 
obviously general Reverse so we're
neutral<00:03:33.990> right<00:03:34.290> now<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.470> can<00:03:34.740> hold<00:03:34.920> the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
neutral right now I can hold the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.130 
neutral right now I can hold the
countershaft<00:03:35.970> sprocket<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:36.780> doesn't

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
countershaft sprocket and it doesn't

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.510 
countershaft sprocket and it doesn't
move<00:03:37.230> well<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.800> moves<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:38.040> little<00:03:38.100> bit<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:38.490> I

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
move well it moves a little bit but I

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.040 
move well it moves a little bit but I
can<00:03:38.700> restrain<00:03:39.210> it<00:03:40.850> turn<00:03:41.850> in<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.030> shaft<00:03:42.240> so

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
can restrain it turn in the shaft so

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
can restrain it turn in the shaft so
we'll<00:03:43.170> click<00:03:43.320> down<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.530> first<00:03:43.860> here<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:46.070> chef

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
we'll click down to first here and chef

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.250 
we'll click down to first here and chef
still<00:03:47.340> turns<00:03:47.780> but<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.900> counter<00:03:49.110> shaft

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
still turns but the counter shaft

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.720 
still turns but the counter shaft
sprockets<00:03:49.440> turning<00:03:49.980> now<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.310> can't<00:03:50.520> hold

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
sprockets turning now and I can't hold

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.080 
sprockets turning now and I can't hold
it<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:51.830> can't<00:03:52.830> hold<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.670> not<00:03:53.850> turn<00:03:54.000> the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
it I can't hold it and not turn the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:01.130 
it I can't hold it and not turn the
shaft<00:03:54.300> so<00:03:57.320> go<00:03:58.320> back<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.500> neutral

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.320 

making<00:04:02.140> sure<00:04:02.290> this<00:04:02.410> all<00:04:02.590> stays<00:04:02.800> together<00:04:03.330> that

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
making sure this all stays together that

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.750 
making sure this all stays together that
might<00:04:04.480> be<00:04:04.600> second<00:04:05.160> yeah<00:04:06.160> Mike<00:04:06.280> on<00:04:06.400> second

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
might be second yeah Mike on second

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.520 
might be second yeah Mike on second
there<00:04:06.880> so<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:07.750> just<00:04:07.900> wanted<00:04:08.080> to<00:04:08.170> make<00:04:08.290> sure<00:04:08.320> all

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
there so I just wanted to make sure all

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.510 
there so I just wanted to make sure all
this<00:04:08.680> is<00:04:08.740> working<00:04:09.190> here

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
this is working here

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.410 
this is working here
so<00:04:09.790> there's<00:04:09.940> neutral<00:04:10.330> again<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:12.000> quick<00:04:13.000> second

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
so there's neutral again a quick second

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.020 
so there's neutral again a quick second
here<00:04:14.130> there<00:04:15.130> second<00:04:16.109> okay<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.519> mechanism

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
here there second okay and the mechanism

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.120 
here there second okay and the mechanism
all<00:04:19.269> seems<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:19.600> be<00:04:19.660> staying<00:04:19.930> together<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:20.500> quick

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
all seems to be staying together a quick

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:31.230 
all seems to be staying together a quick
third<00:04:21.840> there's<00:04:22.840> third<00:04:25.020> fourth<00:04:26.020> fifth<00:04:30.240> what's

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
third there's third fourth fifth what's

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.000 
third there's third fourth fifth what's
getting<00:04:31.390> harder<00:04:31.480> turn<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.860> sixth<00:04:34.800> okay<00:04:35.800> cool

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
getting harder turn and sixth okay cool

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.700 
getting harder turn and sixth okay cool
and<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:39.580> won't<00:04:39.730> shift<00:04:39.910> any<00:04:40.120> higher<00:04:40.620> but<00:04:41.620> the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
and it won't shift any higher but the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.300 
and it won't shift any higher but the
counter<00:04:41.950> shaft<00:04:42.070> sprockets<00:04:42.220> turning<00:04:42.790> and<00:04:44.310> when

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
counter shaft sprockets turning and when

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.610 
counter shaft sprockets turning and when
I<00:04:45.340> turn<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:46.920> shaft<00:04:47.920> I<00:04:48.340> can't<00:04:49.470> stop<00:04:50.470> the

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
I turn the shaft I can't stop the

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.960 
I turn the shaft I can't stop the
counter<00:04:50.890> sprocket<00:04:51.280> okay<00:04:51.460> so<00:04:51.640> we'll<00:04:51.760> go<00:04:51.850> down

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
counter sprocket okay so we'll go down

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.090 
counter sprocket okay so we'll go down
to<00:04:52.030> five<00:04:52.240> here<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.880> four<00:04:55.390> and<00:04:56.230> then<00:04:56.470> three<00:04:56.830> and

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
to five here and four and then three and

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.030 
to five here and four and then three and
then<00:04:57.790> two<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.390> this<00:04:58.990> should<00:04:59.169> be<00:04:59.290> neutral<00:04:59.620> so<00:05:00.010> I

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
then two and this should be neutral so I

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.370 
then two and this should be neutral so I
can't<00:05:00.310> stop<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.610> counter<00:05:00.820> chef<00:05:00.970> sprocket

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
can't stop the counter chef sprocket

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.260 
can't stop the counter chef sprocket
right<00:05:02.380> there<00:05:02.890> should<00:05:03.100> be<00:05:03.190> neutral<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:04.060> I<00:05:04.120> can

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
right there should be neutral and I can

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.480 
right there should be neutral and I can
hold<00:05:04.419> counter<00:05:04.690> chef<00:05:04.870> sprocket<00:05:05.260> and<00:05:06.220> so<00:05:06.370> that

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
hold counter chef sprocket and so that

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.030 
hold counter chef sprocket and so that
is<00:05:06.610> neutral<00:05:06.940> and<00:05:07.030> we'll<00:05:07.150> click<00:05:07.330> first

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
is neutral and we'll click first

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.230 
is neutral and we'll click first
encounter<00:05:09.040> trust<00:05:09.250> markets<00:05:09.580> turn<00:05:09.790> again

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
encounter trust markets turn again

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.390 
encounter trust markets turn again
okay<00:05:10.540> sweet<00:05:11.850> neutral<00:05:12.870> that's<00:05:13.870> neutral<00:05:14.169> again

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
okay sweet neutral that's neutral again

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.010 
okay sweet neutral that's neutral again
so<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.520> mechanism<00:05:16.000> is<00:05:16.120> back<00:05:16.300> in<00:05:16.450> place<00:05:16.690> it's

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
so the mechanism is back in place it's

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.710 
so the mechanism is back in place it's
working<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.940> you<00:05:19.120> guys<00:05:19.240> have<00:05:19.540> more
