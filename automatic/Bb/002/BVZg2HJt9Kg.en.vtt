00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.560
 vanessa we are about to start an adventure we asked 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.160
 has experts to help us and thanks to computer graphics 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.589
 we will tell how the Romans over time 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.859
 they managed to establish themselves not only in wars but also in architecture 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:16.589
 why 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:21.969
 because the Romans also wanted to show their power is an element 

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:27.609
 fundamental their architecture was spoken of as luck the system really 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.490
 ingenious if time naturally 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.819
 I also help buildings a lot 

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:38.959
 of the ancient Rome in more precisely the 407 on 7 are half semicircular 

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:40.000
 pregnant 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.640
 it is a structure capable of bearing large loads but let's see how it is 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.680
 will proceed to build it. 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.840
 then the two side pillars were elected first of all 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.260
 from the imperial age, fired brick enlargements are used 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.739
 they were much more resistant 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.039
 of those in air-dried clay in the progress of the work an element 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.580
 what was fundamental was the provision of a temporary structure 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.830
 made entirely of wood 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.150
 which temporarily supported the bricks that were placed back on the attack 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.000
 before arriving at the sum center he helped the emulator work was on this 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.700
 who came 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.719
 this post the qvc tv bricks joined together by mortar dough so after the 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.409
 construction of the pillars you feel cartons were placed on the structure 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:29.979
 smart 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.250
 piacenzasera to form the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.760
 and we will continue until we reach the. higher the so-called higher 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.860
 key 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.909
 d time 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.830
 elopram could almost be said to be almost finished 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.660
 because it was necessary to remove the rib but to do so it was necessary to wait 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.290
 that the mixture naturally of the muratella 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.660
 city ​​set 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.450
 and the evolution of the construction technique 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.080
 of the arch that the vaulted roofs are born 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.600
 higher successive ones give rise to one 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.910
 once habbo 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.720
 two times barrel-crossed orthogonally damage 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.770
 new cross 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.929
 These curved surfaces derive the ribbed vaults, here is the dome 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.039
 from a simple arch are born architectural marvels they have 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.380
 explained the centuries that gave us greatness 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.480
 of clarity
