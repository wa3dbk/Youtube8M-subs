00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
way because I remember I was standing in

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.720 
way because I remember I was standing in
slips<00:02:33.840> whenever<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.380> think<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.100> took<00:02:35.160> two<00:02:35.610> or

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
slips whenever I I think I took two or

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.790 
slips whenever I I think I took two or
three<00:02:35.760> catches<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.450> suchan's<00:02:36.780> bowling<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.320> I

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
three catches of suchan's bowling and I

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.520 
three catches of suchan's bowling and I
should<00:02:38.010> really<00:02:38.280> stand<00:02:38.520> wide<00:02:39.110> slip<00:02:40.110> because<00:02:40.290> it

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
should really stand wide slip because it

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.070 
should really stand wide slip because it
turns<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.130> ball<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.580> mile<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.420> think<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.870> a

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
turns the ball a mile so I think is a

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.550 
turns the ball a mile so I think is a
very<00:02:43.290> good<00:02:43.650> bowler<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.610> smart<00:02:45.240> bowler<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.870> if

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
very good bowler a smart bowler and if

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.380 
very good bowler a smart bowler and if
he<00:02:46.710> gets<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:47.070> right<00:02:47.280> then<00:02:47.670> he<00:02:47.790> can<00:02:47.910> pose<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.150> lot

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
he gets it right then he can pose a lot

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.030 
he gets it right then he can pose a lot
of<00:02:48.540> trouble<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.050> batsman<00:02:49.470> okay<00:02:49.860> there's

whenever<00:06:23.240> India<00:06:23.780> bats<00:06:24.080> the<00:06:24.350> stadium<00:06:24.770> is

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
whenever India bats the stadium is

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.380 
whenever India bats the stadium is
packed<00:06:24.919> whenever<00:06:25.550> India<00:06:25.910> bowls<00:06:26.180> and

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.510 
packed whenever India bowls and
opposition<00:06:26.870> bats<00:06:27.110> there's<00:06:27.890> not<00:06:28.070> so<00:06:28.310> much

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
opposition bats there's not so much

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.090

crowd<00:06:29.360> at<00:06:29.660> the<00:06:29.780> ground<00:06:30.020> so<00:06:30.410> I<00:06:30.440> think<00:06:30.560> tomorrow

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
crowd at the ground so I think tomorrow

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.680 
crowd at the ground so I think tomorrow
will<00:06:31.310> be<00:06:31.430> a<00:06:31.460> different<00:06:31.820> scenario<00:06:31.970> and<00:06:32.479> when

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
will be a different scenario and when

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.150 
will be a different scenario and when
such<00:06:32.930> in<00:06:33.110> walks<00:06:33.380> in<00:06:33.590> to<00:06:33.710> bat

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
such in walks in to bat

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.530 
such in walks in to bat
I<00:06:34.190> think<00:06:34.640> the<00:06:34.700> stadium<00:06:35.120> will<00:06:35.240> be<00:06:35.360> packed<00:06:35.690> okay
