hello and welcome to light works in this
tutorial<00:00:15.500> we're<00:00:15.890> gonna<00:00:15.980> carry<00:00:16.250> on<00:00:16.370> having<00:00:16.580> a

tutorial we're gonna carry on having a
look<00:00:16.790> at<00:00:16.940> the<00:00:17.000> keyboard<00:00:17.180> shortcuts<00:00:17.900> let's

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
look at the keyboard shortcuts let's

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.080 
look at the keyboard shortcuts let's
have<00:00:18.500> a<00:00:18.530> look<00:00:18.710> at<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:18.860> jump<00:00:19.130> backwards<00:00:19.730> and

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
have a look at the jump backwards and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.269 
have a look at the jump backwards and
jump<00:00:20.300> forwards<00:00:20.660> functions<00:00:21.200> that's<00:00:21.890> that<00:00:22.100> a

and the S key on the keyboard pressing
these<00:00:24.860> keys<00:00:25.220> will<00:00:25.730> mimic<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:27.320> console

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
these keys will mimic the console

cuts<00:00:46.909> happen<00:00:47.330> at<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.720> same<00:00:47.900> time<00:00:48.610> so<00:00:49.610> where<00:00:49.760> we

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
cuts happen at the same time so where we

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.600 
cuts happen at the same time so where we

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.230 

you<00:01:07.780> can<00:01:07.930> see<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.200> way<00:01:08.290> that's<00:01:08.530> snapping

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
you can see the way that's snapping

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.850 
you can see the way that's snapping
across<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.390> different<00:01:10.510> tracks<00:01:10.869> and<00:01:11.140> s<00:01:11.740> to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860

jump<00:01:12.100> forwards<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:14.470> is<00:01:14.619> a<00:01:14.650> great<00:01:14.920> way<00:01:15.100> of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
jump forwards this is a great way of

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.980 
jump forwards this is a great way of
accurately<00:01:15.490> locating<00:01:16.390> points<00:01:16.750> on<00:01:16.840> your
