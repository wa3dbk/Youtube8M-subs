00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.280
 ah 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.349
 hello very good morning welcome to another 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.789
 more segment of designing your space my 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.070
 name is lizette and I meet my 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.140
 compaÃ±era carla and today we love you 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.119
 tell that we have a new design in 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.710
 doors and we will teach them because 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.369
 we are in the construction phase as 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.950
 We are going to cover a wall with some good 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.029
 trunks is an organic wall and carlos them 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.850
 is going to say that what we are going to touch 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.040
 good that it is first but the 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.010
 trunks do not obviously then need 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.800
 look for different blocks where a meters 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.140
 that is, different sizes like these 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.660
 that I have here if you can fix this 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.980
 has no bark and this one if the bark is 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.570
 whatever 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.180
 the skin so to speak 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.400
 this is nothing more when you cut 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.730
 trunks that are very dry sometimes 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.040
 breaks the crust and remain as certain 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.930
 hairs to these types of logs that you 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.360
 so are please withdraw the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.830
 bark quite as pretty things 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.270
 simple if not then you help with a 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.969
 razor 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.320
 choose I do not know what you need if you are 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.570
 like this one that's enough 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.070
 solid then you leave them to the end 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.200
 beautiful and different colors 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.180
 remember also remember that all 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.909
 that right now we are with everything that gives 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.760
 of recycling do not cut trees any more 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.620
 for the bark or to be able to obtain 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.050
 our trunks if they do not go to places 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.150
 where it is not complete that it ends up happening 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.450
 Christmas that they recycle that trunk 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.130
 we can make small slices or if you 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.560
 you have a very big tree in your house 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.330
 you want to give it a little cut out of there 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.210
 not come to cut either all 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.770
 trees that you find is the only thing 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.110
 they will do is carry those rules of the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.030
 tricks that cut a carpenter and 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.640
 they cut them now what they have 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.350
 what to play is with heights too 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.200
 we respect the most 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.539
 Large 2 inches approximate 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.369
 already 2 inches down it starts at 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.789
 vary but that is what we want so that 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:10.410
 this organic wall is made as we say 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:13.900
 have this movement and good as 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.340
 a little bit yes because it tends to skull 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.250
 that the cuts of release as is from 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.510
 small sawdust and you need to clean it 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.420
 so that the truth that we put 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.090
 our glue if I pasted well in 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.450
 I grabbed the wood well remember that it is 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.680
 yellow glue and that's yellow 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.080
 you can find it in any 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.819
 hardware store and good the only thing that 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.950
 They need to do if they want with a brush 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.769
 but like us we're just going to 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.769
 invest then this one no more goes like this 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.330
 We try to make sure it's not like 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.090
 excess 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.580
 we move it 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.620
 they are fixed if you want even with the same 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.819
 finger you can be if not with a stick 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.550
 you want not 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.550
 this glue is removed very easy from 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.370
 the hand and good what we are doing 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.110
 here is to gather all the trunk 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.930
 be stuck with each other because 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.310
 because the one above is going to land in 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.459
 down then it 's important that 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.319
 let's start from the bottom up because 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.750
 because the human is dry instantly 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.330
 you have to wait eleven beautiful and 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.099
 press it well enough strong and good 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.350
 here we already have some that are like 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.630
 little kids I'm going to grab a smaller one 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.150
 well because it's very important to remember 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.370
 they must play with the sizes 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.250
 that they do not all see each other many 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.320
 large or many small ones should not be 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.640
 can realize that on the wall and 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.610
 never if you do not see the holes 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.980
 the wall because it is very important that the 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.720
 wall is not painted either at the time 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.030
 that they are going to do this design because 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.819
 once it is painted it does not grab the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.980
 glue the trunks us this is if 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.500
 it's painted , it's going to slip 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.150
 they are going to come or they may hit but the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.090
 this month will start to 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.970
 fall then make it clean the wall 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.960
 so good here we already press 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.720
 we push 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.190
 we continue as if gathering the holes 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.670
 and getting more 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.980
 or half minutes like this one that comes here 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.870
 remember also that the bigger 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.850
 to the pieces that you are placing 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.620
 they have to leave him a little more time 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.530
 pressed because the weight sometimes gets 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.810
 beat and every hour remove your hand 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.150
 you come with everything and the gift kiko well 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.950
 decent here I am pressing and 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.600
 how can they be fixed I'm trying to 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.820
 that the gaps these as lizette said 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.070
 that I do not stay too big then 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.409
 well, so they have to go very 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.830
 well use 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:43.199
 until they are filling all the 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.509
 wall yes same also for example not 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.429
 they can give an account in this they do not have to 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.860
 be all the times hundred rounds 

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:52.860
 if they get to break or something all 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.499
 can be used do not worry 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.259
 that's why there are gearing pieces with 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:05:00.209
 good pieces, that's all for now 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:03.119
 We hope you liked our 

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:05.639
 idea is a unique age very different and 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:08.280
 especially recycle 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.280
