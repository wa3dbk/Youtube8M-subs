00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.099
 one of the devices that is actually 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.719
 before the ifa scholarship 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.849
 show where we first got one 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.499
 tone state is the liguigia 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.509
 to liguigia it is kind of 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.670
 allowing design of acer is very common 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.869
 in the middle segment and in this video 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.210
 I would of course go all the way 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.039
 by starting with design it 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.720
 is a very thin sad first of all that 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.820
 falls really on journey seven and a half millimeters 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.140
 thin so that is just quite anyway 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.849
 I feel really nicely be thinly 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.460
 toe sauce slightly bent so that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.390
 and sides are a bit thinner and that 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.160
 just feels 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.510
 very neat what is striking is that the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.270
 camera sticks out a bit it is 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.970
 a pity but I can't do everything 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.380
 I am not interested in design itself 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.790
 so very impressed 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.560
 daniel thinks it is nice it feels too 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.430
 a little personal thing about me 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.160
 especially striking is that it is a bit 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.320
 plastic that is in itself is the shape though 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.090
 fairly neat in between has none 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.760
 giant berries but also not whole ones 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.860
 small berries that stand out further is the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.750
 speakers here above the screen one 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.550
 bit of a separate design elements can 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.049
 like it or not 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.100
 at the back it stands out that the bottom 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.290
 the camera sort of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.610
 placed in a transparent ring is the flash 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.250
 just have to be next so it wo n't 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.510
 but looks nice on its own 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.880
 I think the camera sticks out a bit 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.270
 much invention that is unfortunate but loose 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.620
 that is just quite with the phone 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.960
 but a bit of plastic ie after 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.210
 the screen is a 720 p display eps 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.350
 display 5 inches tall and that 's right there 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.580
 just good looking 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.550
 of course the screen is off 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.870
 totally laminated and just looks 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.060
 very neat at first glance 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.280
 I have little to blame for that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.070
 the device also has around the hood 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.409
 and mediatek processor a quad core 1.3 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.870
 giga is wind cortex and a7 cores 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.130
 gigabyte of memory and of course and 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.570
 through the fire point four kit cat with 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.190
 require its own interface over it 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.780
 he does n't say that interface very much 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.640
 adjusted 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.260
 there are, however, some adjustments 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.800
 standard android were trendy actually 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.200
 on the one hand that is the 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.420
 and a mini apps that you can use 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.920
 if you go to multitask menu then go after 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.240
 a chicken different mini apps start 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.110
 income as a doll you have over you 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.880
 screen one 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.590
 we already know longer acer itself 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.420
 that we needed a convenient feature 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.400
 a very clean interface 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.670
 I think it is so good 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.470
 look like it just isn't so yes 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.570
 bombastic agree not 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.520
 milf color for one we just yes 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.080
 fairly simple in tight and love it 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.340
 I'm sure 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.410
 but operation seems the device it is 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.490
 said just quickly and smoothly 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.480
 naturally nicely taken to the 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.340
 processor in the device 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.260
 we do know a bit about that 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.640
 just performs as you like it 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.900
 mid-range telephone 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.000
 enough for daily use 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.500
 otherwise not super fast team is that she 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.660
 but our experience in earlier phones 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.980
 it is, of course, lies in the line of 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.390
 expect that also with this tasty 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.740
 jake will be like that 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.850
 the camera of the device is still 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.620
 interesting is the front 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.120
 camera that didn't jump so well 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.740
 there is a 13 megapixel on the back 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.840
 camera dance in itself is not very exciting 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.880
 we have an aperture of 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.160
 a point 8 and that is very low that 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.410
 even the lowest in the phone 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.060
 sit speak until very large opening 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.280
 a lot of light frankstraat performances 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.250
 from camera that are just the question I ask 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.750
 do not know how that really in it 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.640
 daily use 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.120
 that will prove later but 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.500
 principle that is large aperture opening 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.520
 very interesting and earth would you 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.650
 just your lowlights well with the 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.510
 perform and then it sounds good in itself 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.100
 Of course the lip DJ it also has one 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.630
 dual sim version also includes singles and 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.890
 version this is in version but the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.150
 is therefore also a version that is two 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.489
 SIM cards can swallow it is one 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.630
 device that just by pretty good 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.330
 furthermore looks fairly standard 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.430
 mid-range telephone also goes with 230 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.989
 around the euro so that looks like 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.209
 to become a very decent price 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.950
 a device that is especially very thin then 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.090
 yes you have a reasonably special design or you 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.640
 likes it or not 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.770
 and otherwise just falls mid segment one 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.760
 has relatively high screen resolution and 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.470
 seems to perform reasonably well 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.340
 so for that matter just a net de 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.340
 ice cream phone
