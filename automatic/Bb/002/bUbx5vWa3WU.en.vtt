the way I recommend you get gimp 2.0 and
train<00:01:40.450> smash<00:01:40.840> fear<00:01:41.140> from<00:01:41.470> pev<00:01:41.980> soft<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:45.070> you

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
train smash fear from pev soft so you

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.330 
train smash fear from pev soft so you
open<00:01:45.700> up<00:01:45.820> that<00:01:46.590> they're<00:01:47.590> going<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.800> be<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.950> bunch

open up that they're going to be a bunch

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.880 
open up that they're going to be a bunch
just<00:01:48.790> something<00:01:49.270> we're<00:01:49.360> gonna<00:01:49.450> worry<00:01:49.690> about

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
just something we're gonna worry about

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.880 
just something we're gonna worry about
I'll<00:01:50.890> go<00:01:51.280> through<00:01:51.520> them<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:52.570> map<00:01:52.840> one<00:01:53.260> we

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
I'll go through them the map one we

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.480 
I'll go through them the map one we
don't<00:01:54.610> have<00:01:54.910> to<00:01:55.120> worry<00:01:55.330> about<00:01:56.610> because<00:01:57.610> it<00:01:58.420> is

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
don't have to worry about because it is

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.860 
don't have to worry about because it is
it's<00:02:00.490> just<00:02:00.730> there<00:02:01.330> to<00:02:02.140> mock<00:02:02.350> us<00:02:02.620> and<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.659> mean

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
it's just there to mock us and you mean

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.140 
it's just there to mock us and you mean
you<00:02:05.050> can<00:02:05.290> use<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.770> if<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.280> want<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.670> space

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
you can use it if you want to space

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.859 
you can use it if you want to space
things<00:02:07.540> out<00:02:07.930> or<00:02:08.170> whatever<00:02:08.789> but<00:02:09.789> we'll<00:02:10.720> be

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
things out or whatever but we'll be

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.990 
things out or whatever but we'll be
using<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.379> bump<00:02:11.620> map<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:15.069> think<00:02:15.430> for<00:02:15.849> this

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
using the bump map and I think for this

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.570 
using the bump map and I think for this
reskin<00:02:16.540> we<00:02:17.080> should<00:02:17.650> be<00:02:17.769> fine<00:02:18.069> with<00:02:18.519> the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.890 

Lincolnshire<00:02:26.580> yeah<00:02:26.880> we<00:02:27.150> should<00:02:27.330> be<00:02:27.450> fine<00:02:27.690> with

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
Lincolnshire yeah we should be fine with

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.890 
Lincolnshire yeah we should be fine with
the<00:02:28.020> mesh<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:29.040> open<00:02:29.550> up<00:02:29.640> your<00:02:29.700> map<00:02:30.090> one<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.420> bump

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
the mesh so open up your map one a bump

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:39.200 
the mesh so open up your map one a bump
in<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:32.220> GIMP<00:02:35.930> give<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.530> few<00:02:38.220> seconds<00:02:38.670> there

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
in to GIMP give it a few seconds there

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.199 
in to GIMP give it a few seconds there
we<00:02:39.330> go

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
we go

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.240 
we go
so<00:02:41.780> go<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:43.069> colors<00:02:43.579> button<00:02:44.030> go<00:02:44.959> to

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
so go to the colors button go to

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.349 
so go to the colors button go to
colorize<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:47.299> then<00:02:47.930> bring<00:02:48.650> those<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.939> hue

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
colorize and then bring those the hue

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.479 
colorize and then bring those the hue
and<00:02:50.540> saturation<00:02:50.569> down<00:02:51.379> bring<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.920> lightness

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
and saturation down bring the lightness

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.670 
and saturation down bring the lightness
up<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.209> hundred<00:02:53.689> click<00:02:54.469> OK<00:02:55.420> select<00:02:56.680> dockable

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.970 
up to a hundred click OK select dockable
dialogs<00:02:57.849> and<00:02:58.849> layers<00:02:59.389> things<00:03:00.049> so<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.560> can

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
dialogs and layers things so you can

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.379 
dialogs and layers things so you can
switch<00:03:01.219> back<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.459> forth<00:03:01.790> between<00:03:01.909> layers

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
switch back and forth between layers

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.289 
switch back and forth between layers
because<00:03:02.810> we'll<00:03:02.959> be<00:03:02.989> using<00:03:03.109> that<00:03:03.680> also<00:03:04.579> get

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
because we'll be using that also get

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.970 
because we'll be using that also get
your<00:03:05.569> toolbox<00:03:06.170> out<00:03:06.849> that's<00:03:07.849> important<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.620> go

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
your toolbox out that's important and go

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.149 
your toolbox out that's important and go
to<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.189> new<00:03:10.549> layer<00:03:11.409> make<00:03:12.409> sure<00:03:12.439> it's<00:03:12.829> a<00:03:12.889> white

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
to a new layer make sure it's a white

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.089 
to a new layer make sure it's a white
for<00:03:13.730> this<00:03:13.879> color<00:03:14.299> there's<00:03:14.989> a<00:03:15.139> green<00:03:15.349> arrow<00:03:15.620> in

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
for this color there's a green arrow in

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.720 
for this color there's a green arrow in
the<00:03:16.340> dialog<00:03:17.180> here<00:03:17.510> in<00:03:17.659> the<00:03:17.780> window<00:03:18.519> click<00:03:19.519> that

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
the dialog here in the window click that

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.179 
the dialog here in the window click that
down<00:03:20.389> arrow<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.379> then<00:03:21.680> make<00:03:21.980> sure<00:03:22.010> that

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
down arrow and then make sure that

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.159 
down arrow and then make sure that
layers<00:03:22.519> behind<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.299> take<00:03:24.169> a<00:03:24.530> black<00:03:25.599> marker<00:03:26.599> or

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
layers behind it take a black marker or

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:33.759 
layers behind it take a black marker or
pencil<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:29.409> well<00:03:31.090> bucket<00:03:32.090> fill<00:03:32.329> it<00:03:32.769> goes

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
pencil and well bucket fill it goes

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.420 
pencil and well bucket fill it goes
quicker

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.500 

so<00:03:37.970> we<00:03:38.659> will<00:03:38.930> be<00:03:39.140> using<00:03:39.409> the<00:03:42.640> map<00:03:43.640> one<00:03:44.060> and

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
so we will be using the map one and

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.839 
so we will be using the map one and
that's<00:03:45.049> just<00:03:45.170> going<00:03:45.409> to<00:03:45.470> be<00:03:45.620> like<00:03:45.980> for<00:03:46.400> certain

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
that's just going to be like for certain

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.119 
that's just going to be like for certain
textures<00:03:47.510> such<00:03:48.079> as<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.959> headlights<00:03:51.890> and

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
textures such as the headlights and

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.809 
textures such as the headlights and
couplers<00:03:52.670> those<00:03:53.120> are<00:03:53.390> those<00:03:54.260> are<00:03:54.379> big<00:03:54.819> another

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
couplers those are those are big another

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.809 
couplers those are those are big another
big<00:03:56.120> thing<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.510> trying<00:03:57.379> to<00:03:57.500> figure<00:03:57.799> out<00:03:57.859> how

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
big thing is trying to figure out how

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.089 
big thing is trying to figure out how
all<00:03:59.450> of<00:03:59.780> this<00:03:59.930> goes<00:04:00.260> on<00:04:00.439> because<00:04:00.739> I'll<00:04:00.890> tell

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
all of this goes on because I'll tell

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.369 
all of this goes on because I'll tell
you<00:04:01.220> one<00:04:01.430> thing<00:04:01.730> with<00:04:01.939> that<00:04:02.150> door<00:04:02.569> that<00:04:02.989> that

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
you one thing with that door that that

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.750 
you one thing with that door that that
door<00:04:03.680> is<00:04:03.769> a<00:04:03.799> tricky<00:04:04.310> sob<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:06.129> I<00:04:07.129> think<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.519> can

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
door is a tricky sob and I think I can

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:16.140 
door is a tricky sob and I think I can
show<00:04:08.299> you

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.819 

new<00:04:17.150> look

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.540 

okay<00:04:22.550> so<00:04:23.889> anyways<00:04:24.889> after<00:04:25.069> you<00:04:25.220> have<00:04:25.340> that

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
okay so anyways after you have that

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.580 
okay so anyways after you have that
colored<00:04:26.000> go<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:27.039> image<00:04:28.039> and<00:04:28.750> merge<00:04:29.750> layers<00:04:30.139> and

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
colored go to image and merge layers and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.100 
colored go to image and merge layers and
then<00:04:30.740> just<00:04:30.889> quickly<00:04:31.300> now<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:32.360> need<00:04:32.780> another

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
then just quickly now you need another

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.059 
then just quickly now you need another
layer<00:04:33.470> new<00:04:34.039> layer<00:04:34.720> transparency<00:04:35.720> there<00:04:36.110> now

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
layer new layer transparency there now

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.740 
layer new layer transparency there now
we're<00:04:37.220> going<00:04:37.310> to<00:04:37.370> start<00:04:37.639> skinning<00:04:38.120> this<00:04:38.479> thing

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
we're going to start skinning this thing

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.680 
we're going to start skinning this thing
I<00:04:38.900> would<00:04:39.110> love<00:04:39.379> to<00:04:39.889> give<00:04:40.069> you<00:04:40.310> oh<00:04:40.580> wait<00:04:41.210> sorry

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
and then right here it says mode normal

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.420 
and then right here it says mode normal
switch<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.289> to<00:04:45.770> multiply<00:04:48.069> also<00:04:49.069> there's

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
switch that to multiply also there's
