00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760 

I<00:00:00.319> think<00:00:01.319> that<00:00:01.709> as<00:00:02.570> we<00:00:03.570> accept<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.230> medical

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
I think that as we accept the medical

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.360 
I think that as we accept the medical
utility<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.670> cannabis<00:00:06.799> we<00:00:07.799> are<00:00:07.980> going<00:00:08.220> to

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
utility of cannabis we are going to

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.759 
utility of cannabis we are going to
start<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.790> dig<00:00:09.030> more<00:00:09.330> deeply<00:00:09.389> into<00:00:10.019> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
start to dig more deeply into the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.879 
start to dig more deeply into the
cannabinoids<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:12.120> key<00:00:12.780> constituents<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
cannabinoids the key constituents of the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.950 
cannabinoids the key constituents of the
marijuana<00:00:14.190> plant<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:15.059> are<00:00:15.210> providing<00:00:15.809> this

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
marijuana plant that are providing this

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.220 
marijuana plant that are providing this
benefit<00:00:17.240> from<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.359> pharmaceutical<00:00:18.869> company

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
benefit from a pharmaceutical company

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.170 
benefit from a pharmaceutical company
perspective<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.520> think<00:00:20.730> there's<00:00:20.880> going<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.119> be

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
perspective I think there's going to be

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.630 
perspective I think there's going to be
an<00:00:21.359> interest<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.990> trying<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.920> isolate<00:00:23.100> those

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
an interest in trying to isolate those

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.900 
an interest in trying to isolate those
compounds<00:00:24.119> or<00:00:25.130> trying<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> work<00:00:26.460> within<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
compounds or trying to work within the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.060 
compounds or trying to work within the
endogenous<00:00:27.269> cannabinoids<00:00:27.750> system<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.680> that

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
endogenous cannabinoids system that that

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.650 
endogenous cannabinoids system that that
system<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.699> cannabinoids<00:00:30.000> which<00:00:30.510> is

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
system of cannabinoids which is

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.749 
system of cannabinoids which is
functioning<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.260> all<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.590> us<00:00:31.740> all<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.550> time

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
functioning in all of us all the time

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.799 
functioning in all of us all the time
without<00:00:33.239> any<00:00:33.660> external<00:00:34.170> influence<00:00:35.660> trying<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
without any external influence trying to

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.260 
without any external influence trying to
target<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:37.920> medications<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:39.059> up

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
target that with medications that can up

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.450 
target that with medications that can up
regulate<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.050> level<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.500> cannabinoids<00:00:40.890> in

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
regulate the level of cannabinoids in

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.700 
regulate the level of cannabinoids in
our<00:00:41.640> bodies<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.420> eliminate<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
our bodies that can eliminate the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
our bodies that can eliminate the
breakdown<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.190> cannabinoids<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.120> perhaps

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
breakdown of cannabinoids so perhaps

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.600 
breakdown of cannabinoids so perhaps
getting<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.320> cannabinoid<00:00:46.620> effect<00:00:47.250> without

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
getting a cannabinoid effect without

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.610 
getting a cannabinoid effect without
really<00:00:47.879> taking<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.570> cannabinoid<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.440> by

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
really taking in a cannabinoid but by

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.549 
really taking in a cannabinoid but by
enhancing<00:00:49.980> our<00:00:50.370> own<00:00:50.550> endogenous<00:00:51.180> levels<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> I

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
enhancing our own endogenous levels so I

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.410 
enhancing our own endogenous levels so I
think<00:00:52.680> that's<00:00:52.949> one<00:00:53.219> area<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.670> pharmaceutical

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
think that's one area of pharmaceutical

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.389 
think that's one area of pharmaceutical
industry<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.260> taking<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:56.100> think

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
industry is going to be taking I think

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.299 
industry is going to be taking I think
another<00:00:56.879> area<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.660> trying<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.710> improve<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
another area is trying to improve the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.369 
another area is trying to improve the
overall<00:00:59.609> quality<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.719> regulation<00:01:01.260> of

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
overall quality and the regulation of

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.860 
overall quality and the regulation of
horrible<00:01:01.710> cannabis<00:01:02.449> because<00:01:03.449> there<00:01:03.750> are

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
horrible cannabis because there are

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.500 
horrible cannabis because there are
patients<00:01:04.229> who<00:01:04.379> realize<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.700> an

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
patients who realize that this is an

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.810 
patients who realize that this is an
effective<00:01:06.720> way<00:01:07.170> for<00:01:07.200> them<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.740> think<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.700> can

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
effective way for them I think if we can

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.270 
effective way for them I think if we can
do<00:01:09.030> larger<00:01:09.930> studies<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.500> safety<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.130> can

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
do larger studies of safety and we can

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.070 
do larger studies of safety and we can
be<00:01:11.400> really<00:01:11.700> reassured<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.570> over<00:01:12.900> long

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
be really reassured that if over long

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.560 
be really reassured that if over long
term<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> safe<00:01:13.979> medication<00:01:14.570> if

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
term this is a safe medication if

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.300 
term this is a safe medication if
quality<00:01:15.930> issues<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.619> resolved<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.280> that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
quality issues can be resolved so that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.980 
quality issues can be resolved so that
we<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.610> exactly<00:01:18.030> where<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.299> comes<00:01:18.540> from<00:01:18.659> we

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
we know exactly where it comes from we

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.320 
we know exactly where it comes from we

a question of regulating the process so

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.940 
a question of regulating the process so

that physicians are comfortable

physicians even realize the easy

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.500 
physicians even realize the easy
so<00:02:06.100> there's<00:02:06.310> all<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.550> work<00:02:06.730> to<00:02:06.880> do<00:02:07.000> even<00:02:07.030> there

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
so there's all the work to do even there

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.190

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
clinical trials research and so on and I

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.470 
clinical trials research and so on and I

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
suppose I don't I don't know how

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.660 
suppose I don't I don't know how
realistic<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:23.200> but<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.830> think<00:02:24.100> my<00:02:24.250> vision

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
realistic it is but I think my vision

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.070 
realistic it is but I think my vision
would<00:02:24.820> be<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.180> somebody<00:02:25.450> will<00:02:25.840> come<00:02:26.020> along

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
would be that somebody will come along

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.340 
would be that somebody will come along
and<00:02:26.440> invest<00:02:26.740> in<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.310> process<00:02:28.260> especially<00:02:29.260> if

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
and invest in that process especially if

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.530 
and invest in that process especially if
as<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.680> see<00:02:29.920> happening<00:02:30.490> at<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:30.940> moment<00:02:31.000> in

as I see happening at this moment in
April<00:02:32.140> 2010<00:02:33.450> considerable<00:02:34.450> numbers<00:02:34.810> of

April 2010 considerable numbers of

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
dispensaries opening up there's

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.150 
dispensaries opening up there's
considerable<00:02:37.120> money<00:02:37.630> going<00:02:38.170> through<00:02:38.500> these

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
considerable money going through these

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.190 
considerable money going through these
processes<00:02:39.430> there<00:02:40.360> must<00:02:40.540> be<00:02:40.690> considerable

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
processes there must be considerable

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.890 
processes there must be considerable
profits<00:02:41.650> being<00:02:41.800> generated<00:02:42.270> that<00:02:43.270> should<00:02:43.720> be

profits being generated that should be
funneled<00:02:44.320> back<00:02:44.500> into<00:02:44.670> research<00:02:45.670> and

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
funneled back into research and

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.940 
funneled back into research and
education<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.020> whole<00:02:47.200> field<00:02:47.470> moves

education so that the whole field moves

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.060 
education so that the whole field moves
forward<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.580> upwards<00:02:48.990> rather<00:02:49.990> than<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:51.010> know

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
forward and upwards rather than you know

forward and upwards rather than you know
grab<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.610> money<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:51.910> run<00:02:52.090> i<00:02:52.510> we've<00:02:53.110> all<00:02:53.320> come

grab the money and run i we've all come

grab the money and run i we've all come
to<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:54.100> through<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.640> process<00:02:55.300> of<00:02:55.420> grew<00:02:55.690> slow

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
to this through a process of grew slow

to this through a process of grew slow
realization<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:57.130> research<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.690> think<00:02:58.720> we

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
realization and research and I think we

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.780 
realization and research and I think we
owe<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.350> keep<00:02:59.650> funneling<00:03:00.400> that

so if herbal cannabis is to ever become

gonna have to step up and invest in the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.080 
gonna have to step up and invest in the
kind<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:06.910> research<00:03:07.240> necessary<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.900> do<00:03:08.050> that
