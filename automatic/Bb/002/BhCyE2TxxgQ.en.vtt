00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 Hello everyone today we have in the review article 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.010
 parking system flashpoint 400 and 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.340
 which went on sale in this 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.530
 month namely in march 2013 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.660
 parking is unique and has a number 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.600
 the advantages of which I will now try 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.970
 tell you the first thing you want 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.640
 note this is a new anti-glare 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.140
 matrix display informing the driver 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.580
 obstacles drinking in various ways 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.009
 display adjustment is possible as in 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.320
 vertical and horizontal 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.630
 position a universal way 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.430
 mounting the display allow it 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.340
 organically fit into any interior 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.489
 car and also set this 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.160
 display either on the car dashboard or 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.590
 on the windshield 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.020
 the size of this display is about eight 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.620
 centimeters wide it is also smaller 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.859
 became than the model 400 z from the same 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.530
 producer note scotch 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.140
 he is here the 3rd mask that says that 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.250
 temperature drops will not affect 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.400
 reliability of fastening of this display 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.729
 the system received a new control unit 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.460
 the company left the customers wishes as well 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.290
 installers and made a number of changes was 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.290
 plastic case added 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.520
 connecting all the wires coming from the unit 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.400
 in a single cashier 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.619
 this will eliminate false appeal 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.850
 in service and securely fasten the wires 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.100
 the system was also first implemented 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.030
 model in which the display and buzzer 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.400
 divorced into separate components all this 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.520
 affected the expansion of the functional 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.570
 parking and the possibility of two systems 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.869
 create 8 tooth rear parking admissible 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.439
 the display will respond and the front will 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.920
 answer 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.290
 buzzer sensors themselves have not undergone 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.649
 no changes are all the same sensors 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:07.140
 which are used in 400 z and parking 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:09.599
 800 same as i said the system now 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.110
 disconnected display works separately a 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.170
 there was also such a buzzer 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.330
 he has double sided tape enough 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.520
 long wire you do not connect it 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.770
 directly because to connect it 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.960
 need to use an adapter which 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.540
 also included as you see 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.420
 there is no way out for him there 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.590
 hooked up but here there is such 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.300
 adapter which is also provided 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.050
 fuse you connect start 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.930
 him and then directly 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.550
 connect to it yourself zoom 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.550
 I want to note that here you can 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.709
 adjust both pitch and volume 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.510
 this buzzer actually function 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.610
 very comfortable i think everyone who 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.600
 will put this system will this 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.370
 function to use it here 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.130
 the switches on the measurement are two separate 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.160
 one is responsible for there the other is responsible for 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.880
 volume as it looks live 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.030
 how this display displays the information you 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.950
 can watch at the end of this video 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:20.269
 I think it will be interesting to you if you 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:23.140
 want to put yourself in a good system 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.140
 river of luck 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.540
 volume and tone are regulated
