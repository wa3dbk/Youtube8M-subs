00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
like these young guys who play all the

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.850 
like these young guys who play all the
time<00:01:41.569> my<00:01:42.569> goal<00:01:42.780> was<00:01:42.929> to<00:01:42.990> build<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.289> bankroll<00:01:43.590> so

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
time my goal was to build a bankroll so

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
time my goal was to build a bankroll so
that<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.130> can<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.789> have<00:01:45.569> fun<00:01:45.810> when<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.049> was

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
that it can you know have fun when I was

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870 
that it can you know have fun when I was
older<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.590> that's<00:01:46.679> what<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> worked<00:01:47.520> hard<00:01:47.759> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
older and that's what I worked hard to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.639 
older and that's what I worked hard to
do<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> don't<00:01:48.899> play<00:01:49.049> as<00:01:49.170> much<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.500> did

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
do and so I don't play as much as I did

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.270

is one of the big guys who is one of the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.730 
is one of the big guys who is one of the
teachers<00:02:05.700> there<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.349> as<00:02:07.349> far<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:07.619> I'm

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
teachers there and as far as I'm

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.169 
teachers there and as far as I'm
concerned<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> best<00:02:08.459> way<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> learn<00:02:08.819> you

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
concerned it's the best way to learn you

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.850 
concerned it's the best way to learn you
know<00:02:09.299> learn<00:02:09.509> from<00:02:09.720> others<00:02:09.989> as<00:02:10.380> far<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:10.709> me

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
know learn from others as far as me

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.080 
know learn from others as far as me
doing<00:02:11.069> tutorials<00:02:11.340> I've<00:02:11.580> done<00:02:11.760> some<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.000> that

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
doing tutorials I've done some of that

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.000 
doing tutorials I've done some of that
in<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.239> past<00:02:12.390> but<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.230> truth<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.620> with<00:02:13.829> poker

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
in the past but the truth is with poker

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.830 
in the past but the truth is with poker
BTW<00:02:14.400> i<00:02:14.430> just<00:02:14.730> find<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.060> like<00:02:15.239> most<00:02:15.570> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
BTW i just find it like most the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.330 
BTW i just find it like most the
knowledge<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.200> i<00:02:16.350> have<00:02:16.560> i've<00:02:16.890> put<00:02:17.130> into<00:02:17.310> that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
knowledge that i have i've put into that

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.670 
knowledge that i have i've put into that
so<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:18.269> just<00:02:18.450> makes<00:02:18.600> more<00:02:18.720> sense<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:19.170> sign

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
so it just makes more sense to just sign

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.840 
so it just makes more sense to just sign
up<00:02:19.709> there

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.860 

I<00:02:24.770> have<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> lot<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.210> memories<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.570> Mirage

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.060 
in Las Vegas because that's where i
would<00:02:30.300> like<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.660> sweat<00:02:30.990> blood<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.320> tears<00:02:31.650> and

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070
