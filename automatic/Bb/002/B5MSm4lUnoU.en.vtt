and then typing paper and throwing it
into<00:00:36.060> the<00:00:36.150> garbage<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.900> but<00:00:37.140> all<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.350> does<00:00:37.500> is

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
into the garbage can but all it does is

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.260 
into the garbage can but all it does is
keep<00:00:37.770> stinking<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.430> stinking<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.940> sinking

is<00:01:44.549> stuck<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.830> facing<00:01:46.830> up<00:01:47.280> can't<00:01:47.790> move

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
is stuck like this facing up can't move

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.510 
is stuck like this facing up can't move
he'll<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.750> probably<00:01:49.080> starts<00:01:49.320> stinking<00:01:49.740> now<00:01:49.890> so

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
he'll it probably starts stinking now so

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.280 
he'll it probably starts stinking now so
what<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.450> fold<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> tape<00:01:52.020> over

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
what you do is you fold the tape over

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.980 
what you do is you fold the tape over
and<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:53.070> squeeze<00:01:53.580> off<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.060> edges<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and then squeeze off the edges so the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.350 
and then squeeze off the edges so the
sting<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.590> get<00:01:55.830> out<00:01:56.010> and<00:01:56.220> there<00:01:56.970> you<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.150> it

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
sting can get out and there you have it

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.000 
sting can get out and there you have it
then<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.869> take<00:01:58.080> this<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:58.530> chuck<00:01:58.860> it

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
then you just take this and chuck it

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.300 
then you just take this and chuck it
into<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.430> garbage<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.970> that's<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.659> there<00:02:00.960> is

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
into the garbage and that's all there is

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.520 
into the garbage and that's all there is
so<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:03.210> know<00:02:03.330> many<00:02:03.689> people<00:02:03.990> say<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.380> is

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
so you know many people say this is

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.620 
so you know many people say this is
cruel<00:02:04.890> with<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> thing<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.060> there<00:02:06.270> still

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
cruel with the thing in there still

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.440 
cruel with the thing in there still
living<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.260> guess<00:02:07.650> if<00:02:08.159> you<00:02:08.670> want<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.179> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
living so I guess if you want to you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.350 
living so I guess if you want to you
could<00:02:09.690> kind<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:11.000> squeeze<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.180> between

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
could kind of like squeeze in between

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.390 
could kind of like squeeze in between
your<00:02:12.720> two<00:02:12.900> fingers<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.560> and

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
your two fingers like this and

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.490 
your two fingers like this and
frensham<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.060> don't<00:02:15.299> like<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.450> do<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.900> so

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
frensham but I don't like to do that so

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.350 
frensham but I don't like to do that so
I<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:16.860> leave<00:02:17.069> them<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.579> tape<00:02:18.120> like<00:02:18.329> this

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
I just leave them in the tape like this

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.240 
I just leave them in the tape like this
throw<00:02:18.840> them<00:02:18.959> in<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.110> garbage<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.709> that

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
throw them in the garbage and that

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.860 
throw them in the garbage and that
solves<00:02:20.790> all<00:02:20.879> of<00:02:20.970> my<00:02:21.420> common<00:02:21.900> wish<00:02:22.049> he<00:02:22.230> problems
