00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello again my name is vladimir 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.890
 camus 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.580
 and in this video we continue 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.490
 learn the basics of 7 s and in this case we 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.219
 install with that control the zoom on 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.289
 hosting in my practice lately 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.080
 time I increasingly began 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.369
 use this approach when 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.189
 development of a new site is going on 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.500
 immediately on real hosting this 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.260
 advantageous for at least one reason 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.810
 because developing on real 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.809
 hosting your client will be able to immediately 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.149
 see results your work and when 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.210
 need to move the site 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.579
 sometimes it does n't even need to be done 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.980
 If the customer orders services 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.309
 hosting you like often in my 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.969
 case so i forget show in 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.780
 this time on the example of use 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.420
 hosting Ukraine 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.170
 what I want to say about this hosting temple 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.050
 very comfortable and reliable at the same time 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.619
 serves support works promptly and 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.070
 if any difficulties arise 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:11.159
 work immediately help are solved 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.049
 questions very quickly so that 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.470
 start working with hosting needed 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.110
 initial login we go in and how 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.159
 see not included two-factor 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.360
 authorization 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.640
 sms does not come to the phone and I drive 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.579
 secret number is already my next and turn 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.860
 in the control panel 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.259
 here's what it looks like here are all my sites and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.970
 in order to create a new site 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.740
 go to the hosting section 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:49.240
 my sites add a new site indicate that 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:54.360
 This is our Dima Juma site, for example, we write 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:58.320
 so djuma dima dot com 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.890
 he himself actually this site he is any available 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:09.000
 this address means juma smoke 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 dot com will be created by the test house 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.920
 here is called the service address here by 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.160
 now you can see this address 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.990
 this site and the result of our work 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.020
 as we already know we need 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.400
 first download all our files 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.860
 installer on our series therefore 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.990
 go to the file manager hosting 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.010
 have to wait a little bit because u 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.170
 us hosting our system creates everything 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.920
 the necessary directories at this point are her 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.530
 it takes some time, let's 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.690
 let's wait now the system welcomes us 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.510
 talk about all of us being created 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.420
 moving on let's update the folder 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.830
 see what appeared in front of the directory 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.440
 Juma Dima dot com 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:04.140
 immediately remove unnecessary files from here 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:08.530
 and now we can upload files to the server 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:13.540
 select the previously downloaded installer and 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:18.040
 we wait for loading in the meantime 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:23.610
 go even such a control panel 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:26.890
 hosting and choose a section 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:32.110
 database let's create new database 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.490
 data indicate that we have a database 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.320
 jumbo 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.300
 encoding is general seo and perhaps 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.970
 there is a tick to create a user with 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.630
 with the same name and full access to the database 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.560
 data 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.050
 we see here the process of creating significantly 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.380
 easier also pay attention to the host 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.920
 database is no longer a localhost like 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:00.880
 we see this option we look that we 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:06.240
 going on here almost booted 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:10.030
 and fine now we highlight our archive and 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.280
 we select functions to unpack archive goes 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.650
 unpacking everything we have successfully 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.130
 unpacked let's update this 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.280
 page and us immediately starts 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.580
 the installer as before we have 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.540
 three steps last time I didn't say that 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.890
 here 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.210
 submission list, you can select Russian 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.610
 maybe it will be easier for you 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.370
 find out what data and where you need 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.740
 therefore enter the old fashioned way 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.170
 Joomla 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:45.550
 we specify the email address login 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:49.720
 admin and password 123456 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.870
 repeat the password 123456 move on 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:58.020
 click on the button then select the type 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:00.300
 sql database server database 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.159
 such an option 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:11.610
 databases and user have 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:17.699
 called this way and the password here 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:20.990
 so here we press further if or all 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:23.940
 the data is correct and again 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.879
 we set the default option for home 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.909
 data that is, we smoke data 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:32.490
 we will not install 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.900
 we put everything in silence if you 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.479
 some difficulties arise in the process 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.409
 installation in the last step check 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:45.389
 so that everything is at the level that is 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:48.479
 most checks and requirements for 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:51.210
 the server here and we were included and not 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.030
 there were some red highlight 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.270
 who wouldn't let us commit 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.330
 installation if everyone will click 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:04.940
 installation and going very fast 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:07.940
 installation control system so remove 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.940
 installation 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:22.170
 using the file manager and go 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:25.620
 superman control panel 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:29.790
 This is how the control panel looks 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:33.850
 we have already seen and so here it looks 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:36.070
 frontend as you can see nothing complicated in 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:39.280
 installing control systems on a hosting 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:42.660
 also no takes it no more 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:46.540
 less time about the same and 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:49.870
 the process of working the north is also not much 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:52.210
 harder than developing websites 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.910
 local and on this i will finish 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.600
 and see you in the next lessons 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.600
 Yes soon
