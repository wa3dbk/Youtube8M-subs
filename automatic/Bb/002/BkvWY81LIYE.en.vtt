bulb<00:00:15.420> with<00:00:16.080> an<00:00:16.230> LED<00:00:16.379> bulb<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.340> basically<00:00:17.699> just

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
bulb with an LED bulb so basically just

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.679 
bulb with an LED bulb so basically just
take<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:19.070> just<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.160> very<00:00:20.369> thin<00:00:20.640> flat<00:00:21.480> head

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
take a just a very thin flat head

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.050 
take a just a very thin flat head
screwdriver<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.470> stick<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.820> little

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
screwdriver you stick it in this little

screwdriver you stick it in this little
notch<00:00:24.210> right<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.830> then<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.300> pry<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.330> out

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
notch right here then you pry it out

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.450 
notch right here then you pry it out
very<00:00:28.230> slowly<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.460> pull<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.760> down<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.599> there's

very slowly and pull it down and there's

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.580 
very slowly and pull it down and there's
there's<00:00:32.460> an<00:00:32.850> entire<00:00:33.329> plastic<00:00:33.960> piece<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
there's an entire plastic piece in the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.330 
there's an entire plastic piece in the
back<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.579> wiggle<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.510> little<00:00:36.690> bit<00:00:37.340> it

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
back you just wiggle it a little bit it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.540 
back you just wiggle it a little bit it
should<00:00:38.640> fall<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:41.280> one

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
should fall out you can see it's one

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.299 
should fall out you can see it's one
entire<00:00:41.910> plastic<00:00:42.329> piece<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:44.219> it

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
entire plastic piece so do not do it

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.880 
entire plastic piece so do not do it
slowly<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.730> don't<00:00:44.850> break<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.710> okay<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:48.210> now

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
slowly and don't break it okay so now

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.610 
slowly and don't break it okay so now
here's<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.920> bulb<00:00:50.270> just<00:00:51.270> again<00:00:52.050> probably<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
here's the bulb just again probably the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.229 
here's the bulb just again probably the
bulk<00:00:52.829> out<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.690> middle<00:00:54.989> there's<00:00:56.239> metal

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
bulk out of the middle there's metal

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.529 
bulk out of the middle there's metal
pins<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> already<00:00:58.739> did<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.399> this<00:01:00.359> is

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
pins so I already did this one this is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.859 
pins so I already did this one this is
LED<00:01:01.020> based<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.570> one<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.170> an<00:01:04.409> LED<00:01:04.710> based

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
LED based and this one is an LED based

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.940 
LED based and this one is an LED based
let<00:01:06.869> me<00:01:06.930> put<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.170> back<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
let me put it back so you can see the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
let me put it back so you can see the
difference<00:01:08.310> between<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.820> two<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.479> terms

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
difference between the two and in terms

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.469 
difference between the two and in terms
of<00:01:09.840> how<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.229> light<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:11.090> this<00:01:12.090> thing<00:01:12.270> gets

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
of how they light up this thing gets

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.590 
of how they light up this thing gets
pretty<00:01:12.720> hot<00:01:13.610> okay<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.680> non<00:01:16.680> LED<00:01:17.600> LED

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
pretty hot okay so on this non LED LED

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:28.969 
pretty hot okay so on this non LED LED
yellow<00:01:19.380> much<00:01:20.130> more<00:01:20.340> wider

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.919 

okay<00:01:30.689> now<00:01:31.689> this<00:01:31.810> is<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:32.999> this<00:01:33.999> is<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.240> led<00:01:34.749> one

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
okay now this is the this is the led one

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.050 
okay now this is the this is the led one
should<00:01:37.929> have<00:01:38.020> had<00:01:38.109> more<00:01:38.259> light<00:01:38.469> in<00:01:38.619> here

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
should have had more light in here

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.319 
should have had more light in here
anyway

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
anyway

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.270 
anyway
it's<00:01:40.750> got<00:01:40.899> six<00:01:41.109> LEDs<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:41.799> bought<00:01:41.920> it<00:01:42.039> off<00:01:42.130> at

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
it's got six LEDs and bought it off at

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.440 
it's got six LEDs and bought it off at
eBay

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
eBay

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.709 
eBay

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
I believe these say can bus very cheap

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.589 
I believe these say can bus very cheap

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:02.379 
anyway let's see let's see how they work

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:20.960 
anyway let's see let's see how they work
okay<00:02:18.690> hope<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.900> works

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
okay hope it works

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:55.710 
okay hope it works
the<00:02:21.970> other<00:02:22.150> one<00:02:22.359> did<00:02:25.799> and<00:02:26.799> it<00:02:26.980> works<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:55.209> want<00:02:55.660> to

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
the other one did and it works I want to

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.830 
the other one did and it works I want to
make<00:02:55.840> sure<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.169> after<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.530> put<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.799> in<00:02:57.840> that

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
make sure that after you put it in that

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.740 
make sure that after you put it in that
you<00:02:59.200> can<00:03:00.010> turn<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.280> on<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.609> off<00:03:00.760> by<00:03:01.540> pressing

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
you can turn it on and off by pressing

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.360 
you can turn it on and off by pressing
on<00:03:01.989> it<00:03:03.150> now<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.569> real<00:03:04.599> thing<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:06.069> make<00:03:06.220> sure

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
on it now the real thing is to make sure

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.979 
on it now the real thing is to make sure
that<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.700> ons<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.359> offs<00:03:07.450> when<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.840> door

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
that it ons and offs when the door

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.479 
that it ons and offs when the door
closes<00:03:08.500> because<00:03:10.049> there's<00:03:11.049> a<00:03:11.109> delay<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.769> mean

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
closes because there's a delay I mean

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.039 
closes because there's a delay I mean
you<00:03:12.760> know<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:12.970> dims<00:03:13.209> so<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:13.720> want<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:13.959> make

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
you know it dims so you want to make

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.379
