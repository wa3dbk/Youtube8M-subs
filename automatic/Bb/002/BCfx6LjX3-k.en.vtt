00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.059
 Hello 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.759
 after being asked by some people 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.260
 As you come back from 17 to 16 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.449
 Today I'll show how it works 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.279
 First you need a program for it 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.869
 you do not necessarily need it but it is 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.990
 easier than I have any left with 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.939
 to pick out a program called ip is 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.170
 how downloader can you can 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.599
 download at chip 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.880
 the links will link there for 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.110
 windows and for mac if you like that 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.090
 then you can download it 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.870
 Just start and you can your device 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.960
 choose 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:45.090
 some, for example, iphone 5 gsm 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.289
 ticket through os 6.1 point 4 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.360
 which could also download all 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.940
 but other download the downgrade 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.739

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.050

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.230

 because not downgrade in any case 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.590
