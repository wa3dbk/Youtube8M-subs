the<00:01:01.590> next<00:01:01.800> thing<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.160> bought<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.760> my<00:01:03.270> Rimmel

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the next thing I bought is my Rimmel

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.320 
the next thing I bought is my Rimmel
exaggerated<00:01:04.500> liquid<00:01:05.070> eyeliner<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.119> never

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
exaggerated liquid eyeliner and I never

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.910 
exaggerated liquid eyeliner and I never
really<00:01:06.630> use<00:01:06.810> liquid<00:01:07.049> eyeliners<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.740> I

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
really use liquid eyeliners and I

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.320 
really use liquid eyeliners and I
thought<00:01:08.100> let<00:01:08.310> me<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.580> go<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.820> give<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.180> go

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
thought let me just go and give it a go

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.810 
thought let me just go and give it a go
again<00:01:09.630> because<00:01:10.380> i<00:01:10.530> used<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.010> use<00:01:11.040> them<00:01:11.520> when<00:01:11.790> I

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
again because i used to use them when I

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.510 
again because i used to use them when I
was<00:01:11.970> about<00:01:12.119> 16<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.229> then<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.920> obviously<00:01:14.280> moved

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
was about 16 and then I obviously moved

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.310 
was about 16 and then I obviously moved
on to<00:01:14.790> gel<00:01:15.000> liners<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.810> find<00:01:16.080> them<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
on to gel liners and I just find them a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.100 
on to gel liners and I just find them a
lot<00:01:16.619> easier<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.189> apply<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:18.210> because<00:01:18.630> they're

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
lot easier to apply just because they're

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.320 
lot easier to apply just because they're
lot<00:01:19.259> smoother<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.159> use<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> brush<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.150> I've

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
lot smoother and I use a brush and I've

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.749 
lot smoother and I use a brush and I've
just<00:01:21.479> got<00:01:21.720> used<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.320> method<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.700> I'm

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
just got used for that method and so I'm

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.760 
just got used for that method and so I'm
going<00:01:24.119> back<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.750> i'm<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> give

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
going back to this i'm going to give

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.370 
going back to this i'm going to give

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.590 
really like this because it reminds me
of<00:01:36.720> my<00:01:37.049> NARS<00:01:37.350> chihuahua<00:01:38.159> lip<00:01:38.310> gloss<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.790> also

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
of my NARS chihuahua lip gloss and also

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.390 
of my NARS chihuahua lip gloss and also
I<00:01:39.810> don't<00:01:40.020> really<00:01:40.350> wear<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> lot<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> lip<00:01:41.130> glosses

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.730 
I don't really wear a lot of lip glosses
that<00:01:41.700> often<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:43.079> think<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.500> nice

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
really different I never really wear

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.770 
really different I never really wear
like<00:02:17.959> Pink's<00:02:19.030> lilacs<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.300> stuff<00:02:20.569> like<00:02:20.720> that

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
like Pink's lilacs and stuff like that

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.839 
like Pink's lilacs and stuff like that

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.220 
so it's just different for me and I'm
just<00:02:22.880> trying<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.239> give<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.540> go<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.959> love

just trying to give it a go and I love
the<00:02:24.440> texture<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.069> pigments<00:02:25.610> of<00:02:25.730> them<00:02:25.849> all
