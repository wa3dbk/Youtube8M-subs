evaluation because prese so there are

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.600 
evaluation because prese so there are

older disciplines and nowadays we are

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.530 
older disciplines and nowadays we are
rethinking<00:02:05.320> about<00:02:05.440> all<00:02:06.010> of<00:02:06.190> these

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
rethinking about all of these

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.240 
rethinking about all of these

traditional methods because with
electronic<00:02:09.880> records<00:02:09.970> but<00:02:10.899> also<00:02:10.929> our

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
electronic records but also our

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.510 
electronic records but also our
sensitivity<00:02:12.730> as<00:02:13.440> 21st<00:02:14.440> century<00:02:14.920> individuals

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
sensitivity as 21st century individuals

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.050 
sensitivity as 21st century individuals
we<00:02:16.300> tend<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.720> value<00:02:16.930> our<00:02:17.380> other<00:02:17.709> things<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.760> so

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
we tend to value our other things and so

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.120 
we tend to value our other things and so
we<00:02:19.750> are<00:02:20.260> kind<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:21.070> reorienting<00:02:21.940> our

we are kind of reorienting our

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.910 
we are kind of reorienting our
traditional<00:02:24.130> tools<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.660> it's<00:02:25.840> very<00:02:26.050> exciting

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
traditional tools so it's very exciting
