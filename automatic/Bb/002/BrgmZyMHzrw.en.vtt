something<00:00:00.630> that<00:00:00.810> every<00:00:01.230> driver<00:00:01.530> should<00:00:02.070> have

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
something that every driver should have

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.869 
something that every driver should have
in<00:00:02.610> their<00:00:03.270> repertoire<00:00:03.720> because<00:00:04.259> because<00:00:05.250> it's

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
in their repertoire because because it's

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.960 
in their repertoire because because it's
a<00:00:06.060> it's<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.420> manipulation<00:00:07.220> you<00:00:08.220> do<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.550> even

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
a it's a manipulation you do it even

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.820 
a it's a manipulation you do it even
when<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.210> have<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> car<00:00:09.690> that's<00:00:09.870> balanced<00:00:10.380> he

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
when you have a car that's balanced he

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.650 
when you have a car that's balanced he
will<00:00:10.980> know<00:00:11.160> he's<00:00:11.340> got<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.550> light<00:00:11.849> front<00:00:12.179> end<00:00:12.420> and

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
will know he's got a light front end and

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.860 
will know he's got a light front end and
I<00:00:13.380> work<00:00:13.650> on<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.340> great<00:00:15.030> deal<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.509> them<00:00:15.690> when

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
I work on this a great deal of them when

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.320 
I work on this a great deal of them when
you<00:00:15.960> get<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.260> very<00:00:16.619> top<00:00:16.680> end<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.880> racing

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
you get to the very top end of a racing

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.880 
you get to the very top end of a racing
driver<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.410> say<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.830> course

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
driver and that is to say of course

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.109 
driver and that is to say of course
you've<00:00:20.250> always<00:00:20.340> got<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.609> be<00:00:20.670> prepared<00:00:21.060> for

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
you've always got to be prepared for

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.840 
you've always got to be prepared for
what's<00:00:21.390> coming<00:00:21.449> next<00:00:21.920> but<00:00:22.920> that's<00:00:23.670> that's

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
what's coming next but that's that's

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.210 
what's coming next but that's that's
part<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> structure<00:00:24.990> braking<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.130> on

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
part of the structure braking and so on

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.710 
part of the structure braking and so on
but<00:00:26.400> when<00:00:26.670> you're<00:00:26.820> coming<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.359> corner

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
but when you're coming up to a corner

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.130 
but when you're coming up to a corner
you<00:00:28.439> know<00:00:28.800> say<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.760> downforce<00:00:30.359> corner<00:00:30.779> you

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
you know say it's a downforce corner you

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.170 
you know say it's a downforce corner you
know<00:00:31.439> you're<00:00:31.679> going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> have<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.550> little<00:00:33.120> bit

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
know you're going to have a little bit

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.700 
know you're going to have a little bit
of<00:00:33.270> push<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> other<00:00:33.809> side<00:00:34.079> because<00:00:34.530> you've

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
of push on the other side because you've

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.590 
of push on the other side because you've
lost<00:00:34.890> your<00:00:35.130> front<00:00:35.370> wing<00:00:35.579> or<00:00:35.850> or<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.360> lost<00:00:36.540> some

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
lost your front wing or or it lost some

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.920 
lost your front wing or or it lost some
downforce<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.790> before<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.180> happens<00:00:39.660> you

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
downforce and before that happens you

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.799 
downforce and before that happens you
you<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.739> predict<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:42.030> sort<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.329> angle

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you have to predict what sort of angle

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.260 
you have to predict what sort of angle
you're<00:00:42.960> gonna<00:00:43.079> want<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.250> car<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> there

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
you're gonna want on the car and there

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.229 
you're gonna want on the car and there
be<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> point<00:00:45.719> perhaps<00:00:45.989> you're<00:00:47.120> brushing<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
be a point perhaps you're brushing the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.360 
be a point perhaps you're brushing the
brakes<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.780> little<00:00:49.350> bit<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.680> into<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.950> corner

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
brakes a little bit going into a corner

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.790 
brakes a little bit going into a corner
and<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:51.120> will<00:00:51.270> at<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.750> point<00:00:52.110> before<00:00:52.320> you've

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and you will at that point before you've

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.770 
and you will at that point before you've
got<00:00:52.980> anywhere<00:00:53.280> near<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> apex<00:00:53.610> put<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
got anywhere near the apex put on the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.740 
got anywhere near the apex put on the
additional<00:00:55.469> bit<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.800> steering<00:00:56.070> maybe<00:00:56.940> hold<00:00:57.600> on

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
additional bit of steering maybe hold on

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.630 
additional bit of steering maybe hold on
to<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> brake<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> fraction<00:00:58.949> longer<00:00:59.430> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
to the brake for a fraction longer and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.500 
to the brake for a fraction longer and
get<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> direction<00:01:00.690> change<00:01:01.250> beef<00:01:02.250> before<00:01:02.760> what

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
get a direction change beef before what

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.570 
get a direction change beef before what
one<00:01:03.690> would<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:03.899> called<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> normal<00:01:04.650> apex

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
one would have called the normal apex

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.120 
one would have called the normal apex
because<00:01:06.510> you're<00:01:06.720> thinking<00:01:07.170> will<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.380> I've<00:01:07.830> now

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
because you're thinking will be I've now

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.730 
because you're thinking will be I've now
lost<00:01:08.369> downforce<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> front<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:10.260> longer

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
lost downforce on the front the longer

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.520 
lost downforce on the front the longer
any<00:01:10.920> corner<00:01:11.430> goes<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.570> more<00:01:12.930> time<00:01:13.320> I'm

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
any corner goes on the more time I'm

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.249 
any corner goes on the more time I'm
comparatively<00:01:14.430> going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.360> lose<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.049> same

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
comparatively going to lose the same

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.990 
comparatively going to lose the same
tactic<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.799> use<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.189> your<00:01:17.310> front<00:01:17.490> tires<00:01:17.759> are

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
tactic you use if your front tires are

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.820 
tactic you use if your front tires are
starting<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.509> off<00:01:18.540> why<00:01:19.290> would<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.590> want<00:01:19.770> to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
starting to go off why would I want to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.679 
starting to go off why would I want to
go<00:01:19.979> fast<00:01:20.250> around<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> corner<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.060> ask<00:01:21.330> more

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
go fast around the corner and ask more

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.490 
go fast around the corner and ask more
of<00:01:21.720> them<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.560> simply<00:01:23.840> before<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.380> to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
of them so you simply before you get to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.740 
of them so you simply before you get to
your<00:01:25.590> apex<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.310> put<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> little<00:01:27.509> bit<00:01:27.659> more

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
your apex you put on a little bit more

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.240 
your apex you put on a little bit more
steering<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.380> may<00:01:28.590> stay<00:01:28.829> off<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> throttle

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
steering you may stay off the throttle

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.969 
steering you may stay off the throttle
for<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.579> little<00:01:29.759> bit<00:01:29.880> longer<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.869> may<00:01:31.229> stay

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
for a little bit longer but you may stay

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.649 
for a little bit longer but you may stay
on<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> brake<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.670> fraction<00:01:33.030> longer<00:01:33.450> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
on the brake just a fraction longer and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.870 
on the brake just a fraction longer and
make<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> bit<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.619> point<00:01:35.070> where<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> car<00:01:35.579> can

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
make a bit of a point where the car can

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.179 
make a bit of a point where the car can
change<00:01:36.180> direction<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.930> little<00:01:37.380> bit<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> 50

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
change direction a little bit like a 50

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.580 
change direction a little bit like a 50
pence<00:01:38.400> piece<00:01:38.729> rather<00:01:39.420> than<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> constant<00:01:40.320> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
pence piece rather than a constant you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.859 
pence piece rather than a constant you
and<00:01:40.860> then<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.790> remainder<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.450> corner

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
and then the remainder of that corner

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.569

with<00:03:01.110> drivers<00:03:01.620> when<00:03:02.370> they<00:03:02.519> get<00:03:02.910> all<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.299> other

structures<00:03:03.870> stuff<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.319> there<00:03:04.530> if<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.160> start

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
structures stuff in there if you start

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.520 
structures stuff in there if you start
doing<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.849> before<00:03:06.630> they've<00:03:06.810> got<00:03:06.989> there<00:03:07.200> no

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
doing it before they've got there no

doing it before they've got there no
that's<00:03:07.950> great<00:03:08.099> we<00:03:08.280> just<00:03:08.489> do<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> track<00:03:09.239> Speedway

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660

corner<00:03:23.489> that's<00:03:23.670> completely<00:03:24.269> flat<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.720> you

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
corner that's completely flat and you

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.699 
corner that's completely flat and you
really<00:03:25.290> don't<00:03:25.590> want<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.640> lift<00:03:27.209> at<00:03:27.690> all<00:03:28.019> then

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
really don't want to lift at all then

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.800 
really don't want to lift at all then
you<00:03:29.160> would<00:03:29.280> just<00:03:29.519> start<00:03:29.790> turning<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.329> wheel<00:03:30.540> a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
you would just start turning the wheel a

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.140 
you would just start turning the wheel a
little<00:03:31.380> bit<00:03:31.500> sooner<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.430> little<00:03:32.760> bit<00:03:32.940> more

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
little bit sooner and a little bit more

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.940 
little bit sooner and a little bit more
so<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.900> get<00:03:34.019> your<00:03:34.170> understeer<00:03:34.709> out<00:03:34.859> of

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
so that you get your understeer out of

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.590 
so that you get your understeer out of
the<00:03:35.010> way<00:03:35.100> you'll<00:03:35.280> put<00:03:35.459> on<00:03:35.489> say<00:03:35.760> five<00:03:36.239> degrees

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
the way you'll put on say five degrees

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.120 
the way you'll put on say five degrees
of<00:03:36.750> extra<00:03:37.019> steering<00:03:37.380> on<00:03:37.500> making<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.859> number

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
of extra steering on making the number

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.059 
of extra steering on making the number
up<00:03:38.280> for<00:03:38.850> about<00:03:39.269> two<00:03:39.329> degrees<00:03:40.069> direction

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
up for about two degrees direction

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.379 
up for about two degrees direction
change<00:03:41.310> because<00:03:41.609> you're<00:03:41.760> gonna<00:03:41.880> lose<00:03:42.120> some<00:03:42.359> of

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
change because you're gonna lose some of

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.000 
change because you're gonna lose some of
that<00:03:42.510> I'm<00:03:42.690> making<00:03:43.049> that<00:03:43.200> number<00:03:43.380> up<00:03:43.650> as<00:03:43.799> well

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
that I'm making that number up as well

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.640 
that I'm making that number up as well
and<00:03:44.250> all<00:03:45.120> you're<00:03:45.480> looking<00:03:45.750> for<00:03:46.019> is<00:03:46.260> the

and all you're looking for is the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.770 
and all you're looking for is the
shortest<00:03:47.130> corner<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.579> possibly<00:03:48.000> can<00:03:48.239> because

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
shortest corner you possibly can because

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.750 
shortest corner you possibly can because
you're<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:49.590> trouble<00:03:49.769> same<00:03:50.100> with<00:03:50.250> warm<00:03:50.459> front

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
you're in trouble same with warm front

you're in trouble same with warm front

you almost developer a block system of

you'd be amazed how little time you can
lose<00:03:58.799> but<00:03:59.519> that's<00:04:00.180> in<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.870> gift<00:04:01.109> of<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.350> Kimi

with the tire well first thing that you

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.840 
with the tire well first thing that you

what you can get out of it you've got a

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.969 
what you can get out of it you've got a

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
make a mistake with them but you will

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.510

get<00:05:52.669> that<00:05:53.060> that<00:05:53.330> feeling<00:05:54.050> yeah<00:05:54.470> a<00:05:54.500> driver<00:05:55.220> will

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
get that that feeling yeah a driver will

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.730 
get that that feeling yeah a driver will
just<00:05:55.729> push<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.180> throttle<00:05:56.570> and<00:05:56.750> maybe<00:05:57.530> it

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
just push the throttle and maybe it

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.170 
just push the throttle and maybe it
could<00:05:57.860> even<00:05:58.040> be<00:05:58.160> half<00:05:58.340> throttle<00:05:58.550> 3/4<00:05:59.030> throttle

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
on the exit of a slow corner you'll turn

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.860 
on the exit of a slow corner you'll turn
the<00:06:01.580> wheel<00:06:01.850> in<00:06:02.030> a<00:06:02.120> certain<00:06:02.510> way<00:06:02.660> at<00:06:02.780> a<00:06:02.840> certain

the wheel in a certain way at a certain
speed<00:06:03.410> and<00:06:03.530> you'll<00:06:03.740> get<00:06:03.830> a<00:06:03.890> better<00:06:04.070> turn<00:06:04.370> and

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
speed and you'll get a better turn and

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.250 
speed and you'll get a better turn and
then<00:06:04.669> what<00:06:04.760> he<00:06:04.820> thought<00:06:05.000> and<00:06:05.270> when<00:06:05.840> he<00:06:05.900> gets<00:06:06.110> to

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
then what he thought and when he gets to

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.500 
then what he thought and when he gets to
the<00:06:06.410> full<00:06:06.620> racing<00:06:07.010> corner<00:06:07.310> the<00:06:07.430> next<00:06:07.460> time<00:06:07.850> he

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
the full racing corner the next time he

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.340 
the full racing corner the next time he
will<00:06:08.930> know<00:06:09.410> how<00:06:10.070> hard<00:06:11.000> or<00:06:11.360> soft<00:06:11.630> to<00:06:11.900> turn<00:06:12.140> that

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
will know how hard or soft to turn that

break five minutes later here no on
the<00:07:17.409> brake<00:07:17.620> because<00:07:18.039> and<00:07:18.310> you<00:07:18.400> move<00:07:18.580> your<00:07:18.729> body

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 
the brake because and you move your body

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:21.360 
the brake because and you move your body
different<00:07:19.270> so<00:07:19.599> what<00:07:20.229> one<00:07:20.439> has<00:07:20.620> to<00:07:20.770> do<00:07:20.919> what<00:07:21.279> do

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.370 
different so what one has to do what do

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.189 
different so what one has to do what do
you<00:07:21.430> mean<00:07:21.669> by<00:07:21.939> move<00:07:22.360> your<00:07:22.539> body<00:07:22.689> differently

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 
you mean by move your body differently

you mean by move your body differently
there<00:07:24.099> that<00:07:24.219> is<00:07:24.339> that<00:07:24.610> is<00:07:24.729> decide<00:07:25.509> to<00:07:25.779> punch

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:26.740 
there that is that is decide to punch

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.809 
there that is that is decide to punch
the<00:07:26.860> brake<00:07:27.009> pedal<00:07:27.249> a<00:07:27.310> bit<00:07:27.400> harder<00:07:27.699> because

00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:27.819 
the brake pedal a bit harder because

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:30.839 
the brake pedal a bit harder because
you're<00:07:28.089> arriving<00:07:28.419> faster<00:07:29.020> or<00:07:30.009> punch<00:07:30.699> the

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:30.849 
you're arriving faster or punch the

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:32.249 
you're arriving faster or punch the
floor<00:07:31.029> a<00:07:31.060> bit<00:07:31.240> harder<00:07:31.449> because<00:07:31.539> you<00:07:32.110> think

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:32.259 
floor a bit harder because you think

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:33.959 
floor a bit harder because you think
because<00:07:32.800> you<00:07:32.919> may<00:07:33.069> have<00:07:33.099> a<00:07:33.250> bit<00:07:33.460> more<00:07:33.610> grip<00:07:33.789> and

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:33.969 
because you may have a bit more grip and

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:35.700 
because you may have a bit more grip and
so<00:07:34.120> on<00:07:34.240> usually<00:07:34.960> when<00:07:35.080> you<00:07:35.169> get<00:07:35.259> into<00:07:35.500> a<00:07:35.529> really

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:35.710 
so on usually when you get into a really

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.670 
so on usually when you get into a really
compressed<00:07:36.250> situation<00:07:37.199> people<00:07:38.199> move<00:07:38.500> their

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 
compressed situation people move their

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.170 
compressed situation people move their
bodies<00:07:38.949> and<00:07:39.099> a<00:07:39.129> slightly<00:07:39.339> more<00:07:39.550> rigid<00:07:39.939> and

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:40.180 
bodies and a slightly more rigid and

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.409 
bodies and a slightly more rigid and
abrupt<00:07:40.900> way<00:07:41.139> and<00:07:41.409> what<00:07:42.250> one<00:07:42.789> has<00:07:42.969> to<00:07:43.120> do<00:07:43.270> is

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:43.419 
abrupt way and what one has to do is

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:45.959 
abrupt way and what one has to do is
have<00:07:43.539> a<00:07:43.569> two<00:07:43.870> tier<00:07:44.229> 2<00:07:44.469> level<00:07:44.680> way<00:07:45.310> of<00:07:45.460> driving

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:45.969 
have a two tier 2 level way of driving

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:48.480 
have a two tier 2 level way of driving
where<00:07:46.479> you<00:07:46.719> you<00:07:47.289> separate<00:07:47.740> the<00:07:47.860> fear<00:07:48.099> from<00:07:48.279> the

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:48.490 
where you you separate the fear from the

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.999 
where you you separate the fear from the
field<00:07:48.729> what<00:07:49.000> you<00:07:49.089> see<00:07:49.270> through<00:07:49.419> your<00:07:49.569> visor

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:52.389 
coming at you with the rate you move

do slow but when you're absolutely think
this<00:07:59.169> is<00:07:59.289> the<00:07:59.439> latest<00:07:59.740> I'm<00:07:59.979> gonna<00:08:00.129> break<00:08:00.339> still
