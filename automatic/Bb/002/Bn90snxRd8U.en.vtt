00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
hey what's up everyone has a go this is

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.530 
hey what's up everyone has a go this is
watch<00:00:02.070> and<00:00:02.370> in<00:00:02.669> this<00:00:02.760> video<00:00:03.060> we're<00:00:03.179> doing<00:00:03.210> a

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
watch and in this video we're doing a

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.630 
watch and in this video we're doing a
dedicated<00:00:04.080> battery<00:00:04.890> test<00:00:05.220> comparison

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
dedicated battery test comparison

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.780 
dedicated battery test comparison
between<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.750> Samsung<00:00:07.020> Galaxy<00:00:07.710> s6<00:00:08.160> edge<00:00:08.370> and

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
between the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge and

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.490 
between the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge and
the<00:00:09.059> iPhone<00:00:09.510> 6<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:09.900> what<00:00:10.110> we're<00:00:10.230> going<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.410> do

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
the iPhone 6 so what we're going to do

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.009 
the iPhone 6 so what we're going to do
is<00:00:10.620> test<00:00:10.889> out<00:00:11.099> each<00:00:11.610> smartphone<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.540> really

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
is test out each smartphone and really

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.560 
is test out each smartphone and really
determine<00:00:13.170> which<00:00:14.040> battery<00:00:14.549> lasts<00:00:15.000> longer<00:00:15.360> so

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
determine which battery lasts longer so

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.880 
determine which battery lasts longer so
if<00:00:15.630> you're<00:00:15.750> interested<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.320> let's<00:00:16.770> get

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
if you're interested in that let's get

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.220 
if you're interested in that let's get
right<00:00:17.100> into<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:20.779> now<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> first<00:00:22.050> thing<00:00:22.140> I

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
right into this now the first thing I

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.140 
right into this now the first thing I
would<00:00:22.350> mention<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> battery<00:00:23.430> size<00:00:23.760> on

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
would mention is the battery size on

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.550 
would mention is the battery size on
these<00:00:24.330> two<00:00:24.539> smartphones<00:00:24.869> you're<00:00:25.199> looking<00:00:25.470> at

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
these two smartphones you're looking at

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.070 
these two smartphones you're looking at
a<00:00:25.619> larger<00:00:25.949> overall<00:00:26.099> battery<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.390> s6<00:00:27.570> edge

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
a larger overall battery on the s6 edge

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.650 
a larger overall battery on the s6 edge
about<00:00:28.680> 2600<00:00:29.490> milliamp<00:00:29.670> hours<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
about 2600 milliamp hours on the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.500 
about 2600 milliamp hours on the
standard<00:00:31.080> s6<00:00:31.619> you're<00:00:32.009> looking<00:00:32.279> about<00:00:32.460> 25<00:00:33.000> 50

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
standard s6 you're looking about 25 50

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.120 
standard s6 you're looking about 25 50
milliamp<00:00:33.899> hours<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.620> not<00:00:34.800> much<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.070> a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
milliamp hours so not much of a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.889 
milliamp hours so not much of a
difference<00:00:35.430> between<00:00:35.550> those<00:00:35.940> two<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.750> in

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
difference between those two but in

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.630 
difference between those two but in
terms<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> iPhone<00:00:37.680> 6<00:00:38.070> you're<00:00:38.280> looking<00:00:38.550> at

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640

forty nine minutes to fully charge from
zero<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.550> 100%<00:00:50.940> versus<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> s6<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.379> quite<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
zero to 100% versus the s6 is quite a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.410 
zero to 100% versus the s6 is quite a
bit<00:00:52.890> quicker<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.370> charge<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:54.120> using

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
bit quicker to charge because it's using

Qualcomm's quick charge 2.0 technology
so<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.719> only<00:00:57.840> took<00:00:58.079> me<00:00:58.289> about<00:00:58.500> six<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.010> eight

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
so it only took me about six to eight

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.189 
so it only took me about six to eight
minutes<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.850> go<00:01:00.000> from<00:01:00.270> zero<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.960> hundred

percent charge one other thing to

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.579 
percent charge one other thing to
mention<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.629> Samsung<00:01:03.870> also<00:01:04.379> has

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
mention is that the Samsung also has

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.260 
mention is that the Samsung also has
wireless<00:01:05.070> charging<00:01:05.339> capabilities<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.180> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
wireless charging capabilities so you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.810 
wireless charging capabilities so you
can<00:01:06.450> use<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> PMA<00:01:07.650> or<00:01:07.890> Qi<00:01:08.280> wireless<00:01:08.580> charging

really handy and quite convenient the
first<00:01:13.380> thing<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.680> did<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:14.130> test<00:01:14.340> out<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
first thing that I did to test out the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.280 
first thing that I did to test out the
battery<00:01:14.939> was<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> simple<00:01:15.960> video

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
battery was just do a simple video

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.710 
battery was just do a simple video
playback<00:01:16.740> test<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.490> basically<00:01:18.119> played<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> video

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
