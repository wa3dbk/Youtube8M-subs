expensive<00:07:05.070> but<00:07:05.729> consider<00:07:06.630> what<00:07:06.780> you<00:07:06.900> get<00:07:07.169> I

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.410 
expensive but consider what you get I

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.529 
expensive but consider what you get I
think<00:07:07.860> it's<00:07:07.979> worth<00:07:08.130> the<00:07:08.340> money<00:07:08.580> well<00:07:08.940> I've<00:07:09.419> got

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 
think it's worth the money well I've got

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:10.879
