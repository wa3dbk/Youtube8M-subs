00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.900 

say<00:06:33.070> about<00:06:33.310> that<00:06:34.530> usually<00:06:35.530> is<00:06:35.830> easy<00:06:36.580> to<00:06:36.760> and

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
say about that usually is easy to and

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:43.190 
say about that usually is easy to and
full<00:06:37.320> so<00:06:38.320> oh<00:06:38.620> the<00:06:39.430> build<00:06:39.670> is<00:06:39.850> actually<00:06:41.460> pretty

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
full so oh the build is actually pretty

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.350 
full so oh the build is actually pretty
piston<00:06:44.200> it's<00:06:44.380> not<00:06:44.590> as<00:06:45.070> simple<00:06:45.340> as<00:06:45.670> that<00:06:45.700> as<00:06:46.090> you

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
piston it's not as simple as that as you

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.230 
piston it's not as simple as that as you
would<00:06:46.510> think<00:06:47.160> so<00:06:48.160> what<00:06:48.610> harder<00:06:48.970> than<00:06:49.120> I

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
would think so what harder than I

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.600 
would think so what harder than I
expected<00:06:49.590> it's<00:06:50.590> not<00:06:50.740> hard<00:06:51.100> but<00:06:51.190> I'm<00:06:51.670> not<00:06:51.820> hard

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
expected it's not hard but I'm not hard

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.020 
expected it's not hard but I'm not hard
