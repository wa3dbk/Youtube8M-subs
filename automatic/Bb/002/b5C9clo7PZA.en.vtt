the<00:01:47.250> written<00:01:47.430> review<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:49.220> it's<00:01:50.220> hard

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the written review of this but it's hard

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.399 
the written review of this but it's hard
to<00:01:50.430> believe<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.700> that's<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.990> whole<00:01:52.140> thing

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
to believe that that's the whole thing

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.410 
to believe that that's the whole thing
right<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:53.030> again<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:55.369> silicon

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420

this<00:02:19.170> thing<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:19.680> I've<00:02:20.550> upgraded<00:02:21.330> hard<00:02:21.990> drives

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
this thing in I've upgraded hard drives

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.000 
this thing in I've upgraded hard drives
and<00:02:22.650> memory<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:23.810> laptop<00:02:24.810> computers<00:02:25.320> for<00:02:25.710> years

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and memory in laptop computers for years

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.770 
and memory in laptop computers for years
and<00:02:26.190> years<00:02:26.250> now<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.390> feel<00:02:27.630> fairly

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
and years now so I feel fairly

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.450 
and years now so I feel fairly
comfortable<00:02:28.350> doing<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:28.950> if<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.190> don't

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
comfortable doing this but if you don't

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.520 
comfortable doing this but if you don't
maybe<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.360> best<00:02:30.480> thing<00:02:30.600> would<00:02:30.810> be<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.200> take

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
maybe the best thing would be to take

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.190 
maybe the best thing would be to take
this<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.300> computer<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.450> local<00:02:33.780> computer<00:02:34.050> shop

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
this to a computer a local computer shop

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.670 
this to a computer a local computer shop
and<00:02:34.680> let<00:02:34.770> them<00:02:34.980> put<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.400> for<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:36.680> that's

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
and let them put it in for you that's

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.320 
and let them put it in for you that's
one<00:02:37.890> possibility<00:02:38.370> i'm<00:02:38.910> sure<00:02:39.060> there's<00:02:39.240> other

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
one possibility i'm sure there's other

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.730 
one possibility i'm sure there's other
ways<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.140> get<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.440> there<00:02:40.560> but

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
ways that you can get it in there but

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.460 
ways that you can get it in there but
again<00:02:41.640> be<00:02:41.850> very<00:02:41.880> careful<00:02:42.120> doing<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.080> you

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
again be very careful doing this and you

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.630 
again be very careful doing this and you
have<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.650> understand<00:02:44.070> this<00:02:44.190> very<00:02:44.370> well<00:02:44.490> may

have learned you take a piece of clear

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.940 
have learned you take a piece of clear
packing<00:04:02.160> tape<00:04:02.190> or<00:04:02.640> some<00:04:03.110> duct<00:04:04.110> tape<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.620> fold

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
packing tape or some duct tape you fold

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.510 
packing tape or some duct tape you fold
over<00:04:05.340> one<00:04:05.970> side<00:04:06.300> of<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:09.800> so<00:04:10.800> that<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:10.980> sticky

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
over one side of it so that the sticky

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.240 
over one side of it so that the sticky
part<00:04:11.550> is<00:04:12.000> up<00:04:12.270> we<00:04:13.230> need<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.440> pull<00:04:13.590> over<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:14.070> very

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
part is up we need to pull over the very

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.310 
part is up we need to pull over the very
edges<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:16.459> then<00:04:17.459> what<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:17.669> can<00:04:17.790> do<00:04:18.060> is<00:04:18.320> put

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
careful to use the correct one I was

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.490 
careful to use the correct one I was
just<00:05:18.300> trying<00:05:18.600> to<00:05:18.690> unscrew<00:05:19.169> it<00:05:19.200> with<00:05:19.380> the

just trying to unscrew it with the
Phillips<00:05:19.800> head<00:05:20.060> screwdriver<00:05:21.260> because<00:05:22.260> it's

Phillips head screwdriver because it's

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.150 
Phillips head screwdriver because it's
so<00:05:22.620> small<00:05:22.919> my<00:05:23.600> eyes<00:05:24.600> it<00:05:25.050> was<00:05:25.169> hard<00:05:25.410> to<00:05:25.470> see<00:05:25.740> but

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
so small my eyes it was hard to see but

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
so small my eyes it was hard to see but
I<00:05:26.250> pulled<00:05:26.550> that<00:05:26.669> off<00:05:27.230> put<00:05:28.230> that<00:05:28.380> on<00:05:28.530> our<00:05:28.560> tape

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:40.430 

and<00:05:33.180> it<00:05:33.479> comes<00:05:33.750> out<00:05:33.930> fairly<00:05:34.380> easily<00:05:39.440> that's

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
and it comes out fairly easily that's

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.630 
and it comes out fairly easily that's
kind<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.710> nerve-wracking<00:05:41.280> to<00:05:41.310> be<00:05:41.460> quite

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
kind of nerve-wracking to be quite

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.880 
kind of nerve-wracking to be quite
honest<00:05:41.880> with<00:05:41.940> you<00:05:42.060> pulling<00:05:42.330> that<00:05:42.540> out<00:05:42.770> but<00:05:43.770> it

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
honest with you pulling that out but it

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.830 
honest with you pulling that out but it
comes<00:05:44.640> out<00:05:44.790> of<00:05:44.970> there<00:05:45.090> without<00:05:45.210> a<00:05:45.450> whole<00:05:45.810> lot

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
comes out of there without a whole lot

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:53.830 
comes out of there without a whole lot
of<00:05:46.140> difficulty

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:02.430 

and<00:05:54.530> now<00:05:54.650> we<00:05:54.710> just<00:05:54.949> need<00:05:55.070> to<00:05:55.400> very<00:05:56.030> carefully

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.310

get it in there snuggly all right and
that<00:06:06.620> feels<00:06:06.979> like<00:06:07.250> it<00:06:07.490> is<00:06:07.669> in<00:06:08.479> there<00:06:08.630> now<00:06:08.660> it's

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
that feels like it is in there now it's

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.120 
that feels like it is in there now it's
a<00:06:08.900> good<00:06:09.020> idea<00:06:09.169> to<00:06:09.620> put<00:06:10.340> the<00:06:11.290> screw<00:06:12.290> that<00:06:12.800> helped

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
a good idea to put the screw that helped

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.210 
a good idea to put the screw that helped
the<00:06:13.220> drive<00:06:13.520> in<00:06:13.699> place<00:06:14.290> back<00:06:15.290> in<00:06:15.320> so<00:06:15.919> we'll<00:06:16.040> do

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.749 

mmm<00:06:39.289> now<00:06:39.650> unless<00:06:39.770> you're<00:06:40.039> replacing<00:06:40.610> this

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 
mmm now unless you're replacing this

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:45.279 
mmm now unless you're replacing this

drive because it's broken make certain
you<00:06:45.379> protect<00:06:45.830> it<00:06:46.300> by<00:06:47.300> just<00:06:47.330> putting<00:06:47.690> it<00:06:47.930> in<00:06:48.110> the
