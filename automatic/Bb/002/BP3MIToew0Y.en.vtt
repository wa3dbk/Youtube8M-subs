so you're allowed to keep your slider
for<00:01:57.079> this<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.500> basically<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.490> takes<00:01:58.700> your

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
for this and basically it takes your

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.749 
for this and basically it takes your
camera<00:01:59.210> grabber<00:01:59.509> and<00:01:59.890> when<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:01.039> pull<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.579> to

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
camera grabber and when you pull it to

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.609 
camera grabber and when you pull it to
the<00:02:01.789> left<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.659> gives<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.079> a<00:02:03.110> bunch<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.439> options

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
the left it gives you a bunch of options

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.229 
the left it gives you a bunch of options
so<00:02:04.039> when<00:02:04.159> i<00:02:04.189> pull<00:02:04.430> it<00:02:04.520> up<00:02:04.640> music<00:02:05.560> phone

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239

so when i pull it up music phone
messages<00:02:08.239> and<00:02:08.530> even<00:02:09.530> counter<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.190> yes<00:02:10.429> you

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
messages and even counter and yes you

another way to bring shortcuts directly

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.440 
another way to bring shortcuts directly
from<00:02:21.410> your<00:02:21.709> lock<00:02:22.130> screen<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.120> fourth

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
from your lock screen and so the fourth

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.759 
from your lock screen and so the fourth

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
come in handy so all you have to do is

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.970 
come in handy so all you have to do is
hold

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
hold

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.190 
hold
down<00:02:31.250> for<00:02:31.459> two<00:02:31.489> seconds<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.180> either<00:02:32.569> disables

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
down for two seconds and either disables

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.000 
down for two seconds and either disables
or<00:02:33.349> enable<00:02:33.709> enables<00:02:35.140> airplane<00:02:36.140> mode<00:02:36.379> directly

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
or enable enables airplane mode directly

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.710 
or enable enables airplane mode directly
from<00:02:37.129> your<00:02:37.220> lock<00:02:37.489> screen<00:02:37.519> and<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.360> think<00:02:38.599> it's

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
from your lock screen and I think it's

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.210 
from your lock screen and I think it's
quite<00:02:38.870> useful<00:02:39.110> instead<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.680> going<00:02:39.920> all<00:02:40.040> the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
quite useful instead of going all the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.289 
quite useful instead of going all the
way<00:02:40.310> into<00:02:40.400> settings<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.000> then<00:02:41.090> either

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
way into settings and then either

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.520 
way into settings and then either
turning<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:41.900> on<00:02:42.080> or<00:02:42.440> off<00:02:43.150> this<00:02:44.150> is<00:02:44.330> like<00:02:44.480> a

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
turning it on or off this is like a

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.559 
turning it on or off this is like a
fifth<00:02:45.530> week<00:02:45.830> but<00:02:46.220> I'll<00:02:46.790> could<00:02:47.030> sorta<00:02:47.269> combine

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
fifth week but I'll could sorta combine

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.150 
fifth week but I'll could sorta combine
it<00:02:47.690> with<00:02:47.720> lock<00:02:47.959> screen<00:02:48.230> airplane<00:02:48.650> mode<00:02:48.890> since

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
it with lock screen airplane mode since

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.559 
it with lock screen airplane mode since
there's<00:02:49.400> one<00:02:49.640> more<00:02:49.790> tweaked<00:02:50.060> i<00:02:50.180> want<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.450> show

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
there's one more tweaked i want to show

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.539 
there's one more tweaked i want to show
you<00:02:50.599> so<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:51.470> one<00:02:51.650> is<00:02:51.739> called<00:02:51.890> custom<00:02:52.370> battery

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
you so this one is called custom battery

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.520 
you so this one is called custom battery
and<00:02:52.940> as<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.629> can<00:02:53.750> see<00:02:53.780> in<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.140> top<00:02:54.319> right

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
and as you can see in the top right

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.009 
and as you can see in the top right
corner<00:02:54.739> add<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.610> slowly<00:02:55.970> unwinding<00:02:56.569> circle

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
corner add that slowly unwinding circle

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.410 
corner add that slowly unwinding circle
that<00:02:57.200> slowly<00:02:57.709> changes<00:02:58.579> color<00:02:58.790> as<00:02:59.030> your

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
that slowly changes color as your

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.509 
that slowly changes color as your
battery<00:02:59.690> gets<00:02:59.870> lower<00:03:00.079> and<00:03:00.200> lower<00:03:00.379> so<00:03:01.099> it's<00:03:01.400> the

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
battery gets lower and lower so it's the

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.420 
battery gets lower and lower so it's the
usual<00:03:01.670> red<00:03:02.269> for<00:03:02.510> ten<00:03:02.659> percent<00:03:03.049> about<00:03:03.769> grey<00:03:04.160> for

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
usual red for ten percent about grey for

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.220 
usual red for ten percent about grey for
fifty<00:03:04.670> percent<00:03:05.000> they<00:03:05.480> keeps<00:03:05.690> changing<00:03:06.019> color

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
fifty percent they keeps changing color

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.199 
fifty percent they keeps changing color
with<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.650> battery<00:03:07.069> percentage<00:03:07.280> directly

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
with the battery percentage directly

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.000 
with the battery percentage directly
inside<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:09.260> saves<00:03:09.500> space<00:03:09.650> on<00:03:09.980> your

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
inside of it it saves space on your

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.360 
inside of it it saves space on your
status<00:03:10.280> bar<00:03:10.609> and<00:03:10.819> it<00:03:11.329> looks<00:03:11.540> unique<00:03:12.370> alright

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
status bar and it looks unique alright

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.800 
status bar and it looks unique alright
so<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:13.670> fifth<00:03:13.849> on<00:03:13.970> last<00:03:14.180> week<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.629> called

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
so the fifth on last week is called

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.780 
so the fifth on last week is called
pluck<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.470> what<00:03:15.920> it<00:03:16.040> does<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.549> when<00:03:16.670> you

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
pluck and what it does is when you
