every week you know and as you keep on

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.220 
every week you know and as you keep on
hearing<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.660> some<00:03:45.840> things<00:03:46.049> you<00:03:46.170> start

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
hearing that some things you start

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.960 
hearing that some things you start
believing<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.340> when<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.579> wasn't

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
believing it and when it wasn't

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.640 
believing it and when it wasn't
happening<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.480> found<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.870> harder<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.470> then<00:03:49.500> we

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
happening it found it harder and then we

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.259 
happening it found it harder and then we
were<00:03:49.769> dropping<00:03:50.220> points<00:03:50.609> finding<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.000> hard<00:03:51.180> to

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
were dropping points finding it hard to

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.349 
were dropping points finding it hard to
beat<00:03:51.540> teams<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.709> know<00:03:52.829> it<00:03:53.250> becomes<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.239> lot

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
beat teams and you know it becomes a lot

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.240 
beat teams and you know it becomes a lot
harder<00:03:54.420> than<00:03:54.810> what<00:03:55.109> it<00:03:55.230> should<00:03:55.260> be<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:56.130> know

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
harder than what it should be you know

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.620 
harder than what it should be you know
so<00:03:56.400> i<00:03:56.430> think<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.700> mental<00:03:57.060> side<00:03:57.209> was<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.420> lot

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
so i think the mental side was a lot

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.680 
so i think the mental side was a lot
tougher<00:03:57.810> than<00:03:57.989> anything

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690
