don't like those as much as I just like
this<00:02:31.080> simple<00:02:32.060> way<00:02:33.060> right<00:02:33.420> here<00:02:33.630> just<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
this simple way right here just the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
this simple way right here just the
almonds<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.790> salt<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.810> pour<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.440> if

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
almonds and the salt and I pour it in if

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.060 
almonds and the salt and I pour it in if
you<00:02:38.250> saw<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.459> poured<00:02:38.880> in<00:02:39.000> about<00:02:39.860> 3/4<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:40.980> a

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
you saw that poured in about 3/4 of a

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.970 
you saw that poured in about 3/4 of a
cup<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.580> filtered<00:02:42.180> water<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.680> water

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
cup of filtered water and that water

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.449 
cup of filtered water and that water
really<00:02:44.400> helps<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.120> get<00:02:45.840> those<00:02:46.170> almonds<00:02:47.130> moved

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
really helps to get those almonds moved

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.670 
really helps to get those almonds moved
around<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.660> careful<00:02:49.200> when<00:02:49.320> you're<00:02:49.500> adding

around but be careful when you're adding

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.500 
around but be careful when you're adding
water<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.250> don't<00:02:50.400> want<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.640> add<00:02:50.730> too<00:02:50.970> much<00:02:51.150> or

water you don't want to add too much or

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.080 
water you don't want to add too much or
