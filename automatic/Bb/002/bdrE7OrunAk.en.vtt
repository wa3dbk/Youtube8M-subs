00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.430 

okay<00:00:00.599> guys<00:00:00.900> here's<00:00:01.469> my<00:00:01.620> dilemma<00:00:01.860> this<00:00:03.770> is<00:00:04.770> the

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.440 
okay guys here's my dilemma this is the

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:15.320 
okay guys here's my dilemma this is the
ESC<00:00:07.490> be<00:00:08.719> BTW<00:00:10.880> i<00:00:11.880> guess<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:13.820> long<00:00:14.820> where<00:00:15.299> I

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
ESC be BTW i guess this long where I

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:24.220 
ESC be BTW i guess this long where I
hear<00:00:15.900> from<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:17.449> ESC<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:20.810> throttle<00:00:21.810> sensor

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
hear from the ESC is the throttle sensor

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:34.690 
hear from the ESC is the throttle sensor
then<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.949> power<00:00:27.470> from<00:00:29.300> BC<00:00:30.859> is<00:00:31.880> going<00:00:32.880> into<00:00:33.480> my

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
then the power from BC is going into my

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.260 
then the power from BC is going into my
power<00:00:35.700> input<00:00:36.360> under<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.780> bottom<00:00:37.670> of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.879> gyro

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
power input under the bottom of the gyro

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.520 
power input under the bottom of the gyro
and<00:00:40.129> so<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.780> f<00:00:42.780> beside<00:00:44.539> got<00:00:45.539> coming<00:00:46.050> back<00:00:46.260> down

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and so on f beside got coming back down

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.639 
and so on f beside got coming back down
here<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.960> plugged<00:00:49.230> into<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
here and have it plugged into the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:58.920 
here and have it plugged into the
throttle<00:00:50.219> channel<00:00:51.170> no<00:00:53.660> ours<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:54.930> like

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.820 

okay<00:00:59.930> now<00:01:00.200> i'm<00:01:00.380> going<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.590> plug<00:01:01.520> this<00:01:01.790> in<00:01:05.830> so

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
okay now i'm going to plug this in so

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.280 
okay now i'm going to plug this in so
you<00:01:07.190> can<00:01:07.370> see<00:01:07.610> when<00:01:08.150> i<00:01:08.180> put<00:01:08.570> in<00:01:08.720> this<00:01:08.930> wire

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
you can see when i put in this wire

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.260 
you can see when i put in this wire
that's<00:01:09.560> coming<00:01:09.920> from<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.190> s<00:01:10.370> plus<00:01:10.700> side<00:01:11.030> of

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
that's coming from the s plus side of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.890 
that's coming from the s plus side of
the<00:01:11.360> gyro<00:01:11.690> cuz<00:01:12.080> now<00:01:12.350> only<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.330> BCS<00:01:14.330> powered<00:01:14.750> up

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
the gyro cuz now only the BCS powered up

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:22.480 
the gyro cuz now only the BCS powered up
and<00:01:15.080> i<00:01:15.200> have<00:01:15.380> no<00:01:15.620> power<00:01:16.870> until<00:01:17.870> I<00:01:21.280> put<00:01:22.280> this

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
and i have no power until I put this

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:35.320 
and i have no power until I put this
back<00:01:22.820> in<00:01:22.850> channel<00:01:23.450> 3<00:01:30.910> power<00:01:31.990> but<00:01:34.150> this<00:01:35.150> is

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
back in channel 3 power but this is

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.020 
back in channel 3 power but this is
still<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.630> throttle<00:01:36.170> sensor<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:37.030> i'm

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
still the throttle sensor so i'm

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:48.460 
still the throttle sensor so i'm
wondering<00:01:43.180> i'm<00:01:44.180> wondering<00:01:44.780> if<00:01:44.900> i<00:01:47.440> need<00:01:48.440> to

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
wondering i'm wondering if i need to

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.740 
wondering i'm wondering if i need to
take<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.920> throttle<00:01:49.400> sensor<00:01:50.119> wire<00:01:50.330> out<00:01:50.360> of

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
take the throttle sensor wire out of

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.700 
take the throttle sensor wire out of
here<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:52.250> plug<00:01:53.119> it<00:01:53.270> in<00:01:53.390> here<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.990> love<00:01:54.470> it<00:01:54.590> in

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
here and plug it in here and love it in

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.609 
here and plug it in here and love it in
channel<00:01:55.100> 3<00:01:55.450> but<00:01:56.450> then<00:01:56.660> I<00:01:56.690> still<00:01:57.140> have<00:01:57.440> this

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
channel 3 but then I still have this

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.910 
channel 3 but then I still have this
purple<00:01:59.920> governor<00:02:00.920> why<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.130> guess<00:02:02.649> and<00:02:03.649> I'm<00:02:03.860> not

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
purple governor why I guess and I'm not

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.749 
purple governor why I guess and I'm not
sure<00:02:04.100> if<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:05.590> should<00:02:06.590> be<00:02:06.770> in<00:02:06.860> channel<00:02:07.310> 3<00:02:09.759> so

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
sure if that should be in channel 3 so

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.850 
sure if that should be in channel 3 so
maybe<00:02:11.180> somebody<00:02:11.510> can<00:02:11.810> help<00:02:11.870> me<00:02:12.230> out<00:02:12.700> for<00:02:13.700> what
