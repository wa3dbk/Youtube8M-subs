00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
been like funny where the sides right

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.990 
been like funny where the sides right
here<00:00:39.020> grows<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.320> little<00:00:42.770> lesser<00:00:43.770> not<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.520> even

they<00:00:45.149> kind<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.480> go<00:00:45.600> back<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.930> noticed

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
they kind of go back so and I noticed

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.350 
they kind of go back so and I noticed
that<00:00:49.410> some<00:00:49.649> parts<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.399> back<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:51.030> on

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
that some parts are going back like on

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.470 
that some parts are going back like on
this<00:00:51.600> side<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:52.020> grows<00:00:52.260> back<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.699> goes<00:00:53.850> back<00:00:54.210> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
this side it grows back it goes back a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.029 
this side it grows back it goes back a
little<00:00:54.660> further<00:00:54.930> than<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.530> side

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
little further than this side

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.420 
little further than this side
so<00:00:56.789> I'm<00:00:57.289> wondering<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.770> stress-related

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so I'm wondering if it's stress-related

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.459

stressed but hey your body can be

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.119 
stressed but hey your body can be
telling<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.629> something<00:01:04.320> different<00:01:04.830> from

of<00:01:49.450> just<00:01:49.660> already<00:01:50.560> knew<00:01:50.800> that<00:01:51.130> this<00:01:51.220> wasn't

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
upon that as you know now I don't think

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.060 
upon that as you know now I don't think
it<00:01:58.690> works<00:01:58.900> for<00:01:58.990> me<00:01:59.200> because<00:01:59.290> as<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.650> can<00:01:59.800> see

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
it works for me because as you can see

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.770 
it works for me because as you can see
my<00:02:00.280> cyber<00:02:00.580> still<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:02.380> know<00:02:03.869> pretty<00:02:04.869> thin<00:02:05.640> um<00:02:06.640> I

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
my cyber still you know pretty thin um I

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.020 
my cyber still you know pretty thin um I
can't<00:02:07.780> say<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.050> little<00:02:08.649> bit<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:09.009> hair<00:02:09.220> back<00:02:09.729> but

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
can't say a little bit of hair back but

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.610 
can't say a little bit of hair back but
not<00:02:10.570> as<00:02:11.100> not<00:02:12.100> as<00:02:12.130> big<00:02:12.459> of<00:02:12.489> I<00:02:12.670> thought<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.060> would

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
not as not as big of I thought it would

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.440 
not as not as big of I thought it would
so<00:02:14.620> when<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:14.830> did<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:15.160> first<00:02:15.340> video<00:02:15.670> somebody

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
so when I did that first video somebody

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.810 
so when I did that first video somebody
suggested<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.230> fellows<00:02:17.709> who<00:02:17.890> were<00:02:17.920> suggested

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
suggested a fellows who were suggested

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.080 
suggested a fellows who were suggested
to<00:02:19.060> try<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.750> castor<00:02:20.230> oil<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.370> figured<00:02:21.880> that

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
to try a castor oil so I figured that

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.760 
to try a castor oil so I figured that
would<00:02:22.480> be<00:02:22.600> my<00:02:22.720> next<00:02:22.780> challenge<00:02:23.350> I<00:02:23.410> didn't<00:02:23.620> want

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
would be my next challenge I didn't want

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.820 
would be my next challenge I didn't want
to<00:02:23.830> just<00:02:24.010> jump<00:02:24.280> in<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.790> do<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:24.940> over<00:02:25.510> the

to just jump in and do it over the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.560 
to just jump in and do it over the
mountain<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.160> now<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.300> Nioxin

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570

I<00:02:51.730> think<00:02:52.510> it's<00:02:52.630> funny<00:02:52.870> Iowa<00:02:53.350> something<00:02:53.680> like

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
I think it's funny Iowa something like

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.030 
I think it's funny Iowa something like
that<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.450> they<00:02:55.450> had<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.810> extra<00:02:56.290> dark<00:02:56.590> version

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
that and they had the extra dark version

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.850 
that and they had the extra dark version
but<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:58.000> was<00:02:58.690> tempted<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.320> buy<00:02:59.620> it

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
but I was tempted to buy it

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.800 
but I was tempted to buy it
thinking<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.549> extra<00:03:00.820> dark<00:03:01.000> would<00:03:01.299> do<00:03:01.570> better

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
thinking the extra dark would do better

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.110 
thinking the extra dark would do better
but<00:03:02.200> then<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.799> was<00:03:03.160> looking<00:03:03.430> at<00:03:03.549> some<00:03:03.760> strides

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120

know what let me just play safe and buy
regular<00:03:26.680> bottle<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:29.829> is<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:30.010> small<00:03:30.370> bottle

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
regular bottle so this is a small bottle

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.039 
regular bottle so this is a small bottle
I<00:03:30.970> thought<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.239> was<00:03:31.480> going<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:31.780> thought<00:03:31.810> it'd<00:03:32.019> be

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
I thought I was going I thought it'd be

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.190 
I thought I was going I thought it'd be
a<00:03:32.140> little<00:03:32.200> bit<00:03:32.380> bigger<00:03:32.650> but<00:03:33.840> it's<00:03:34.840> pretty

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
a little bit bigger but it's pretty

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.650 
a little bit bigger but it's pretty
thick<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:35.799> I<00:03:35.860> don't<00:03:36.070> think<00:03:36.730> I'll<00:03:36.970> leave<00:03:37.150> so

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
thick so I don't think I'll leave so

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.030 
thick so I don't think I'll leave so
much<00:03:37.920> but<00:03:38.920> if<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.519> go<00:03:39.700> down<00:03:39.730> half<00:03:40.090> oh<00:03:40.239> by<00:03:40.420> another

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
much but if I go down half oh by another

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.369 
much but if I go down half oh by another
anyway<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.340> took<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.610> little<00:03:41.760> bit<00:03:41.969> and<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.049> put<00:03:43.290> it

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
anyway I took a little bit and I put it

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.800 
anyway I took a little bit and I put it
in<00:03:43.500> one<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.650> my<00:03:43.829> old<00:03:44.180> dubrow<00:03:45.180> applicator

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.849 
in one of my old dubrow applicator
bottles<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.379> I<00:03:48.079> put<00:03:49.079> it<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.319> little<00:03:49.349> bit<00:03:49.590> in<00:03:49.769> my

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
bottles and I put it a little bit in my

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.940 
bottles and I put it a little bit in my
hair<00:03:50.129> now<00:03:50.370> in<00:03:50.819> my<00:03:51.060> scalp<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.950> immediately

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
hair now in my scalp and immediately

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.119 
hair now in my scalp and immediately
like<00:03:53.430> my<00:03:53.909> hair<00:03:54.120> started<00:03:54.659> feeling<00:03:55.079> softer<00:03:55.799> I

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
like my hair started feeling softer I

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.399 
like my hair started feeling softer I
mean<00:03:56.459> it's<00:03:56.579> already<00:03:56.700> soft<00:03:57.140> from<00:03:58.140> what<00:03:58.290> I've

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
mean it's already soft from what I've

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.949 
mean it's already soft from what I've
used<00:03:58.439> prior<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.579> really<00:04:00.060> feels<00:04:00.359> like<00:04:00.629> good

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
used prior but it really feels like good

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.319 
used prior but it really feels like good
in<00:04:01.109> my<00:04:01.230> hair<00:04:01.500> so<00:04:01.890> I'm<00:04:02.129> hoping<00:04:02.579> that<00:04:02.879> it<00:04:03.150> can

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
in my hair so I'm hoping that it can

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.110 
in my hair so I'm hoping that it can
help<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:04.379> stimulate<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:05.250> sides<00:04:05.489> I<00:04:05.819> mean<00:04:06.060> I

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
help to stimulate the sides I mean I

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.699 
help to stimulate the sides I mean I
don't<00:04:06.180> think<00:04:06.390> I'll<00:04:06.540> use<00:04:06.569> it<00:04:06.750> every<00:04:07.109> day<00:04:07.139> I'll

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
don't think I'll use it every day I'll

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.009 
don't think I'll use it every day I'll
probably<00:04:08.010> use<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.459> once<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.939> week<00:04:08.970> or<00:04:09.450> once

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
probably use it once a week or once

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.280 
probably use it once a week or once
every<00:04:10.639> like<00:04:11.639> every<00:04:12.060> three<00:04:12.540> days<00:04:12.689> depending<00:04:12.959> on

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290

with the Jay who has to all because
there<00:04:44.099> is<00:04:45.199> castor<00:04:46.199> oil<00:04:46.229> in<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.919> green<00:04:47.159> insulin

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
there is castor oil in the green insulin

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.409 
there is castor oil in the green insulin
so<00:04:47.699> I<00:04:47.729> don't<00:04:48.060> think<00:04:48.419> that<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:50.220> Arvind<00:04:50.760> on<00:04:50.909> bump

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
so I don't think that to Arvind on bump

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.279 
so I don't think that to Arvind on bump
heads<00:04:51.690> with<00:04:51.870> each<00:04:51.960> other<00:04:53.270> um<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.330> think<00:04:54.539> this

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
heads with each other um I think this

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.610 
heads with each other um I think this
would<00:04:56.280> probably<00:04:56.310> work<00:04:56.849> if<00:04:57.479> I<00:04:57.930> use<00:04:58.139> it<00:04:58.169> for<00:04:58.560> a

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
would probably work if I use it for a

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.790 
would probably work if I use it for a
year<00:04:59.010> but<00:04:59.880> I<00:05:00.240> don't<00:05:00.900> think<00:05:01.229> it<00:05:01.530> should<00:05:01.740> take

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
year but I don't think it should take

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.700 
year but I don't think it should take
that<00:05:02.280> long<00:05:02.580> for<00:05:02.610> my<00:05:03.090> my<00:05:03.659> hair<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:04.050> start<00:05:04.260> going

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
that long for my my hair to start going

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.529 
that long for my my hair to start going
back<00:05:04.909> so<00:05:05.909> I<00:05:06.360> guess<00:05:06.690> I'll<00:05:06.870> continue<00:05:07.169> to<00:05:07.349> use<00:05:07.620> it

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
back so I guess I'll continue to use it

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.689 
back so I guess I'll continue to use it
because<00:05:09.539> I<00:05:09.810> paid<00:05:10.110> I<00:05:10.349> think<00:05:10.409> the<00:05:10.979> fiber<00:05:11.220> kwatak

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
because I paid I think the fiber kwatak

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.610 
because I paid I think the fiber kwatak
is<00:05:11.820> 40<00:05:12.210> or<00:05:12.240> 50<00:05:12.659> dollars<00:05:12.900> I<00:05:12.990> paid<00:05:13.199> for<00:05:13.380> it<00:05:13.440> so<00:05:13.470> I

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
is 40 or 50 dollars I paid for it so I

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.379 
is 40 or 50 dollars I paid for it so I
paid<00:05:13.919> a<00:05:13.949> lot<00:05:14.130> of<00:05:14.159> money<00:05:14.250> for<00:05:14.550> this<00:05:14.669> so<00:05:15.360> I

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
paid a lot of money for this so I

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.930 
paid a lot of money for this so I
definitely<00:05:15.780> want<00:05:16.409> to<00:05:16.470> try<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.860> use<00:05:17.520> it<00:05:17.550> on<00:05:17.760> so

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
definitely want to try to use it on so

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.460 
definitely want to try to use it on so
the<00:05:18.060> model<00:05:18.300> is<00:05:18.330> finished<00:05:18.780> and<00:05:18.990> then<00:05:19.139> just

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
the model is finished and then just

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.170 
the model is finished and then just
continue<00:05:19.889> with<00:05:19.949> the<00:05:20.070> castor<00:05:20.460> oil<00:05:20.490> but<00:05:20.970> I

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
continue with the castor oil but I

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.300 
continue with the castor oil but I
should<00:05:21.840> have<00:05:21.960> known<00:05:22.139> better<00:05:22.320> on<00:05:22.860> that<00:05:23.190> the

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
should have known better on that the

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.000 
should have known better on that the
Castrol<00:05:23.729> would<00:05:23.849> have<00:05:23.940> worked<00:05:24.180> so<00:05:25.010> anyway

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
Castrol would have worked so anyway

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.159 
Castrol would have worked so anyway
