00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
here the solution we deployed included

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.700 
here the solution we deployed included
two<00:01:21.070> major<00:01:21.430> strategies<00:01:22.090> one<00:01:22.720> was<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:23.380> pick<00:01:23.560> up

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
two major strategies one was to pick up

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.170 
two major strategies one was to pick up
the<00:01:23.830> flood<00:01:24.070> water<00:01:24.310> that<00:01:24.549> was<00:01:24.640> flowing<00:01:25.030> from

the flood water that was flowing from

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.630 
the flood water that was flowing from
over<00:01:25.450> here<00:01:25.810> put<00:01:26.350> it<00:01:26.439> into<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.100> catch<00:01:27.400> basin

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
over here put it into a catch basin

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.350 
over here put it into a catch basin
right<00:01:28.150> here<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:28.659> take<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:29.619> underground<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
right here and take it underground to

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.480 
right here and take it underground to
the<00:01:31.509> street<00:01:31.810> that<00:01:32.409> was<00:01:32.560> ripped<00:01:32.770> up<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.250> we

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
the street that was ripped up and we

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.510 
the street that was ripped up and we
installed<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.390> huge<00:01:35.259> infiltration<00:01:36.009> gallery

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
installed a huge infiltration gallery

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.469 
installed a huge infiltration gallery
that's<00:01:36.729> two<00:01:37.119> large<00:01:37.570> pipes<00:01:37.990> loaded<00:01:38.920> with<00:01:39.009> holes

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
that's two large pipes loaded with holes

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.300 
that's two large pipes loaded with holes

the water flows through the water comes

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.780 
the water flows through the water comes
out<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.700> pipe<00:01:42.909> into<00:01:43.180> gravel<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:43.960> then<00:01:44.049> down

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
out the pipe into gravel and then down

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.270 
out the pipe into gravel and then down

and<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.880> process<00:01:52.240> significantly<00:01:53.170> saves

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
and this process significantly saves

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.980 
and this process significantly saves
money<00:01:53.979> in<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.220> long<00:01:54.490> run<00:01:54.520> because<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.689> makes

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
money in the long run because it makes

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.350 
money in the long run because it makes
the<00:01:56.229> street<00:01:56.530> part<00:01:57.189> of<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.430> whole<00:01:57.759> city's

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.300 
kind of an ecological change as well we
see<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:09.989> lot<00:04:10.169> of<00:04:10.199> different<00:04:10.590> birds<00:04:10.799> here<00:04:11.099> now

all<00:04:12.000> these<00:04:12.359> components<00:04:12.750> work<00:04:13.169> together<00:04:13.349> as<00:04:13.829> a

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
all these components work together as a

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.180 
all these components work together as a
whole<00:04:14.250> system<00:04:14.879> that<00:04:15.060> mimics<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:16.049> natural

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
whole system that mimics a natural

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.099 
whole system that mimics a natural
watershed<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.880> accomplish<00:04:18.389> this<00:04:18.570> we<00:04:18.780> built<00:04:18.989> a

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
watershed to accomplish this we built a

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.469 
watershed to accomplish this we built a
partnership<00:04:19.590> with<00:04:20.070> nature<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.970> included

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
partnership with nature that included

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.810 
partnership with nature that included
the<00:04:21.630> unique<00:04:22.049> cooperation<00:04:23.039> of<00:04:23.190> nonprofit

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
the unique cooperation of nonprofit

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
government agencies who in this case

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.779 
government agencies who in this case
are<00:04:28.860> concerned<00:04:29.250> with<00:04:29.370> water<00:04:29.610> conservation

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
are concerned with water conservation

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.529 
are concerned with water conservation
and<00:04:30.660> all<00:04:31.470> of<00:04:31.650> them<00:04:31.919> work<00:04:32.580> together<00:04:32.820> with<00:04:33.389> the

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
and all of them work together with the

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.749 
and all of them work together with the
people<00:04:33.750> on<00:04:34.139> the<00:04:34.350> street<00:04:34.650> one<00:04:35.280> of<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.460> things

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
people on the street one of the things

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.240 
people on the street one of the things
that<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.270> residents<00:04:36.720> requested<00:04:37.320> were<00:04:37.830> street

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
that the residents requested were street

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.529 
that the residents requested were street
lights<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:38.699> so<00:04:38.940> we<00:04:39.090> found<00:04:39.270> a<00:04:39.389> way<00:04:39.479> to

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
lights and so we found a way to

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.600 
lights and so we found a way to
incorporate<00:04:39.870> these<00:04:40.320> pretty<00:04:40.979> innovative

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
incorporate these pretty innovative

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.719 
incorporate these pretty innovative
solar<00:04:42.360> streetlights<00:04:42.840> that<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:44.460> can<00:04:44.580> see<00:04:44.699> a

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
solar streetlights that you can see a

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.820 
solar streetlights that you can see a
solar<00:04:45.030> panel<00:04:45.479> up<00:04:45.570> there<00:04:45.840> they<00:04:46.320> capture<00:04:46.710> the

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
solar panel up there they capture the

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.249 
solar panel up there they capture the
Sun<00:04:47.039> during<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.310> day<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:47.990> have<00:04:48.990> great

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
Sun during the day and have great

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:50.779 
Sun during the day and have great
radiation<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.919> same<00:04:50.130> as<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.400> ones<00:04:50.580> that<00:04:50.699> are

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
radiation the same as the ones that are

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.550 
radiation the same as the ones that are
on<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:50.910> grid<00:04:51.270> at<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.750> at<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.110> city<00:04:52.289> but<00:04:52.440> these

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
on the grid at the at the city but these

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.810 
on the grid at the at the city but these
are<00:04:52.680> completely<00:04:53.039> off<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.220> grid<00:04:53.490> they're<00:04:53.669> not

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
are completely off the grid they're not

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.969 
are completely off the grid they're not
connected<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.360> anything<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:55.080> so<00:04:55.680> they<00:04:55.800> don't

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
connected to anything and so they don't

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.879 
connected to anything and so they don't
take<00:04:56.190> any<00:04:56.370> power<00:04:56.669> tree<00:04:57.449> people<00:04:57.690> they<00:04:58.530> came<00:04:58.710> and

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
take any power tree people they came and

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.080 
take any power tree people they came and
talked<00:04:59.100> to<00:04:59.130> us<00:04:59.340> that<00:04:59.550> we<00:04:59.639> had<00:04:59.789> a<00:04:59.820> day<00:05:00.060> where

everybody helped pitch in and do the

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.469 
everybody helped pitch in and do the
tree<00:05:01.979> planting<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:02.460> we<00:05:03.030> all<00:05:03.210> work<00:05:03.360> together

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
tree planting and we all work together

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.600

the<00:05:03.960> project<00:05:04.410> in<00:05:04.530> general<00:05:04.560> took<00:05:05.070> about<00:05:05.310> five

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
the project in general took about five

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.219 
the project in general took about five
years<00:05:05.639> but<00:05:06.180> it's<00:05:06.419> really<00:05:06.750> brought<00:05:06.930> back<00:05:06.990> a

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
years but it's really brought back a

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:24.380 
years but it's really brought back a
