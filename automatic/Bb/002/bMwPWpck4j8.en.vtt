00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello I am that in this video I am going to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.130
 share with you what are my 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.690
 favorite products of the month I liked it 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.370
 but that you like it and let's start with 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.900
 the video or start with my favorites 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.150
 for the hair because this month I have 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.599
 quite a lot of you have commented 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.550
 Abajito that my hair looks prettier 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.320
 healthier and things and the truth I 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.869
 It makes me very happy the truth yes 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.090
 I feel healthier than before although I know that 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.220
 some do not think the same and there is something 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.039
 that I've been using during 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.869
 last three or four months I've waited 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.180
 so much to tell you about this product 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.590
 because hundreds of four months is like 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.110
 enough time to realize 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.940
 if they work or does not work and so I had 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.829
 very much desire to try this product 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.140
 because I listened to him on the radio and 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.420
 then I contacted them and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.309
 The truth is that they gave me the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.680
 product and they told me that if I 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.020
 it worked could talk or not talk about 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.090
 he or nobody paid me to talk about 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.920
 this the truth I am being honest with 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.170
 you the product that you 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.940
 speaking is called ovations of cerati is 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.620
 a three step treatment this wants 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.420
 say that it brings a shampoo treatment and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.790
 a conditioner and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.350
 witness how this product works 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.820
 It is very important that you know that you do not know 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.560
 You can use every day because 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.270
 they have too many proteins and 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.000
 good things for the hair that yes 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.580
 we pass, it's going to start falling and 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.119
 I wash my hair three times as 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.159
 week 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.659
 I use this only once a 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.690
 week so they have to do is 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.399
 wash your hair with this shampoo 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.110
 then the treatment that is 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.149
 les the therapy they leave it like 15 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.830
 minutes when they 're in the tub or what 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.140
 they want to leave it more time is better 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.179
 It is also important that you massage 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.830
 the scalp and then later you 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.780
 we play with this and ready 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.549
 this product is half expensive it costs 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.590
 like 100 dollars but I think if 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.450
 we want to invest in something good for 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.789
 our hair is a good option 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.039
 and quite leaves them link in case 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.110
 interesting to try another product that has 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.289
 used a lot during this month is 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.360
 this way of crisis I feel that I 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.299
 leaves more defined services more 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.610
 marked and the most shiny hair and 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.799
 all that and do not worry this does not leave 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.479
 hair like it lasted or anything like that and 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.369
 cause me like 6 dollars I think that they 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.530
 you can find in your as it worked 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.480
 very much the knot I decided to buy from the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.630
 same brand is that it's like a date 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.090
 I like to wear it on the tips and 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.680
 like in this part of the hair and I 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.269
 it leaves super shiny in super soft 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.370
 another product for the hair of which 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.049
 I want to talk to you, this is arandi of the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.880
 medical guys and I think this product 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.200
 it will last me my whole life because the 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.850
 truth is that you only need super 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.070
 little you put it on your fingers what 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.810
 you put from ends to ends in your hair and 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.380
 this will also help us control 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.870
 the frizz and I swear it smells like lithium 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.630
 are for our little face I have two 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.060
 products here the first one is this cream 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.030
 for bobby braun eyes that I love 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.799
 has a consistency like super 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.600
 thin super liquid and does not know how 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.579
 the arm I am to leave all this part 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.410
 super treated and I like it too 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.299
 put on my eyelids to avoid 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.500
 any type of wrinkles notice the 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.900
 product for the face that I used 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.569
 very much is this floor pointer too 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.580
 it's cosmetics and it's called trap 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.800
 and 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.630
 and it is important to know how it is used 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.250
 because I was misusing and saying 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.020
 what is this and the only thing that you have to 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.060
 to do is to rinse yourself a towel 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.010
 hot it is important to do that step 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.600
 because I was trying to rinse it 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.170
 with nothing more water and it was like 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.760
 everything beautiful that is in another product 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.290
 which I want to talk about in this video 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.120
 that really is not a favorite but 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.250
 About two weeks ago, upload a photo of 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.440
 my nails that I made in a room that 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.270
 They were mate and many asked me how 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.670
 like fabrics there are like pvc fabrics and 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.190
 I do not know what but I did them in a 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.630
 lounge and I do not know how to do that but not 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.520
 worry you can do what 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.600
 same their houses and they are simply bought 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.150
 one like these 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.550
 I have this to forget that it is for 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.200
 make the nails mate and abajito in the 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.040
 inscription box left them all in case 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.660
 they want to buy it 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.610
 now we go with my favorite part and it 's 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.110
 the makeup to start with this 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.480
 palette of stigma that the truth the 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.760
 I received later this month but I've 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.340
 very much used these colors landmarks 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.720
 from above that as more neutral but I 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.340
 I would like you to dry the 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.230
 pallets that have sigma that are very 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.209
 pretty where super quality and not 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.860
 they are so expensive and as always they are left 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.350
 that he aroused so that they save 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.300
 percent lately I'm super 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.329
 Traumatized with contouring my face 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.850
 cross it very best and for this I have 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.160
 this bronze is called lowered mom and is 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.800
 precious is a super matte browser 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.770
 perfect for contouring and it was not so 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.960
 expensive or it was like 20 dollars abajito him 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.670
 He said everything I did not tell them I'm trauma 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.290
 tenth with contour me face 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.800
 so I decided to invest in this 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.260
 brochita that is the sigma f 05 that 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.780
 is perfect for outlining is super 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.880
 soft and I really love it and another 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.930
 brochita that I have used together with this 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.180
 is the f 50 say more than you have these 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.950
 fibers that helps me a lot when 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.140
 I'm with turning and sometimes when we 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.030
 it's like the hairline here this helps us 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.660
 to blur super well that does not look 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.419
 as a line and wait was also used 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.580
 very much the 266 of maca for 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.250
 Make up my eyebrows 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.509
 it's perfect I used to hate this brushes 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.629
 because I had bought it for 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:13.939
 delineate my eyes with the inab gel 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:16.129
 and the truth did not help me anything but 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:18.199
 I decided to start using it for my daughters and 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.849
 I loved it too this month I'm super 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.150
 obsessed with this liner 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:25.909
 capcom I saw that it's called tattoo mine erc and 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.889
 It's beautiful, it's like the 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:31.569
 puntita is super slim and helps us 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:33.699
 as to have a super precise delineation 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.740
 I love this you can get it in 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.809
 sephora well this month is used 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.779
 much better and blender like that 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:42.759
 I decided to leave a little bit for peace and s80 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:44.499
 of sigma and I also like it very much 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.689
 how does this work all of which 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:48.969
 that homes do not work well if 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:51.309
 we do not put them in water they remember me 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:52.929
 favorite video of the previous month 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:55.029
 I mentioned that functional status with 

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:58.539
 false eyelashes and that I love and 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:06:01.240
 all that and this month I'm in love with 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.729
 this receiver to stick tabs that is 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.039
 of house or flashes and this one was super 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.379
 cheap I do not remember how much it cost but 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.300
 I know cheap work left them all 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.219
 as time another favorite of this month is 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.080
 a website that in fact that 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.449
 I bought this kimono in case you liked it 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.059
 can go to check the page abajito 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.469
 I leave the link as always and this 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:22.990
 I loved it because they have things 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:24.490
 as super cheap what they are very 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.009
 impatient I do not recommend this 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.319
 page because if it takes like three 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.930
 Weekdays to get to our house but 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.850
 the truth I 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.160
 what they expect because it's worth the 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.530
 things are super good price that shipping 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.000
 free and quality is super good the 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.889
 store of which I am speaking to you 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.449
 llama choice another favorite this month 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.490
 are these white men who are from 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.710
 droplets I swear I have not stopped 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.360
 use since I bought them and the best is 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.070
 that I have the super small foot then 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.900
 with peron is as a child and they cost me super 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.789
 cheap, I highly recommend them 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.590
 talk like they do not get much out of 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.750
 trouble when we do not know how to shoes 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.389
 put on because I swear they sometimes go 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:03.389
 with everything and I recommend some white 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:05.160
 are the blacks are the picks and well that 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:07.650
 it was all because of today's video I hope that 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.150
 they liked that it served them 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.130
 gm in the comments what were your 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.380
 favorite products this month so that
