station dock which is this great going
along<00:00:27.840> here<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.529> then<00:00:29.310> we've<00:00:29.580> got<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.760> slope<00:00:30.269> or

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
along here and then we've got a slope or

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.889 
along here and then we've got a slope or
block<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.740> slope<00:00:32.070> up<00:00:32.279> we've<00:00:32.730> got<00:00:32.759> stands<00:00:33.360> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
block so we slope up we've got stands to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.590 
block so we slope up we've got stands to
support<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.860> everything<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.190> that

support it and everything like that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.930 
support it and everything like that
Moss<00:00:37.079> straight<00:00:37.559> along<00:00:37.829> there<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.700> we've<00:00:38.910> got

Moss straight along there and we've got

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.729 
Moss straight along there and we've got
a<00:00:39.090> slope<00:00:39.480> down<00:00:39.780> block<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.350> then<00:00:40.500> we're<00:00:40.620> going

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
down and all the way across so adds a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.410 
down and all the way across so adds a
lot<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.190> different<00:00:47.610> trap<00:00:47.850> types<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
lot of different trap types in the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.910 
lot of different trap types in the
Minecraft<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.140> actually<00:00:49.289> build<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
Minecraft so you can actually build a

Minecraft so you can actually build a
rollercoaster<00:00:50.280> rather<00:00:50.820> than<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
rollercoaster rather than just a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.290 
rollercoaster rather than just a

this pneumatic and also called pneumatic
log<00:02:53.760> launch<00:02:54.360> mechanism<00:02:54.840> that's<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.680> mouthful

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
log launch mechanism that's a mouthful

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.730 
log launch mechanism that's a mouthful
that's<00:02:56.790> what<00:02:56.910> she<00:02:57.060> said<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:58.200> speed<00:02:58.470> us<00:02:58.620> up

across the guys we want to be going fast

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.840 
across the guys we want to be going fast
that's<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.890> whole<00:03:05.130> point<00:03:05.340> we<00:03:05.550> want<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.760> be

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
that's the whole point we want to be

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.400 
that's the whole point we want to be
doing<00:03:06.000> flips<00:03:06.390> but<00:03:06.600> unfortunately<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.200> couldn't

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
doing flips but unfortunately I couldn't

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.890 
doing flips but unfortunately I couldn't
get<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.830> work<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.730> we<00:03:09.210> can't<00:03:09.450> go<00:03:09.600> around

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
get that to work and we can't go around

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.320 
get that to work and we can't go around
corners<00:03:10.140> very<00:03:10.440> fast<00:03:10.940> but<00:03:11.940> we<00:03:12.090> will<00:03:12.180> just

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
corners very fast but we will just

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.550 
corners very fast but we will just
continue<00:03:12.570> doing<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.110> here

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
continue doing this here

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.250 
continue doing this here
I<00:03:13.640> imagine<00:03:14.640> we'll<00:03:14.730> go<00:03:14.940> downhill<00:03:15.360> pretty<00:03:16.110> fast

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
I imagine we'll go downhill pretty fast

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.490 
I imagine we'll go downhill pretty fast
as<00:03:16.650> well<00:03:16.830> so<00:03:17.400> we'll<00:03:17.580> leave<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.000> bit<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:18.570> then

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
as well so we'll leave that bit and then

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.310 
as well so we'll leave that bit and then

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
of a corner then a little bit of a speed

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.949 
of a corner then a little bit of a speed
go<00:03:37.620> down<00:03:37.910> fast<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.180> we<00:03:39.450> come<00:03:39.720> in<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.370> nice

go down fast and we come in to a nice

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.650 
go down fast and we come in to a nice
fast<00:03:42.959> quick<00:03:43.560> halt<00:03:43.980> yep<00:03:44.910> because<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.450> makes

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
fast quick halt yep because that makes

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.340 
fast quick halt yep because that makes
sense<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:46.140> nice<00:03:46.550> fast<00:03:47.550> finish<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.239> then<00:03:48.840> ready

but we're not on bricks to this guy's we

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.640 
but we're not on bricks to this guy's we
want<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.150> constantly<00:03:57.570> ride<00:03:58.110> this<00:03:58.350> roller

so yeah rollercoaster mod for Minecraft
1.7.10<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:03.590> let's<00:04:04.590> go<00:04:04.890> Oh<00:04:07.310> snow<00:04:08.310> build<00:04:08.610> up<00:04:08.790> as

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
1.7.10 and let's go Oh snow build up as

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.880 
1.7.10 and let's go Oh snow build up as
we<00:04:09.060> approach<00:04:09.420> inhale<00:04:09.780> odd<00:04:10.140> we<00:04:10.500> hit<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.769> hill

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
we approach inhale odd we hit the hill

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.449 
we approach inhale odd we hit the hill
and<00:04:11.040> go<00:04:11.100> fast<00:04:11.370> hit<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.880> pneumatic<00:04:12.560> M<00:04:13.560> thing

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
and go fast hit the pneumatic M thing

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.890 
and go fast hit the pneumatic M thing
I'm<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.850> ghost<00:04:15.060> go<00:04:15.209> fast<00:04:15.450> all<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.630> way<00:04:15.750> around

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
I'm a ghost go fast all the way around

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.860 
I'm a ghost go fast all the way around
oh<00:04:16.080> yes<00:04:16.410> oh<00:04:16.820> gosh<00:04:17.820> we<00:04:18.060> have<00:04:18.299> not<00:04:18.510> done<00:04:18.720> any

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
oh yes oh gosh we have not done any

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.250 
oh yes oh gosh we have not done any
testing<00:04:19.320> we've<00:04:19.560> hit<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.730> slope<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.450> I<00:04:22.049> think

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
testing we've hit the slope and I think

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.440 
testing we've hit the slope and I think
I've<00:04:22.380> just<00:04:22.590> broke<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.979> truck<00:04:23.160> as<00:04:23.310> well<00:04:23.720> yeah

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
I've just broke the truck as well yeah

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.610 
I've just broke the truck as well yeah
Oh<00:04:25.480> No<00:04:27.180> guys<00:04:28.180> have<00:04:28.360> just<00:04:28.660> approached<00:04:29.380> the

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
Oh No guys have just approached the

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.470 
Oh No guys have just approached the
first<00:04:29.860> bend<00:04:30.310> they<00:04:30.790> had<00:04:30.910> another<00:04:31.090> first<00:04:31.330> when

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
first bend they had another first when

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.660 
first bend they had another first when
the<00:04:31.630> first<00:04:31.840> drop<00:04:32.140> and<00:04:32.590> Briggs<00:04:33.040> this<00:04:33.220> is<00:04:33.370> why<00:04:33.520> we

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
the first drop and Briggs this is why we

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.030 
the first drop and Briggs this is why we
test<00:04:33.940> roller<00:04:34.270> courses<00:04:34.750> in<00:04:34.960> real<00:04:35.260> life<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.800> in

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
test roller courses in real life and in

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.910 
test roller courses in real life and in
my<00:04:36.250> group<00:04:36.490> before<00:04:36.700> we<00:04:37.090> ride<00:04:37.330> them<00:04:37.890> so<00:04:38.890> I

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
my group before we ride them so I

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.830 
my group before we ride them so I
believe<00:04:39.400> this<00:04:39.520> needs<00:04:39.700> a<00:04:39.880> slope<00:04:40.300> down<00:04:40.600> block

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
believe this needs a slope down block

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.750 
believe this needs a slope down block
I'll<00:04:40.990> just<00:04:41.170> try<00:04:41.350> to<00:04:41.410> demonstrate<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.400> guys

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
I'll just try to demonstrate to you guys

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.040 
I'll just try to demonstrate to you guys
how<00:04:43.480> difficult<00:04:44.440> it<00:04:44.650> is<00:04:44.890> to<00:04:45.870> build<00:04:46.870> these

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
how difficult it is to build these

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.750 
how difficult it is to build these
trucks<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:47.680> then<00:04:47.800> hopefully<00:04:48.220> you'll<00:04:48.370> know

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
trucks and then hopefully you'll know

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.880 
trucks and then hopefully you'll know
that<00:04:48.790> for<00:04:49.060> yourself<00:04:49.390> I<00:04:49.630> just<00:04:50.290> need<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.710> find

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
that for yourself I just need to find

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.760 
that for yourself I just need to find
the<00:04:51.130> slope<00:04:51.400> down<00:04:51.670> yeah<00:04:52.600> so<00:04:53.320> because<00:04:53.650> we're

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
the slope down yeah so because we're

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.950 
the slope down yeah so because we're
solving<00:04:53.950> down<00:04:54.310> we<00:04:54.610> need<00:04:54.790> a<00:04:54.820> slope<00:04:55.300> down<00:04:55.540> truck

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
solving down we need a slope down truck

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.040 
solving down we need a slope down truck
and<00:04:56.230> this<00:04:56.590> is<00:04:56.740> how<00:04:56.890> difficult<00:04:57.460> it<00:04:57.670> is<00:04:57.700> to<00:04:58.050> place

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
and this is how difficult it is to place

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.730 
and this is how difficult it is to place
the<00:04:59.230> trucks<00:05:00.840> all<00:05:01.840> right<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.260> I'll<00:05:02.380> place<00:05:02.560> it

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
the trucks all right so I'll place it

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.870 
the trucks all right so I'll place it
here<00:05:03.430> yep<00:05:05.040> right<00:05:06.040> see<00:05:06.280> that's<00:05:06.310> not<00:05:06.700> right

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
here yep right see that's not right

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.030 
here yep right see that's not right
that's<00:05:07.240> not<00:05:07.360> in<00:05:07.510> the<00:05:07.570> right<00:05:07.660> place<00:05:07.810> there<00:05:08.470> it's

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
that's not in the right place there it's

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.580 
that's not in the right place there it's
not<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.250> right<00:05:09.400> place<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:10.120> it<00:05:11.020> possibly<00:05:11.500> is

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
not the right place and it possibly is

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.440 
not the right place and it possibly is
the<00:05:11.770> red<00:05:11.920> bliss<00:05:12.100> but<00:05:12.490> sometimes<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.090> place<00:05:13.300> it

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
the red bliss but sometimes you place it

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.330 
the red bliss but sometimes you place it
and<00:05:13.540> it<00:05:13.600> just<00:05:13.630> doesn't<00:05:13.900> go<00:05:14.140> right<00:05:14.380> so<00:05:15.070> you<00:05:15.130> need

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
and it just doesn't go right so you need

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.070 
and it just doesn't go right so you need
to<00:05:15.460> need<00:05:15.730> to<00:05:15.820> get<00:05:15.970> your<00:05:16.090> hammer<00:05:16.300> and<00:05:16.600> just

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
to need to get your hammer and just

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.240 
to need to get your hammer and just
