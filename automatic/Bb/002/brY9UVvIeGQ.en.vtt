goes on to get more teeth because

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.390 
goes on to get more teeth because
they're<00:03:01.560> running<00:03:01.770> out<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.890> teeth<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.220> we<00:03:02.280> have

no idea why they're running out of teeth

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.900 
no idea why they're running out of teeth
when<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.140> found<00:03:04.620> out<00:03:04.890> what<00:03:05.160> they<00:03:05.310> use<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.700> teeth

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
when I found out what they use the teeth

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.890 
when I found out what they use the teeth
for<00:03:06.180> mice<00:03:06.420> my<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:07.230> wash<00:03:08.070> not<00:03:08.970> expecting<00:03:09.870> that

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
for mice my I wash not expecting that

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.720 
for mice my I wash not expecting that
what<00:03:10.410> was<00:03:10.560> your<00:03:10.710> original<00:03:10.860> theory<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.460> thought

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
what was your original theory I thought

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.699 
what was your original theory I thought
maybe<00:03:12.060> they<00:03:12.450> were<00:03:12.510> kind<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.840> wishes<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.500> that

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
maybe they were kind of wishes in that

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.400 
maybe they were kind of wishes in that
realm<00:03:14.070> or<00:03:14.580> teeth<00:03:14.910> if<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.480> teeth<00:03:15.750> correspond

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
realm or teeth if the teeth correspond

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.260 
realm or teeth if the teeth correspond
to<00:03:16.500> creating<00:03:17.100> like<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.250> human<00:03:17.700> body

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
to creating like a human body

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.540 
to creating like a human body
what<00:03:18.959> does<00:03:19.170> whipping<00:03:19.590> yourself<00:03:19.709> correspond

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
what does whipping yourself correspond

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.490 
what does whipping yourself correspond
to<00:03:20.700> what<00:03:20.970> kind<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.209> magic<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.110> I'm<00:03:22.350> not

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
to what kind of magic is that I'm not

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.100 
to what kind of magic is that I'm not
exactly<00:03:23.010> sure<00:03:23.280> how<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.610> torturing<00:03:24.600> people

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
exactly sure how the torturing people

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.590 
exactly sure how the torturing people
gets<00:03:25.560> transformed<00:03:26.160> into<00:03:26.400> magic<00:03:27.390> that<00:03:27.570> you

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
gets transformed into magic that you

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.420 
gets transformed into magic that you
could<00:03:28.020> use<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.470> know<00:03:28.560> I'm<00:03:28.620> saying<00:03:28.980> but<00:03:29.310> she

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
could use you know I'm saying but she

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.970 
could use you know I'm saying but she
went<00:03:29.550> into<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.760> basement<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.360> we<00:03:30.900> saw<00:03:31.140> Vega

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
went into that basement and we saw Vega

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.590 
went into that basement and we saw Vega
I<00:03:32.220> thought<00:03:32.459> maybe<00:03:32.640> if<00:03:32.910> they<00:03:33.030> get<00:03:33.180> killed

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
I thought maybe if they get killed

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.840 
I thought maybe if they get killed
they<00:03:33.810> have<00:03:33.990> to<00:03:34.140> be<00:03:34.320> laid<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:34.830> rest<00:03:35.070> may<00:03:35.610> be<00:03:35.670> in

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
they have to be laid to rest may be in

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.100 
they have to be laid to rest may be in
there<00:03:36.060> for<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.330> bit<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.660> then<00:03:36.780> they<00:03:36.900> wake<00:03:37.080> up
