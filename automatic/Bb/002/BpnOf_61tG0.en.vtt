00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.350
 and therefore a warm welcome to 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.000
 second follow with oli yorks ours 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.950
 second let in the last hour 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.610
 So we do not have it now 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.020
 We have a painful hour 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.490
 figured out what it means when we do 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.009
 not where I was just here 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.460
 because I need the on later for the c 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:31.369
 w nevermind ward off painfully 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.200
 figured out what it means when you do 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.360
 with clothes in klingenbogen pure run 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.410
 and not neat on fits exactly 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.060
 We now have this reason in ours 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 factory a joke am still three 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.300
 featurettes and this time we have one 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.550
 full load on hock dresses that 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.780
 actually 44 pieces I am very 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.420
 curious if we do not use it with it 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.700
 something nice and can schnetzeln 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.860
 look what we find maybe 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.570
 can also perform a thicker and 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.340
 This time I look that we maybe the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.680
 klamm burg rauslocken a bit 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.060
 and then sees red flashing 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.129
 there would be no units here 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.009
 have because it indeed almost the pigs at 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.799
 the tactics is because we have nothing 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.670
 have in any direction the 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.440
 kill pigs 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.840
 the pigs the pigs from the 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.030
 get clear quasi to be able to kill 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.530
 because then only our true ones 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.300
 king meant that means we have to have them 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.770
 flashing that means there must be no magic 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.490
 come out because then we are 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.290
 almost blind and I want to say I'm looking for 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.250
 us a mix of really right 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.540
 your blood and a mix 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.799
 yes, where it is a bit competition 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.810
 the last time a bit has fallen 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.729
 Let's see how it works this time 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.740
 I've found a vengeance now 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.590
 I'm actually unsure if we have the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.670
 should attack 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.450
 I could imagine that one 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.100
 overkill will or will miss you 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.750
 Up here is just that 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.619
 I 'm sorry now I'm just too 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.570
 very much in the fingers 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.039
 But I'm going to look first 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.030
 First time if we buy the clear where and 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.950
 long tie 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.409
 it's going to lure us clear whether 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.150
 seems to be empty 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.160
 the skeletons from essential to the last 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:14.080
 envisaged chasing a still 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.190
 Let's get out what we have now 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.300
 Let's try that 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.739
 I never really do it with hawx 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.350
 three pages at the same time that is 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.239
 can destroy from here and from here 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.610
 sometimes because time is running us too 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:31.569
 grows three fingers simultaneously and 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:35.280
 look that is running and then sit down 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.280
 they were actually perfect and would have to 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.239
 very curious 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.239
 With 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.330
 last time 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.470
 how strong they are 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.090
 this is unbelievable meant this time 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.130
 That's far too many you can offer 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.370
 with high wheels if you do not need 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:06.620
 one has already driven correctly 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.150
 no wonder I have to say that at 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.430
 rock liner is easy to have that 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.000
 cleanest you can get 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.780
 so quickly turn around 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.780
 Of course, evil can end 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.430
 Revenge is not going to get many cups 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.600
 but for that I am, nevertheless, am 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.920
 I 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.090
 a first time with 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.090
 take offense 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.920
 No 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.120
 she is 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.350
 but we can calculate what 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:50.209
 that costs you to Fulda Rottweiler 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:54.440
 amigos him 300 karl gold 149 6 4 and 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.180
 1040 dark elixir let's see 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.800
 We calculate this time and that her 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.580
 Know how people hawks are relative 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.320
 cheap in relation to the others 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.760
 dark units for being that way 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.650
 Effective costs are 65 points per level 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.580
 five did I think I would have called 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.930
 44 pieces 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.000
 cost me scarce 2.8 1000 Dark 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.769
 elixir well I agree with that now 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.180
 plus did not I 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.150
 no with whom just incredibly like 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.130
 and we'll take another look 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.730
 I'm a bit energetic that 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.530
 seen naturally and actually does 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.640
 one does not like me the wikileaks 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.500
 but I had stayed 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.420
 somehow after that alone 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.800
 the feeling that I'm one again 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.980
 chosen opponent has a lot to 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.980
 long 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.349
 horse riding 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.759
 not nights just because I'm the dark one 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.559
 Elixir must collect and then I want 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.709
 say something for this hawk ride round 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:06.059
 if you have any so exactly 

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:11.489
 I really could not pretend much 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:12.839
 For the future, ask if I have the lightning 

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:15.599
 has needs next time 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:17.429
 we will see, look otherwise 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.279
 I would say what that s.der 

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:22.289
 from that little short overkill of 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:24.629
 the box 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.739
 kgaa mrk easy peasy made now can 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.419
 I immediately added a wall up 

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:31.349
 I can give you a short update 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.789
 I am now at 132 I do not know 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.499
 Of course, the video can be a bit 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.050
 comes out later then I have 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:39.539
 maybe a few more by then 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.589
 I'm out makes it good to 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.589
 next time
