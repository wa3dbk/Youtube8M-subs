Pontiac<00:00:12.809> Solstice<00:00:13.280> we<00:00:14.280> originally<00:00:14.730> developed

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
Pontiac Solstice we originally developed

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.970 
Pontiac Solstice we originally developed
these<00:00:15.480> sequential<00:00:15.929> turn<00:00:16.260> signals<00:00:16.740> for<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
these sequential turn signals for the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.480 
these sequential turn signals for the
Saturn<00:00:17.340> Sky<00:00:17.580> back<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.080> 2007<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.289> ever<00:00:20.250> since

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
Saturn Sky back in 2007 and ever since

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.240 
Saturn Sky back in 2007 and ever since
then<00:00:20.820> ours<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.810> Solstice<00:00:22.260> owners<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:23.009> been

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
then ours the Solstice owners have been

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.310 
then ours the Solstice owners have been
asking<00:00:24.090> why<00:00:24.300> can't<00:00:24.570> they<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.929> sequential

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
asking why can't they have sequential

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.769 
asking why can't they have sequential
turn<00:00:25.619> signals<00:00:26.070> now<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:27.029> develop<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.509> lot<00:00:27.689> of

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
turn signals now we develop a lot of

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.990 
turn signals now we develop a lot of
these<00:00:27.839> products<00:00:28.349> because<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.279> fact<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.789> our

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
these products because the fact is our

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.350 
these products because the fact is our
roadsters<00:00:31.009> sit<00:00:32.009> very<00:00:32.310> low<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.760> ground<00:00:32.820> and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
roadsters sit very low to the ground and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.650 
roadsters sit very low to the ground and
we<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.410> had<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.650> lot<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.100> vehicles<00:00:35.430> hit<00:00:36.420> from

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
we have had a lot of vehicles hit from

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.170 
we have had a lot of vehicles hit from
the<00:00:36.780> front<00:00:36.990> hit<00:00:37.290> from<00:00:37.500> behind<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.880> driver

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the front hit from behind and the driver

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.600 
the front hit from behind and the driver
in<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.630> vehicle<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.230> hit<00:00:40.440> our<00:00:40.650> roadster<00:00:41.190> has

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
in the vehicle that hit our roadster has

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.490 
in the vehicle that hit our roadster has
always<00:00:41.820> said<00:00:42.120> well<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.360> vehicles<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:42.960> low<00:00:43.170> I

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
always said well the vehicles so low I

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.130 
always said well the vehicles so low I
didn't<00:00:43.800> see<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.040> they<00:00:44.280> are<00:00:44.340> braking<00:00:45.140> so

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
didn't see that they are braking so

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.550 
didn't see that they are braking so
we've<00:00:46.470> developed<00:00:47.310> a<00:00:47.580> series<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.940> products

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
we've developed a series of products

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.810 
we've developed a series of products
including<00:00:49.560> the<00:00:49.590> second<00:00:50.070> generation<00:00:50.430> brake

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
including the second generation brake

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.490 
including the second generation brake
light<00:00:51.030> pulsar<00:00:51.420> which<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.870> vehicle<00:00:52.320> does

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
light pulsar which this vehicle does

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.550 
light pulsar which this vehicle does
have<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.100> we've<00:00:54.060> also<00:00:54.570> developed<00:00:54.870> these<00:00:55.260> now

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
have and we've also developed these now

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.310 
have and we've also developed these now
these<00:00:55.860> new<00:00:56.360> sequential<00:00:57.360> turn<00:00:57.540> signal<00:00:57.930> modules

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
these new sequential turn signal modules

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
these new sequential turn signal modules
for<00:00:58.950> the<00:00:59.100> Pontiac<00:00:59.340> Solstice<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:01.440> let's<00:01:02.190> go

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
for the Pontiac Solstice so let's go

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.189 
for the Pontiac Solstice so let's go
ahead<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.610> demonstrate<00:01:02.910> these<00:01:03.600> real<00:01:03.930> quick

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
ahead and demonstrate these real quick

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.520 
ahead and demonstrate these real quick
we're<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> start<00:01:05.549> out<00:01:05.670> with<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.600> hazard

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
we're going to start out with a hazard

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.840 
we're going to start out with a hazard
situation<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.219> can<00:01:11.340> see<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.990> sequential

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
situation so you can see the sequential

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.310 
situation so you can see the sequential
modules<00:01:14.850> mounted<00:01:15.749> just<00:01:16.170> above<00:01:16.499> the<00:01:18.320> reverse

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
modules mounted just above the reverse

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.260 
modules mounted just above the reverse
lights<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.899> you<00:01:22.469> were<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.859> break<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:24.030> is

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
lights so if you were to break this is

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.239 
lights so if you were to break this is
the<00:01:24.479> effect<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.020> would<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.380> let's<00:01:26.070> go<00:01:26.189> ahead

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.249 
the effect you would get let's go ahead

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:28.999 
the effect you would get let's go ahead
and<00:01:26.429> stop<00:01:26.789> that<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> Matt<00:01:27.799> let's<00:01:28.799> go<00:01:28.950> ahead

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and stop that for a Matt let's go ahead

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.950 
and stop that for a Matt let's go ahead
and<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.219> a<00:01:29.249> right<00:01:29.490> turn

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:45.170 

and<00:01:37.960> let's<00:01:38.170> do<00:01:38.260> a<00:01:38.290> left<00:01:38.560> turn<00:01:42.900> and<00:01:43.900> let's<00:01:44.590> stop

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and let's do a left turn and let's stop

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.930 
and let's do a left turn and let's stop
and<00:01:46.180> want<00:01:46.390> you<00:01:46.510> break<00:01:46.780> for<00:01:47.080> me

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
and want you break for me

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:56.150 
and want you break for me
let's<00:01:48.940> stop<00:01:49.210> and<00:01:49.650> break<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:52.080> stop<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:53.550> break

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
let's stop and break and stop and break

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.990 
let's stop and break and stop and break
break<00:01:57.160> and<00:01:58.140> stop<00:01:59.369> and<00:02:00.369> let's<00:02:00.520> go<00:02:00.640> back<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.970> a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
break and stop and let's go back to a

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.260 
break and stop and let's go back to a
Hazzard<00:02:01.450> real<00:02:01.660> quick<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.850> as<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.150> can<00:02:04.270> see
