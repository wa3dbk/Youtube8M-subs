00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
last few weeks that it wouldn't work but

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.060 
last few weeks that it wouldn't work but
I've<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.600> had<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> proof<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.380> concept<00:01:46.530> today

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
I've just had a proof of concept today

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.480 
I've just had a proof of concept today
and<00:01:47.369> successfully<00:01:48.060> did<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.829> um<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:50.369> this

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490

what<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.100> came<00:01:53.220> up<00:01:53.369> with<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.880> how<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.210> worked

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
what I came up with and how this worked

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.389 
what I came up with and how this worked
now<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.409> may<00:01:55.500> notice<00:01:55.530> you're<00:01:55.920> staring<00:01:56.280> at

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
now you may notice you're staring at

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.179 
now you may notice you're staring at
link<00:01:56.610> he<00:01:57.570> was<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> high<00:01:57.930> quality<00:01:57.990> model<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.920> found

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
link he was a high quality model I found

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.249 
link he was a high quality model I found
online<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.270> free<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.899> use<00:02:01.049> to

online for for free just to use to
tinker<00:02:01.590> with<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:02.640> did<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
tinker with so I just did that for the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.230 
tinker with so I just did that for the
sake<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.810> having<00:02:03.960> something<00:02:04.259> fun<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.680> stare<00:02:04.920> at

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
sake of having something fun to stare at

this<00:02:06.240> funny-looking<00:02:06.630> skeleton<00:02:07.439> thingy<00:02:07.710> is

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
this funny-looking skeleton thingy is

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.889 
this funny-looking skeleton thingy is
the<00:02:08.429> armature<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.270> created<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
the armature that I created and the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.559 
the armature that I created and the
armature<00:02:10.890> allows<00:02:11.129> me<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.430> blender<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.970> animate

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569

more<00:02:13.709> easily<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.280> can<00:02:14.819> take<00:02:15.150> these<00:02:15.329> bones<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:15.959> I

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
more easily I can take these bones and I

more easily I can take these bones and I
can<00:02:16.140> move<00:02:16.260> them<00:02:16.469> out<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.769> I've<00:02:16.859> followed<00:02:17.489> a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
can move them out and I've followed a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.750 
can move them out and I've followed a
really<00:02:18.599> good<00:02:18.749> tutorial<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.499> I<00:02:20.370> have<00:02:20.519> full

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
really good tutorial and I have full

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
skeleton and I've weight painted the

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.369 
skeleton and I've weight painted the
means<00:02:27.870> i<00:02:27.989> can<00:02:28.109> show<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.439> actually

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
means i can show you that actually

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:36.259 
means i can show you that actually
object<00:02:31.379> mode<00:02:33.230> let<00:02:34.230> me<00:02:34.319> select<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:35.269> wait

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
object mode let me select this and wait

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.390 
object mode let me select this and wait
pain<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:36.719> you<00:02:36.780> see<00:02:36.989> when<00:02:37.109> i<00:02:37.139> select<00:02:37.379> a<00:02:37.620> bone<00:02:37.829> i'm

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
pain so you see when i select a bone i'm

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.890 
pain so you see when i select a bone i'm
able<00:02:38.609> to<00:02:38.700> paint<00:02:38.939> the<00:02:39.090> pixels<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.569> should

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
able to paint the pixels that should

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.580 
able to paint the pixels that should
move<00:02:40.049> on<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.650> mesh<00:02:40.859> along<00:02:41.310> with<00:02:41.579> that<00:02:41.849> bone<00:02:42.590> so

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
move on the mesh along with that bone so

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.550 
move on the mesh along with that bone so
then<00:02:43.799> when<00:02:44.159> i<00:02:44.189> select<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:44.909> know<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.450> head<00:02:46.260> the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
then when i select you know the head the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.959 
then when i select you know the head the
whole<00:02:46.709> torso<00:02:46.980> doesn't<00:02:47.400> move<00:02:47.459> just<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.819> head

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:47.969 
whole torso doesn't move just the head

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.339 
whole torso doesn't move just the head
because<00:02:48.180> i've<00:02:48.299> painted<00:02:48.540> them<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.930> way<00:02:49.109> and

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
because i've painted them that way and

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.189 
because i've painted them that way and
then<00:02:50.219> the<00:02:50.459> armature<00:02:50.969> controls<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.780> mesh<00:02:51.959> and

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:52.199 
then the armature controls the mesh and

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.720 
then the armature controls the mesh and
it<00:02:52.319> has<00:02:52.409> some<00:02:52.560> special<00:02:52.769> constraints<00:02:53.519> built

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
it has some special constraints built

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.050 
it has some special constraints built
into<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:55.199> for<00:02:55.590> example<00:02:55.620> if<00:02:56.250> i<00:02:56.669> move<00:02:56.849> this

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
into it so for example if i move this

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.899 
into it so for example if i move this
bone<00:02:57.329> down<00:02:57.629> here<00:02:57.989> um<00:02:59.000> pose<00:03:00.000> mode<00:03:01.219> then<00:03:02.219> the<00:03:02.699> leg

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
bone down here um pose mode then the leg

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.979 
bone down here um pose mode then the leg
moves<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.829> mostly<00:03:04.829> realistic<00:03:05.489> manner<00:03:05.989> along

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
moves in a mostly realistic manner along

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.199 
moves in a mostly realistic manner along
with<00:03:07.199> it<00:03:07.349> they<00:03:08.250> can<00:03:08.400> bend<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.699> knee<00:03:08.849> it<00:03:09.030> can<00:03:09.150> do

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
with it they can bend the knee it can do

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.629 
with it they can bend the knee it can do
everything<00:03:09.329> so<00:03:09.599> all<00:03:09.629> this<00:03:09.900> helps<00:03:10.199> me<00:03:10.349> to<00:03:10.639> put

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
everything so all this helps me to put

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.939 
everything so all this helps me to put
the<00:03:11.879> figure<00:03:12.599> where<00:03:12.959> i<00:03:12.989> want<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.349> be<00:03:13.560> when<00:03:13.859> it

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:13.949 
the figure where i want it to be when it

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.270 
the figure where i want it to be when it
comes<00:03:14.129> to<00:03:14.310> animation<00:03:14.849> um<00:03:15.680> let<00:03:16.680> me<00:03:16.709> open<00:03:16.949> up<00:03:17.159> the

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
comes to animation um let me open up the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.330 
comes to animation um let me open up the
file<00:03:17.489> i'm<00:03:17.729> actually<00:03:17.909> was<00:03:18.449> working<00:03:18.780> with<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.340> i

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
file i'm actually was working with and i

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.210 
file i'm actually was working with and i
actually<00:03:20.639> did<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.269> walking<00:03:22.109> animation<00:03:22.259> so<00:03:23.159> you

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
actually did a walking animation so you

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.920 
actually did a walking animation so you
can<00:03:23.400> see<00:03:23.609> that<00:03:23.790> here<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.239> i<00:03:24.299> just<00:03:24.479> did<00:03:24.629> this<00:03:24.750> it

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
can see that here and i just did this it

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.569 
can see that here and i just did this it
took<00:03:25.109> me<00:03:25.259> you<00:03:25.620> know<00:03:25.739> week<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.189> a<00:03:26.220> half<00:03:26.250> or<00:03:26.549> so

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
took me you know week and a half or so

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.819 
took me you know week and a half or so
to<00:03:26.729> learn<00:03:26.970> all<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.269> stuff<00:03:27.329> but<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.019> followed<00:03:28.739> a

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
to learn all this stuff but I followed a

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:29.990 
to learn all this stuff but I followed a
tutorial<00:03:28.949> I<00:03:29.459> have<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.609> little<00:03:29.819> bit<00:03:29.970> of

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
tutorial I have a little bit of

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.729 
tutorial I have a little bit of
experience<00:03:30.449> with<00:03:30.599> animation<00:03:31.199> for<00:03:31.409> second

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
experience with animation for second

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.280 
experience with animation for second
life<00:03:31.859> so<00:03:32.159> that<00:03:32.280> helped<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.959> I'm<00:03:34.049> going<00:03:34.169> to<00:03:34.199> be

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
life so that helped so I'm going to be

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.569 
life so that helped so I'm going to be
able<00:03:34.349> to<00:03:34.500> create<00:03:34.590> all<00:03:34.799> my<00:03:34.919> animations<00:03:35.400> this

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
able to create all my animations this

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.339 
able to create all my animations this
way<00:03:35.729> and<00:03:35.970> instead<00:03:36.419> of<00:03:36.479> link<00:03:36.780> I'll<00:03:36.989> just<00:03:37.199> take

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
way and instead of link I'll just take

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.679 
way and instead of link I'll just take
the<00:03:37.560> mesh<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:37.949> Candice<00:03:38.310> creates<00:03:38.639> of<00:03:38.849> you

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
the mesh that Candice creates of you

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:41.360 
the mesh that Candice creates of you
know<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.930> main<00:03:40.019> character<00:03:40.500> or<00:03:40.769> enemies<00:03:41.129> or

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
know the main character or enemies or

whatever and I can just drop it right on
top<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.919> this<00:03:44.009> armature<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.669> I'll<00:03:45.299> have<00:03:45.449> a

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479 
top of this armature and I'll have a

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.990 
top of this armature and I'll have a
full<00:03:45.870> set<00:03:46.169> of<00:03:46.290> animations<00:03:46.889> ready<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.400> go<00:03:47.579> to

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
full set of animations ready to go to

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.749 
full set of animations ready to go to
save<00:03:48.209> myself<00:03:48.389> a<00:03:48.780> whole<00:03:48.989> bunch<00:03:49.199> of<00:03:49.319> time<00:03:49.759> so

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:50.759 
save myself a whole bunch of time so

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:53.899 
save myself a whole bunch of time so
from<00:03:51.120> here<00:03:51.479> I<00:03:51.659> took<00:03:52.199> this<00:03:52.590> animation<00:03:53.069> and<00:03:53.459> I

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
from here I took this animation and I

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.119 
from here I took this animation and I
saved<00:03:54.239> this<00:03:54.540> through<00:03:54.930> an<00:03:55.290> exporter<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:55.799> found

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
saved this through an exporter I found

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.819 
saved this through an exporter I found
as<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.400> direct<00:03:57.000> x<00:03:57.269> file<00:03:57.569> I<00:03:57.840> found<00:03:58.349> a<00:03:58.650> program

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
as a direct x file I found a program

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.649 
as a direct x file I found a program

you<00:04:00.689> in<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:00.959> video<00:04:01.139> because<00:04:01.500> it's<00:04:01.829> on<00:04:01.919> a

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
you in this video because it's on a

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.559 
you in this video because it's on a
windows<00:04:02.310> laptop<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.879> have<00:04:03.030> it's<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.269> windows

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
windows laptop I have it's a windows

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.189 
windows laptop I have it's a windows
only<00:04:03.719> program<00:04:04.280> unfortunately<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:06.540> that

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
only program unfortunately and that

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.959 
only program unfortunately and that
program<00:04:07.379> will<00:04:07.680> take<00:04:07.859> this<00:04:08.040> model<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:08.609> it'll

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:08.969 
program will take this model and it'll

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.969 
program will take this model and it'll
generate<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.449> spreadsheet<00:04:09.810> let<00:04:10.560> me<00:04:10.650> load<00:04:10.829> that

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
generate a spreadsheet let me load that

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.409 
generate a spreadsheet let me load that
for<00:04:11.219> you<00:04:11.340> now<00:04:11.459> so<00:04:11.699> you<00:04:11.789> can<00:04:11.969> see<00:04:12.180> what<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.389> looks

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
for you now so you can see what it looks

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.779 
for you now so you can see what it looks
like<00:04:12.719> and<00:04:12.989> I<00:04:13.739> had<00:04:13.919> to<00:04:14.039> actually<00:04:14.159> combine<00:04:14.639> it

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:14.789 
like and I had to actually combine it

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.129 
like and I had to actually combine it
all<00:04:14.849> together<00:04:15.030> with<00:04:15.299> another<00:04:15.689> program

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
all together with another program

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.580 
all together with another program
because<00:04:16.919> it<00:04:17.009> came<00:04:17.190> out<00:04:17.370> as<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:17.609> bunch<00:04:18.000> of

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
because it came out as a bunch of

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.319 
because it came out as a bunch of
columns<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:20.130> i<00:04:20.400> combined<00:04:20.880> all<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.090> these

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
columns so i combined all of these

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.810 
columns so i combined all of these
sprites<00:04:21.659> into<00:04:22.500> this<00:04:23.219> image

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
sprites into this image

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.110 
sprites into this image
let<00:04:24.910> me<00:04:25.000> zoom<00:04:25.240> in<00:04:25.450> here<00:04:25.680> move<00:04:26.680> over<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:27.850> you<00:04:27.940> can

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
let me zoom in here move over so you can

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.790 
let me zoom in here move over so you can
see<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.570> have<00:04:28.690> all<00:04:28.900> 20<00:04:29.170> frames<00:04:29.470> of<00:04:29.710> the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
see I have all 20 frames of the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.880 
see I have all 20 frames of the
animation<00:04:30.280> going<00:04:30.580> down<00:04:30.880> top<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.420> bottom<00:04:31.450> and

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
animation going down top to bottom and

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.160 
animation going down top to bottom and
then<00:04:32.890> I<00:04:33.250> have<00:04:33.790> all<00:04:34.030> eight<00:04:34.330> angles<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:34.990> over

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
then I have all eight angles so over

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.670 
then I have all eight angles so over
here<00:04:35.380> he's<00:04:35.500> facing<00:04:35.710> north<00:04:36.130> east<00:04:36.550> south<00:04:37.680> I'm

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
here he's facing north east south I'm

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.010 
here he's facing north east south I'm
sorry<00:04:39.010> northwest<00:04:39.460> southeast<00:04:39.670> and<00:04:40.210> then<00:04:40.780> all

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
sorry northwest southeast and then all

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.510 
sorry northwest southeast and then all
the<00:04:41.050> in<00:04:41.230> between<00:04:41.500> so<00:04:41.680> I<00:04:41.710> decided<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.250> do<00:04:42.370> eight

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
the in between so I decided to do eight

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.610 
the in between so I decided to do eight
angles<00:04:42.700> now<00:04:43.180> you<00:04:43.240> might<00:04:43.450> say<00:04:43.480> why<00:04:44.260> do<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.470> feet

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
angles now you might say why do the feet

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.790 
angles now you might say why do the feet
look<00:04:44.770> so<00:04:44.920> stupid<00:04:45.160> I<00:04:45.720> had<00:04:46.720> a<00:04:46.750> problem<00:04:47.110> with<00:04:47.590> my

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
look so stupid I had a problem with my

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.460 
look so stupid I had a problem with my
armature<00:04:48.310> of<00:04:48.340> some<00:04:48.730> sort<00:04:49.090> when<00:04:49.630> I<00:04:49.660> exported<00:04:50.350> it

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
armature of some sort when I exported it

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.760 
armature of some sort when I exported it
the<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.610> feet<00:04:51.820> went<00:04:52.060> flying<00:04:52.420> off<00:04:52.660> and<00:04:52.960> then<00:04:53.170> so

export<00:05:23.560> out<00:05:23.740> of<00:05:23.860> blender<00:05:24.250> and<00:05:24.430> bring<00:05:24.640> stuff

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
export out of blender and bring stuff

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.700 
export out of blender and bring stuff
into<00:05:25.210> other<00:05:25.390> programs<00:05:25.840> with<00:05:26.020> animation<00:05:26.500> is

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
into other programs with animation is

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.770 
into other programs with animation is
tenuous<00:05:27.040> at<00:05:27.430> best<00:05:27.460> so<00:05:28.360> I'm<00:05:28.420> hopeful<00:05:28.660> I<00:05:28.750> can

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
tenuous at best so I'm hopeful I can

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.260 
tenuous at best so I'm hopeful I can
iron<00:05:29.200> that<00:05:29.320> out<00:05:29.380> because<00:05:29.740> it's<00:05:29.980> it's<00:05:30.400> you<00:05:31.150> know

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
iron that out because it's it's you know

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.270 
iron that out because it's it's you know
my<00:05:31.480> my<00:05:31.900> workflow<00:05:32.320> really<00:05:32.620> depends<00:05:33.010> on<00:05:33.070> some

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
my my workflow really depends on some

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.710 
my my workflow really depends on some
stuff<00:05:33.490> that's<00:05:33.670> a<00:05:33.820> little<00:05:33.850> easier<00:05:34.180> than<00:05:34.690> I

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
stuff that's a little easier than I

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.380 
stuff that's a little easier than I
would<00:05:34.930> like<00:05:34.960> but<00:05:35.710> it's<00:05:36.550> amazing<00:05:36.910> to<00:05:37.150> be<00:05:37.300> able

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
would like but it's amazing to be able

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.690 
would like but it's amazing to be able
to<00:05:37.540> take<00:05:37.720> these<00:05:37.900> models<00:05:38.350> and<00:05:38.560> turn<00:05:39.430> them<00:05:39.550> into

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
to take these models and turn them into

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.550 
to take these models and turn them into
these<00:05:39.880> sprite<00:05:40.300> sheets<00:05:40.570> based<00:05:40.840> on<00:05:41.020> animations

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
these sprite sheets based on animations

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.840 
these sprite sheets based on animations
I<00:05:41.680> did<00:05:41.860> it's<00:05:42.010> going<00:05:42.130> to<00:05:42.190> save<00:05:42.370> me<00:05:42.490> a<00:05:42.520> bunch<00:05:42.730> of

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.890 
game alright here's my game looks pretty
silly<00:05:54.040> because<00:05:54.280> the<00:05:54.700> you<00:05:55.510> know<00:05:55.600> the<00:05:55.750> model

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
silly because the you know the model

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.510 
silly because the you know the model
isn't<00:05:56.260> textured<00:05:56.650> it<00:05:56.800> isn't<00:05:57.040> in<00:05:57.100> high<00:05:57.250> quality

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
isn't textured it isn't in high quality

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.850 
isn't textured it isn't in high quality
right<00:05:57.850> now<00:05:58.030> and<00:05:58.240> it<00:05:58.330> isn't<00:05:58.860> shadowing

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
right now and it isn't shadowing

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.470 
right now and it isn't shadowing
properly<00:06:00.340> or<00:06:00.520> you<00:06:00.940> know<00:06:01.060> this<00:06:01.300> is<00:06:01.360> just

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
properly or you know this is just

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.030 
properly or you know this is just
placeholder<00:06:02.110> stuff<00:06:02.320> to<00:06:02.470> prove<00:06:02.710> that<00:06:02.890> this

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
placeholder stuff to prove that this

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.160 
placeholder stuff to prove that this
worked<00:06:03.310> I<00:06:03.580> was<00:06:04.030> so<00:06:04.150> excited<00:06:04.240> it<00:06:04.660> did<00:06:04.840> work<00:06:04.990> I

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
standing a pose out of that walking

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.200 
standing a pose out of that walking
sprite<00:06:11.920> sheet<00:06:12.190> for<00:06:12.670> when<00:06:12.760> the<00:06:12.850> character

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
sprite sheet for when the character

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.270 
sprite sheet for when the character

standing but when i click i essentially

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.020 
standing but when i click i essentially
have<00:06:15.550> full<00:06:15.940> high<00:06:16.240> quality<00:06:16.830> 3d<00:06:17.830> motion<00:06:18.640> and

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
have full high quality 3d motion and

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.000 
have full high quality 3d motion and
this<00:06:19.510> is<00:06:19.630> all<00:06:19.750> based<00:06:19.900> off<00:06:20.170> that<00:06:20.230> sprite<00:06:20.770> sheet

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
this is all based off that sprite sheet

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.090 
this is all based off that sprite sheet
file<00:06:21.280> which<00:06:22.240> i'm<00:06:22.570> very<00:06:22.630> excited<00:06:23.290> about<00:06:23.470> now

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
file which i'm very excited about now

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.470 
file which i'm very excited about now
you<00:06:24.190> can<00:06:24.280> see<00:06:24.460> it<00:06:24.610> looks<00:06:24.700> stupid<00:06:25.090> because<00:06:25.270> the

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
you can see it looks stupid because the

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.030 
you can see it looks stupid because the
jerks<00:06:25.720> are<00:06:25.870> out<00:06:26.020> and<00:06:26.140> the<00:06:26.230> feet<00:06:26.380> go<00:06:26.440> flying<00:06:26.860> off

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
jerks are out and the feet go flying off

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.580 
jerks are out and the feet go flying off
but<00:06:27.370> that's<00:06:27.850> something<00:06:27.970> I'll<00:06:28.240> figure<00:06:28.480> out<00:06:28.660> so

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
but that's something I'll figure out so

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.870 
but that's something I'll figure out so
hopefully<00:06:29.650> in<00:06:29.950> the<00:06:29.980> not<00:06:30.130> too<00:06:30.190> distant<00:06:30.370> future

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
hopefully in the not too distant future

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.310 
hopefully in the not too distant future
I'll<00:06:31.510> actually<00:06:31.840> be<00:06:32.110> able<00:06:32.380> to<00:06:32.580> have<00:06:33.580> some<00:06:34.320> some

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
I'll actually be able to have some some

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.719 
I'll actually be able to have some some
nice<00:06:35.530> final<00:06:36.490> looking<00:06:37.060> artwork

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729 
nice final looking artwork

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:39.689 
nice final looking artwork
as<00:06:37.819> opposed<00:06:38.180> to<00:06:38.330> you<00:06:38.659> know<00:06:38.689> placeholder<00:06:39.439> art

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:39.699 
as opposed to you know placeholder art

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.100 
as opposed to you know placeholder art
I'll<00:06:40.699> have<00:06:40.849> all<00:06:41.059> eight<00:06:41.240> directions<00:06:41.599> working

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
I'll have all eight directions working

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.239 
I'll have all eight directions working
instead<00:06:42.319> of<00:06:42.499> just<00:06:42.650> the<00:06:42.800> four<00:06:43.039> cardinal

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:43.249 
instead of just the four cardinal

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.749 
instead of just the four cardinal
directions<00:06:43.490> and<00:06:44.180> I'll<00:06:45.080> start<00:06:45.349> adding<00:06:45.759> running

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 
directions and I'll start adding running

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.269 
directions and I'll start adding running
animation<00:06:46.999> I'll<00:06:47.360> learn<00:06:47.900> how<00:06:48.110> to<00:06:48.249> attach<00:06:49.249> the

00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:49.279 
animation I'll learn how to attach the

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:51.309

2d sprites of 3d models I kind of rushed

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.890 
2d sprites of 3d models I kind of rushed
through<00:07:00.860> this<00:07:00.979> a<00:07:01.039> little<00:07:01.219> bit<00:07:01.460> so<00:07:01.699> I<00:07:01.999> hope<00:07:02.809> that

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
through this a little bit so I hope that

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.320 
through this a little bit so I hope that
makes<00:07:03.259> sense<00:07:03.469> that's<00:07:04.460> the<00:07:04.610> workflow<00:07:05.059> that<00:07:05.089> I'm

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
makes sense that's the workflow that I'm

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.149 
makes sense that's the workflow that I'm
using<00:07:05.569> for<00:07:05.870> this<00:07:05.960> it<00:07:06.169> was<00:07:06.289> very<00:07:06.469> tricky<00:07:06.830> to<00:07:06.949> set

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:07.159 
using for this it was very tricky to set

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:09.339 
using for this it was very tricky to set
up<00:07:07.309> and<00:07:07.490> learn<00:07:07.699> but<00:07:08.599> like<00:07:08.719> I<00:07:08.839> said<00:07:08.900> it's<00:07:09.259> going

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:09.349 
up and learn but like I said it's going

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:10.749 
up and learn but like I said it's going
to<00:07:09.409> be<00:07:09.559> a<00:07:09.589> huge<00:07:09.860> advantage<00:07:10.039> in<00:07:10.490> the<00:07:10.550> long<00:07:10.580> run

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:10.759 
to be a huge advantage in the long run

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.489 
to be a huge advantage in the long run
because<00:07:11.149> I'm<00:07:11.539> going<00:07:11.839> to<00:07:11.930> be<00:07:12.050> able<00:07:12.139> to<00:07:12.319> have

because I'm going to be able to have

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:15.790 
because I'm going to be able to have
