00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
bumping the turkeys and bumping the deer

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.490 
bumping the turkeys and bumping the deer
and<00:02:11.489> stuff<00:02:11.849> like<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.360> because<00:02:12.810> scout<00:02:13.230> it's

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and stuff like that because scout it's

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.589 
and stuff like that because scout it's
going<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.769> be<00:02:13.860> very<00:02:14.040> hard<00:02:14.459> so<00:02:14.849> what<00:02:15.330> I've<00:02:15.450> done

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
going to be very hard so what I've done

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.720 
going to be very hard so what I've done
is<00:02:15.660> I've<00:02:15.870> set<00:02:15.900> up<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.200> trail<00:02:16.410> camera<00:02:16.650> back<00:02:17.370> here

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
is I've set up a trail camera back here

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.839 
is I've set up a trail camera back here
and<00:02:18.800> I've<00:02:19.800> got<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:20.010> pretty<00:02:20.190> low<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.640> tree

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
and I've got a pretty low on that tree

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.390 
and I've got a pretty low on that tree
because<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.180> ground<00:02:21.360> slopes<00:02:21.780> away<00:02:22.080> but

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
because the ground slopes away but

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.229 
because the ground slopes away but
basically<00:02:23.400> I'm<00:02:23.550> gonna<00:02:23.640> let<00:02:23.790> my<00:02:23.879> trail<00:02:24.120> camera

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
basically I'm gonna let my trail camera

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.910 
basically I'm gonna let my trail camera
do<00:02:24.480> my<00:02:24.629> scouting<00:02:24.900> for<00:02:25.170> me<00:02:25.319> when<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.650> come<00:02:25.860> out
