 disagreement the employee representatives 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.050
 point to a glaring lack of 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.790
 consultation in particular concerning 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.530

 it highlights the urgency of 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.930
 situation and the need to save the 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.860
 pension system in the function 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.680

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.180
 front of the scene the reform of the system 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.710
 retreats soon the state does not 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.960
 will have more funds to pay for 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.910
 retirees' pensions as a solution 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.320
 Government proposes the raising of 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.420
 the retirement age of two to 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:44.140
 five years and the increase in the rate of 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:46.570
 contribution it will be first of all 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.440
 gradually increase the starting age to 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.810
 retirement at 65 62 years old in 2015 and then 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.340
 for six additional months 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.840
 every year 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.600
 it will also involve increasing 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.580
 employer and employee contributions and 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.140
 to revise the basis of calculation of 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.120
 rights 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.120
 the state will be a partner in this reform 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.050
 trade union centers do not hear it 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.790
 not from that ear she believes that the 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.860
 reform of the pension system must 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.870
 be subject to further consultation 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:26.500
 broader in the context of a debate 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:28.630
 public movie argo starvation if the recovery 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.760
 the age of retirement should not 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.620
 in no case be mandatory and before 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.650
 the increase in contributions 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.290
 first of all, where are 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.590
 past the contributions paid by 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.590
 citizens during all these years of water 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.800
 same story in the Moroccan street 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.300
 raise the age of retirement to 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.300
 65 years is far from unanimous 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.720
 I am totally against working 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.720
 up to 65 years is unacceptable 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.330
 if the retirement age is 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.740
 raised to 65 there will be fewer posts 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.740
 for young workers 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.870
 these measures will reduce the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.180
 deficit of the general scheme but 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.970
 will not suffice to restore the balance of 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.790
 finances the government will have to engage 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.880
 an overhaul of the system of 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.880
 pensions
