00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.200 
make our life a lot easier and the final
two<00:00:57.960> things<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.590> strictly<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.640> game

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
two things are strictly for the game

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.299 
two things are strictly for the game
developing<00:01:00.809> side<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.829> first<00:01:02.100> is

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
developing side of it and the first is

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.270 
developing side of it and the first is
lwjgl<00:01:03.229> that's<00:01:04.229> lightweight<00:01:04.559> java<00:01:05.040> game

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
lwjgl that's lightweight java game

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.679 
lwjgl that's lightweight java game
library<00:01:05.570> that's<00:01:06.570> an<00:01:06.689> opengl<00:01:08.450> version<00:01:09.450> for

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
library that's an opengl version for

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.320 
library that's an opengl version for
java<00:01:09.960> that's<00:01:10.680> very<00:01:11.100> powerful<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.820> probably<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
java that's very powerful and probably a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.460 
java that's very powerful and probably a
little<00:01:12.420> bit<00:01:12.600> over<00:01:12.689> our<00:01:12.810> heads<00:01:13.140> when<00:01:13.350> we're

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
little bit over our heads when we're

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.530 
little bit over our heads when we're
first<00:01:13.830> looking<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.250> programming<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.820> we're

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
first looking at programming so we're

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.050 
first looking at programming so we're
also<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> allow<00:01:16.140> download<00:01:16.799> slick<00:01:17.610> 2d

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
also going to allow download slick 2d

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940 
also going to allow download slick 2d
and<00:01:18.330> that's<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.140> game<00:01:19.320> programming<00:01:19.619> library

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
and that's a game programming library

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.940 
and that's a game programming library
which<00:01:20.159> works<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.759> lwjgl<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.930> makes<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
which works with lwjgl and makes it a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.620 
which works with lwjgl and makes it a
little<00:01:23.070> bit<00:01:23.220> simpler<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.820> achieve<00:01:24.180> some

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
little bit simpler to achieve some

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.999 
little bit simpler to achieve some
results<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> little<00:01:25.380> bit<00:01:25.470> quicker<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.860> it's

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
results and a little bit quicker so it's

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.800 
results and a little bit quicker so it's
really<00:01:26.159> good<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.640> start<00:01:27.509> learning

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
really good to start learning

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.690 
really good to start learning
programming<00:01:28.110> by<00:01:28.320> using<00:01:28.500> slick<00:01:29.040> 2d<00:01:29.340> ok<00:01:29.640> so

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
programming by using slick 2d ok so

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.340 
programming by using slick 2d ok so
let's<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.210> ahead<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:30.780> these<00:01:30.900> four<00:01:31.170> pieces

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
let's go ahead and get these four pieces

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.840 
let's go ahead and get these four pieces
and<00:01:31.680> I'll<00:01:31.770> show<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:31.950> exactly<00:01:32.340> how<00:01:32.579> we're

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and I'll show you exactly how we're

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.630 
and I'll show you exactly how we're
going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.150> install<00:01:33.420> them<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.710> first<00:01:35.009> let's<00:01:35.430> get

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
going to install them so first let's get

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.490 
going to install them so first let's get
the<00:01:35.820> java<00:01:36.119> jdk<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.869> go<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> google<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.409> type

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
the java jdk just go to google and type

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.520 
the java jdk just go to google and type
java<00:01:38.100> jdk<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.780> first<00:01:40.020> link<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.320> going<00:01:40.470> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
java jdk and the first link is going to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.179 
java jdk and the first link is going to
take<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:42.680> Oracle's<00:01:43.680> website<00:01:44.040> right<00:01:44.130> here

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
take you to Oracle's website right here

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.249 
take you to Oracle's website right here
ok<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.689> want<00:01:45.810> right<00:01:46.020> here<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.229> the

ok so the one we want right here is the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.719 
ok so the one we want right here is the
Java<00:01:46.740> platform<00:01:47.030> jdk<00:01:48.030> 7<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:49.140> too<00:01:49.470> ok<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.549> it

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
Java platform jdk 7 you too ok so it

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
I've made a new folder called game

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.360 
I've made a new folder called game
program<00:05:06.480> with<00:05:06.630> slick<00:05:06.870> 2d<00:05:07.170> and<00:05:07.380> I<00:05:07.950> think<00:05:08.220> that's

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
program with slick 2d and I think that's

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.630 
program with slick 2d and I think that's
a<00:05:08.460> good<00:05:08.610> idea<00:05:08.760> for<00:05:09.150> you<00:05:09.330> as<00:05:09.480> well<00:05:09.630> ok<00:05:10.290> so<00:05:10.890> if<00:05:11.490> you

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
a good idea for you as well ok so if you

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.500 
a good idea for you as well ok so if you
want<00:05:11.790> to<00:05:11.880> put<00:05:12.000> everything<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:12.390> just

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
want to put everything you just

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.360 
want to put everything you just
downloaded<00:05:12.870> into<00:05:13.020> its<00:05:13.260> own<00:05:13.380> folder<00:05:13.740> that<00:05:14.280> way

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
downloaded into its own folder that way

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.590 
downloaded into its own folder that way
you<00:05:14.460> can<00:05:14.550> keep<00:05:14.610> track<00:05:14.910> of<00:05:15.000> everything<00:05:15.330> because

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
you can keep track of everything because

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.880 
you can keep track of everything because
you're<00:05:15.810> gonna<00:05:15.960> need<00:05:16.230> to<00:05:16.380> know<00:05:16.560> where<00:05:16.740> all

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
you're gonna need to know where all

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.860 
you're gonna need to know where all
these<00:05:17.040> pieces<00:05:17.280> are<00:05:17.520> at<00:05:17.670> before<00:05:18.570> we<00:05:18.720> can
