and<00:03:48.000> then<00:03:48.120> there<00:03:48.300> it<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.980> picked<00:03:49.980> again

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:07.270 

so<00:04:00.370> back<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.940> front

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.520 

Wanda's<00:04:08.000> goodness<00:04:08.420> this<00:04:08.810> was<00:04:08.959> part<00:04:09.230> i'll<00:04:09.350> show

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
Wanda's goodness this was part i'll show

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:20.000 
Wanda's goodness this was part i'll show
you<00:04:09.590> what's<00:04:09.800> it

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.500 

it<00:04:20.550> just<00:04:20.760> has<00:04:20.880> four<00:04:21.150> tabs<00:04:21.420> on<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.720> front<00:04:21.960> of<00:04:22.080> it

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
it just has four tabs on the front of it

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.020 
it just has four tabs on the front of it
so<00:04:24.510> these<00:04:24.630> are<00:04:24.690> super<00:04:25.200> cheap<00:04:25.850> don't<00:04:26.850> really

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
so these are super cheap don't really

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.630 
so these are super cheap don't really
pick<00:04:27.240> many<00:04:27.510> of<00:04:27.660> these<00:04:27.780> because<00:04:28.410> what<00:04:29.280> happens

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
pick many of these because what happens

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.160 
pick many of these because what happens
is<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:29.850> maintenance<00:04:30.210> guys<00:04:30.390> just<00:04:30.720> bust<00:04:31.020> them

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
is the maintenance guys just bust them

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.730 
is the maintenance guys just bust them
out<00:04:32.510> retail<00:04:33.510> on<00:04:33.660> one<00:04:33.690> of<00:04:33.930> these<00:04:34.050> is<00:04:34.290> like<00:04:34.440> three

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
out retail on one of these is like three

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.480 
out retail on one of these is like three
dollars<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:35.910> they're<00:04:36.240> not<00:04:36.330> going<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.780> pay<00:04:37.490> pay

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
dollars so they're not going to pay pay

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.650 
dollars so they're not going to pay pay
you<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.700> come<00:04:38.880> out<00:04:39.030> and<00:04:39.120> pick<00:04:39.330> one<00:04:39.360> of<00:04:39.570> these

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
you to come out and pick one of these

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.060 
you to come out and pick one of these
open<00:04:40.110> they're<00:04:40.230> just<00:04:40.380> going<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.530> pop<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.980> open

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
open they're just going to pop it open

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.660 
open they're just going to pop it open
themselves<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:42.020> buy<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.050> replacement<00:04:43.410> for<00:04:43.710> but

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.150 

you<00:04:47.670> can<00:04:47.790> see<00:04:47.910> there's<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.210> bowl<00:04:49.010> and<00:04:50.010> what

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
you can see there's the bowl and what

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.810 
you can see there's the bowl and what
you're<00:04:50.280> going<00:04:50.370> with<00:04:50.430> this<00:04:50.550> tension<00:04:50.850> bar<00:04:52.820> let's

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
you're going with this tension bar let's

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.390 
you're going with this tension bar let's
turn<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.540> lock<00:04:54.690> position

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
turn the lock position

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.800 
turn the lock position
because<00:04:56.970> you're<00:04:57.090> getting<00:04:57.330> that<00:04:57.389> little<00:04:57.600> slot

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
because you're getting that little slot

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.020 
because you're getting that little slot
right<00:04:57.960> there<00:04:58.490> attention<00:04:59.490> bar<00:04:59.610> gets<00:04:59.820> in<00:04:59.910> that

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
right there attention bar gets in that

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.740 
right there attention bar gets in that
little<00:05:00.240> slot

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.010 

that's<00:05:08.410> where<00:05:08.590> you're<00:05:08.710> applying<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.070> tension

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.470 

downward<00:05:13.020> I<00:05:13.730> get<00:05:14.730> my<00:05:14.820> thumb<00:05:15.030> out<00:05:15.180> of<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.330> way

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
downward I get my thumb out of the way

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.770 
downward I get my thumb out of the way
right<00:05:17.000> there<00:05:18.290> and<00:05:19.550> then<00:05:20.550> on<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.210> back<00:05:21.420> side<00:05:21.720> of

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
right there and then on the back side of

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:30.850 
right there and then on the back side of
this

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.170 

and<00:05:31.189> the<00:05:31.310> books

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.270 

yeah<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.330> fence<00:05:35.569> a<00:05:35.900> little<00:05:36.830> piece<00:05:37.160> right

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
yeah the fence a little piece right

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.350 
yeah the fence a little piece right
there<00:05:38.259> that<00:05:39.259> goes<00:05:39.500> into<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:40.099> gates<00:05:40.490> on<00:05:41.090> the

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
there that goes into the gates on the

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.909 
there that goes into the gates on the
wafers<00:05:41.810> and<00:05:42.880> as<00:05:43.880> you<00:05:43.970> can<00:05:44.090> see<00:05:44.120> there's<00:05:44.449> the

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
wafers and as you can see there's the

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.500 
wafers and as you can see there's the
oops

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.190 

there's<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.140> two<00:05:50.290> wafers<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:52.020> those<00:05:53.020> are<00:05:53.170> the

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
there's the two wafers and those are the

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.450 
there's the two wafers and those are the
gates<00:05:53.610> the<00:05:54.610> defense<00:05:54.940> slides<00:05:55.240> into<00:05:56.340> so<00:05:57.340> when

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
gates the defense slides into so when

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.500 
gates the defense slides into so when
it's<00:05:57.610> in<00:05:58.830> put<00:05:59.830> together<00:06:00.190> you've<00:06:00.820> got<00:06:01.000> both<00:06:01.480> of

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
it's in put together you've got both of

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.030 
it's in put together you've got both of
the<00:06:02.520> gates<00:06:03.520> over<00:06:03.880> here<00:06:04.620> under<00:06:05.620> the<00:06:05.740> spring

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
the gates over here under the spring

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.450 
the gates over here under the spring
tension<00:06:06.460> and<00:06:07.320> the<00:06:08.320> fence<00:06:08.620> is<00:06:08.830> catching<00:06:09.280> right

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
tension and the fence is catching right

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.080 
tension and the fence is catching right
here<00:06:10.830> they<00:06:11.830> get<00:06:12.010> pushed<00:06:12.190> over<00:06:12.430> so<00:06:12.760> the<00:06:12.880> fence

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
here they get pushed over so the fence

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.180 
here they get pushed over so the fence
drops<00:06:13.390> down<00:06:13.630> into<00:06:13.690> the<00:06:13.960> gates<00:06:14.170> and<00:06:14.500> then<00:06:15.100> it

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
drops down into the gates and then it

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.840 
drops down into the gates and then it
opens<00:06:15.460> up<00:06:16.350> so<00:06:17.350> there's<00:06:17.530> those<00:06:17.860> like<00:06:18.610> I<00:06:18.700> said

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
opens up so there's those like I said

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.400 
opens up so there's those like I said
this<00:06:18.940> is<00:06:19.000> just<00:06:19.270> super<00:06:19.630> you<00:06:20.170> can<00:06:20.320> see<00:06:20.530> just<00:06:21.460> junk

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
this is just super you can see just junk

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.990 
this is just super you can see just junk
but<00:06:23.410> so<00:06:23.740> they<00:06:23.890> are<00:06:23.950> a<00:06:24.220> lot<00:06:24.760> of<00:06:24.790> them<00:06:24.970> around

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
but so they are a lot of them around

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.800 
but so they are a lot of them around
here<00:06:26.820> there's<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:27.910> box<00:06:28.090> again<00:06:28.270> it's<00:06:28.540> a<00:06:28.600> guard

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
here there's the box again it's a guard

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.980 
here there's the box again it's a guard
number<00:06:29.110> 9<00:06:29.290> 19<00:06:30.300> it's<00:06:31.300> the<00:06:31.420> same<00:06:31.600> for<00:06:31.810> all<00:06:31.900> the

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
number 9 19 it's the same for all the

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.290 
number 9 19 it's the same for all the
little<00:06:32.200> letter<00:06:32.350> boxes<00:06:32.740> like<00:06:32.920> this<00:06:33.000> if<00:06:34.000> you<00:06:34.180> run

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
little letter boxes like this if you run

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.190 
little letter boxes like this if you run
into<00:06:34.330> them<00:06:34.750> you<00:06:35.170> can<00:06:35.350> bend<00:06:35.590> these<00:06:35.710> up<00:06:36.190> your<00:06:36.580> own

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
into them you can bend these up your own

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.110 
into them you can bend these up your own
if<00:06:38.200> anybody<00:06:38.650> wants<00:06:39.100> measurements<00:06:39.730> off<00:06:39.880> of
