00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:12.169
 this time we talk about the mantis 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.940
 religious scientific name mantis 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.679
 religious 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.600
 it is a big famous insect 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.540
 belonging to the order of the mantles of the 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.340
 the minds of all the family 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.250
 they know and everyone knows what a call 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.230
 religious for its characteristic way 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.140
 to hold the first pair of jointed legs 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.640
 almost like in prayer that actually 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.800
 way of keeping the legs has nothing to do with it 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.110
 nothing at all with prayer 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.090
 but let's go with the mantis in order 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.790
 religious is an insect with dimensions 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.620
 considerable being able to reach 7 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.690
 inches and a half in the female and the six 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.300
 in the male which is therefore slightly more 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.510
 small the color ranges from bright green 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.160
 to the brown diffused originally in 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.829
 africa this species has been introduced 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.520
 by mistake or on most of the 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.809
 the rest of the world is found in America 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.250
 northern and in large part 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.930
 Eurasia 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.360
 but being an insect attached to 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.250
 rather hot temperatures becomes 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.540
 increasingly rare as you proceed 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.610
 to the north 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.970
 in Italy, however, it is more or less widespread 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.920
 everywhere the mantis is probably one 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.950
 of the most efficient and ruthless predators 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.650
 of the microcosm the people who come often 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.350
 they are better apte torie and they are 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.390
 fitted with serrated pins making the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.549
 shoot like springs in a few cents 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.580
 of second able to capture insects and 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.930
 small animals of every kind and strength 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.270
 the feeling must be that of 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.920
 to be in a grip of blades than over 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.710
 that crush the prey to the keep 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.140
 stop at this point the mantis can 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.909
 start your meal without caring 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.630
 more so if the victim is still alive 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.479
 while the mantis is devoured 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.400
 religious is borax snaps suddenly 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.310
 to blend in thanks to the form and to the 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.159
 color knows how to wait for hours motionless to 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.689
 killing as few is not a real nightmare 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.090
 only for all other insects but 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.890
 even for spiders scorpions small amphibians 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.270
 even small reptiles per 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.270
 small mammals and small birds 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.140
 it is an insect that presents 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.760
 hetero metaboli a or metamorphosis 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.260
 incomplete 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.600
 this means that from eggs not 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.980
 larvae are born different from the adult who 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.480
 then they build a pupa for 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.780
 métamorphose areas change totally 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.070
 in short, form in mantises does not happen 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.970
 what we see for example in 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.060
 farfalle sowing produces a water ca 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.320
 a sort of bag containing eggs 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.510
 when the babies are born it looks like one 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.100
 miniature version of adults 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.459
 except that they don't have wings 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.080
 in this form they are called meani di le 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.880
 neanids grow by meeting 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.590
 different wetsuits with which they change 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.680
 exoskeleton become bigger and bigger 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.900
 but without ever changing any aspect 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.520
 changes before the final check 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.160
 a sketch of wings and at this point 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.810
 finally they are called nymphs with 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.330
 the last wetsuit comes out of the adult 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:07.580
 provided with alì that in any case la 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:09.110
 mantis very rarely uses the thing for 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.420
 however, the most famous mantis is 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.480
 the coupling in which the female often 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.820
 he beheads the male and devours him one thing 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.250
 brutal but certainly not due to malice 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.930
 rather I would say he needs the female 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.360
 of protein for egg development 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.670
 so much so that the breeding mantises 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.440
 always well fed often save the 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.030
 their lover 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.920
 being an insect the mantis 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.470
 it acts by instinct and eats everything 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.420
 that the female of the 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.070
 aggressive fierce mantis but does it for 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.980
 simply ensuring a future for 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.709
 his offspring the male dies for 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.239
 love but the most surprising thing is that 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.680
 the poor woman goes on 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.739
 the coupling even if the latter 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.489
 live devoured beheaded 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.709
 probably it is a mechanism 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.950
 evolutionary due to the presence of centers 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.269
 nerves also in the abdomen itself 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.519
 now that you know a little more about the 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.739
 mantis so beautiful but so brutal e 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.970
 respected it is a fierce one 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.560
 predator 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.489
 you have no idea what the killer is 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.489
 you could hold it in your hand
