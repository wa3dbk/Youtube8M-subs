00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 in today's video I'm going to show a 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.420
 novelty for you I received some 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.179
 time a kit with some produtinhos to 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.130
 test and today tell you a little 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.549
 of my experience because it is really 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.529
 cool when we get something 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.630
 and have a little time to test for 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.760
 know the product in order to make a 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.580
 Review a little more detailed 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.560
 Good, I got a colgate kit that's 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.330
 here in my hand it is necessary 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.060
 redhead then inside there are several 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.949
 among them what I go 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.649
 show you guys I'll tell you 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.540
 also before that I wanted to talk 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.399
 a little with you about the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.489
 care of the mouth and teeth 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.129
 also because I am the son of the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.780
 prosthetic my father always got on my foot 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.320
 at my sisters' feet for us 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.379
 really take care of the mouth of the teeth and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.110
 I'm already an adult today. 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.789
 That's good, I'll show you. 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.850
 now the news that I was 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.850
 commenting at the beginning of the video that it is a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.479
 new brush that the colgate tatÃ¡ flipping 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.060
 now that is in soft and a brush that 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.330
 besides being super cute is very 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.170
 different she has a thin path has a 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.780
 pearly finish on the cable is 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.380
 and looking at the fifth 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.360
 they appear to be incredibly thin 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.619
 they look like they are incredibly 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.720
 fine 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.990
 I got it here, I actually kept it. 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.810
 the little box to talk to you is a 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.380
 little more of the brush then she 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.070
 promises a deep and delicate cleaning 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:44.369
 certain with tips 17 times thinner 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.380
 so what I felt with this brush is 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.560
 extremely soft 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.130
 I do not think the gum not think k in 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.770
 time to brush does not bother and to be 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.540
 more thin also gives a sense of 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.390
 that it is entering all 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.060
 tooth corners as well and also gives 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.710
 a feeling after brushing teeth 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.479
 they are neither more 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.369
 neighbors I hope you have enjoyed 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.780
 I hope you enjoyed the video. 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.170
 of novelty 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.220
 Take care of your teeth. Kiss. 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.500
 great for you 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.560

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.560
