o'clock to correct so this is with
tessellation<00:04:06.250> on<00:04:07.080> then<00:04:08.080> I'll<00:04:08.230> turn

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
tessellation on then I'll turn

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.070 
tessellation on then I'll turn
tessellation<00:04:09.040> onyx<00:04:09.430> big<00:04:09.610> dick<00:04:12.690> yes<00:04:13.690> I've<00:04:13.870> run
