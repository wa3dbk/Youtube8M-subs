flash<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:04.489> volume<00:01:05.489> up<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.030> uh

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
flash if you have the volume up and uh

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.719 
flash if you have the volume up and uh
the<00:01:07.110> EMF<00:01:07.560> readings<00:01:08.070> come<00:01:08.280> from<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.580> little

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the EMF readings come from this little

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.320 
the EMF readings come from this little
probe<00:01:09.090> right<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:10.490> it<00:01:11.490> won't<00:01:11.610> work<00:01:12.150> without

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
probe right here it won't work without

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.499 
probe right here it won't work without
the<00:01:12.600> probe<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.049> don't<00:01:13.290> think<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.299> turn<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.390> on

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the probe I don't think so turn it on

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.380 
the probe I don't think so turn it on
and<00:01:16.939> there<00:01:17.939> want<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:19.100> lights<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
and there want the lights and the the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.590 
and there want the lights and the the
beep<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.049> test<00:01:22.830> us<00:01:22.979> out<00:01:23.159> we've<00:01:23.310> got<00:01:23.340> an<00:01:23.700> e/m

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
beep so test us out we've got an e/m

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.130 
beep so test us out we've got an e/m
pump<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.580> which<00:01:26.580> will<00:01:26.880> I'll<00:01:27.840> pick<00:01:28.020> up

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
pump right here which will I'll pick up

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.200 
pump right here which will I'll pick up
the<00:01:28.290> probe<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.360> flip<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:31.820> at<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> probe

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the probe and flip it on at the probe

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.020 
the probe and flip it on at the probe
over<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.659> e/m<00:01:34.200> pump<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.890> watch<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
over the e/m pump and you can watch the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:50.740 
over the e/m pump and you can watch the
needle<00:01:36.329> go<00:01:36.450> up

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.510 

so<00:01:51.750> now<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.560> e/m<00:01:52.799> pumps<00:01:53.100> gone<00:01:53.280> through

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
so now the the e/m pumps gone through

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.420 
so now the the e/m pumps gone through
would<00:01:53.670> say<00:01:53.880> yeah<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.990> full<00:01:55.970> sweep<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:59.100> as<00:01:59.280> you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
would say yeah it's full sweep so as you

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.810 
would say yeah it's full sweep so as you
can<00:01:59.580> see<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:02.360> cell<00:02:03.360> sensor<00:02:04.189> beeped<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.549> lit

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
can see the cell sensor beeped and lit

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.100 
can see the cell sensor beeped and lit
up<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:09.619> increasing<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.950> an<00:02:11.280> increasing<00:02:11.760> rate

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
up in a increasing in an increasing rate

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.970 
up in a increasing in an increasing rate
depending<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:15.450> height<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.080> Milly

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
depending on the the height of the Milly

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.150 
depending on the the height of the Milly
gas<00:02:17.160> levels<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.380> if<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.709> want<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.280> set<00:02:21.090> up<00:02:21.120> an

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
gas levels so if you want to set up an

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.750 
gas levels so if you want to set up an
EMF<00:02:23.160> test<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.870> from<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.950> distance<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.580> will

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
EMF test and from a distance this will

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.430 
EMF test and from a distance this will
be<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.880> good<00:02:27.060> device<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.540> use<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:28.019> be<00:02:28.200> able<00:02:28.290> to
