00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
favourites but even if Ronaldo recovers

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.640 
favourites but even if Ronaldo recovers
from<00:03:23.459> his<00:03:23.640> injury<00:03:24.000> then<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:24.480> think<00:03:24.780> real<00:03:25.230> madrid

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
from his injury then I think real madrid

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.160 
from his injury then I think real madrid
can<00:03:26.400> go<00:03:26.670> through<00:03:27.000> because<00:03:27.540> they<00:03:27.930> have<00:03:28.140> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
can go through because they have the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.740 
can go through because they have the
firepower<00:03:28.620> up<00:03:29.280> front<00:03:29.760> they<00:03:29.940> have<00:03:30.120> Ronaldo

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
firepower up front they have Ronaldo

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.850 
firepower up front they have Ronaldo

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
bail is called benzema de Maria they

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.920 
bail is called benzema de Maria they
have<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> host<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.880> attacking<00:03:36.180> players<00:03:36.630> but<00:03:36.810> the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
have a host of attacking players but the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.440 
have a host of attacking players but the
day<00:03:37.320> was<00:03:37.620> pretty<00:03:37.980> better<00:03:38.250> if<00:03:38.549> away<00:03:38.970> from<00:03:39.269> home

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
day was pretty better if away from home

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.720 
day was pretty better if away from home
because<00:03:40.170> at<00:03:40.350> Dortmund<00:03:40.950> they<00:03:41.070> were<00:03:41.130> very<00:03:41.459> very

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
because at Dortmund they were very very

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.240 
because at Dortmund they were very very
lucky<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.780> only<00:03:42.989> lose<00:03:43.290> tune<00:03:43.590> in<00:03:43.769> because<00:03:43.920> Mick

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
lucky to only lose tune in because Mick

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.470 
lucky to only lose tune in because Mick
atariya<00:03:44.730> missed<00:03:45.090> an<00:03:45.420> open<00:03:45.750> goal<00:03:46.080> mr.<00:03:47.480> another

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
atariya missed an open goal mr. another

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.259 
atariya missed an open goal mr. another
great<00:03:48.840> chance<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.940> Dortmund<00:03:50.940> could<00:03:51.120> have

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
great chance and Dortmund could have

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.670 
great chance and Dortmund could have
easily<00:03:51.420> won<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:51.989> game<00:03:52.170> free<00:03:52.530> near<00:03:52.769> for<00:03:53.100> Nia

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
easily won that game free near for Nia

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.030 
easily won that game free near for Nia
so<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.760> think<00:03:56.409> whoever<00:03:57.409> has<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:57.890> better

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
so I think whoever has the better

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.309 
so I think whoever has the better
defense<00:03:58.670> out<00:03:58.969> of<00:03:59.209> two<00:03:59.510> games<00:03:59.750> round<00:04:00.109> mother

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
defense out of two games round mother

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.709 
defense out of two games round mother
there<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:01.370> brown<00:04:01.579> mud<00:04:01.790> buying<00:04:02.180> milk<00:04:02.420> dine

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:02.719 
there in the brown mud buying milk dine

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.170 
there in the brown mud buying milk dine
will<00:04:03.170> go<00:04:03.379> through<00:04:03.680> because<00:04:03.890> both<00:04:04.489> teams<00:04:04.519> have

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
will go through because both teams have

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.899 
will go through because both teams have
a<00:04:05.359> mean<00:04:05.719> man<00:04:05.959> attacking<00:04:06.469> firepower<00:04:07.159> so<00:04:07.879> I

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
a mean man attacking firepower so I

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.270 
a mean man attacking firepower so I
think<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.299> will<00:04:08.420> come<00:04:09.019> down<00:04:09.079> to<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.620> defence's

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
think it will come down to the defence's

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.399 
think it will come down to the defence's
the<00:04:10.819> chassis<00:04:11.090> athletico<00:04:11.659> madrid<00:04:11.959> tie<00:04:12.349> is

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
the chassis athletico madrid tie is

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.709 
the chassis athletico madrid tie is
another<00:04:12.950> time<00:04:13.280> which<00:04:13.579> is<00:04:13.760> very<00:04:14.030> very<00:04:14.120> hard<00:04:14.569> to

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:14.719 
another time which is very very hard to

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.710 
another time which is very very hard to
go<00:04:14.920> Atletico<00:04:15.920> Madrid<00:04:16.310> has<00:04:16.340> been<00:04:16.850> really

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
go Atletico Madrid has been really

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.390 
go Atletico Madrid has been really
