00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
at the bottom pipe a blob of each color

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.109 
at the bottom pipe a blob of each color
repeating<00:01:38.070> them<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> top

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
repeating them when you get to the top

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.289 
repeating them when you get to the top
just<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.990> through<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.380> pattern<00:01:40.970> then<00:01:41.970> take<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
just going through a pattern then take a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.030 
just going through a pattern then take a
spoon<00:01:42.570> that's<00:01:42.990> been<00:01:43.170> dipped<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.619> hot<00:01:43.799> water

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
spoon that's been dipped in hot water

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.149 
spoon that's been dipped in hot water
and<00:01:44.369> push<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.210> sort<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.630> half<00:01:45.840> way<00:01:45.869> along<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and push it sort of half way along the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.429 
and push it sort of half way along the
blob<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.640> then<00:01:47.700> drag<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.299> across<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.780> cake<00:01:48.990> so

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
blob and then drag it across the cake so

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.469 
blob and then drag it across the cake so
just<00:01:49.649> push<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.250> drag<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.909> across<00:01:51.000> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
just push it in and drag it across and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.440 
just push it in and drag it across and
keep<00:01:51.780> doing<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.079> all<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.439> way<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.130> cake

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
keep doing that all the way up the cake

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.420 
keep doing that all the way up the cake
then<00:01:54.450> for<00:01:54.720> your<00:01:54.840> next<00:01:55.049> row<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.380> blobs<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.250> need

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
then for your next row of blobs you need

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.030 
then for your next row of blobs you need
to<00:01:56.549> pipe<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.090> color<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.500> above

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
to pipe the color that was just above

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.039
