of these get your heads over here and

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.000 
of these get your heads over here and
when<00:00:38.450> I<00:00:38.480> do<00:00:38.600> I<00:00:38.629> just<00:00:38.989> ride<00:00:39.170> I'm<00:00:39.440> close<00:00:39.770> to<00:00:39.800> it

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
when I do I just ride I'm close to it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.190 
when I do I just ride I'm close to it
and<00:00:40.100> then<00:00:40.220> I<00:00:40.340> throw<00:00:40.610> it<00:00:40.760> on<00:00:41.090> top<00:00:41.120> let's<00:00:41.960> see<00:00:42.110> how

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
and then I throw it on top let's see how

00:00:42.200 --> 00:01:42.970 
and then I throw it on top let's see how
it<00:00:42.350> goes<00:01:08.770> all<00:01:09.770> right

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.750 

you

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.460 

that<00:01:50.760> was<00:01:50.940> my<00:01:51.090> very<00:01:51.270> own<00:01:51.510> revenue<00:01:51.810> problem<00:01:52.290> I

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that was my very own revenue problem I

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.470 
that was my very own revenue problem I
still<00:01:52.680> struggle<00:01:53.160> riding<00:01:53.730> with<00:01:53.880> one<00:01:53.910> hand<00:01:54.300> when

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
still struggle riding with one hand when

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.640 
still struggle riding with one hand when
I<00:01:54.510> concentrate<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.080> rest

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
I concentrate on the rest

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.730 
I concentrate on the rest
but<00:01:55.830> I<00:01:55.860> guess<00:01:56.040> practice<00:01:57.470> don't<00:01:58.470> have<00:01:58.560> another

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
but I guess practice don't have another

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.360 
but I guess practice don't have another
girl<00:01:59.270> so<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> bit<00:02:00.540> others<00:02:00.750> lack<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.260> little<00:02:02.160> bit

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
girl so the bit others lack a little bit

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.800 
girl so the bit others lack a little bit
of<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.490> loop<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.150> is<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.330> easier<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.690> to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
of the loop this is the easier it is to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.720 
of the loop this is the easier it is to
catch<00:02:04.050> something<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.620> that's<00:02:04.740> pretty<00:02:05.430> simple

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
catch something so that's pretty simple

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.080 
catch something so that's pretty simple
a<00:02:05.790> compared<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.390> no<00:02:06.630> using<00:02:07.620> it<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.830> that

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
a compared to no using it like that

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.530 
a compared to no using it like that
which<00:02:09.090> makes<00:02:09.360> sense<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:09.899> think<00:02:09.930> about<00:02:10.260> it

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
which makes sense you think about it

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.150 
which makes sense you think about it
already<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.840> what<00:02:12.960> you<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.650> do<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.040> can

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
already so what you can do is you can

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160 
already so what you can do is you can
just<00:02:14.220> put<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.610> punch<00:02:14.970> there<00:02:15.270> are<00:02:15.660> things<00:02:15.900> all

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
just put a punch there are things all

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.500 
just put a punch there are things all
over<00:02:16.410> your<00:02:16.560> arena<00:02:16.970> or<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.180> have<00:02:18.330> somebody

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
over your arena or you can have somebody

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.850 
over your arena or you can have somebody
running<00:02:18.840> around<00:02:18.930> with<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> broom<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.680> try

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
running around with a broom that you try

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.620 
running around with a broom that you try
to<00:02:19.890> catch<00:02:20.220> if<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.000> had<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.270> mate<00:02:21.420> here<00:02:21.600> I

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
to catch if I had to mate here I

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.300 
to catch if I had to mate here I
probably<00:02:21.990> could<00:02:22.470> show<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.650> today<00:02:22.920> but<00:02:23.130> I'm

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
probably could show you today but I'm

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.410 
probably could show you today but I'm
unfortunately<00:02:23.880> I'm<00:02:23.940> here<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.150> my<00:02:24.240> own

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
unfortunately I'm here on my own

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.040 
unfortunately I'm here on my own
except<00:02:24.780> for<00:02:24.900> cameraman<00:02:25.820> um<00:02:26.850> already<00:02:27.720> let's

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
except for cameraman um already let's

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.750 

so<00:02:47.140> playing<00:02:47.350> around<00:02:47.650> with<00:02:47.860> less<00:02:48.100> oh<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.520> mean

so playing around with less oh I mean

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.740 
so playing around with less oh I mean

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
obviously another parental roll bar for

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.120 
obviously another parental roll bar for
the<00:02:52.750> next<00:02:52.900> elevator<00:02:53.200> just<00:02:53.530> try<00:02:53.770> to<00:02:53.830> learn<00:02:54.010> that

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
the next elevator just try to learn that

myself

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
myself

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.210 
myself
but<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.210> think<00:02:55.480> it's<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.630> good<00:02:55.750> exercise<00:02:55.960> to<00:02:56.220> get

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
but I think it's a good exercise to get

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.650 
but I think it's a good exercise to get
a<00:02:57.280> bit<00:02:57.460> more<00:02:57.580> confident<00:02:58.030> confident<00:02:58.420> with<00:02:58.570> you

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
a bit more confident confident with you

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.300 
a bit more confident confident with you
battle<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.170> also<00:02:59.320> no<00:02:59.680> two<00:02:59.740> right<00:03:00.010> here<00:03:00.130> are

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
battle that also no two right here are

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.730 
battle that also no two right here are
single<00:03:00.640> handles<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.450> for<00:03:02.200> your<00:03:02.320> horse<00:03:02.500> to

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
single handles and for your horse to

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.320 
single handles and for your horse to
just<00:03:02.920> concentrate<00:03:03.430> on<00:03:03.460> something<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.060> then

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
just concentrate on something and then

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.960

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
him so I think it's just in general like

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.630 
him so I think it's just in general like
good<00:03:11.560> thing<00:03:11.770> is<00:03:11.980> can<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.250> choose<00:03:12.490> you<00:03:12.610> should
