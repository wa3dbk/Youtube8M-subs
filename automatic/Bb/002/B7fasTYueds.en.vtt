00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.590
 it is really a lot of searching but good 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.000
 I 'm going to be the first to see this 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.469

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.239

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.020
 hoped that would take you away I knew 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.450

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.189

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.070
 I think this set is my favorite 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.640
 just because the fly boys get up and on 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.820
 then I also have this with parentheses 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.090
 these are short socks 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.710
 but yes that is also handy 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:17.180

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:29.030
 with funnels on it super fun and then this 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.120
 set with animal prints on it 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.650
 on the card what they look like 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.720

 a nice bottom this is the bottom 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:56.390

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.700
 tim uprights believe that ripples up 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.620
 of being broken and so have to leave 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.959

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.620

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:22.340
 new well that could directly but 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.329
 exaggeratedly much of course but this is good 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.269

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:33.500

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.250
