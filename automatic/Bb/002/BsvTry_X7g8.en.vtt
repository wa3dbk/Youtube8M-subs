00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.580
 duel for teams mother of mine I love 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.350
 this locution of modern warfare2 for 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.730
 me the best the best in history the 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.950
 improvement of all the colors of that duel 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.380
 by teams I love I love how 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.759
 says it and you can not start a better 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.380
 heading that listening to that and the truth 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.820
 is that today's game is very very 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.630
 good but good let's leave the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.800
 bottom line although you can see that 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.470
 especially when I get out of the streak 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.300
 of the end and I can when to start with the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.820
 of 130 and all that you see that I make a 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.070
 really decent and pretty good streak 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.970
 so much with the m16 that is what we're going 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.040
 to talk today 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.379
 today both with the dual mother rap 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.000
 mine inside the cave that I did not know that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.920
 I take him out to take me both 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.199
 replica like the 10,000 like the m16 do 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.330
 the horror took me out then the c-130 and the ac 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.830
 130 it also makes the horror and 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.720
 true that the game came out very very 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.460
 well and quite quickly the truth is that 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.920
 on my part and on the part of another of the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.119
 another one of my team sorry to be taken out 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.559
 also an air support I take out the 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:04.440
 oil then try at the end in four 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.270
 minutes we make 10 against 100,000 points 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.920
 and 10,000 points because we are in charge 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.900
 terrestrial and the truth is that the departure 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.040
 Well, it comes out and it's pretty good but it's not 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.380
 we will not talk about the game if not 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.960
 let's talk about the weapon I 'm using 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.369
 the dual graph is that I do not think that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.369
 There is almost nothing to say 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.100
 the annual chart obviating obviously 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.780
 what is the spice 12 for me is the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.000
 best secondary of the game as I say 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.280
 ignoring the blades the blades 12 because 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.500
 is that peace other than that it is a weapon 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.360
 that has a lot of class that I love and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.460
 which is quite strong as I say 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.280
 it's a good weapon if you like a lot 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.950
 people is not so easy to use 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.810
 it's a difficult weapon but it's a weapon that 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.149
 I really like the graphic instead 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.770
 yes they are always easy to use 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.780
 but but they are also very good to me 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.060
 radicals I love to take a 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.130
 lot of nuclear but a lot of 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.330
 nuclear exo breton play 3 that by 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.400
 I no longer have the game the interest 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.680
 of modern warfare 2 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.240
 but but let's take a lot of 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.270
 nuclear with the radicals because it's a 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.500
 weapon but but we go plan beast in plan 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.380
 of this replicators with aim 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.759
 stable that's a supernatural thing and 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.270
 good by the way you hear me something 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.210
 weird because a teenage Friday in 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.950
 one for local military is the least of it 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.100
 can do the truth I have put a little 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.810
 aphonic and it's what happens but good as 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.280
 truthful the flow is an outrage but 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.340
 good new to know of sinners if not 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.750
 let's talk about the m16 what do you think 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.640
 is in my 16 there are many people who are 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.080
 in which he says that the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.630
 truth is yes for me at least 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.850
 is undervalued but well I think 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.580
 that has been totally eclipsed by the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.860
 Famas and well, not for that reason 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.959
 to say that the weapon is bad no no no no 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.600
 I do not actually want to make a video 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.950
 I also have a couple of videos that 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.660
 I need you asking me but a 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.490
 bunch of I'm watching it from the acr of 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.200
 modern warfare 2 against modern cr 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.140
 warfare 3 a lot of people all the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.150
 videos and now I also want to make a 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.120
 comparison of modern fames 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.370
 warfare 2 with the modern warfare m16 2 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.720
 and to see which one is better 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.159
 and the truth is that the thing is even 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.180
 is equal because this weapon is not 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.360
 it's turkey moo 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.159
 although the fames have better is more 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.049
 famous so to speak because both the 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.230
 you use in birra bach uses a lot of 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.060
 people but this weapon is undervalued 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.730
 for me at least it is undervalued 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.019
 because it's a very, very, very good weapon and 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.720
 Well, my mother, how am I, please? 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.849
 I'm fatal with the allergy and everything and 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.799
 Well, you see that I have already taken the 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.299
 harrier I take out the graph that looks is 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.890
 that is a lot 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.079
 Unbelievable bakeries but earn in return 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.450
 and admitting it is by far kills three 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.160
 bullets just like famas like I say or 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.870
 this weapon is inflamed I think so 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.019
 because a lot of people do not like that 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.750
 he uses it very little and that for me it is a 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.489
 weapon that has nothing to envy to the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.019
 fame of modern warfare 2 but good is 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.940
 You see what there already is with me 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.420
 c 130 I could have done the horror 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.950
 but the game is over, no, what a shame 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.810
 well I hope you liked this 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.640
 video to give like favorites and everything 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.920
 others is a 30 and 24 that is not bad 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.690
 in four minutes so it's a bit a 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.370
 little in plan beast but you can not leave 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.930
 here below the comments that you think 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.340
 the m16 if you like it or do not like it 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.689
 let's go nothing else on my part I hope that 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.909
 you liked this video to like 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.019
 favorites and everything else as I tell you and 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.620
 nothing a greeting and until the next 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.620
 goodbye
