a 75 and the a 85 chipset as you go up
in<00:00:53.760> chipsets<00:00:54.329> from<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> 55<00:00:56.300> you<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> few

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
in chipsets from the a 55 you get a few

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.290 
in chipsets from the a 55 you get a few
more<00:00:57.899> features<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.160> has<00:00:59.460> enough

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
more features but this one has enough

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.349 
more features but this one has enough
features<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.960> complement<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:02.190> low<00:01:02.760> budget

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
features to complement my low budget

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.469 
features to complement my low budget
bill<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.400> let's<00:01:05.400> go<00:01:05.580> over<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> few<00:01:06.000> these

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
bill here and let's go over a few these

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.700 
bill here and let's go over a few these
features<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:08.540> okay<00:01:09.540> first<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.680> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
features here okay first up this is a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.929 
features here okay first up this is a
military<00:01:11.340> class<00:01:12.090> mainboard<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.939> my

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
military class mainboard and my

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.670 
military class mainboard and my
understanding<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.080> supposed<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> be

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
understanding is it's supposed to be

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.980 
understanding is it's supposed to be
made<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> little<00:01:17.820> bit<00:01:17.909> better<00:01:18.090> components

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
made of a little bit better components

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.560 
made of a little bit better components
than<00:01:19.170> standard<00:01:19.880> supposed<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> little

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
than standard supposed to be a little

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.210 
than standard supposed to be a little
bit<00:01:21.720> more<00:01:21.900> efficient<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> longer

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
bit more efficient and have a longer

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.820 
bit more efficient and have a longer
lifespan<00:01:23.750> okay<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:24.990> that's<00:01:25.229> cool<00:01:25.560> if

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
lifespan okay I think that's cool if

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.310 
lifespan okay I think that's cool if
that's<00:01:26.040> really<00:01:26.369> true<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.150> we'll<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.600> all

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that's really true but we'll see all

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.319 
that's really true but we'll see all
right<00:01:28.380> also<00:01:28.680> HDMI<00:01:29.189> support<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:30.860> Windows<00:01:31.860> 8

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
right also HDMI support it Windows 8

ahead<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.870> open<00:03:58.080> this<00:03:58.200> up<00:03:58.410> this<00:03:59.190> has<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.459> nice

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
ahead and open this up this has a nice

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.170 
ahead and open this up this has a nice
anti-static<00:04:01.080> bag<00:04:02.070> that<00:04:02.370> which<00:04:02.490> it<00:04:02.670> comes<00:04:02.850> in

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
anti-static bag that which it comes in

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.780 
anti-static bag that which it comes in
keeps<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:03.959> from<00:04:04.110> getting<00:04:04.290> shocked<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:05.130> that

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
keeps it from getting shocked and that

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.000 
keeps it from getting shocked and that
way<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.150> doesn't<00:04:06.360> end<00:04:06.660> up<00:04:06.780> being<00:04:06.840> DOA<00:04:07.440> when<00:04:07.890> you

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
way it doesn't end up being DOA when you

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.190 
way it doesn't end up being DOA when you
get<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:09.410> now<00:04:10.410> this<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.740> a<00:04:10.920> micro<00:04:11.760> ATX
