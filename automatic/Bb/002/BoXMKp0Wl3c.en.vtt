 and 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.769
 hello today in hotline video with 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.840
 You Yuri Sidorenko 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.850
 and mirrorless camera with interchangeable 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.519
 fujifilm x optics 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.720
 e2 what has changed compared to 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.000
 previous model 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.580
 if the characteristics of the watch table 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.760
 not much but in practice improvement 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.240
 substantial and almost all invisible with 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.640
 At first glance, the external differences are not so 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.300
 many letter in title before change 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.079
 assignment of some buttons quality 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.050
 manufacturing 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.359
 above all praise xi2 produces 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.600
 impressions are much more expensive 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.609
 things to choose an available version 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.100
 silver top and bottom or fully 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.780
 black version 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.639
 the device is convenient to photograph under 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.620
 the fingers of the right palm are small 

00:00:54.639 --> 00:01:00.370
 pad and thumb rests 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.780
 ledge on the rear panel on the top 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.570
 panels are located on the lever 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.210
 food in the center of which is located 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.150
 button descent with a socket for mechanical 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.580
 wire rope ring assignment shutter speed and 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.300
 xp corrections versus two 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.120
 by steps 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.570
 exe one now three steps in plus and 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.080
 minus 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.130
 and a button with assignable via menu 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.890
 hot shoe functionality 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.350
 adjacent to the built-in flash and and 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.360
 the lamp can be manually rejected for 90 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.210
 degrees up with respect to optical 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.670
 lens axis a pair of microphones 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.980
 located next to the hot shoe they 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.170
 not spaced apart so for 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.510
 get a wide stereo base 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.270
 better to use an external microphone 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.190
 on the front panel button button accordion

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.010
 inches and almost half 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.090
 elements of the image are traditionally many 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.550
 hardware buttons 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.159

 proximity sensor battery and card 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.030
 memory located in the common compartment on 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.540
 the bottom panel is near the tripod 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.819
 nest 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.640
 it is offset relative to the optical axis

 camera connection to computer 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.420
 are in the compartment under the cover on the left 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.310
 panels 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.560
 there are 2 and a half

 millimeter socket for external 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.190
 microphone main innovation hidden 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.290
 inside 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.019
 first of all it is the second versions 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.680
 data processor and xr and 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.750
 x-trans matrix simus format hey pi es 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.209
 si with a specific location 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.459
 light filters and without smoothing 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.239
 her filter has integrated sensors 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.120
 for work 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.159
 phase autofocus this is essential 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.159
 increased the speed and accuracy of targeting 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.590
 sharpness putting the ears of the film and all 2 in 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:14.260
 one row with mirrorless market leaders 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.900
 devices by the way and focusing in 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.780
 x 2 there are 3 modes simplifying manual 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.200
 focus simple zoom backlight 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.669
 contrast edges and digital wedges for 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.510
 digital wedge display 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.079
 used information from the left and right 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.629
 phase sensors 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.680
 with high-aperture lenses fujinon and 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:37.930
 manual optics 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.699
 it's even more convenient to work with fujifilm x and 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.280
 2 this is primarily a camera 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.980
 of course he can record video but how 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.480
 serious videographer tool 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.579
 consider it is not worth it not in 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.470
 no hardware buttons the camera does not 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.810
 allows you to change the aperture during 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.629
 filming nullifying all virtues 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.060
 line of aperture optics size 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.220
 images remained the same 16 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.260
 megapixel detailing at height 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.609
 lack of smoothing effect 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.859
 filter 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:10.379
 the difference between a iso 3200 and 6400 is small 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.910
 with standard settings 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.730
 noise reduction is excellent 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.950
 pictures except that in the shadows grow noise and to 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.570
 Unfortunately, extreme values ​​iso 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.840
 12,800 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.690
 and 25600 only available 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.050
 for jpeg files if you process raw 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.120
 made with iso 6400 then the result 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.130
 will be quite competitive by 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.169
 Compared even with full staffing 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.960
 cameras do their bit 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:41.110
 and 14 bit write raw 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.650
 data, the whole update turned out 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.020
 rather evolutionary change x1 to xc2 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.479
 I will become only big enthusiasts of the company 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.669
 fujifilm still have something to improve 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.620
 in the next version I would like to get 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.620
 swivel screen and full 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.910
 control via wifi and yet xc2 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.160
 wonderful machine 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.870
 especially considering the awesome rulers 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.970
 lens fujinon 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.530
 with you in hotline video were yuri 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.460
 Sidorenko and mirrorless camera 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.940
 premium fujifilm x e2 wish 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.940
 creative success
