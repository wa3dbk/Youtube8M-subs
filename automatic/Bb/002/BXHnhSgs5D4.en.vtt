the K on the other leg we do have a lot
of<00:01:54.710> articulation<00:01:55.700> on<00:01:55.939> these<00:01:56.270> legs<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:57.200> can

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
of articulation on these legs you can

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.590 
of articulation on these legs you can
move<00:01:57.619> this<00:01:57.830> section<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.580> you<00:01:59.060> can<00:01:59.270> move<00:01:59.390> that

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
move this section and you can move that

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.990 
move this section and you can move that
section<00:02:00.020> as<00:02:00.259> well<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.799> do<00:02:00.950> get<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:01.369> lot<00:02:01.790> of

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
section as well so you do get a lot of

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.539 
section as well so you do get a lot of
freedom<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.780> can<00:02:02.810> twist<00:02:03.290> these<00:02:04.009> lower

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
freedom and you can twist these lower

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.160 
freedom and you can twist these lower
sections<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:05.299> you<00:02:05.360> can<00:02:05.509> pull<00:02:05.720> these<00:02:05.900> legs

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
sections so you can pull these legs

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.440 
sections so you can pull these legs
right<00:02:06.439> out<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:07.009> then<00:02:07.490> twist<00:02:07.820> them<00:02:08.030> around<00:02:08.239> and

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
right out and then twist them around and

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.080 
right out and then twist them around and
put<00:02:08.509> them<00:02:08.750> in<00:02:08.869> all<00:02:09.349> kinds<00:02:09.679> of<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.579> different

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
put them in all kinds of a different

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.449 
put them in all kinds of a different
positions<00:02:11.810> let's<00:02:12.079> take<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.500> spin<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.400> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
whereas they are supposed to be but

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.740 
whereas they are supposed to be but
