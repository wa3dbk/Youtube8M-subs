00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:11.100
 Yes, this video is the Hello bean paste bread It Is 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.090
 Would like to introduce with the way is it words of Yu-Gi-Oh of fruit juice soup of multiple sleeve 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.100
 I'm sorry 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.490
 I just started Yu-Gi-Oh and I still don't know how to use that sleeve or multiple sleeves 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.850
 It is the person I mean look at this video 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.869
 I think that it should be understood how much of the multiple sleeve method 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:31.800
 Er to introduce this time is going I always 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:36.840
 It is the way to do of 40 sleeve will continue to introduce the 40 slim of way 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.280
 That's right I 'm going to explain the way of 40 sleeves right now 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.140
 First of all, it's three copies that I will go directly to the card, but in this video 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.810
 I 'm chiller , yes 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.960
 This is the research budget 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:56.600
 I think that I want to use the say the new sleeve s size 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:00.530
 Nde is 3 parts of this size there is the Tteyuu s's of the sleeve snack to other that 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.340
 There is no problem if you use this 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.970
 I will use this in this video 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:10.720
 Well, I can draw right away, but the interesting part of these three parts is 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.130
 And Tsu ordinary sleeve 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.870
 It's going to go like this from the top of the outside 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.900
 Already 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.280
 If preferential Institute san for this was pure water 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.460
 From the side 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.900
 The card 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.900
 I'm finally getting in from you 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.170
 In this way when you post multiple sleeve Therefore, in doing so 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.170
 When you use it 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.159
 If it is a guy, this kind of cart processing gradually 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.670
 It's little by little but it's out 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:50.390
 It is this that it is not it 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:54.110
 I think this is a good place for this team of research institute 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.470
 Ten people of yes were taken 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.280
 so 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.390
 The 20th is that 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.890
 Of ordinary dairy industry 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.480
 I will use the character sleeve 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:12.930
 Even if it is not water from the line 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:13.840
 The shield should stand 99 mm 10 mm and the side 63 mm. 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.020
 Hmm 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.150
 The child who was at home 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.480
 I will use the next 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.480
 In Well this is probably will continue to put in from the top Yes it is from the top 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.400
 It had entered 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.720
 Mr. wants to be here for 30 years 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.240
 This also uses the m size of the multiple excess seconds of the trading card researcher 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.410
 It is written by Te tea th 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.410
 I will use this at 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:50.200
 It is about from the top usually even if this is different from a little while ago of s Well 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:51.350
 Fill in if there is that I would like to do if there is a thing that I would like you to note here 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.620
 card 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:00.040
 Because I am a little narrow at the time of Kitty , I think that I will enter other powers 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.750
 If you enter from h 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.280
 There is a failure example of 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.110
 This tell you You know Canaan 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.290
 This is in the loading platform 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.100
 Is not it has entered kana parting was of the wound that contains scratches 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.290
 This is that 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:22.130
 By surely you there are times when a card is say that would break base when it has gone Guigui force 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.819
 Please be careful about that force by all means Yes 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.240
 I will put in a stamp 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.069
 Be careful 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.180
 Please come out and leave 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.370
 It came to an end in place in Yes 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.520
 It is three copies to use for 40 women 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.270
 Here 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.190
 We say with a clear pocket bought by Daiso of the world 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.970
 Yes 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:49.950
 Very perfect state of It is a sleeve Ettoko 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:53.610
 Yes there is a mere Mao Daiso's why 1 million yen a 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.430
 105 yen amazing cost performance 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.670
 Let's put this in 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.000
 This is not 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.600
 Hey from behind 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.810
 When I go out 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.120
 Hmm 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:13.440
 So now I have completed 40 sleeps I'm always doing 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.180
 In when you've pledged that in this 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.590
 I'll get out of it while using it 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.590
 Do you think this is because the air is entering here 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.570
 Hold back 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.010
 please look 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.000
 Yes I was impressed with this 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.000
 After this 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:38.270
 Main deck for 40 thousand extra decks for 15 side decks for 15 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.270
 Do the same for this 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.280
 Yes Really finished 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:53.330
 This time a little 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.169
 I only made a minute, but the main deck is about this thick 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.930
 Such feeling is not- 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.930
 It is not difficult to see the card text, even when you have a card 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.930
 Hmm 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:11.170
 I think that it will protect the card that I think that there is a one- click sound 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.110
 Yes I do a little more about this 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.630
 There is a slight drawback 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.640
 Finger major bank 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.640
 Is n't it a hand genre effect value ? 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.390
 That's that at the time of the crackling people 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.710
 When would doing this way that either the 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.160
 I've been rough 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.950
 It is rough 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.360
 I don't slip too much 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:39.689
 Now when hand cutting 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.880
 Speaking of one defect there is a defect 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:45.120
 So much 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:51.540
 Well you this way recommend you were a person I do not 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:53.610
 But those who say that it 's good to slip is also another example of this 40 woman 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:59.969
 It does not matter at all if give me 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:03.520
 If you also able to contribute even a little to the ways of travel of the 40 sleeve of it this video is everyone 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:04.990
 I think this video was also helpful a little 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.680
 Well then 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:13.560
 How about everyone trying this method 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.560
