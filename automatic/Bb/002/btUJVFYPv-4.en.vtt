it<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.920> drive<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.280> somewhere<00:02:14.430> then<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.000> start

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
it to drive you somewhere then you start

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.100 
it to drive you somewhere then you start
shooting<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.560> know<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.920> was<00:02:17.010> annoying

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
shooting and you know that was annoying

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.360 
shooting and you know that was annoying
but<00:02:19.110> now<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.320> can<00:02:19.530> drive<00:02:19.740> yourself<00:02:19.860> as

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
but now you can drive yourself as

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.360 
beautiful oh hopefully he'll wrap up
some<00:02:23.130> kills<00:02:23.370> here<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:25.410> think<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.130> actually<00:02:26.220> a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
some kills here I think it's actually a

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.640 
some kills here I think it's actually a
lot<00:02:26.460> more<00:02:26.520> clearer<00:02:27.060> than<00:02:27.300> more<00:02:27.480> for<00:02:27.750> two<00:02:28.940> as<00:02:29.940> in

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
lot more clearer than more for two as in

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.720 
lot more clearer than more for two as in
you<00:02:31.650> know<00:02:31.770> easy<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.880> see<00:02:33.150> instead<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:34.610> no<00:02:35.610> I'm

cameras over used as well just to say
the<00:03:01.950> orange<00:03:02.280> tiger<00:03:02.780> I've<00:03:03.780> seen<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.200> many

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
the orange tiger I've seen so many

the orange tiger I've seen so many
people<00:03:04.620> with<00:03:04.770> that<00:03:04.920> thing<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.310> think<00:03:05.489> people

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
people with that thing I think people

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.400 
people with that thing I think people
should<00:03:05.820> start<00:03:06.540> experiencing<00:03:07.080> some<00:03:07.260> more

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
should start experiencing some more

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.150 
should start experiencing some more
colors<00:03:07.709> on<00:03:07.800> their<00:03:07.920> guns<00:03:08.810> anyway<00:03:09.860> here's<00:03:10.860> what

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
colors on their guns anyway here's what

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.500 
colors on their guns anyway here's what
I<00:03:11.420> first<00:03:12.420> thought<00:03:12.570> was<00:03:12.810> an<00:03:12.930> ac-130<00:03:13.590> isn't<00:03:14.510> so

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
I first thought was an ac-130 isn't so

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.030 
I first thought was an ac-130 isn't so
he's<00:03:15.630> basically<00:03:15.750> actually<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.350> exact<00:03:16.770> same

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
he's basically actually the exact same

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.780 
he's basically actually the exact same
thing<00:03:17.360> this<00:03:18.360> kill<00:03:19.290> streak<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.770> actually<00:03:19.950> know

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
thing this kill streak I actually know

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
thing this kill streak I actually know
this<00:03:20.970> is<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.180> fact<00:03:23.060> bullet<00:03:24.060> takes<00:03:24.300> one<00:03:24.570> less

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
this is a fact bullet takes one less

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.210 
this is a fact bullet takes one less
kill<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:28.140> know<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.620> have<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.830> fire<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.070> few

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
kill so you know you have to fire a few

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.410 
kill so you know you have to fire a few
more<00:03:29.340> bullets<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.670> kill<00:03:29.700> them<00:03:29.970> unlike<00:03:30.390> the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
more bullets to kill them unlike the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.470 
more bullets to kill them unlike the
gunship<00:03:31.519> but<00:03:32.519> now<00:03:32.670> everyone's<00:03:33.030> worked<00:03:33.239> out

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
gunship but now everyone's worked out

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.630 
gunship but now everyone's worked out
that<00:03:33.630> this<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:34.200> Jesus<00:03:34.620> racking<00:03:35.310> them<00:03:35.400> up<00:03:35.459> with

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
that this the Jesus racking them up with

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.180 
that this the Jesus racking them up with
his<00:03:35.760> chopper<00:03:36.180> chopper<00:03:36.690> ownage<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.440> this<00:03:37.980> side

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
his chopper chopper ownage and this side

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.140 
his chopper chopper ownage and this side
going<00:03:38.400> inside<00:03:39.230> or<00:03:40.519> he<00:03:41.519> doesn't<00:03:41.670> party<00:03:42.030> as<00:03:42.090> a

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
going inside or he doesn't party as a

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.729 
going inside or he doesn't party as a
chopper<00:03:42.390> but<00:03:42.630> i'm<00:03:42.750> sure<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:43.080> can<00:03:43.230> see<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.650> it

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
chopper but i'm sure you can see that it

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.290 
chopper but i'm sure you can see that it
does<00:03:43.920> not<00:03:43.950> use<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.310> chopper<00:03:44.610> their<00:03:45.000> orders

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
does not use a chopper their orders

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.229 
does not use a chopper their orders
running<00:03:45.570> inside<00:03:46.700> but<00:03:47.700> yeah<00:03:47.850> you<00:03:47.910> can<00:03:48.000> clearly

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
running inside but yeah you can clearly

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.820 
running inside but yeah you can clearly
see<00:03:48.330> this<00:03:48.540> weaker<00:03:48.840> than<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.440> chopper

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
see this weaker than that the chopper

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.490 
see this weaker than that the chopper
knots<00:03:50.100> traffic<00:03:50.370> on<00:03:50.430> at<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.640> air<00:03:50.760> gunship<00:03:51.500> so

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
knots traffic on at the air gunship so

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.910 
knots traffic on at the air gunship so
it's<00:03:52.650> harder<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.890> use<00:03:54.320> is<00:03:55.320> pretty<00:03:55.739> much<00:03:55.860> the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
it's harder to use is pretty much the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.770 
it's harder to use is pretty much the
kill<00:03:56.190> feed<00:03:56.430> let's<00:03:56.910> just<00:03:57.090> leave<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.540> there

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
kill feed let's just leave it there

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.600 
kill feed let's just leave it there
