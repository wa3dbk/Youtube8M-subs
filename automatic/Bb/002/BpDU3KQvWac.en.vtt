trying to actually solve the problem or
what<00:00:05.339> are<00:00:05.430> they<00:00:05.520> doing<00:00:05.940> about<00:00:06.839> it

only ones there's you know when you

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.820 
only ones there's you know when you
start<00:00:13.650> looking<00:00:13.769> at<00:00:14.269> the<00:00:15.269> problem<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.139> you

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
start looking at the problem that is you

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.380 
start looking at the problem that is you
know<00:00:16.949> people<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.369> power<00:00:17.609> making<00:00:17.970> decisions

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
know people in power making decisions

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.150 
know people in power making decisions
based<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> wrong<00:00:19.170> things

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
based on the wrong things

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.330 
based on the wrong things
yeah<00:00:20.490> things<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.300> are<00:00:21.390> not<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.689> wrong<00:00:21.900> of

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
yeah things that are not the wrong of

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.200 
yeah things that are not the wrong of
priorities<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.519> are<00:00:23.760> not<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.090> alignment

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
priorities that are not in alignment

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.810 
priorities that are not in alignment
with<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.199> priorities<00:00:25.710> are<00:00:25.740> should<00:00:26.699> be

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
with what the priorities are should be

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.070 
with what the priorities are should be
for<00:00:27.029> what's<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.300> best<00:00:27.539> interest<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
for what's in the best interest of the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.050 
for what's in the best interest of the
planet<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.650> for<00:00:28.800> people<00:00:28.980> that's<00:00:29.640> kind<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
planet and for people that's kind of the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.420 
planet and for people that's kind of the
overarching<00:00:30.510> theme<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.260> film<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.769> general

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
overarching theme of the film in general

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.190 
overarching theme of the film in general
was<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.180> look<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.600> we're<00:00:33.809> at<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.020> place

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
was that look like we're at this place

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.870 
was that look like we're at this place
we<00:00:34.500> all<00:00:34.680> know<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> planet<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.640> balance

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
we all know the planet is out of balance

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.180 
we all know the planet is out of balance
right<00:00:36.239> now<00:00:36.360> we<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:36.930> know<00:00:37.110> our<00:00:37.380> society<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.160> in

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
right now we all know our society is in

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.190 
right now we all know our society is in
a<00:00:38.460> not<00:00:38.969> really<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.450> good<00:00:39.600> position<00:00:39.750> and

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
a not really in a good position and

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.299 
a not really in a good position and
things<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.530> kind<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.739> messed<00:00:40.950> up<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.280> over

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
things are kind of messed up all over

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
things are kind of messed up all over
the<00:00:41.520> place<00:00:41.790> now<00:00:42.540> what<00:00:42.690> do<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:42.989> about<00:00:43.170> it

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the place now what do you do about it

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.600 
the place now what do you do about it
now<00:00:43.410> when<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:43.590> get<00:00:43.739> into<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.010> secrecy<00:00:44.489> around

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
now when we get into the secrecy around

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.110 
now when we get into the secrecy around
these<00:00:45.149> technologies<00:00:46.520> it<00:00:47.520> becomes<00:00:47.910> very

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
these technologies it becomes very

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.299 
these technologies it becomes very
complex<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.710> obvious<00:00:50.160> that

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
complex it's it's it's obvious that

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.189 
complex it's it's it's obvious that
there<00:00:50.430> has<00:00:50.579> been<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.789> cover-up<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.809> obvious

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
there has been a cover-up it's obvious

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.740 
there has been a cover-up it's obvious
there's<00:00:52.530> evidence<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.219> they're<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.149> part

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
there's evidence that they're the part

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.209 
there's evidence that they're the part
of<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> according<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.530> dr.<00:00:55.770> Greer<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> lot

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
of the according to dr. Greer and a lot

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.319 
of the according to dr. Greer and a lot
of<00:00:56.309> these<00:00:56.370> people<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.879> makes<00:00:57.059> logical

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
of these people and it makes logical

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.360 
of these people and it makes logical
sense<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.050> reason<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> UFO<00:00:58.949> thing<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
sense the reason that the UFO thing it

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.369 
sense the reason that the UFO thing it
is<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.090> taboo<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.660> there<00:01:00.750> has<00:01:00.899> been<00:01:00.930> such<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
is so taboo and there has been such a

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.429 
is so taboo and there has been such a
concerted<00:01:02.309> effort<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.760> keep<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.989> know

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
concerted effort to keep it you know

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.590 
concerted effort to keep it you know
under<00:01:04.799> wraps<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.280> because<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> technology

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
under wraps is because of the technology

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.570 
under wraps is because of the technology
that<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.010> extraterrestrials<00:01:08.010> are<00:01:08.159> using<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
that the extraterrestrials are using the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.760 
that the extraterrestrials are using the
have<00:01:08.880> use<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.299> get<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.320> according

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
have use to get here and that according

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
have use to get here and that according
to<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:11.820> whistleblowers<00:01:12.479> we've

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
to you know whistleblowers we've

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.109 
to you know whistleblowers we've
acquired<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.560> technology<00:01:14.189> now<00:01:14.880> when<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
acquired that technology now when you

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.030 
acquired that technology now when you
look<00:01:15.240> at<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.540> from<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.229> know<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.619> homeland

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
look at it from you know a homeland

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.810 
look at it from you know a homeland
security<00:01:17.869> point<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.960> view<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.430> logical

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
security point of view the one logical

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.999 
security point of view the one logical
argument<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.240> makes<00:01:21.390> sense<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:22.350> being

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
argument that makes sense for for being

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.620 
argument that makes sense for for being
careful<00:01:23.430> about<00:01:23.490> these<00:01:23.729> technologies<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.479> when

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
careful about these technologies is when

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.060 
careful about these technologies is when
you<00:01:24.689> talk<00:01:24.840> about<00:01:24.869> harnessing<00:01:25.560> quantum<00:01:25.950> energy

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you talk about harnessing quantum energy

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.740 
you talk about harnessing quantum energy
I<00:01:26.460> mean<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> could<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.630> like

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
I mean you could it's it's like

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.569 
I mean you could it's it's like
imagining<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.380> dirty<00:01:28.619> nuclear<00:01:29.009> bomb<00:01:29.250> on

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
imagining a dirty nuclear bomb on

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.179 
imagining a dirty nuclear bomb on
steroids<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.530> wrong<00:01:31.680> person<00:01:31.890> had

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
steroids like if the wrong person had

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.800
