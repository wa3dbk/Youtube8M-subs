was<00:00:12.000> like<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.330> fourth<00:00:12.780> or<00:00:12.929> fifth<00:00:13.170> episode<00:00:13.469> of

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830

like using the medium to long range

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.120 
like using the medium to long range
weapon<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.119> PP<00:00:27.390> 90<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.470> strategy<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.920> I

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
weapon the PP 90 so the strategy that I

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.950 
weapon the PP 90 so the strategy that I
use<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.670> particular<00:00:29.849> gameplay<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.689> very

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
use in this particular gameplay is very

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.950 
use in this particular gameplay is very
different<00:00:31.560> than<00:00:31.980> my<00:00:32.520> Kimbo<00:00:32.850> fmg9<00:00:33.180> 21<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.780> dome

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
different than my Kimbo fmg9 21 on dome

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.420 
different than my Kimbo fmg9 21 on dome
that<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.170> posted<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> long<00:00:34.710> time<00:00:34.920> ago<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.130> just

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
mentioned and this strategy is very very

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.490 
mentioned and this strategy is very very
aggressive<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.300> getting<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.079> as<00:00:40.260> many

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
aggressive this is getting that as many

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.069 
aggressive this is getting that as many
quills<00:00:40.950> as<00:00:41.190> many<00:00:41.610> kills<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.420> quickly<00:00:42.840> as

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
you really have it's a combination of

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.810 
you really have it's a combination of
staying<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.379> alert<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:49.829> possible<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.730> also

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
getting really really lucky that you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.920 
getting really really lucky that you
don't<00:00:52.559> get<00:00:52.680> spawned<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.360> or<00:00:54.360> randomly

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
don't get spawned on or randomly

throwing after anything like that so as

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.970 
throwing after anything like that so as
far<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> PP<00:00:57.870> 90<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> did<00:00:58.410> mention<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
far as the PP 90 I did mention it's a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.220 
far as the PP 90 I did mention it's a
medium<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.489> long<00:00:59.730> range<00:00:59.760> weapon<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.960> not<00:01:01.109> as

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
medium to long range weapon it's not as

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.680 
medium to long range weapon it's not as
good<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> type<00:01:01.770> 95<00:01:02.039> obviously<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.359> I

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
good as the type 95 obviously it's I

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.270 
good as the type 95 obviously it's I
would<00:01:03.960> say<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> little<00:01:04.500> bit<00:01:04.650> better<00:01:04.799> than<00:01:05.070> using

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
would say a little bit better than using

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.179 
would say a little bit better than using
the<00:01:05.430> akimbo<00:01:05.729> fmg9<00:01:06.530> but<00:01:07.530> definitely<00:01:07.860> not<00:01:07.979> on

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the akimbo fmg9 but definitely not on

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.609 
the akimbo fmg9 but definitely not on
the<00:01:08.220> type<00:01:08.460> 95<00:01:08.760> level<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.390> all<00:01:09.869> your<00:01:10.140> kills<00:01:10.409> I

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the type 95 level so all your kills I

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.140 
the type 95 level so all your kills I
would<00:01:10.770> say<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.400> about<00:01:11.520> that

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
would say are going to be about that

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.080 
would say are going to be about that
close<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:13.350> maybe<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.710> little<00:01:13.950> bit<00:01:14.159> farther<00:01:14.400> long

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
close or maybe a little bit farther long

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.640 
close or maybe a little bit farther long
range<00:01:15.360> not<00:01:15.720> really<00:01:15.990> going<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.140> happen<00:01:16.320> you're

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
range not really going to happen you're

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.899 
range not really going to happen you're
gonna<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.040> stay<00:01:17.250> fairly<00:01:17.610> closely

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
gonna have to stay fairly closely

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.219

those<00:03:27.780> are<00:03:27.959> basically<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.470> only<00:03:28.590> spots<00:03:29.010> that

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
those are basically the only spots that

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.100

they're<00:03:29.280> going<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.459> try<00:03:29.610> really<00:03:29.820> hard<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.989> get

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
they're going to try really hard to get

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.830 
they're going to try really hard to get
after<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.530> at<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.280> think<00:03:33.090> right<00:03:33.450> about

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
after you at so I think right about

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.250 
after you at so I think right about
here's<00:03:34.440> when<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:34.770> start<00:03:35.100> picking<00:03:35.459> things<00:03:35.640> up

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
here's when I start picking things up

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.810 
here's when I start picking things up
this<00:03:37.260> is<00:03:37.380> another<00:03:37.590> good<00:03:37.770> spot<00:03:38.100> right<00:03:38.130> standing

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
this is another good spot right standing

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.210 
this is another good spot right standing
on<00:03:38.940> top<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.390> little<00:03:39.660> slanted<00:03:40.650> concrete

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
on top of the little slanted concrete

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.370 
on top of the little slanted concrete
wall<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:42.060> can<00:03:42.209> get<00:03:42.300> a<00:03:42.330> pretty<00:03:42.600> good<00:03:42.720> angle<00:03:43.260> but

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
wall you can get a pretty good angle but

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.110 
wall you can get a pretty good angle but
you<00:03:43.440> are<00:03:43.650> very<00:03:43.980> susceptible<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.790> throwing

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
you are very susceptible to throwing

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.699 
you are very susceptible to throwing
knives<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:45.810> it's<00:03:45.989> just<00:03:46.140> one<00:03:46.260> thing<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.560> watch

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
knives so it's just one thing to watch

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.320 
knives so it's just one thing to watch
out<00:03:46.890> for<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.370> have<00:03:47.550> to<00:03:47.670> continually

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
out for and you have to continually

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.420 
out for and you have to continually
watch<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:48.989> right<00:03:49.200> side<00:03:49.470> because<00:03:50.160> if<00:03:50.280> there's

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
watch this right side because if there's

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.890 
watch this right side because if there's
only<00:03:50.519> one<00:03:50.850> person<00:03:51.090> down<00:03:51.450> there<00:03:51.630> there's<00:03:51.810> a

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
only one person down there there's a

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.960 
only one person down there there's a
good<00:03:52.170> chance<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:53.280> he's<00:03:53.519> gonna<00:03:53.670> die<00:03:53.940> right

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
good chance that he's gonna die right

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.820 
good chance that he's gonna die right
there<00:03:54.420> I<00:03:54.450> do<00:03:54.600> get<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.959> Moab<00:03:55.260> which<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.530> really
