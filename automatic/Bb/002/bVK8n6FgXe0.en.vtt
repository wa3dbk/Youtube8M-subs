00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.840 
now if you flip it open your case will
probably<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.730> if<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.899> will<00:01:04.850> just

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
probably do that but if you will just

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.490 
probably do that but if you will just
slide<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> down<00:01:06.330> usually<00:01:06.780> slides<00:01:07.170> right<00:01:07.350> back

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
