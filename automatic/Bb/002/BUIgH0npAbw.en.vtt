00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and actually right like that will

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.929 
and actually right like that will
probably<00:01:31.380> work<00:01:31.470> pretty<00:01:31.530> well

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
probably work pretty well

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.249 
probably work pretty well
I've<00:01:32.939> keep<00:01:33.150> an<00:01:33.240> eye<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.840> part<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
I've keep an eye on this part of the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.710 
I've keep an eye on this part of the
hole<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.619> if<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.369> need<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.000> air<00:01:36.180> can't<00:01:36.540> flow

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
hole here if I need the air can't flow

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.179 
hole here if I need the air can't flow
between<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.170> layers<00:01:37.320> there<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.920> does<00:01:38.070> not

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
between the layers there it does not

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.100 
between the layers there it does not
work<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:38.520> well<00:01:38.549> okay<00:01:39.540> my<00:01:39.630> scissors<00:01:39.840> Becca<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
work as well okay my scissors Becca and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.600 
work as well okay my scissors Becca and
I<00:01:40.200> I'm<00:01:40.829> gonna<00:01:40.950> stick<00:01:41.130> ascenders<00:01:41.400> all<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.549> way

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
I I'm gonna stick ascenders all the way

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.700 
I I'm gonna stick ascenders all the way
through<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.720> use<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.200> open<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:43.530> that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
through and use it just open up that

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.469 
through and use it just open up that
area<00:01:43.890> where<00:01:44.159> right<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.790> little<00:01:45.180> bit<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
area where right there a little bit to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.170 
area where right there a little bit to
be<00:01:45.540> sure<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> air<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:45.990> flow<00:01:46.020> through<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:47.180> now

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
be sure the air can flow through it now

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.429 
be sure the air can flow through it now
you<00:01:48.240> may<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.540> experiment<00:01:48.840> some<00:01:49.110> between

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
you may have to experiment some between

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.560 
you may have to experiment some between
these<00:01:49.560> holes<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.009> help<00:01:50.159> push<00:01:51.060> paper<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:51.450> is

these holes and help push paper there is

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.210 
these holes and help push paper there is
between<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.140> layers<00:01:52.380> until<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.159> to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
between the layers until you get it to

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.620 
between the layers until you get it to
work<00:01:53.369> that's<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.820> high-quality<00:01:54.060> paper<00:01:54.420> will

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
work that's it high-quality paper will

work that's it high-quality paper will
work<00:01:54.750> easier<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.380> know<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> can't<00:01:56.399> get<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.549> one

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
work easier I know I can't get this one

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.929 
work easier I know I can't get this one
to<00:01:56.790> work

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
to work

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.800 
to work
I<00:01:59.060> think<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.240> may<00:02:00.329> need<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.540> fiddle<00:02:00.659> around

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810

I think you may need to fiddle around
with<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.320> bit<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.680> get<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.979> work<00:02:02.180> now<00:02:03.180> I'm

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
with it a bit to get it to work now I'm

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.490

careful what you put there I have a try
putting<00:02:28.379> more<00:02:28.469> than<00:02:28.560> one<00:02:28.650> hole<00:02:28.739> yet<00:02:28.890> I've<00:02:29.430> gone

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
putting more than one hole yet I've gone

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.920 
putting more than one hole yet I've gone
ahead<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.819> cut<00:02:30.269> out<00:02:30.389> a<00:02:30.450> second<00:02:30.659> hole<00:02:30.780> there

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
ahead and cut out a second hole there

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.899 
ahead and cut out a second hole there
see<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.709> now<00:02:31.920> two<00:02:31.980> finger<00:02:32.280> holes<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.760> may<00:02:32.849> be

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
see that now two finger holes you may be

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.129 
see that now two finger holes you may be
wondering<00:02:33.180> why<00:02:33.269> I<00:02:33.299> those<00:02:33.750> holes<00:02:33.930> are<00:02:34.019> not

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:34.139 
wondering why I those holes are not

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.780 
wondering why I those holes are not
lined<00:02:34.319> up<00:02:34.409> with<00:02:34.469> a<00:02:34.590> methyl<00:02:34.889> that<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.519> because<00:02:35.730> I

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
lined up with a methyl that is because I

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.429 
lined up with a methyl that is because I
discovered<00:02:35.939> that<00:02:36.239> unlike<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.780> recorder<00:02:37.290> here

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
discovered that unlike a recorder here

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.080 
discovered that unlike a recorder here
where<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.769> air<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.129> either<00:02:38.400> coming<00:02:38.639> up<00:02:38.879> here

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
where the air is either coming up here

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.250 
where the air is either coming up here
or<00:02:39.239> through<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> body<00:02:39.659> of<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.810> instrument<00:02:39.930> on

or through the body of the instrument on
these<00:02:40.620> part<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.189> air<00:02:41.310> column<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.639> actually

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
these part of the air column is actually

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.429 
these part of the air column is actually
running<00:02:42.030> between<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.510> layers<00:02:42.659> you<00:02:43.230> cut<00:02:43.349> off

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
running between the layers you cut off

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.839 
running between the layers you cut off
hole<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.889> that<00:02:43.980> path<00:02:44.219> you<00:02:44.370> may<00:02:44.459> mess<00:02:44.609> up<00:02:44.760> that

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
hole in that path you may mess up that

airflow<00:02:45.090> on<00:02:45.150> your<00:02:45.299> flute<00:02:45.389> oh<00:02:45.450> stop<00:02:45.629> working<00:02:45.870> so

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:46.169 
airflow on your flute oh stop working so

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:47.330 
airflow on your flute oh stop working so
I<00:02:46.200> found<00:02:46.409> it<00:02:46.500> better<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.799> cut<00:02:46.919> the<00:02:46.980> whole<00:02:47.099> stuff

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
I found it better to cut the whole stuff

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:57.309 
I found it better to cut the whole stuff
that<00:02:47.519> pass<00:02:47.669> to<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.849> side<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.180> let's<00:02:48.659> listen

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.539 

that<00:02:58.319> seems<00:02:58.469> to<00:02:58.530> come<00:02:58.650> out<00:02:58.709> pretty<00:02:58.799> well<00:02:58.889> I<00:02:59.069> did

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
that seems to come out pretty well I did

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.009 
that seems to come out pretty well I did
not<00:02:59.669> use<00:02:59.819> any<00:02:59.969> mathematical<00:03:00.659> formula<00:03:00.930> to

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
not use any mathematical formula to

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.300 
not use any mathematical formula to
place<00:03:01.169> the<00:03:01.260> holes<00:03:01.439> which<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:02.040> probably

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
place the holes which one probably

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.349 
place the holes which one probably
should<00:03:02.430> use<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.639> they<00:03:02.700> want<00:03:02.849> actual<00:03:03.090> pitches

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
should use it they want actual pitches

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.789 
should use it they want actual pitches
so<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:03.540> missing<00:03:03.840> report<00:03:04.079> dealt<00:03:04.230> fairly<00:03:04.680> well

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
so it's missing report dealt fairly well

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:05.869 
so it's missing report dealt fairly well
but<00:03:04.889> they<00:03:04.980> were<00:03:05.040> rather<00:03:05.129> arbitrarily<00:03:05.639> named

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
but they were rather arbitrarily named

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.129 
but they were rather arbitrarily named
maybe<00:03:06.030> my<00:03:06.150> experience<00:03:06.239> with<00:03:06.629> woodwinds<00:03:06.900> just

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
maybe my experience with woodwinds just

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.030 
maybe my experience with woodwinds just
gave<00:03:07.379> me<00:03:07.439> a<00:03:07.469> good<00:03:07.560> idea<00:03:07.620> where<00:03:07.829> to<00:03:07.889> put<00:03:07.980> the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
gave me a good idea where to put the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.659 
gave me a good idea where to put the
hole<00:03:08.099> I<00:03:08.189> don't<00:03:08.340> know

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
hole I don't know

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.009 
hole I don't know
anyways<00:03:09.090> let's<00:03:09.299> try<00:03:09.450> another<00:03:09.569> one<00:03:09.689> see<00:03:09.870> if<00:03:09.930> it

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
anyways let's try another one see if it

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.209 
anyways let's try another one see if it
messes<00:03:10.200> up<00:03:10.260> our<00:03:10.349> flute<00:03:10.530> or<00:03:10.650> if<00:03:10.709> it'll<00:03:10.829> work<00:03:10.889> I

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219 
messes up our flute or if it'll work I

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.309 
messes up our flute or if it'll work I
not<00:03:11.549> three<00:03:11.819> holes<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.269> flute<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:13.200> I'm

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
not three holes in the flute and I'm

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.520 
not three holes in the flute and I'm
gonna<00:03:13.469> see<00:03:13.590> if<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.799> works<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.250> what<00:03:14.519> we<00:03:14.609> get

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
gonna see if it works and what we get

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.569 
gonna see if it works and what we get
our<00:03:16.530> pitch<00:03:16.739> there<00:03:16.919> let's<00:03:17.370> see<00:03:17.430> what<00:03:17.549> our

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
our pitch there let's see what our

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:38.750 
our pitch there let's see what our
pitches<00:03:17.849> are<00:03:36.949> that's<00:03:37.949> pretty<00:03:38.159> cool<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.519> is

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
pitches are that's pretty cool is it is

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.640 
pitches are that's pretty cool is it is
really<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.209> just<00:03:39.389> paper<00:03:39.510> what<00:03:40.169> I<00:03:40.379> think

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
really this is just paper what I think

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.899 
really this is just paper what I think
I'm<00:03:40.709> gonna<00:03:40.799> try<00:03:40.979> force<00:03:41.280> all<00:03:41.400> just<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.669> see<00:03:41.790> what

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
I'm gonna try force all just to see what

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.550 
I'm gonna try force all just to see what
happens<00:03:42.180> all<00:03:42.810> right<00:03:42.870> now<00:03:43.680> we<00:03:43.739> have<00:03:44.009> four<00:03:44.189> holes

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
happens all right now we have four holes

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.969 
happens all right now we have four holes
see<00:03:46.560> what<00:03:46.709> happens

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:48.979 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.440 

hey<00:03:49.979> plays

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
hey plays

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
hey plays
[Applause]

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.230 

[Applause]

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.400 

so<00:04:06.240> I<00:04:06.270> just<00:04:06.450> play<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.630> picture<00:04:07.020> total<00:04:07.200> different

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
so I just play a picture total different

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.750 
so I just play a picture total different
here's<00:04:07.620> my<00:04:07.740> my<00:04:07.890> trying<00:04:08.400> different<00:04:08.460> angering

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
here's my my trying different angering

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.460 
here's my my trying different angering
there<00:04:08.970> being<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.180> win-win<00:04:09.510> player<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:09.930> have<00:04:10.350> some

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
there being a win-win player I have some

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.380 
there being a win-win player I have some
ideas<00:04:10.710> on<00:04:10.800> things<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.670> others<00:04:11.910> might<00:04:12.060> not

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
ideas on things that others might not

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.270 
ideas on things that others might not
that<00:04:12.990> is<00:04:13.350> that<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.740> amount<00:04:13.920> piece<00:04:14.100> is<00:04:14.190> now

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
that is that the amount piece is now

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.770 
that is that the amount piece is now
getting<00:04:14.430> too<00:04:14.610> wet<00:04:14.790> as<00:04:15.240> will<00:04:15.390> happen<00:04:15.450> since<00:04:15.690> it

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
getting too wet as will happen since it

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.910 
getting too wet as will happen since it
is<00:04:15.870> paper<00:04:16.080> you<00:04:16.290> can<00:04:16.410> only<00:04:16.500> play<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.680> for<00:04:16.830> so

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
is paper you can only play it for so

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.199 
is paper you can only play it for so
long<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.250> it'll<00:04:17.370> start<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.610> deteriorate<00:04:17.820> so

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
long and it'll start to deteriorate so

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.340 
long and it'll start to deteriorate so
you<00:04:18.299> need<00:04:18.420> to<00:04:18.480> let<00:04:18.540> dry<00:04:18.720> out<00:04:18.900> before<00:04:19.140> you<00:04:19.230> play

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
you need to let dry out before you play

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.660 
you need to let dry out before you play
together<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:19.739> that's<00:04:19.980> all<00:04:20.160> that's<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.489> paper

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
together so that's all that's a paper

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.930 
together so that's all that's a paper
flute<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.180> we'll<00:04:22.049> see<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.350> later

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
flute and we'll see you later

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.210 
flute and we'll see you later
don't<00:04:23.940> do<00:04:24.120> that
