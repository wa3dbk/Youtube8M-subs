00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.720
 and beautiful to all friends of youtube quest 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:22.150
 today we are here in a new video where 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.759
 I wanted to explain to you how we do say 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.160
 how to color the armor of 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.710
 minecraft with the leather 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.419
 meanwhile I wanted to tell you two things is not 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.180
 who knows what? 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:38.020
 but then the first is that this is the 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.840
 first video on the channel here we say the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.039
 Video decent since I called 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.769
 200 official channel but also because 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.539
 is the first video in which I put the 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.649
 intro in practice because a short while ago 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.989
 having seen the intro and then why 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.429
 in short, it's a video, let's say this 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.859
 trick of coloring the armor 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:05.379
 you will see later what it is 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.060
 I found out a few days ago between 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.710
 the day before yesterday 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.800
 but let's see immediately how it's done 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.800
 then ok, let's go to minecraft then 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.580
 I forgot about workbenches 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.780
 when I did here okay then we 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.350
 we must take the helmet e 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.660
 then the colored shades then 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:33.940
 first and foremost , you are silent with leather 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.980
 leather is made with the skin that is on 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.760
 here it is the one with the cows in fact 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.760
 killing the cows 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.100
 Oh well 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.150
 and then we take a dye for example 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.470
 the red rose green cactus so everyone 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:54.470
 we choose red rose and yes 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.690
 kraft for example with all the flowers all 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.350
 the possible and unimaginable flowers that 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.390
 you have you can craft and you do it 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.610
 enough that you put in a homework 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.460
 paula margherita put it in a case 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.709
 here and it becomes light gray ok 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.160
 we take the leather helmet or 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.100
 leggings in short what you have and it 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.260
 we place near here where you like and give you 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:25.400
 I am very cool colored leather helmet 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.130
 too fashion so in practice it is a good one 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.180
 method for example to be able to do that ne 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.720
 i know a pvp type server with teams that 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.959
 I know you do the reds against blue and then 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.670
 nothing if he plays a trick like that 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.739
 very cool that I discovered some time 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.100
 some time a short time e 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:52.480
 too, however, a few days ago there was little 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:55.610
 long ago it was now I kill this cow 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.299
 so it doesn't break any more the watermelons are a lot 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.489
 cruel yes I know but I warn you it can 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.820
 do only with leather, unfortunately not 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.730
 can be done with the iron mesh on 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.040
 diamond and they can't be done 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.299
 unfortunately then nothing the video ends 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.360
 here 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.480
 I hope it was useful anyway 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.239
 tell me 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.500
 in short, it was useful for me to be brought to you 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.500
 no oh well joke 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.610
 nothing ends the video here and I'll see you 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.610
 to the next nice guys video
