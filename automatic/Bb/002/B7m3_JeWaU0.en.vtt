00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:18.559
 the theme of prehistoric animals that had one more day 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.969
 gÃ¼emes fighter messiah or not 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.909
 iq lady of everything that is 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:30.079
 the good this recreation that was given through cinema 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.770
 of adur wines and so it was taken for granted 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.410
 percent as a consumption factor I think that beyond that 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.840
 it served 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.010
 to introduce the guys in everything that is 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.010
 percent the concern for historical animals 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.590
 and that's where we 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.679
 we value 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:52.630
 much 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.780
 the role of adult adult mediated 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.910
 the adult facilitator of the father of the top 100 p 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.729
 percent of the school here 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.020
 and fashion a qualitative leap say 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.300
 until that object that can be in some way 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.550
 for 5 this let's say 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.680
 by all the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.820
 perotti 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.180
 you can introduce sensibly the life of the boy 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.890
 and good and that is a motivation for curiosity 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.890
 for the inquiry for him to do to 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.990
 for everything he 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.700
 the infantile universe in relation to the non-parasitic terminals and with 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.270
 the objects because 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.810
 I think 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.170
 to see this instrument we are talking about animals but 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.560
 as living beings but I think the same goes for the boy's relationship 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.390
 what's wrong with it 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.720
 the disdain of recent success has cones object one can stay in 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 in that number to know it 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.759
 or you can also let that guy wait for you 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.159
 moon there 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.380
 I do it because before going out desperately to buy another novelty 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.470
 what tape 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.460
 This event has no hands 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.409
 then the neck and this one 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.729
 this explore what guys company says it does not propose animal models 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:13.539
 in a drawer 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.669
 and we divide them by aragua porras 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:20.239
 for ree animals says the animal is a big box 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.789
 the historical ones that we have seen 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.539
 because and the boy was allowed to enter and pti 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.720
 and as a citizen as how to get inside 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.720
 in this 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.840
 in that amount of animals not and the smallest 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.649
 i all 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.589
 and it's interesting to see 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.939
 as 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:44.010
 How do you know a lot about animals and how do they ask and how do they get curious? 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.839
 and well there you have to see if there is any big 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:50.690
 that is answering no 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.689
 that this new one 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.689
 to Ecuador 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.379
 wheel 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.579
 I think it's really playing the world 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.529
 a child learns to be a player 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:19.980
 player in life player in quotes say let's not learn to live 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:26.739
 Then I think the sensitive game 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.279
 the game that has to do 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:30.489
 with sensitivity 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.199
 forgetfulness also humanizes 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:35.979
 sensitizes them 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.529
 That's why the importance of 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.939
 lekic to select the material with which these play 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.449
 because we think there's a canyon there 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.689
 of informative obviously with with 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.779
 with the guidance and constitutive of this scientist 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.749
 we always say to repeat it kiki 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:59.270
 that a boy and girl are formed in which they are constituted in 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.579
 in your relationship with adults 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.299
 so good in that relationship with adults in that relationship with the subjects 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.969
 that so far this year 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:09.219
 and good 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:12.219
 in the child's world c that is constituting 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.809
 then it seems to me that it is not the same 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:16.999
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:20.019
 that is surrounded by certain aspects 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.030
 that no tusquets that's why it seems important to us and it always appeared 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.860
 important to be oriented origin and meaning which does not mean 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.340
 have demonize 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.689
 nothing is illicit life in society 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:36.879
 the boy has the axis or 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.520
 until a lot of elements what happens is that one chooses 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.419
 a sign will turn you 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.599
 percent and 1 good 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.319
 the development of critical thinking 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.999
 So, well, in that way, it's what interests us 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.520
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.740
 keck and a child can learn to 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.440
 to discover ali 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.499
 i interpret the reality and there it is worth 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:01.499
 to health 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:03.939
 someone is worth for living beings 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:08.229
 ok for the objects it is worth for your relationship in the game with others yes 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.610
 worth for literature 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.949
 p pig for all your supplies yield 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.289
 surrounded by 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.110
 of these elements not 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.759
 pele that we started we have never raised for a hundred 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.469
 my son and this record 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:33.710
 and the youthful tiki union the anti a matter of following action 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.490
 why we try 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.240
 open the fan but our position is to try 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.790
 of giving him boy and childhood in general to all instances with the 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.650
 that we work differently 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.559
 possibility 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:54.429
 and diversity that's why the only way that's why the Latin American chola 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.210
 that's why the 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.449
 the animals that's why but I said in boy 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.879
 that's why a whole game that is not not that is not strongly competitive without 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:06.830
 case increases 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.050
 be a cooperative game 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.270
 and it's still a little bit the whole sofia template here 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.879
 that we try 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.710
 to defend from sustaining 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.819
 d 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.279
 to support not 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:22.279
 through the prize we make 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.050
 the animals said the risk 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.129
 constitution for children the first step in the relationship they will establish 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.949
 A challenge 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:33.210
 with live animals 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.830
 that is why the participation of adults is important 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.119
 this selection process 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:42.879
 the choice when deciding 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:44.999
 as and completed nutlet
