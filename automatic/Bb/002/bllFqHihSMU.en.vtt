00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
I think it gives the film kind of a cool

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.700 
I think it gives the film kind of a cool
deal<00:04:35.090> because<00:04:35.420> it's<00:04:35.600> much<00:04:35.810> different<00:04:36.080> looking

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
deal because it's much different looking

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.380 
deal because it's much different looking
