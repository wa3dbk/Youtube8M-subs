00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.510
 program today we will see the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.430
 piece the girl of the joints cutter 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.170
 hubert felix thiefaine others the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.580
 rhythmic chords that it takes for 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.650
 to play well it's gone we end up 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.270
 behind and guitar and forget about 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.860
 look at the depot to see how that 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.860
 looks for how by the agreements 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.320
 for the chords it's going to be relatively 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.910
 simple is that chords or to the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.860
 original version a hood second 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.670
 box sending without cover in second box 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.940
 live 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.890
 this song is sometimes played without a hood 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.630
 so that's how we have everything 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.500
 must the chords of which very simple mi 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.200
 minor 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.460
 D major 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.730
 C major 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.760
 G major and minor 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.950
 this is nothing complicated by the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.330
 So we can do it like that 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.220
 exploit it one can also do it like 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.070
 it 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.900
 it's up to you to do what's favorite 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.260
 well now we'll see what the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260
 rhythmic 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.219
 the rhythm in this account in 8 he goes 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.899
 have to scratch on the 1 the bass of 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.880
 the agreement then little reminder of that 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.720
 it's for a minor it's going to be the rope 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.050
 half for a D major the rope of re 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.680
 for a major C the rope of the for a 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.170
 ground the rope half and for a the chord 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.760
 of two we have everything we need and 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.020
 well now we are gone for the 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.670
 rhythmic so on the 1-1 have made the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.730
 low on the dow did nothing 3 4 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.820
 we will play them 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:49.230
 5 does nothing and if he does that to do 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.770
 full of 3,4 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.770
 walton 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.420
 but of course this rhythmic and to do 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.570
 a lot a lot a lot more 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.570
 quick 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.229
 so we'll have to train already 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.090
 do it slowly and speed up small to 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.080
 small to make the piece that's for 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.819
 the rhythmic and well now we're going 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.819
 see how this piece is built 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.780
 for this song we will have a 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.370
 alternation of a couplet with lyrics 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.310
 of a couple she was singing with justin the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.750
 the la suite of agreements will be the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.609
 next to do so minor and 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.610
 major do C major G major 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:36.730
 the minor E minor 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.440
 new leader here and bayer have to have the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.060
 already make a first time with the 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.140
 lyrics and after a second time with 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.630
 the lakers here I was looking for the word 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.010
 and then we resume with the words and 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.030
 after again the hearts and again 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.350
 the lyrics and again the hearts 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.870
 knowing that for a hole one can 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.010
 start with the choruses so I'm going 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.390
 show you now this web 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.380
 what it gives and after it takes 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.630
 rotate and full of times 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.030
 to make the piece wholesale it takes 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.030
 do nine there are nine verses sung 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.360
 with lyrics so there are at least 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.530
 nine deals with the choirs so that's 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.440
 done eighteen times in a row that it takes 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.070
 do it at least 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.070
 so that's what it's going to give 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.799
 he'll have to turn his 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.220
 platform away of course that's more 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.220
 quickly 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.069
 that's it and well on the rhythm we have everything 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.140
 what you need you watch the demo 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.450
 how to build this piece 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.860
 do not hesitate to like to share if 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.450
 it's too complicated for you to do 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.280
 beginners pack the four months of 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.230
