these<00:00:14.910> quick<00:00:15.210> clean<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.500> basically

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
these quick clean I so this is basically

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.130 
these quick clean I so this is basically
the<00:00:17.070> top<00:00:17.250> race<00:00:17.550> as<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.119> can<00:00:18.300> see<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:18.779> clear

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
the top race as you can see it's clear

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.410 
the top race as you can see it's clear
so<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.250> basically<00:00:20.369> gives<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> look<00:00:21.210> of

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
so that basically gives it the look of

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.040 
so that basically gives it the look of
an<00:00:21.689> invisible<00:00:22.020> brace<00:00:23.060> also<00:00:24.060> as<00:00:24.210> well<00:00:24.420> where<00:00:24.869> my

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
