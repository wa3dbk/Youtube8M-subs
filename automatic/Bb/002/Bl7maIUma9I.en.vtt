the past when I didn't differentiate

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.600 
the past when I didn't differentiate
instruction<00:00:10.320> what<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.800> saw<00:00:11.040> happened<00:00:11.429> was<00:00:11.580> I

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
instruction what I saw happened was I

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.820 
instruction what I saw happened was I
saw<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.540> would<00:00:12.900> always<00:00:12.990> have<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.469> small

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
saw that I would always have a small

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.790 
saw that I would always have a small
population<00:00:14.519> or<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> subset<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.179> kids<00:00:15.480> who<00:00:15.839> we

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
population or a subset of kids who we

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.279 
population or a subset of kids who we
like<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.250> call<00:00:17.430> them<00:00:17.609> silent<00:00:18.029> fails<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.660> I

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
like to call them silent fails and I

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.140 
like to call them silent fails and I
realized<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.160> need<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.430> address<00:00:20.880> that

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
realized that I need to address that

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.509 
realized that I need to address that
issue<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:22.710> an<00:00:22.859> issue<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.070> has<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.430> do

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
issue and it's an issue that has to do

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.890 
issue and it's an issue that has to do
with<00:00:23.640> me<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.269> hasn't<00:00:24.480> issued<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.720> do<00:00:24.779> with

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
with me and it hasn't issued to do with

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.279 
with me and it hasn't issued to do with
my<00:00:25.019> instruction<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.849> what<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.880> found<00:00:27.269> was<00:00:27.689> that

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
my instruction and what I found was that

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.659 
my instruction and what I found was that
if<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.400> am<00:00:29.880> able<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.510> find<00:00:31.439> different<00:00:32.009> avenues

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
if I am able to find different avenues

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.940 
if I am able to find different avenues
of<00:00:32.700> explanation<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.719> certain<00:00:33.989> topics<00:00:34.469> that

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
of explanation for certain topics that

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.010 
of explanation for certain topics that
I'm<00:00:35.040> able<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.250> draw<00:00:35.460> these<00:00:35.640> kids<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.210> now<00:00:36.899> I'm

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
I'm able to draw these kids in now I'm

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.780 
I'm able to draw these kids in now I'm
not<00:00:37.170> saying<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.620> all<00:00:37.649> five<00:00:38.160> or<00:00:38.219> six<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.670> them

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
not saying that all five or six of them

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.729 
not saying that all five or six of them
are<00:00:38.969> not<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.510> be<00:00:39.570> silent<00:00:39.750> fails<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:40.469> I

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
are not going to be silent fails but I

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.680 
are not going to be silent fails but I
can<00:00:41.070> decrease<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.579> amount<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:41.969> my<00:00:42.059> classroom

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
can decrease that amount in my classroom

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.010 
can decrease that amount in my classroom
and<00:00:43.280> one<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.430> ways<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:45.120> i<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.719> able<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and one of the ways that i was able to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.619 
and one of the ways that i was able to
address<00:00:46.260> those<00:00:46.739> issues<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:48.120> example<00:00:48.510> if

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
address those issues was for example if

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.750 
address those issues was for example if
I<00:00:48.780> were<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.079> explain<00:00:49.469> equations<00:00:50.039> sometimes<00:00:50.579> I

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
I were to explain equations sometimes I

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.790 
I were to explain equations sometimes I
would<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.120> use<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.989> know<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> traditional

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
would just use you know the traditional

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.770 
would just use you know the traditional
way<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.399> know<00:00:53.430> solving<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.449> other

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
way of just you know solving and other

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.869 
way of just you know solving and other
times<00:00:55.050> i<00:00:55.199> would<00:00:55.320> use<00:00:55.440> tea<00:00:55.620> tables<00:00:56.039> other<00:00:56.520> times

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
times i would use tea tables other times

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.670 
times i would use tea tables other times
i<00:00:57.030> would<00:00:57.210> talk<00:00:57.360> about<00:00:57.390> using<00:00:57.989> opposites<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
i would talk about using opposites and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.830 
i would talk about using opposites and
they<00:00:59.640> really<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.030> appreciate<00:01:00.300> these

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
they really do appreciate these

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.770 
they really do appreciate these
different<00:01:01.230> avenues<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.680> explanation<00:01:02.780> another

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
different avenues of explanation another

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.000 
different avenues of explanation another
way<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:03.989> i<00:01:04.199> would<00:01:04.350> address<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> silent

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
way that i would address the silent

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.280 
way that i would address the silent
fails<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.700> i<00:01:05.729> adopted<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.689> practice<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
fails is that i adopted and practice and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.039 
fails is that i adopted and practice and

thing and I have gained a lot of
experience<00:01:32.270> finding<00:01:33.270> different<00:01:33.509> ways<00:01:33.659> of

solutions with the class because again
students<00:01:54.210> feel<00:01:54.329> safe<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.659> my<00:01:54.689> classroom<00:01:55.259> so

at<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> certain<00:01:58.920> problem<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.579> I'm<00:02:00.180> able<00:02:00.360> to

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
at a certain problem and I'm able to

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.609 
at a certain problem and I'm able to
make<00:02:00.630> more<00:02:00.780> connections<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.469> that

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
make more connections with that

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.420
