four<00:03:08.510> what<00:03:09.510> I've<00:03:09.689> gone<00:03:09.870> ahead<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.260> done<00:03:10.439> here

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
four what I've gone ahead and done here

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.009 
four what I've gone ahead and done here
now<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.250> I'll<00:03:11.430> flip<00:03:11.760> them<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.000> skin<00:03:12.629> side<00:03:12.989> down

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
now is I'll flip them so skin side down

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.220 
now is I'll flip them so skin side down
so<00:03:13.349> all<00:03:13.709> my<00:03:13.889> chicken<00:03:14.310> here<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:15.359> skin<00:03:15.720> side<00:03:15.989> is

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
so all my chicken here the skin side is

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.979 
so all my chicken here the skin side is
down<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.919> I've<00:03:17.280> got<00:03:17.579> my<00:03:17.760> oven<00:03:17.970> preheating<00:03:18.870> at

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
down and I've got my oven preheating at

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.879 
down and I've got my oven preheating at
a<00:03:19.019> relatively<00:03:19.680> high<00:03:19.859> heat<00:03:20.489> for<00:03:20.849> twenty-five

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
a relatively high heat for twenty-five

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.610 
a relatively high heat for twenty-five
skin-side<00:03:22.889> down<00:03:22.949> middle<00:03:23.760> rack<00:03:24.229> 425<00:03:25.229> degrees

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
skin-side down middle rack 425 degrees

skin-side down middle rack 425 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:03:26.479> uncovered<00:03:27.479> do<00:03:27.720> not<00:03:27.930> cover<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.579> the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
Fahrenheit uncovered do not cover it the

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.339 
Fahrenheit uncovered do not cover it the
reason<00:03:29.879> why<00:03:30.000> we're<00:03:30.209> doing<00:03:30.239> skin<00:03:30.690> side<00:03:30.930> down<00:03:30.959> is

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
reason why we're doing skin side down is

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.839 
reason why we're doing skin side down is
because<00:03:31.590> once<00:03:31.799> we<00:03:31.919> put<00:03:32.099> it<00:03:32.129> in<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.400> oven<00:03:32.519> we're

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
because once we put it in the oven we're

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.490 
because once we put it in the oven we're
going<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.060> forget<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.419> and<00:03:33.629> just<00:03:33.840> leave<00:03:34.109> it<00:03:34.139> in

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
going to forget it and just leave it in

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.960 
going to forget it and just leave it in
their<00:03:34.859> eyes<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.310> we're<00:03:35.489> not<00:03:35.579> going<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.849> touch

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
their eyes is we're not going to touch

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.729 
their eyes is we're not going to touch
it<00:03:36.120> we're<00:03:36.269> not<00:03:36.419> going<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.599> do<00:03:36.720> anything<00:03:36.959> the

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
it we're not going to do anything the

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.640 
it we're not going to do anything the
final<00:03:38.250> 20<00:03:38.909> percent<00:03:39.329> of<00:03:39.419> the<00:03:39.569> cook<00:03:39.780> time<00:03:40.019> that

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
final 20 percent of the cook time that

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.990 
final 20 percent of the cook time that
is<00:03:40.799> when<00:03:41.010> we're<00:03:41.220> going<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.430> flip<00:03:41.639> it<00:03:41.669> it's<00:03:41.849> just

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
is when we're going to flip it it's just

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.390 
is when we're going to flip it it's just
