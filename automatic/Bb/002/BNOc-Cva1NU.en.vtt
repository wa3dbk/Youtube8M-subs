why<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.470> say<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.269> at<00:00:45.269> level<00:00:45.989> 15<00:00:46.470> warriors<00:00:47.070> have

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
why I say that at level 15 warriors have

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.799 
why I say that at level 15 warriors have
to<00:00:47.370> pick<00:00:47.550> between<00:00:47.699> three<00:00:48.210> talents<00:00:48.659> that<00:00:48.750> are

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
to pick between three talents that are

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.140 
to pick between three talents that are
going<00:00:49.049> to<00:00:49.170> affect<00:00:49.260> their<00:00:49.769> charge<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.909> first

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
going to affect their charge the first

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.539 
going to affect their charge the first
one<00:00:51.299> is<00:00:51.330> called<00:00:51.629> juggernaut<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.799> reduces<00:00:53.369> the

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:53.549 
one is called juggernaut it reduces the

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.789 
one is called juggernaut it reduces the
cooldown<00:00:53.729> of<00:00:54.000> charge<00:00:54.510> from<00:00:54.869> 20<00:00:55.229> seconds<00:00:55.650> down

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:55.799 
cooldown of charge from 20 seconds down

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:58.189 
cooldown of charge from 20 seconds down
to<00:00:56.010> 12<00:00:56.309> almost<00:00:57.210> allowing<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.659> to<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:57.869> it<00:00:57.989> twice

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
to 12 almost allowing you to do it twice

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.880 
to 12 almost allowing you to do it twice
as<00:00:58.470> often<00:00:58.650> as<00:00:58.920> before<00:01:02.900> the<00:01:03.900> second<00:01:04.379> talent<00:01:04.769> is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
as often as before the second talent is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.310 
as often as before the second talent is
called<00:01:05.250> double<00:01:05.640> time<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.090> basically<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:07.290> it

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
called double time and basically what it

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.690 
called double time and basically what it
does<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.280> allow<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
does is it's going to allow you to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.850 
does is it's going to allow you to
charge<00:01:08.880> two<00:01:09.299> times<00:01:09.659> before<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> before<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
charge two times before the before the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.130 
charge two times before the before the
cooldown<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.189> activated<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.780> means

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
cooldown is activated so what that means

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.109 
cooldown is activated so what that means
is<00:01:13.259> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.619> charge<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.820> immediately

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
is you can charge and then immediately

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.359 
is you can charge and then immediately
right<00:01:15.600> after<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.470> charge<00:01:16.770> again<00:01:17.159> or

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
right after that you can charge again or

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.740 
right after that you can charge again or
you<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.549> wait<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> few<00:01:17.790> seconds<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.479> charge

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
you can wait a few seconds in charge

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.050 
you can wait a few seconds in charge
again<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.680> charge<00:01:19.890> two<00:01:20.009> times<00:01:20.520> before

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
again so you can charge two times before

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.609 
again so you can charge two times before
the<00:01:21.299> twenty<00:01:21.719> second<00:01:22.049> cooldown<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:23.159> triggered

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
the twenty second cooldown is triggered

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
the twenty second cooldown is triggered
the<00:01:25.619> third<00:01:25.829> level<00:01:26.070> 15<00:01:26.490> talent<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:26.999> warbringer

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the third level 15 talent is warbringer

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.510 
the third level 15 talent is warbringer

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
which basically will cause your charge

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.310
