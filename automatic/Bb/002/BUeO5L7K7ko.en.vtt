00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.900
 alas not moron what has we 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.270
 interested is obviously their style 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.740
 crazy he brings futuroscope humor 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.750
 and that's what we want to do 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.490
 for the next years of the parks 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.770
 of attractions and the universe of the world of 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.210
 game these two very different universes and 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.039
 yet very quickly we found 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.000
 synergies between the two draws found 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.560
 first of all it was a collaboration 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.560
 extraordinary and complementary 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.350
 the particularity of such a project is 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.270
 that it is related to the artistic field 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.400
 it was necessary to innovate a number of 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.270
 small mechanical tricks 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.269
 or automatism to come to realize 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.949
 effects of what was requested 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.949
 interesting store it was a universe 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.680
 very rich in terms of two references 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:58.860
 and immediately we saw a potential 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:01.739
 in the in the machine the most thing 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.510
 complicated it's also the most 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.570
 interesting is the victims aspect in 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.830
 Crest 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.140
 from the beginning we only had one 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.520
 goal is to be closer to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.680
 immersion then an immersion that wants 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.590
 to say what to feel about it is to 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.970
 to say to make a real trip to the game I 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.030
 believe we 've never been that far 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.399
 on the futuroscope park in fact 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.630
 only since the entry of the queue of attempted 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:30.960
 outside to the exit 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.030
 we are completely immersed and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.680
 we live an experience the end the coast 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.689
 to the other 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.100
 the first challenge it was writing the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.600
 specification was so rabbits 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.770
 time travel after which she has 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.310
 a trip back in time 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.719
 wide enough 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.399
 so we had to choose when even 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.750
 key eras that speaks to everyone 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.950
 small and big 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.020
 to design a film with a decor 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.390
 primer or children necessarily that we do not 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.670
 can not do two fields against 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.319
 cutting fields because we are 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.399
 constrained to those at this decor holds a 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.799
 plan is theater 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.590
 must apply to inspect 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.060
 stages of work including the state of the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.459
 pre production which is extremely 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.979
 important to define the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.500
 character design finish the decor 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.360
 the designs the decorations the colors but 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.370
 also and especially what happens 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.290
 in the story that if very late we get 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.549
 found again to let think but 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.090
 we will add this or that 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:27.489
 thing that we debated and c7 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.290
 cooperation of all trades that has 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.670
 took a lot of time and that was their 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.940
 wonderful since nobody can 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.319
 really appropriate the paternity that 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.970
 is completely shared between one 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.230
 and the other trades 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.760
 physical that make the decorations that little 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.230
 after this case the film sets of 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.390
 body of professions of realization of 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.739
 production direction so a whole bunch 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.519
 different artists and that took it 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.519
 a lot of time 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:16.720
 act as if we were actually working 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:18.549
 for the api knees that's all after having 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.230
 saw the rabbits on the screen after having 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.359
 played with rabbits after reading the 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.639
 rabbits we will live with 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.920
 there is practically 600 meters carette 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.430
 attraction decoration so 600 sqm of 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.340
 decor is also a lot of people who 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.099
 comes from in at different times ago 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.030
 a team louises partiality that 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.799
 represents about twenty companies 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.319
 about 250 people who worked 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.030
 on the project personally I think 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.069
 that it's really the most 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.260
 the most complex as well the 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.260
 modification of the building because these 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.609
 young people with yvan modify our 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.109
 technologies implemented from a 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.870
 Generally speaking, we are on 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:01.629
 technologies and audiovisual and 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.060
 mechanics and automatisms 'the echo' 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.470
 control really get complicated so we 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.940
 is in since the things we want 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.790
 to touch them we feel them 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.560
 we are at scale 1 everything that happens 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.590
 these are big paintings of big 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.650
 frescoes and then a loyal also to the dna 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.230
 bunny rabbits who are 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.340
 rims and curious 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.340
 sometimes a little land 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.539
 decorations that moves that collapses so 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:31.160
 all this is sacred the artist thinks 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.130
 all the technical issues and that's where 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.409
 where the futuroscope has a real ability to 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.539
 create 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:41.619
 it is to associate a creative vision with a 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:44.220
 technical vision rabbids 

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:46.680
 today is the audacity of the future bone 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.330
 by this style by this technique we 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.889
 mobilized we want again 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.180
 but an attraction that fit into the 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:55.550
 category of the largest of the 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.550
 futuroscope huge momentum attractions
