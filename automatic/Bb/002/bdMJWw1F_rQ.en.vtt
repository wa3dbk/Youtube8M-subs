I've never seen this one on youtube
before<00:00:09.420> so<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.840> thought<00:00:10.050> I'd<00:00:10.200> do<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> quick<00:00:10.440> film

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
before so I thought I'd do a quick film

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:21.109 
before so I thought I'd do a quick film
it's<00:00:12.690> an<00:00:12.750> HD<00:00:13.139> ready<00:00:13.349> 1080p<00:00:16.430> webcam<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:20.119> lens

turns<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.720> face<00:00:21.930> both<00:00:22.199> ways<00:00:25.490> it's<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.670> under

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
turns to face both ways it's just under

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.870 
turns to face both ways it's just under
30<00:00:27.150> pounds<00:00:28.279> which<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.460> thought<00:00:29.580> was<00:00:29.699> really

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
30 pounds which I thought was really

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.880 
30 pounds which I thought was really
good<00:00:30.029> value<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.390> money

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
good value for money

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.810 
good value for money
I've<00:00:31.890> got<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> gig<00:00:32.520> card<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.090> there<00:00:34.610> it<00:00:35.610> does<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
I've got a gig card in there it does a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.170 
I've got a gig card in there it does a
loop<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.420> when<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> cards<00:00:37.739> full<00:00:37.950> up<00:00:38.180> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
loop so when the cards full up it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.690 
loop so when the cards full up it
carries<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.719> recording<00:00:40.290> by<00:00:41.160> deleting<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
carries on recording by deleting the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.130 
carries on recording by deleting the
first<00:00:42.030> files<00:00:43.789> it<00:00:44.789> takes<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.180> about<00:00:45.420> 500

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
first files it takes up about 500

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.360 
first files it takes up about 500
megabytes<00:00:46.620> or<00:00:46.950> 450<00:00:47.850> megabytes<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:49.370> three

minutes of recording turns on
automatically<00:00:55.110> when<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.500> cars<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:56.809> fed<00:00:57.809> fire

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
automatically when the cars on fed fire

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.119 
automatically when the cars on fed fire
the<00:00:58.170> USB<00:00:58.969> socket<00:01:00.109> you<00:01:01.109> get<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> cigarette

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the USB socket you get a cigarette

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.320 
the USB socket you get a cigarette
adapter<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:04.320> SD<00:01:04.739> micro<00:01:05.189> SD<00:01:05.670> card<00:01:05.939> goes<00:01:06.119> in

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
adapter the SD micro SD card goes in

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.250 
adapter the SD micro SD card goes in
there<00:01:07.460> you<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.580> an<00:01:08.640> HDMI<00:01:09.090> slot

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
there you have an HDMI slot

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.420 
there you have an HDMI slot
yeah<00:01:11.250> an<00:01:11.310> HDMI<00:01:11.850> lead<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.360> well<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:13.159> think<00:01:14.159> this

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
yeah an HDMI lead as well I think this

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.300 
yeah an HDMI lead as well I think this
is<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:16.610> analog<00:01:17.610> video<00:01:17.900> output<00:01:19.040> but<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.130> don't

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
is a analog video output but you don't

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.830 
is a analog video output but you don't
get<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> lead<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:23.479> overall<00:01:24.479> really

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
get the lead for that overall really

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.520 
get the lead for that overall really
nice<00:01:25.170> quality<00:01:26.869> very<00:01:27.869> small<00:01:30.079> LEDs<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.320> night

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
nice quality very small LEDs for night

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.850 
nice quality very small LEDs for night
time<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:33.409> think<00:01:34.409> they're<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.740> normal

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
time but I think they're just normal

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.940 
time but I think they're just normal
LEDs<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.490> white<00:01:36.090> LEDs<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.810> they<00:01:36.990> they<00:01:37.740> don't

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
LEDs just white LEDs so they they don't

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.770 
LEDs just white LEDs so they they don't
do<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> very<00:01:38.159> good<00:01:38.369> job<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:38.820> won't<00:01:39.210> light

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
do a very good job they just won't light

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.090 
do a very good job they just won't light
up<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.170> windscreen<00:01:41.299> also<00:01:42.299> have<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> microphone

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
up the windscreen also have a microphone

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.560 
up the windscreen also have a microphone
for<00:01:44.100> recording<00:01:44.159> audio<00:01:47.149> you<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.210> set<00:01:48.479> the

for recording audio you can set the
resolution<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.790> loop<00:01:50.970> recording<00:01:51.479> length<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
resolution the loop recording length you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.249 
resolution the loop recording length you
can<00:01:52.170> change<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.710> color<00:01:53.100> balance<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:55.110> can

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
can change the color balance you can

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.170 
can change the color balance you can
leave<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> recordings<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.430> standby<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.030> it

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
leave it recordings on standby and it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.880 
leave it recordings on standby and it
records<00:01:57.540> motion<00:01:57.899> detection<00:01:58.259> when<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.680> sees

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
records motion detection when it sees

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.660 
records motion detection when it sees
movement<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.469> turn<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.829> audio<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.460> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
movement you can turn the audio on and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.969 
movement you can turn the audio on and
off<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.149> set<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> date<00:02:04.409> stamp<00:02:04.799> on

you can make it auto power off the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.910 
you can make it auto power off the
buttons<00:02:14.190> make<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> buzz<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.350> noise<00:02:16.500> if<00:02:16.770> you

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
buttons make a buzz and a noise if you

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.920
