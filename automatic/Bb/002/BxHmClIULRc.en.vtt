released<00:07:26.050> just<00:07:26.320> yesterday<00:07:26.770> and<00:07:27.490> I<00:07:27.610> was<00:07:27.760> a<00:07:27.789> bit

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 
released just yesterday and I was a bit

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:30.099 
annoyed because I believe that the

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:32.310 
annoyed because I believe that the
gateway<00:07:30.430> 3ds<00:07:30.639> isn't<00:07:31.240> much<00:07:31.810> better<00:07:32.050> because

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.320 
gateway 3ds isn't much better because

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.939 
gateway 3ds isn't much better because
it's<00:07:32.940> this<00:07:33.940> basically<00:07:34.599> same<00:07:35.409> look<00:07:35.620> as<00:07:35.770> this
