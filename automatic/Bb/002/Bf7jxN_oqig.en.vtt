00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.400
 Let's cook Fried champignons with chicken fillet 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.749
 Mushrooms cut into 4 parts. 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:19.440
 I took medium sized mushrooms. 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:42.260
 Cut chicken fillet into small pieces. 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.460
 Onions cut into cubes of medium size. 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.620
 Put mushrooms on a dry heated frying pan, cover 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.910
 cover and fry until the mushrooms do not let the juice. 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:12.620
 By the time it is 5-7 minutes. 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.600
 Add chicken fillet, stir and fry, on 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.150
 moderate heat until all the liquid has boiled away. 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:39.850
 By the time it is 30 minutes. 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:59.590
 Stir periodically. 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:22.469
 When all the liquid boils away, pour in the vegetable oil, 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:28.409
 add onions, evenly distribute it 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.829
 on the surface of the mushrooms, cover with a lid, and leave 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:38.950
 roast for 3-5 minutes. 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:50.019
 Then salt and pepper to taste, mix everything well, 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:56.969
 cover and fry under the lid for 15 minutes, periodically 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:19.189
 stirring. 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:24.790
 Dissolve tomato sauce with boiling water and mix well, 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:35.400
 so that the sauce is completely dissolved in water. 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.980
 Add the sauce to the mushrooms, mix well, cover 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:04:07.640
 cover and, stirring, fry for another 8-10 minutes. 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.280
 I stir the mushrooms a few times during frying and watch 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.359
 so that the mushrooms are not burnt. 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:37.481
