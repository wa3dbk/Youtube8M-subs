all<00:01:05.870> your<00:01:06.170> firmwares<00:01:06.650> go<00:01:07.010> into<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.430> firmwares

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
all your firmwares go into the firmwares

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.890 
all your firmwares go into the firmwares
folder<00:01:08.180> which<00:01:08.420> is<00:01:08.450> empty<00:01:09.110> right<00:01:09.140> now<00:01:09.260> and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
folder which is empty right now and

the<00:01:14.540> former's<00:01:14.900> have<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.170> be<00:01:15.260> a<00:01:15.290> single<00:01:15.710> file<00:01:16.070> so

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
the former's have to be a single file so

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.000 
the former's have to be a single file so
when<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.030> download<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.900> firmware<00:01:18.110> it's

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
when you download the firmware it's

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.400 
when you download the firmware it's
going<00:01:19.220> to<00:01:19.280> be<00:01:19.370> an<00:01:19.460> FTF<00:01:20.000> file<00:01:20.330> flashtool<00:01:21.050> file

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
going to be an FTF file flashtool file

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.770 
going to be an FTF file flashtool file
and<00:01:21.620> it's<00:01:21.830> a<00:01:21.920> single<00:01:22.310> file<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:23.360> if<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.540> copy

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
and it's a single file so if you copy

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.280 
and it's a single file so if you copy
that<00:01:23.960> file<00:01:24.350> remove<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:26.090> put<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:26.990> into<00:01:27.200> your
