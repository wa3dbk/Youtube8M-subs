00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
of the twelve days of anime and today I

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.820 
of the twelve days of anime and today I
shall<00:01:56.710> be<00:01:56.920> talking<00:01:57.130> about<00:01:57.580> something<00:01:57.820> that

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
shall be talking about something that

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.100 
shall be talking about something that
technically<00:01:59.830> isn't<00:02:00.100> canon<00:02:00.730> anime<00:02:01.270> if<00:02:01.690> that

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
technically isn't canon anime if that

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.360

makes sense

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.220 
makes sense
but<00:02:03.910> rather<00:02:04.120> it<00:02:04.450> was<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.600> project<00:02:05.020> now<00:02:05.110> I've

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
but rather it was a project now I've

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.740 
but rather it was a project now I've
been<00:02:05.350> very<00:02:05.560> hard<00:02:05.860> for<00:02:05.950> ever<00:02:06.520> since<00:02:07.150> rewatching
