00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
shipped overseas so this is a 0-5 right

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.329 
shipped overseas so this is a 0-5 right
there<00:00:26.019> it's<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.970> zoom<00:00:28.660> in<00:00:28.900> right<00:00:29.109> there<00:00:29.409> point

there it's you zoom in right there point
five<00:00:30.609> millimeter<00:00:31.179> casings<00:00:31.449> so<00:00:31.839> this<00:00:32.020> is<00:00:32.230> Moby

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
five millimeter casings so this is Moby

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.290 
five millimeter casings so this is Moby
the<00:00:33.130> thinnest<00:00:33.550> case<00:00:34.110> out<00:00:35.110> there<00:00:35.730> next<00:00:36.730> to<00:00:37.030> like

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
the thinnest case out there next to like

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.930 
the thinnest case out there next to like
switch<00:00:37.570> easy<00:00:37.750> nudes<00:00:38.080> or<00:00:38.470> feathers<00:00:39.220> like<00:00:39.790> the

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.930 
nude is a millimeter thin this is 0.5
millimeters<00:00:42.460> so<00:00:43.210> this<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.870> case<00:00:44.050> itself

little<00:02:01.719> bit<00:02:02.020> towards<00:02:02.319> the<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:03.340> bottom<00:02:03.729> of<00:02:03.819> the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
little bit towards the the bottom of the

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.499 
little bit towards the the bottom of the
lens<00:02:04.090> instead<00:02:04.509> of<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.659> top<00:02:05.850> there<00:02:06.850> is<00:02:07.179> also

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
lens instead of the top there is also

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.320 
lens instead of the top there is also
this<00:02:07.990> rainbow<00:02:08.500> effect<00:02:08.920> off<00:02:09.520> you<00:02:09.640> guys<00:02:09.789> can<00:02:10.060> see

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
this rainbow effect off you guys can see

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.089 
this rainbow effect off you guys can see
it<00:02:10.450> like<00:02:10.810> right<00:02:11.080> about<00:02:11.349> there<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.799> should<00:02:11.980> be

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
it like right about there you should be

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.470 
it like right about there you should be
able<00:02:12.159> to<00:02:12.250> see<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.519> hopefully<00:02:12.849> on<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.209> video

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
able to see it hopefully on the video

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.910 
able to see it hopefully on the video
it's<00:02:14.080> got<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.260> little<00:02:14.379> bit<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.709> rainbow

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
it's got a little bit of a rainbow

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.440 
it's got a little bit of a rainbow
effect

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
effect

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.190 
effect
much<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:17.459> my<00:02:17.760> disappointment<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.870> does<00:02:19.020> have

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
much to my disappointment it does have

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.960 
much to my disappointment it does have
that<00:02:19.290> rainbow<00:02:19.500> effect<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.069> can<00:02:20.250> probably<00:02:20.520> fix

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
that rainbow effect you can probably fix

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.440 
that rainbow effect you can probably fix
that<00:02:21.650> by<00:02:22.650> putting<00:02:22.980> doing<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.520> whole<00:02:23.849> talcum

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
that by putting doing the whole talcum

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.110 
that by putting doing the whole talcum
powder<00:02:24.480> trick<00:02:25.170> we're<00:02:25.530> very<00:02:26.400> similar<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.880> if

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
powder trick we're very similar to if

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.670 
powder trick we're very similar to if
you<00:02:27.209> had<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:28.220> otterbox<00:02:29.220> defender<00:02:29.340> or

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
you had a otterbox defender or

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.190 
you had a otterbox defender or
ballistics<00:02:31.680> HC<00:02:32.130> case<00:02:32.430> just<00:02:33.330> puff<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.780> little

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
ballistics HC case just puff a little

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.600 
ballistics HC case just puff a little
bit<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.500> talcum<00:02:34.920> powder<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.310> should<00:02:35.489> get

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
bit of talcum powder and it should get

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.470 
bit of talcum powder and it should get
rid<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.150> won't<00:02:36.239> have<00:02:36.450> that

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
rid of that and you won't have that

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.550 
rid of that and you won't have that
issue<00:02:36.630> at<00:02:37.050> all<00:02:37.819> so<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:38.940> does<00:02:39.120> not<00:02:39.270> have<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:40.050> lay

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
issue at all so it does not have a lay

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.650 
issue at all so it does not have a lay
on<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.770> table<00:02:40.890> design<00:02:41.100> as<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:41.670> can<00:02:41.790> see<00:02:42.030> the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
on the table design as you can see the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.460 
on the table design as you can see the
edge<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:43.380> pretty<00:02:44.370> much<00:02:44.489> exposed<00:02:45.000> around

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
edge is pretty much exposed around

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.040 
edge is pretty much exposed around
another<00:02:46.470> disappointment<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.220> case

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
another disappointment of the case

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.750 
another disappointment of the case
honestly<00:02:49.050> was<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.860> scratches<00:02:50.130> pretty

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
honestly was that it scratches pretty

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.170 
honestly was that it scratches pretty
easily

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
easily

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.940 
easily
I<00:02:51.360> was<00:02:51.630> actually<00:02:51.810> disappointed<00:02:52.470> because<00:02:52.560> I

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
I was actually disappointed because I

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.740 
I was actually disappointed because I
brought<00:02:53.549> it<00:02:53.700> right<00:02:53.819> out<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> case<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.480> said

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
brought it right out of the case I said

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.660 
brought it right out of the case I said
it<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:55.019> my<00:02:55.500> table<00:02:55.769> picked<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.250> up<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.580> there

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
it on my table picked it up and there

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.729 
it on my table picked it up and there
was<00:02:56.790> already<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.269> scratch<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.170> back<00:02:58.380> and

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
was already a scratch on the back and

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.220 
was already a scratch on the back and
after<00:02:58.890> about<00:02:59.819> a<00:02:59.880> day<00:03:00.120> or<00:03:00.239> two<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.420> use<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.989> already

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
after about a day or two a use I already

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.979 
after about a day or two a use I already
got<00:03:01.350> all<00:03:01.500> these<00:03:01.650> ridiculous<00:03:02.370> scratches

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
got all these ridiculous scratches

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.509 
got all these ridiculous scratches
everywhere<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.739> doesn't<00:03:05.040> really<00:03:05.160> attract

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
everywhere it doesn't really attract

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.880 
everywhere it doesn't really attract
fingerprints<00:03:06.269> as<00:03:06.390> much<00:03:06.569> it's<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.769> the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
fingerprints as much it's just that the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.090 
fingerprints as much it's just that the
whole<00:03:08.010> scratch<00:03:08.340> factor<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.819> kind<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.060> bad<00:03:10.100> also

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
whole scratch factor is kind of bad also

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.270 
whole scratch factor is kind of bad also
along<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.489> edges<00:03:12.170> see<00:03:13.170> how<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.500> scratches<00:03:13.980> in

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
along the edges see how it scratches in

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.309 
along the edges see how it scratches in
there<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.760> does<00:03:14.910> have<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> caves<00:03:15.360> logo<00:03:15.780> but

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
there it does have the caves logo but

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.620 
there it does have the caves logo but
yeah<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:17.459> it's<00:03:17.610> kind<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:18.000> disappointing<00:03:18.180> that

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
yeah so it's kind of disappointing that

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.569 
yeah so it's kind of disappointing that
it<00:03:19.049> scratches<00:03:19.319> so<00:03:19.620> easily<00:03:19.829> I<00:03:20.010> wish<00:03:20.310> they<00:03:20.459> would

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
it scratches so easily I wish they would

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.949 
it scratches so easily I wish they would
have<00:03:20.640> made<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.940> similar<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.900> material<00:03:23.959> that

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
have made it similar to a material that

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.099 
have made it similar to a material that
kind<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.530> would<00:03:25.709> be<00:03:25.739> more<00:03:26.070> resistant<00:03:26.609> to

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
kind of would be more resistant to

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.770 
kind of would be more resistant to
scratches<00:03:28.940> but<00:03:29.940> there<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.329> have<00:03:30.359> it<00:03:30.600> guys<00:03:30.720> for

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
scratches but there you have it guys for

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.750 
scratches but there you have it guys for
the<00:03:33.780> price<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.200> paid<00:03:34.440> for<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.739> it's<00:03:35.459> not<00:03:35.579> so

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
the price I paid for this it's not so

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.949 
the price I paid for this it's not so

other cases that come with it they're
not<00:04:39.289> as<00:04:39.500> good<00:04:39.650> as<00:04:39.770> like<00:04:39.860> an<00:04:40.009> sgp<00:04:40.460> but<00:04:40.729> again

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
not as good as like an sgp but again

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.790 
not as good as like an sgp but again
it's<00:04:41.600> pretty<00:04:41.810> good<00:04:42.050> for<00:04:42.259> including<00:04:42.560> two<00:04:42.680> of

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
it's pretty good for including two of

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.010 
it's pretty good for including two of
them<00:04:42.919> in<00:04:43.009> there<00:04:43.130> this<00:04:43.880> was<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.240> little<00:04:44.539> bit<00:04:44.690> more

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
them in there this was a little bit more

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.640 
them in there this was a little bit more
disappointing<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:45.830> really<00:04:46.160> is<00:04:46.280> just<00:04:46.610> a<00:04:46.729> cheap

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
disappointing it really is just a cheap

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.580 
disappointing it really is just a cheap
what<00:04:48.650> they<00:04:48.800> call<00:04:49.039> is<00:04:49.250> a<00:04:49.280> wallet<00:04:49.910> stand<00:04:50.210> and<00:04:51.050> you

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
what they call is a wallet stand and you

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.620 
what they call is a wallet stand and you
can<00:04:51.800> I<00:04:52.039> guess<00:04:52.430> put<00:04:52.639> it<00:04:52.789> as<00:04:52.940> a<00:04:52.970> credit<00:04:53.300> card

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
can I guess put it as a credit card

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.810 
can I guess put it as a credit card
right<00:04:53.870> in<00:04:54.110> your<00:04:54.229> wallet<00:04:54.620> but<00:04:55.100> it<00:04:55.220> serves<00:04:55.490> to

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
right in your wallet but it serves to

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.689 
right in your wallet but it serves to
kind<00:04:56.539> of<00:04:56.630> prop<00:04:56.870> your<00:04:57.080> phone<00:04:57.320> up<00:04:57.560> if<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:58.490> needed

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
kind of prop your phone up if you needed

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.020 
kind of prop your phone up if you needed
