00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
have enough fuel for that so we have to

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.990 
have enough fuel for that so we have to

man driving around so yeah that's it for
the<00:03:33.540> translunar<00:03:34.260> injection<00:03:34.379> pretty<00:03:35.250> quick

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
the translunar injection pretty quick

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.160 
the translunar injection pretty quick
pretty<00:03:35.760> simple<00:03:37.519> yeah<00:03:38.519> next<00:03:39.150> step<00:03:39.329> is<00:03:39.569> docking

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
pretty simple yeah next step is docking

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.860 
pretty simple yeah next step is docking
with<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.349> lunar<00:03:40.560> module<00:03:40.739> so<00:03:41.400> just<00:03:42.389> like<00:03:42.569> after

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
with the lunar module so just like after

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.680 
with the lunar module so just like after
every<00:03:43.200> step<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.859> have<00:03:43.889> to<00:03:44.370> hit<00:03:44.790> quick<00:03:45.150> save<00:03:45.480> at

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
every step you have to hit quick save at

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.780 
every step you have to hit quick save at
the<00:03:45.810> end<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:46.950> orbiter<00:03:47.400> no<00:03:47.519> is<00:03:47.670> your

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
the end so the orbiter no is your

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.410 
the end so the orbiter no is your
position<00:03:48.090> on<00:03:48.510> us<00:03:48.720> where<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.109> were<00:03:49.260> last<00:03:49.470> time

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
position on us where you were last time

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.660 
position on us where you were last time
