00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.609
 she was dedicated to the exit of the same name 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.829
 games in the genre of fighting game and the plot of the comic 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.710
 is a prequel event in the game 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.320
 more detail about it narration 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.450

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.970
 on gotham who fell into silence 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.880
 the rest of the night is no longer disturbed by the sounds 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.530
 child sleep crime is no longer 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.770
 interrupted by crashing shots 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.350
 no more screams from the dark squeals of tires and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.319
 sound like street sirens haunting everything 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.860
 reckless men and women about such 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:28.649
 Gotham he always dreamed of but that is not 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.500
 and you that she is turned out of corvee in 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.590
 nightmare is silence of fear silence 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.709
 marred by margins this sound 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.649
 the march of the marching echoes all over the world 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:41.130
 so dictators their world is now in the iron 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.970
 fist 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.979
 man of steel probably everyone who 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.049
 at least a little familiar with superman watched 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.450
 cartoons read comics 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.580
 the sight of his power was amazed then he is capable 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.259
 he is capable of doing more 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.739
 put things in order in more than one 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.200
 the city 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:00.989
 he is able to clean up the world 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.849
 and for this man of steel was not enough 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:06.780
 only a pair of steel sorry for 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:09.060
 expression and so here lie if we 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.150
 see what happens after he 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.730
 they will get well enough to throw 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.500
 metaphor let's order quartz 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.400
 thanks to the super servants that his 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.160
 the girl is pregnant 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.260
 he is very happy but she comes here 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.790
 message and it is forced in the middle of the night 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.480
 run to another journalistic 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.790
 investigation 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.989
 and superman is happy flying to share 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.840
 news with batman 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.760
 who is like the best detective in the world 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.950
 guesses everything on secret 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.730
 investigation someone visits but from killing 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.980
 her photographer 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.090
 by found business cards near the corpse 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.200
 superman finds out that this someone is a joker 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.970
 superman asks for help 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.310
 this one engages the whole justice league 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.750
 for searching loys jointly 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.670
 they find out 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.709
 joker and harley quinn recently hijacked 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.209
 submarine and superman throws the window and he 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.390
 has time and will out catches before 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.110
 joker stupefies in gas he sees 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.299
 in front of him his worst nightmare doomsday 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.110
 wanting to save his wife he grabs him and flies 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.510
 in open space 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.700
 but it can not be doomsday because he was 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.950
 defeated by superman for sure it is someone 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.959
 another in space when the gas acts 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.209
 passes superman discovers on his 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.910
 hands dead life which he killed himself in 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.030
 this moment joker pronounces 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.599
 promising 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.079
 a riot that marks an explosion which 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:34.180
 destroys the metropolitan of millions of people 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.000
 these events change superman joker 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.849
 took away his wife his child his city a 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.829
 superman takes away his life change 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.620
 his principles because he is not a murderer 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.299
 or rather it was not before then he 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.669
 decides to clean up the world 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.160
 stop all conflicts and do it 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.079
 can only act and radically he 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.880
 wants to do better but good 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.819
 the road is lined with intentions 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.040
 not in the best of places and the first is 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.120
 understands batman between them begins 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.150
 constant you 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.799
 and later the open feud superman 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.599
 interferes in the affairs of many countries 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.389
 ordering them to end the conflict and 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.380
 overthrows leaders and rulers and heroes 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.569
 support him 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.539
 but not everything is so divided into two parts 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.760
 the superman team and the rebel batman and 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.739
 superman seems to be working properly but 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.110
 still gradually we see how he 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.599
 turns into a dictator who 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.820
 impose their system of the entire planet if 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:30.190
 kyuter gives him a miracle tablet using 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.530
 which makes an entire army of soldiers from 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.840
 ordinary people they occupy whole 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.210
 cities 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.190
 gradually superman is getting angry 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.889
 kills an arrow that tries to steal 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.280
 pill recipe the word he donated 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.410
 myself all the same did it later the plot 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.510
 intertwined semester which is rubbed into 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.330
 trust in superman and turns him on 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.590
 down this slippery slope 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.160
 comic we will see a grand battle 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.229
 the corps of green lanterns and the Batman squad 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.419
 against the superman team will see 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.610
 betrayal and change of views in it 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.460
 almost all the main characters are involved 10 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.770
 afghani the third to appear even constantine 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.979
 who wants to stop superman too 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.419
 but you can do it with magic 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.550
 if you don't know then kryptonite is not 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.680
 Superman's only weakness is magic 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.630
 that's what you need to fight against him who 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.000
 wants some magic here too 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.610
 what did you get some questions not and 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.419
 although thanks to the game the end of it all 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.669
 already known 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.780
 follow the progress anyway 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.729
 interesting view is not this arch is very 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.560
 I liked it I read all the issues 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.220
 for two days just on one 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.380
 breathing 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.120
 she is so exciting that I don't even 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.270
 noticed that in the comic very often 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.430
 Batman is changing as always 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.650
 I was openly hateful 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.840
 I didn't really like him to superman before 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.330
 Now I was burning with sincere desire 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.380
 see how he will be crushed and even heroes 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.570
 were close to that 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.979
 but semester prevented giving superman 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.660
 ring is good harley quinn she brings 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.910
 quarrel or option mayor in this grim 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.550
 the universe she weighed herself into green 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.260
 boom and befriends canary well and 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.800
 I think no one needs to explain about 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.310
 false mustache is another character who 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.630
 It made me strong feelings and he is 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.030
 feel hate and anger and 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.400
 irritation this little piece of beauty 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.740
 Ligula not only betrayed his father 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.860
 killed you can say called brother 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.750
 joined the superman is nothing but 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.660
 how dare he raise his hand on alfredo 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.850
 alfred is holy 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.310
 further flew off the coils of superman this 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.830
 not allowed himself seriously but he 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.540
 comics appear infrequently but very 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.760
 annoying at every appearance 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.700
 passes the sheep creates his plans 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.980
 superman kills mustache on the king 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.520
 who damn saved him from death a minute 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.770
 backwards 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.870
 then almost crippled alted and after 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.330
 this is sitting at the league table 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.340
 justice 10 of the discussions of the future 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.980
 planets and guys wake up 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.380
 he is 13 years old and my hirano trust choice 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.180
 the colors of your socks and you already listen to him 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.280
 in discussion with being the whole world and 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:09.300
 somebody give him a glass of milk and 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.670
 put to bed injustice 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.590
 great arch that I definitely 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.170
 I advise you to read seriously the guys 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:19.530
 read despite half 

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:21.240
 of events, I’ve already started to spoil you 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.490
 arch about how divine being 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.820
 understood what power 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.360
 and took the world its fist dictates its 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.030
 regulations 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:34.140
 such an injustice when the gods 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:36.690
 among us liked the release like 

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.000
 want to see more subscribe to 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.210
 the channel with you was a time especially for 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.980
 superheroic 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.980
 I go to fulfill it, I am saved 

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:49.860
 bearing
