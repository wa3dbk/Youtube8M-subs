00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.889
 Hi guys, I'm obsessed with the show the client list 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.830
 Raely Osse Jennifer Love Hewitt has the most beautiful hair in each episode 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.340
 I want to show you my recreation of that hairstyle 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.020
 I'm going to start adding volume to my hair to card, I like to use dry shampoo, I feel 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.140
 which is the best product that does not give weight to your hair and absorbs fat, so the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.030
 hard carding but I'm going to apply this to my roots 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.500
 I'm going to divide about 5 cm from my forehead and I'm going to comb the rest backwards 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:54.250
 I'm going to take a section of hair and I'm going to lail the roots, from behind, 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:06.960
 I bring it forward and I will do the same with the next section I will do it 3 or 4 times 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.470
 once you finish loading you're going to do everything backwards, 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.920
 and so that everything looks the same, we are going to cardar the sides also, 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.920
 I'm going to take a section of hair diagonally, apply dry shampoo and start cardar 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:29.450
 of new 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:37.180
 Once we have all carding, we will soften with a brush or comb to soften 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.730
 all 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:45.490
 We are going to start curling the hair, I'm going to start with my curling iron of an inch and a half, 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:53.549
 And of course I'll start with the section below, so I'll section the hair. 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.649
 To give it an extra fixation, I'll spray fixative lightly 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.640
 and I'll start to curl, as I'll always start in the middle of my hair and leave the ends 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.060
 out a little bit, and that will prevent your tips from burning 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:24.680
 I'll have it there for 8 seconds and then loose for this I'm going to curl it out of the face 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:47.360
 and the next one inwards so that they do not sin and form only one wave. 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.260
 Following in the last layer of hair, I want my curls to look very big and 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:06.349
 voluminozos so I'm going to change my curling iron to a 2-inch 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:16.409
 and when the curls are there I will run my fingers through them, 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.190
 and finally for the curl to last I will use my spry for a better finish, I love kendra 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:40.790
 platinum and I'll put it everywhere.
