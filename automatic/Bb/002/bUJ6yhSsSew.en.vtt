windows<00:00:52.199> movie<00:00:52.500> maker<00:00:52.530> says<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.399> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
windows movie maker says that it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.950 
windows movie maker says that it
supports<00:00:53.969> avi<00:00:54.300> files<00:00:55.579> true<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.690> uses

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
supports avi files true but it uses

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.490 
supports avi files true but it uses
separate<00:00:58.530> codex<00:00:59.120> which<00:01:00.120> read<00:01:00.870> data<00:01:01.379> from

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
separate codex which read data from

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.219 
separate codex which read data from
files<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.699> transform<00:01:03.270> them<00:01:03.390> into<00:01:03.480> video<00:01:03.899> and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
files and transform them into video and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.710 
files and transform them into video and
etc<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:06.600> uses<00:01:06.930> an<00:01:07.290> external<00:01:07.890> codec<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.720> render

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
etc it uses an external codec to render

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.280 
etc it uses an external codec to render
it<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.460> it's<00:01:11.460> hard<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.930> it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
it and so it's hard for it to do and it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.730 
it and so it's hard for it to do and it
takes<00:01:14.130> forever<00:01:15.110> especially<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.140> my<00:01:16.320> computer

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
takes forever especially on my computer

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.880 
takes forever especially on my computer
but<00:01:17.150> my<00:01:18.150> computer<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.689> slow<00:01:18.869> here's<00:01:19.650> maybe

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
but my computer is slow here's maybe

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.280 
but my computer is slow here's maybe
that's<00:01:20.220> when<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.820> deal<00:01:21.090> with<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
that's when you can deal with it but to

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.200 
that's when you can deal with it but to
speed<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.680> up<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:25.619> says<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.189> takes<00:01:26.430> avi<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
speed it up so it says that takes avi it

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.410 
speed it up so it says that takes avi it

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
pretty close to this I've only run

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.560 
pretty close to this I've only run
across<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> couple<00:01:58.290> glitches<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.509> is

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
across a couple glitches so here it is

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.050 
across a couple glitches so here it is
running<00:02:01.130> by<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.189> way<00:02:02.340> my<00:02:02.520> computer<00:02:02.969> is

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
running by the way my computer is

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.959 
running by the way my computer is
usually<00:02:03.570> not<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.229> slow<00:02:04.590> it's<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.340> taking<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
usually not this slow it's just taking a

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.160 
usually not this slow it's just taking a
really<00:02:06.540> long<00:02:06.780> time<00:02:07.079> because

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
really long time because

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.300 
really long time because
it's<00:02:10.170> not<00:02:10.680> used<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:12.800> running<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:14.040> video

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
it's not used to running a video

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.050 
it's not used to running a video
recorder<00:02:15.240> well<00:02:16.490> rang<00:02:17.490> other<00:02:17.940> programs<00:02:20.060> also

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
recorder well rang other programs also

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.710 
recorder well rang other programs also
this<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> heavy<00:02:22.050> weight<00:02:22.260> program<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.720> it

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
this is a heavy weight program and so it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.140 
this is a heavy weight program and so it
takes<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.560> while<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.920> start<00:02:26.160> up<00:02:26.280> even<00:02:26.640> when<00:02:26.820> I

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
takes a while to start up even when I

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.340 
takes a while to start up even when I
don't<00:02:27.390> have<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.960> video<00:02:28.290> recorder<00:02:28.800> running<00:02:30.350> now

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
don't have a video recorder running now

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.990 
don't have a video recorder running now
I'm<00:02:31.530> going<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.860> pause<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.280> recording<00:02:32.370> for

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
I'm going to pause the recording for

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.790 
I'm going to pause the recording for
right<00:02:33.180> now<00:02:33.210> until<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:34.230> starts<00:02:34.500> recording<00:02:36.800> okay

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
right now until it starts recording okay

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.140 
right now until it starts recording okay

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.530 
Maker and also if they're an HD and
widescreen<00:04:17.040> chances<00:04:18.040> are<00:04:18.310> your<00:04:18.850> computer<00:04:19.359> can

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
widescreen chances are your computer can

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.900
