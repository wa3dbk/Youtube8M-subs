win a faceoff right when I come into a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.509 
win a faceoff right when I come into a
draw<00:00:27.689> I'm<00:00:27.930> usually<00:00:28.109> thinking<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:29.010> pick<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> spot

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
draw I'm usually thinking I pick a spot

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.609 
draw I'm usually thinking I pick a spot
on<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.760> boards<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.869> try<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.199> win<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.439> there

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
on the boards to try and win it there

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.770 
on the boards to try and win it there
and<00:00:31.830> then<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.399> go<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.090> wonder<00:00:33.390> if<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:33.660> on

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
and then I go in and I wonder if it's on

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.450 
and then I go in and I wonder if it's on
my<00:00:33.899> forehand<00:00:34.290> or<00:00:34.440> my<00:00:34.559> backhand<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.100> prepared

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
my forehand or my backhand I prepared

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.190 
my forehand or my backhand I prepared
differently<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.239> then<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> look<00:00:36.870> at<00:00:37.020> their

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
differently and then I look at their

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.229 
differently and then I look at their
center<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.590> which<00:00:37.710> hand<00:00:37.950> he<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.160> if<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.180> know

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
center in which hand he is if I know

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.540 
center in which hand he is if I know
anything<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.809> he<00:00:40.079> does<00:00:40.290> specifically<00:00:41.160> or

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
anything that he does specifically or

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.569 
anything that he does specifically or
how<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.540> adjust<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.530> then<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.129> focus

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
how I can adjust and then I just focus

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.010 
how I can adjust and then I just focus
on<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> puck<00:00:44.940> after<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.570> wait<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
on the puck after that and wait for the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.470 
on the puck after that and wait for the
ref<00:00:46.430> on<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> stick<00:00:47.820> position

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
ref on the stick position

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450 
ref on the stick position
most<00:00:48.719> guys<00:00:48.870> traditionally<00:00:49.620> want<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.190> get<00:00:50.340> it

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
most guys traditionally want to get it

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.420 
their core muscles their stomach muscles
to<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.340> spin<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> win<00:01:36.600> faceoffs

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
to really spin and win faceoffs

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.830 
to really spin and win faceoffs
the<00:01:38.430> idea<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.119> they<00:01:39.299> get<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.600> there<00:01:39.810> they

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the idea is if they get in there they

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.170 
the idea is if they get in there they
get<00:01:40.140> low<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:40.590> get<00:01:40.799> competing<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.850> that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
get low they get competing in that

couple<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.710> different<00:01:47.040> techniques<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.790> call

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
couple of different techniques we call

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.480 
couple of different techniques we call
it<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.329> sweep<00:01:48.869> technique<00:01:49.409> or<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> drop<00:01:50.159> technique

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it a sweep technique or a drop technique

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.819 
it a sweep technique or a drop technique
stacks<00:01:51.270> will<00:01:51.420> show<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.810> sweep<00:01:52.110> where<00:01:52.500> he<00:01:52.590> puts

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
stacks will show the sweep where he puts

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.530 
stacks will show the sweep where he puts
it<00:01:52.950> around<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.369> tops<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> circle<00:01:54.299> here

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
it around the tops of the circle here

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.530 
it around the tops of the circle here
and<00:01:54.689> then<00:01:55.049> sweeps<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.860> puck<00:01:56.100> back<00:01:56.540> ok

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
and then sweeps the puck back ok

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.480 
and then sweeps the puck back ok
sweeping<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.259> back<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.740> other<00:01:58.770> one<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.250> more

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
sweeping it back the other one is more

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.940 
sweeping it back the other one is more
of<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.670> drop<00:02:00.060> technique<00:02:00.840> they<00:02:01.409> try<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> get

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
of a drop technique they try to get

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.679 
of a drop technique they try to get
their<00:02:02.159> stick<00:02:02.430> up<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.909> top<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.420> circle

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
their stick up to the top of the circle

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.750 
their stick up to the top of the circle
ok<00:02:04.439> drop<00:02:04.740> their<00:02:04.979> stick<00:02:05.280> down

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
ok drop their stick down

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.540 
ok drop their stick down
and<00:02:05.850> then<00:02:06.060> pull<00:02:06.420> ok<00:02:07.140> hard<00:02:07.470> back<00:02:07.800> on<00:02:08.040> on<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
and then pull ok hard back on on the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.060 
and then pull ok hard back on on the
puck<00:02:08.760> like<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.630> drawing<00:02:10.260> it<00:02:10.470> straight<00:02:10.830> back

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
puck like that drawing it straight back

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.790 
puck like that drawing it straight back
ok<00:02:11.700> between<00:02:11.910> their<00:02:12.300> legs<00:02:12.480> we'll<00:02:13.440> show<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.650> a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
ok between their legs we'll show you a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.280 
ok between their legs we'll show you a
couple<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.160> forehand<00:02:14.670> techniques<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:16.110> he

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
couple of forehand techniques that he

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.890 
couple of forehand techniques that he
uses<00:02:16.680> on<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.040> side<00:02:17.310> ok<00:02:17.970> if<00:02:18.180> he<00:02:18.360> wants<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.750> go

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
uses on this side ok if he wants to go

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.780 
uses on this side ok if he wants to go
forehand<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> first<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.460> will<00:02:20.640> be<00:02:20.670> a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
forehand so the first one will be a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.470 
forehand so the first one will be a
sweep<00:02:21.470> there<00:02:22.470> ok<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.520> now<00:02:23.880> I'll<00:02:24.030> show<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.300> a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
sweep there ok and now I'll show you a

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.840 
sweep there ok and now I'll show you a
drop<00:02:24.870> ok<00:02:25.560> where<00:02:25.770> he'll<00:02:25.950> just<00:02:26.160> come<00:02:26.370> down<00:02:26.610> on

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
drop ok where he'll just come down on

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.240 
drop ok where he'll just come down on
top<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.600> drop<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.470> stick<00:02:28.710> down<00:02:28.920> and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
top of it and drop the stick down and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.370 
top of it and drop the stick down and
hopefully<00:02:29.430> win<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.910> right<00:02:30.090> back<00:02:30.390> ok<00:02:31.050> straight

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
hopefully win it right back ok straight

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.910 
hopefully win it right back ok straight
through<00:02:31.590> his<00:02:31.710> legs<00:02:31.980> ok<00:02:32.400> here<00:02:32.820> we<00:02:32.940> go

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
through his legs ok here we go

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.260 
through his legs ok here we go
third<00:02:34.920> technique<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.550> we<00:02:35.700> want<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.000> show<00:02:36.210> you

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
third technique that we want to show you

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.300 
third technique that we want to show you
the<00:02:36.750> tie<00:02:36.990> up<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.010> kick

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the tie up and the and the kick

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.000 
the tie up and the and the kick
technique<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.360> idea<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:39.810> Goro<00:02:40.530> wants<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
technique the idea is that Goro wants to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.610 
technique the idea is that Goro wants to
take<00:02:41.250> his<00:02:41.460> stick<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.030> then<00:02:42.390> spin<00:02:42.810> his<00:02:42.960> body<00:02:43.260> in

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
take his stick and then spin his body in

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.550 
take his stick and then spin his body in
collect<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.430> puck<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.880> use<00:02:45.090> his<00:02:45.300> feet<00:02:45.600> just

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
collect the puck and use his feet just

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.770 
collect the puck and use his feet just
like<00:02:46.710> a<00:02:46.740> soccer<00:02:47.130> player<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:48.210> kick<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.570> back

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780
