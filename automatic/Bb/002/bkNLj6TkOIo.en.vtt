00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 temps and as you can see it's flying 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.840
 hello youtube friends today I bring you a 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.840
 new mode and then nothing friends let's start 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.240
 very much 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.750
 of so many up to elena load him 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.750
 I asked 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.480
 good friends were I bring you a new 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.789
 mode this time they have updated what 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.820
 would be the tumban items for the version of 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.469
 minecraft 0.11 point of x and then in 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.120
 this case again is going to be what it would be 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.309
 as a complement for what would be 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.140
 minecraft pocket edition or to be able 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.120
 activate what would be the complement then 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.820
 first they have to install what would be 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.070
 He sins after leaving here where he says 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.470
 blog launcher options and they should 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.300
 activate what it would be to administer 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.430
 add-ons as you can see there is 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.320
 activated and there we will have 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.970
 activated what the module would be like 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.369
 you can see in the bottom part we have 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.589
 and what would be the buttons of the my 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:05.570
 as you can see we press it and no longer 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.210
 we have what it would be then the inventory 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.000
 completely like pc and then there 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.650
 is how can you see that already thanks 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.840
 to what would be then the update of 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.590
 minecraft as it expanded a bit 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.869
 what it would be then is in this way and as 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.130
 can see it is practically 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.649
 identical to what the version would be 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.720
 previous that was for the 0.10 point 5 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.159
 no but then this time I add 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.770
 what would this be 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.539
 button that is the effects and how can 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.630
 see so here are all the effects of 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:38.509
 positions so that we can put it and 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.929
 let's get the jump to the maximum and 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.299
 we have to put that later now 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.909
 that also last to the maximum we are not going to 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.270
 get out of here that is but how can 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.549
 see it active and police as if 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.439
 I was turned not know why this 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.170
 of speed I did not put what would be the 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.049
 of jumping we are going to put like this to see 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.360
 how it looks and how can you see it as 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.219
 he turns around he can not stand it I do not know why and 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.860
 let's put a bucket here 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.379
 of milk to test what it would be then and 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.910
 let's be at once and also like 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.540
 you can see then add what would be 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.400
 because all of the mods that we have in 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.019
 installed in this case here I have the 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.299
 the horses that he just made a 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.859
 review a few hours ago and then 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.989
 with this one we are going to be able to take out what 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.730
 would be for the spaces not her that 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.700
 enough people were asking me 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.489
 how it was taken out and then there it is we're not going 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.470
 let's see let's take that effect there 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.760
 It is already the effect takes me and now I 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.620
 let's put ourselves then 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.620
 to the tone that would be one of the most 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.379
 we like jump we are going to put everything 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.819
 cap and we are going to give in apply effect and 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.459
 let's leave what would be the take 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.500
 items and as you can see is flying 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.079
 part of a jump to get to what I had 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.599
 put the heights and then we are going to die 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.730
 of what the fall would be do not see if 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.620
 it serves quite well what would be ham 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.530
 we die and a while ago it does not provide and without 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.659
 die what would be the fall and is 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.000
 pretty good as you can see it is the 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:09.720
 new update of your little hand 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.330
 for the minecraft version 0.11 point 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.190
 xy well there they are as I was saying 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.860
 is everything to the hundred everything compatible is not 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.930
