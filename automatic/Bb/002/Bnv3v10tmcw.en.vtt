power all day long look at him eating it
up<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.509> basically<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> way<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.650> was<00:01:25.799> thinking

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
up so basically the way I was thinking

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.350 
up so basically the way I was thinking
is<00:01:26.189> he'll<00:01:26.460> get<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> boost<00:01:26.880> from<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
is he'll get the boost from the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.210 
is he'll get the boost from the
superpower<00:01:27.780> thickness<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.439> bar<00:01:28.710> they'll<00:01:29.100> get

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
superpower thickness of bar they'll get

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.190 
superpower thickness of bar they'll get
the<00:01:29.310> boosts<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.759> then<00:01:30.090> transform<00:01:30.630> into<00:01:30.900> him

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the boosts I then transform into him

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.740 
the boosts I then transform into him
take<00:01:31.680> those<00:01:31.950> boosts<00:01:32.490> I'll<00:01:32.880> eat<00:01:33.150> up<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.540> night

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
take those boosts I'll eat up one night

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.600 
take those boosts I'll eat up one night
/<00:01:34.020> because<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.380> did<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> calcs<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.189> night<00:01:35.369> /

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
/ because I did the calcs like night /

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.920

forty percent if I'm up last one defense

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.700

because it's neutral overall cuz he's a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.170

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
because if he had my sash would have

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.259 
because if he had my sash would have
been<00:02:47.799> intact<00:02:48.099> I<00:02:48.370> could<00:02:48.700> have<00:02:48.790> gone<00:02:48.909> from<00:02:49.060> you

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
nastyplot and then agility and then I

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:52.709 
nastyplot and then agility and then I
could<00:02:51.639> have<00:02:52.000> him<00:02:52.150> up<00:02:52.209> but

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:52.719 
could have him up but

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.420 
could have him up but
unfortunately<00:02:53.019> I<00:02:53.590> didn't<00:02:53.829> get<00:02:53.889> to<00:02:54.010> do<00:02:54.099> that<00:02:54.219> he

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
unfortunately I didn't get to do that he

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.740 
unfortunately I didn't get to do that he

gonna switch out I'm not interested in

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.699 
gonna switch out I'm not interested in
being<00:02:57.549> in<00:02:57.790> there<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.389> I<00:02:58.449> go<00:02:58.599> into<00:02:58.810> reichel<00:02:59.319> now

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
being in there and I go into reichel now

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.170 
being in there and I go into reichel now
the<00:02:59.769> reason<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.069> went<00:03:00.189> into<00:03:00.310> raikou<00:03:00.639> is<00:03:00.819> that<00:03:01.060> if

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
the reason I went into raikou is that if

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.759 
the reason I went into raikou is that if
he<00:03:01.299> switched<00:03:01.629> I<00:03:01.810> can<00:03:01.989> always<00:03:02.079> bolts<00:03:02.409> which<00:03:02.560> out

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
he switched I can always bolts which out

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.500 
he switched I can always bolts which out
and<00:03:03.040> have<00:03:03.340> switched<00:03:03.579> priority<00:03:03.969> and<00:03:04.239> if<00:03:04.419> he

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
and have switched priority and if he

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.879 
and have switched priority and if he
switched<00:03:04.780> there's<00:03:05.049> quite<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> lot<00:03:05.439> on<00:03:05.590> his<00:03:05.709> team

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
switched there's quite a lot on his team

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.119 
switched there's quite a lot on his team
which<00:03:06.040> is<00:03:06.189> threatened<00:03:06.579> by<00:03:06.609> reichel<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:08.129> was

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
which is threatened by reichel so I was

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.229 
which is threatened by reichel so I was
hoping<00:03:09.250> he'd<00:03:09.549> switch<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:09.939> he<00:03:10.000> ends<00:03:10.180> up

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
hoping he'd switch and he ends up

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.459 
hoping he'd switch and he ends up
switching<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.780> was<00:03:10.870> quite<00:03:10.930> happy<00:03:11.049> with<00:03:11.260> that

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:11.469 
switching so I was quite happy with that

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.349 
switching so I was quite happy with that
but<00:03:11.980> even<00:03:12.159> if<00:03:12.280> he'd<00:03:12.430> stayed<00:03:12.639> in<00:03:12.819> rifle<00:03:13.090> could

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
but even if he'd stayed in rifle could

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.759 
but even if he'd stayed in rifle could

wouldn't maybe he'd have died if he had
it<00:05:34.590> in<00:05:34.710> burn<00:05:34.890> so<00:05:35.430> maybe<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.700> bone<00:05:35.820> added<00:05:36.240> a

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
it in burn so maybe the bone added a

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.670 
it in burn so maybe the bone added a
little<00:05:36.450> bit<00:05:36.660> for<00:05:36.780> that<00:05:36.810> play<00:05:37.110> out<00:05:37.140> of<00:05:37.440> switched

crunch<00:05:54.960> here<00:05:55.200> especially<00:05:55.590> with<00:05:55.950> that<00:05:55.979> chance

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
crunch here especially with that chance

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.890 
crunch here especially with that chance
of<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.550> defense<00:05:56.850> drop<00:05:57.090> it<00:05:57.419> really<00:05:57.750> could<00:05:57.870> have

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
of the defense drop it really could have

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.750 
of the defense drop it really could have
been<00:05:58.050> bad<00:05:58.200> for<00:05:58.260> me<00:05:58.560> so<00:05:59.070> I<00:05:59.100> decided<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.580> let

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
been bad for me so I decided to let

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.700 
been bad for me so I decided to let
arcanine<00:06:00.180> kill<00:06:00.419> slowbro<00:06:00.870> which<00:06:01.290> is<00:06:01.440> going<00:06:01.620> to

arcanine kill slowbro which is going to

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.730 
arcanine kill slowbro which is going to

to give the exact spread but i do live
this<00:06:28.229> extreme<00:06:28.710> speed<00:06:28.979> so<00:06:29.190> maybe<00:06:29.400> you<00:06:29.550> can

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
this extreme speed so maybe you can

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.730 
this extreme speed so maybe you can
guess<00:06:30.030> what<00:06:30.570> my<00:06:30.690> spread<00:06:30.960> is<00:06:31.110> anywhere<00:06:31.650> i<00:06:31.710> go

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
guess what my spread is anywhere i go

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.350 
guess what my spread is anywhere i go
over<00:06:31.860> the<00:06:32.039> earthquake<00:06:32.550> and<00:06:32.760> I'm

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
over the earthquake and I'm

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.659 
over the earthquake and I'm
this<00:06:33.599> after<00:06:33.840> nine<00:06:33.960> hours<00:06:34.169> so<00:06:34.919> I<00:06:35.310> was<00:06:35.550> quite

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
this after nine hours so I was quite

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:37.909 
this after nine hours so I was quite
happy<00:06:35.699> with<00:06:36.000> my<00:06:36.180> situation<00:06:36.240> here<00:06:36.960> I<00:06:37.139> think<00:06:37.710> I'm

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
happy with my situation here I think I'm

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.510 
happy with my situation here I think I'm
42<00:06:38.819> up<00:06:39.599> I<00:06:40.530> really<00:06:41.009> wasn't<00:06:41.159> worried<00:06:41.490> about

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
42 up I really wasn't worried about

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.129 
42 up I really wasn't worried about
losing<00:06:41.789> this<00:06:41.969> battle<00:06:42.120> at<00:06:42.270> this<00:06:42.389> point<00:06:42.599> snacker

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
losing this battle at this point snacker

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.330 
losing this battle at this point snacker
