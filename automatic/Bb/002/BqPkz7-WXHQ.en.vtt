00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.710 
about that and I thought I thought the
reference<00:04:02.260> i<00:04:02.350> was<00:04:02.470> making<00:04:02.710> was<00:04:02.800> obvious<00:04:03.690> but<00:04:04.690> i

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
reference i was making was obvious but i

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.120 
reference i was making was obvious but i
guess<00:04:04.960> if<00:04:05.140> you<00:04:05.230> haven't<00:04:05.530> seen<00:04:05.680> shawshank

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
guess if you haven't seen shawshank

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.470 
guess if you haven't seen shawshank
redemption<00:04:06.670> that<00:04:06.820> I<00:04:06.910> guess<00:04:07.090> it<00:04:07.210> doesn't<00:04:07.360> make

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
redemption that I guess it doesn't make

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.680 
redemption that I guess it doesn't make
sense<00:04:07.540> to<00:04:07.810> you<00:04:07.930> but<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.710> prison<00:04:09.160> library<00:04:09.690> so

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
sense to you but the prison library so

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.020 
sense to you but the prison library so
Shawshank<00:04:11.500> Redemption<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:12.100> guy<00:04:12.610> get<00:04:12.790> sent<00:04:12.970> to

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.630 
Shawshank Redemption a guy get sent to
prison<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:14.500> he<00:04:14.620> wants<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:14.890> get<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.040> library<00:04:15.220> for
