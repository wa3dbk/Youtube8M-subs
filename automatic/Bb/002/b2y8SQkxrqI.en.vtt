00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.750 
to a start
never<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.360> four-wheeler<00:02:10.869> started<00:02:11.550> I'll<00:02:12.550> show

starter<00:02:25.690> kit<00:02:27.030> then<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.360> that's<00:02:28.630> pretty<00:02:29.110> much

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
starter kit then so that's pretty much
