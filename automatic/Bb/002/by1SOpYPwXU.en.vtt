work tomorrow next week next year you
know<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.400> Queens<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:24.029> like<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.390> say<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.779> we

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
know it Queens we like to say that we

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.500 
know it Queens we like to say that we
have<00:00:25.050> academic<00:00:25.680> excellence<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.510> exceptional

have academic excellence and exceptional

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.750 
have academic excellence and exceptional
experience<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> question<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.980> guess<00:00:29.220> here

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
experience so the question I guess here

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.370 
experience so the question I guess here
is<00:00:29.789> what's<00:00:30.300> different<00:00:30.720> about<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.050> student

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
is what's different about the student

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.810 
is what's different about the student
experience<00:00:31.470> well<00:00:32.340> there<00:00:32.489> are<00:00:32.520> really<00:00:32.700> three

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
experience well there are really three

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.490 
experience well there are really three
things<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.660> make<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> Cornell<00:00:34.260> Queens

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
and probably most obvious the candidates

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.090
