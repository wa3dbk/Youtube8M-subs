thing<00:01:17.179> we're<00:01:17.299> going<00:01:17.479> to<00:01:17.569> do<00:01:17.840> is<00:01:18.170> install<00:01:18.770> one

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
thing we're going to do is install one

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.389 
thing we're going to do is install one
of<00:01:19.429> these<00:01:19.670> clamps<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:20.479> screws<00:01:20.810> on<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:22.069> center

of these clamps and screws on the center

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.789 
of these clamps and screws on the center
only<00:01:22.819> so<00:01:23.420> we've<00:01:23.599> installed<00:01:23.959> this<00:01:24.229> partially

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
only so we've installed this partially

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.669 
only so we've installed this partially
with<00:01:25.429> the<00:01:25.670> claw<00:01:26.119> of<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.779> clamp<00:01:27.079> facing

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
with the claw of the clamp facing

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.099 
with the claw of the clamp facing
upwards<00:01:28.099> turn<00:01:28.849> it<00:01:28.999> around<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:29.389> way<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:29.959> can

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
upwards turn it around this way you can

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:31.959 
upwards turn it around this way you can
see<00:01:30.319> that<00:01:30.469> this<00:01:30.649> faces<00:01:31.099> upwards<00:01:31.459> it's<00:01:31.700> going

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
see that this faces upwards it's going

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:34.929 
see that this faces upwards it's going
to<00:01:32.090> grip<00:01:32.359> the<00:01:32.659> underside<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:34.009> tip<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.520> the

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
to grip the underside of the tip of the

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.029 
to grip the underside of the tip of the
fender<00:01:35.299> and<00:01:35.509> then<00:01:35.990> we're<00:01:36.169> going<00:01:36.319> to<00:01:36.439> take<00:01:36.649> the

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
fender and then we're going to take the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.569 
fender and then we're going to take the
t25<00:01:38.139> Torx<00:01:39.139> driver<00:01:39.229> and<00:01:39.979> screw<00:01:40.249> it<00:01:40.429> down

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
t25 Torx driver and screw it down

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.419 
t25 Torx driver and screw it down
partially<00:01:41.419> so<00:01:41.869> that<00:01:42.109> the<00:01:42.649> clamp<00:01:42.950> still<00:01:43.249> has

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
partially so that the clamp still has

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.050 
partially so that the clamp still has
some<00:01:43.639> freedom<00:01:43.939> to<00:01:44.060> move<00:01:44.179> on<00:01:44.359> the<00:01:44.450> inside<00:01:46.060> now

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
some freedom to move on the inside now

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.099 
some freedom to move on the inside now
you're<00:01:47.389> going<00:01:47.509> to<00:01:47.569> feel<00:01:47.689> some<00:01:47.929> resistance

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
you're going to feel some resistance

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.559 
you're going to feel some resistance
when<00:01:48.799> you<00:01:48.950> install<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.369> screw<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:49.999> reason<00:01:50.389> is

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
when you install a screw the reason is

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.839 
when you install a screw the reason is
that<00:01:50.599> there<00:01:51.049> is<00:01:51.229> this<00:01:51.409> black<00:01:51.770> nylon<00:01:52.069> insert

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:52.849 
that there is this black nylon insert

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.620 
that there is this black nylon insert
that's<00:01:53.329> a<00:01:53.599> capturing<00:01:54.469> detail<00:01:55.189> to<00:01:55.909> assure<00:01:56.389> that

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
that's a capturing detail to assure that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.359 
that's a capturing detail to assure that
it<00:01:56.749> does<00:01:56.929> not<00:01:57.079> back<00:01:57.409> out<00:01:57.709> after<00:01:57.979> it's<00:01:58.249> been

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
it does not back out after it's been

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.549 
it does not back out after it's been
installed<00:01:59.349> so<00:02:00.349> you'll<00:02:00.499> have<00:02:00.619> to<00:02:01.209> put<00:02:02.209> some

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:02.559 
installed so you'll have to put some

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:06.099 
installed so you'll have to put some
some<00:02:03.559> force<00:02:03.829> behind<00:02:04.099> the<00:02:04.659> twisting<00:02:05.659> action<00:02:05.809> of

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
some force behind the twisting action of

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:07.630 
some force behind the twisting action of
your<00:02:06.259> driver<00:02:06.529> in<00:02:07.249> order

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
your driver in order

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.730 
your driver in order
past<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.149> but<00:02:08.360> once<00:02:08.569> it's<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:08.899> once<00:02:09.350> it<00:02:09.560> is

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
past that but once it's a once it is

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.910 
past that but once it's a once it is
fully<00:02:10.190> seated<00:02:10.490> it<00:02:10.819> will<00:02:10.940> stay<00:02:11.240> long<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:11.959> the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
fully seated it will stay long so the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.410 
fully seated it will stay long so the
first<00:02:13.100> thing<00:02:13.310> we're<00:02:13.430> going<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.730> do<00:02:13.880> then<00:02:14.090> is

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
first thing we're going to do then is

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.270 
first thing we're going to do then is
position<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.370> in<00:02:16.370> place<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:18.440> can<00:02:18.560> see<00:02:18.709> that

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
position it in place so you can see that

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.480 
position it in place so you can see that
the<00:02:19.700> side<00:02:20.060> ears<00:02:22.060> will<00:02:23.060> fit<00:02:23.330> into<00:02:23.569> this<00:02:24.490> detail

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
the side ears will fit into this detail

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.020 
the side ears will fit into this detail
on<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:27.140> side<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.860> existing<00:02:28.400> fender<00:02:28.790> and

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
on the side of the existing fender and

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.740 
on the side of the existing fender and
right<00:02:29.840> now<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.700> can<00:02:31.700> see<00:02:31.940> this<00:02:32.120> moving<00:02:32.360> up<00:02:32.600> and

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
right now I can see this moving up and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.199 
right now I can see this moving up and
down<00:02:33.640> we<00:02:34.640> want<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.239> be<00:02:35.390> fully<00:02:35.720> seated

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
down we want it to be fully seated

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.390 
down we want it to be fully seated
making<00:02:38.209> contact<00:02:38.720> with<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.050> underside<00:02:39.830> of<00:02:40.190> the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
making contact with the underside of the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.300 
making contact with the underside of the
tip<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.850> fender<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.890> then<00:02:42.890> we're<00:02:43.100> going

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
tip of the fender and then we're going

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.550 
tip of the fender and then we're going
to<00:02:45.250> turn<00:02:46.250> this<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:46.880> I've<00:02:47.660> installed<00:02:48.230> this

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
to turn this so I've installed this

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.680 
to turn this so I've installed this
tight<00:02:48.890> enough<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.910> stays<00:02:50.209> in<00:02:50.239> place

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
tight enough so that it stays in place

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.580 
tight enough so that it stays in place
the<00:02:51.470> sides<00:02:51.769> are<00:02:51.980> still<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.250> little<00:02:52.400> floppy<00:02:53.590> now

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
the sides are still a little floppy now

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.800 
the sides are still a little floppy now
I'm<00:02:54.739> going<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.040> take<00:02:55.250> another<00:02:56.150> screw<00:02:56.540> and

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
I'm going to take another screw and

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.370 
I'm going to take another screw and
clamp<00:02:57.080> this<00:02:58.070> is<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.370> clamp<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.820> will<00:02:59.380> grip

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
clamp this is the clamp that will grip

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.259 
clamp this is the clamp that will grip
the<00:03:00.530> underside<00:03:00.950> of<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.190> fender<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:01.970> see

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
the underside of the fender and you see

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.780 
the underside of the fender and you see
that<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.690> claw<00:03:03.170> portion<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.160> facing

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
that the claw portion of it is facing

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.479 
that the claw portion of it is facing
outwards<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:05.540> facing<00:03:05.989> up<00:03:06.280> there<00:03:07.280> is<00:03:07.459> a

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
outwards and facing up there is a

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.550 
outwards and facing up there is a
locating<00:03:08.330> feature<00:03:09.290> on<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.769> underside<00:03:10.220> that

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
locating feature on the underside that

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.890 
locating feature on the underside that
will<00:03:12.560> allow<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.489> be<00:03:13.700> oriented<00:03:14.180> upward<00:03:14.630> so

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
will allow it to be oriented upward so

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.560 
will allow it to be oriented upward so
we<00:03:15.049> want<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.380> grab<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.829> underside<00:03:16.820> of<00:03:17.209> the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
we want to grab the underside of the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.069 
we want to grab the underside of the
meat<00:03:17.780> of<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.019> material<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.700> I'll<00:03:20.570> start<00:03:20.900> the

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
meat of the material and I'll start the

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.960 
meat of the material and I'll start the
screw<00:03:21.320> with<00:03:21.470> my<00:03:21.620> fingers<00:03:21.950> now<00:03:22.130> you<00:03:22.579> notice

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
screw with my fingers now you notice

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.979 
screw with my fingers now you notice
that<00:03:23.000> we<00:03:23.360> have<00:03:23.600> great<00:03:24.350> lines<00:03:24.650> in<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.070> way<00:03:25.989> so

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
that we have great lines in the way so

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.699 
that we have great lines in the way so
is<00:03:27.140> one<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.320> these<00:03:27.500> necessary<00:03:28.280> compromises<00:03:28.730> to

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
is one of these necessary compromises to

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.710 
is one of these necessary compromises to
locate<00:03:30.709> it<00:03:30.860> here<00:03:30.910> just<00:03:31.910> so<00:03:32.239> we<00:03:32.269> could<00:03:32.540> take

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
locate it here just so we could take

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.620 
locate it here just so we could take
advantage<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:33.500> this<00:03:34.630> crescent-shaped

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
advantage of this crescent-shaped

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.490 
advantage of this crescent-shaped
feature<00:03:36.140> on<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.650> fender<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:38.060> allow<00:03:38.989> a<00:03:39.290> nice

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
feature on the fender to allow a nice

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.850 
feature on the fender to allow a nice
clean<00:03:39.860> fit<00:03:40.540> now<00:03:41.540> it's<00:03:41.959> gone<00:03:42.230> through<00:03:42.530> that

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
clean fit now it's gone through that

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.259 
clean fit now it's gone through that
nylon<00:03:43.900> capturing<00:03:44.900> feature<00:03:45.910> so<00:03:46.910> there's<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.150> bit

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
nylon capturing feature so there's a bit

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.289 
nylon capturing feature so there's a bit
of<00:03:47.360> resistance<00:03:47.720> felt<00:03:48.260> in<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.680> driver<00:03:49.120> but<00:03:50.120> now

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
of resistance felt in the driver but now

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.979 
of resistance felt in the driver but now
it's<00:03:50.570> it's<00:03:51.019> nice<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:51.560> tight<00:03:51.739> up<00:03:51.769> against<00:03:52.280> that

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
it's it's nice and tight up against that

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.819 
it's it's nice and tight up against that
now<00:03:53.989> we<00:03:54.049> go<00:03:54.290> back<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:55.670> tighten<00:03:56.299> this<00:03:56.829> fully

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
now we go back and tighten this fully

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.530 
now we go back and tighten this fully
and<00:03:59.110> go<00:04:00.110> around<00:04:00.500> again<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:01.250> retighten<00:04:02.030> all<00:04:02.269> of

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
and go around again to retighten all of

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.349 
and go around again to retighten all of
three<00:04:03.049> of<00:04:03.170> them<00:04:03.320> to<00:04:03.530> make<00:04:03.680> sure<00:04:03.739> it<00:04:04.220> says<00:04:04.519> firm

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
three of them to make sure it says firm

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.010 
three of them to make sure it says firm
as<00:04:05.570> possible<00:04:06.109> and<00:04:06.320> then<00:04:06.560> we're<00:04:06.709> finished
