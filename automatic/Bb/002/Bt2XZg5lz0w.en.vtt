00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.680
 Y 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.910
 and what translates to cost you is because 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.530
 It is fine today here 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.480
 Welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.070
 trànsit are visions tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.689
 teach a tutorial that I have been asked 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.970
 I'm going to show you how to build and 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.580
 how to use it jett with the special weapon of 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.829
 trànsit zombies we have to build it 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.570
 and it has some as well as tricks and 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.759
 it's like they add up so I'll try to 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.190
 make it clear how this works 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.320
 weapon and how to build it so we're going to 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.989
 start with the parts that we have to 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.030
 get the first part which is the 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.190
 turbine located in the tunnel can 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.630
 be in this area and along this 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.760
 hall where is the good a little step 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.920
 where is the m16 here does not seem to me 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.810
 but if it does not appear there disappears 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.030
 in another area next to the puddle the water 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.530
 with a that in a corner in behind 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.790
 a white car if I'm not wrong here 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.800
 is that part 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.840
 this is the turbine in zinc and for 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.760
 build it we have to go to the town in 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.710
 the bar there is the construction table 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.150
 where tv where are we going to build the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.210
 batter with remember that this is in the 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.350
 town where it says bar where is the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.670
 pool table and all that so 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.610
 we build the first part and 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.470
 we continue with the second the next 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.600
 part is in what the 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.200
 people call the cabin the cabin not 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.350
 he 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.850
 in this part the town is leaving 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.770
 we have to go finishing up so that they 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.869
 I recommend carrying a jumbo wing iphone 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.039
 is about a few eyes of fact in this 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.420
 part is where you get the bobby 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.979
 knight to get to it we have to 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.049
 follow the village and follow this path 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.700
 I will teach them completely good 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.590
 will teach them all the way so that 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.030
 is located where is this have to 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.890
 go practically like that everything 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.450
 right they go a little bit to the left 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.560
 that is, it is not like a path 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.090
 different but they go a little bit to the 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.590
 left they will see fire there is the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.390
 fire and when they see the fire they go to 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.619
 enter here to what would be the cabin the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.479
 booth whatever it is already the bobby 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.159
 knight and the part then appear here 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.539
 where he appeared to me at this table or 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.890
 can you appear in the fireplace I think 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.539
 that there is another location but it is not very 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.950
 hard to find what this part is the 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.780
 meter so good we're going to 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.270
 build it and we continue with the third 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.520
 part the next part gentlemen will 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.200
 find in what many people call 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.289
 lactar untoten is a construction that 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.819
 has a similar design to get there 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.530
 this part is something similar to getting to 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.450
 the tower of lis térek we have to leave 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.670
 of the farm and the all right we're going to 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.069
 see the cornfield out there we cross that river 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.019
 of lava that is broken pass we stick 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.250
 to the cornfield and let's see the green lamp 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.230
 when we see the green screen means 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.890
 that is the entrance right next to 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.450
 of the lamp 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.770
 is where is the entrance then they 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.270
 I'm going to teach the way they have to 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.770
 continue to get to swim a tote is not 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.780
 very difficult but you can still 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.880
 confuse they have to enter here to the side 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.170
 of the green lamp come in and when 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.490
 they can turn to the left as the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.500
 bank that can not turn other side 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.670
 it gives death to the left and a 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.620
 moment in which the right they will see 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.270
 like a corridor I say a very 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.459
 narrow and very small that is this 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.380
 different size and once they cross 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.630
 this path will reach nac de nut 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.610
 tm and where is the third part 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.170
 of the jet with the part that we are 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.610
 looking is whatever the handle them 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.130
 can come out in this part above as 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.630
 that these boxes can come out 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.520
 here where it appeared to me that it would be 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.989
 down good down like this thing 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.459
 just exactly where are the 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.900
 stairs and I think there's another 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.970
 location but I could not tell you 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.220
 exactly where it is but according to me it is 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.200
 like that on this side near here or 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.489
 Maybe this is not so hard 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.650
 to find it so once 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.019
 let's have that part, let's build it 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.280
 to go through the last part the last 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.900
 part that the cables would be 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.000
 find in this area where you turn on the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.680
 electricity can tell them to appear is 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.350
 in three places he appeared to me here 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.299
 just like to play on the verge of 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.739
 fall to the lava another location les 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.340
 it may seem here right where it is like 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.500
 that this one 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.269
 of electricity or something like that or I can 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.920
 look over this barrel so 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.690
 once we have look we are going to 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.250
 build them to finish the jet with 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.629
 once we have the jet with when 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.800
 we will grab it will occupy a space in 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.390
 our inventory so if you have a 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.160
 fan a shield or something like that is going to 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.080
 occupy their space and they will have to leave 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.000
 that yesterday gone is a weapon somewhat 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.769
 special not my favorite to make them 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.590
 sincere the german has a meter the 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.060
 which one is going up according to the time 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.280
 using this meter it could be like 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.319
 that is hot and between you 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.000
 this I say the jet with as well as that 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.380
 followed this meter will move forward and if 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.599
 the last point comes the jet bomb to 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.340
 destroy itself and it will be divided into parts 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.349
 these parts are going to want to be that where 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.030
 it was destroyed and you can grab them and 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.530
 Rebuild them then as 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.760
 you can use it and if it's going to 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.040
 be destroying every time you use it 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.169
 well the german has to be used in 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.910
 bursts like this is not highly recommended 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.769
 be firing as well as everyone 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.270
 followed but to be like that little to 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.340
 little shooting as well as I have 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.010
 the zombie ball back shot little me 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.960
 I move away after I shoot again a little 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.479
 and I walk away because I do this because good 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.550
 the jet as it can be cooled is this 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.380
 weapon can get to cool it takes a lot 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.790
 time and you have to have it outside use 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.710
 for example I use it 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.540
 and reaches the red point without reaching 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.550
 destroy yourself then I have to have it 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.380
 outside and if I do not have the meter outside 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.030
 or start going down to go down and going to 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.710
 start to cool down once you're 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.140
 cold again you can use it again 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.630
 this weapon gentlemen is not highly recommended 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.610
 use against big zombie balls 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.620
 because because besides that if you 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.970
 you want to destroy give kill kill 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.950
 the whole zombie ball can not be 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.590
 like you have to be little by little 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.210
 about five or six zombies for 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.670
 shot so to speak as if by 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.170
 burst per section and if you want to kill 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.480
 to all the zombies like that from a milestone 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.400
 more or you can not because because if the 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.660
 When it arrives it gets destroyed in that 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.360
 I practically had to get to 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.830
 be destroyed so that its effectiveness is 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.290
 complete and be able to destroy and kill all 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.780
 the zombie ball as the grass when 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.340
 then explodes hurts you if if 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.830
 the zombies when they are approaching you 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.360
 the jet with you get hurt because you do not get 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.610
 you can move with your baglietto nobody you 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.900
 moves alone is like walking alone towards 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.370
 forward then another can be for 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.050
 back and if you want to kill all the 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.670
 zombies you start to kill them but 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.860
 they start to surround you, they hurt you a lot 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.020
 blankets you almost explodes and you die 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.790
 then the jet does not need like a 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.310
 tomorrow gentlemen is useful but it is not my 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.170
 favorite 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.970
 I think they were made for interest 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.290
 but then nothing that 's all sir 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.270
 I remember that the arrive can cool down 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.100
 but they have to have it outside without 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.630
 used so I do not expect anything to be 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.950
 does this tutorial gentlemen take care 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.150
 See you later remember 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.310
 leave me in the comments if they have 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.510
 some tutorial of something else to see 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.510
 gentlemen see you later
