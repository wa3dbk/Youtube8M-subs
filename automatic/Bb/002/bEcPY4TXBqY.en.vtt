00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
is one of the accident I think the weak

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.380 
is one of the accident I think the weak
points<00:05:07.050> about<00:05:07.440> dapper<00:05:07.920> comm<00:05:08.340> is<00:05:08.520> that<00:05:08.970> some<00:05:09.240> of

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
points about dapper comm is that some of

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.540 
points about dapper comm is that some of
these<00:05:09.480> a<00:05:09.540> lot<00:05:09.870> of<00:05:09.990> overlap<00:05:10.590> so<00:05:11.130> if<00:05:11.280> you<00:05:11.400> go

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
these a lot of overlap so if you go

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.520 
these a lot of overlap so if you go
through<00:05:11.790> one<00:05:12.210> category<00:05:12.900> you're<00:05:13.140> gonna<00:05:13.260> see
