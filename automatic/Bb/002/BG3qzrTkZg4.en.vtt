00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
can simply take out the support ring as

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.120 
can simply take out the support ring as
you<00:01:08.000> can<00:01:08.180> see<00:01:08.420> there's<00:01:09.080> a<00:01:09.200> rock<00:01:09.470> inside<00:01:09.890> of<00:01:10.070> the

you can see there's a rock inside of the
valve<00:01:10.340> this<00:01:10.880> is<00:01:11.030> what<00:01:11.210> was<00:01:11.299> causing<00:01:11.539> our

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
valve this is what was causing our

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.960 
valve this is what was causing our
valves<00:01:12.229> is<00:01:12.350> continuously<00:01:12.950> water<00:01:13.250> what<00:01:13.850> we

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
valves is continuously water what we

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.450 
valves is continuously water what we
need<00:01:14.119> to<00:01:14.240> do<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:14.600> get<00:01:14.750> that<00:01:14.990> rock<00:01:15.289> out<00:01:15.530> an<00:01:15.860> easy

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
need to do is get that rock out an easy

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.219 
need to do is get that rock out an easy
way<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.670> do<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.030> is<00:01:17.179> to<00:01:17.210> simply<00:01:17.630> turn<00:01:17.869> your<00:01:18.050> main

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
way to do it is to simply turn your main

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.889 
way to do it is to simply turn your main
water<00:01:18.530> feedback<00:01:19.100> on<00:01:19.310> for<00:01:19.640> a<00:01:19.670> split<00:01:19.970> second<00:01:20.720> to

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
water feedback on for a split second to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:33.570 
water feedback on for a split second to
let<00:01:21.080> this<00:01:21.289> rock<00:01:21.590> pass

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.010 

we<00:01:34.120> can<00:01:34.300> also<00:01:34.480> use<00:01:35.320> our<00:01:35.500> hands<00:01:36.010> and<00:01:37.020> simply

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
we can also use our hands and simply

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.650 
we can also use our hands and simply
remove<00:01:38.800> the<00:01:38.830> debris<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.970> we<00:01:40.120> found<00:01:40.270> inside

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
remove the debris that we found inside

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.930 
remove the debris that we found inside
the<00:01:40.720> valve<00:01:41.080> we've<00:01:41.980> now<00:01:42.160> ensured<00:01:42.550> that<00:01:42.700> there's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
the valve we've now ensured that there's

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.060 
the valve we've now ensured that there's
no<00:01:43.090> debris<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.930> valve<00:01:44.170> should<00:01:44.380> now<00:01:44.530> operate

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
no debris the valve should now operate

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.250 
no debris the valve should now operate
cleanly<00:01:45.610> so<00:01:46.420> what<00:01:46.600> we'll<00:01:46.750> do<00:01:46.900> is<00:01:47.080> we'll

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
cleanly so what we'll do is we'll

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.400 
cleanly so what we'll do is we'll
reinsert<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.550> support<00:01:49.270> ring<00:01:49.450> inside<00:01:50.200> the

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
reinsert the support ring inside the

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.120 
reinsert the support ring inside the
valve<00:01:54.090> will<00:01:55.090> reinsert<00:01:55.660> the<00:01:55.900> diaphragm<00:01:56.530> make

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
valve will reinsert the diaphragm make

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.590 
valve will reinsert the diaphragm make
sure<00:01:57.160> that<00:01:57.960> everything<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:59.050> seated<00:01:59.440> properly

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
sure that everything is seated properly

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.770 
sure that everything is seated properly
inside<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.750> valve<00:02:03.660> will<00:02:04.660> then<00:02:05.700> insert<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
inside the valve will then insert the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.310 
inside the valve will then insert the
spring<00:02:10.140> take<00:02:11.140> your<00:02:11.260> bonnet<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:13.290> reinsert<00:02:14.290> it

it<00:02:17.020> is<00:02:17.140> seated<00:02:17.500> correctly<00:02:18.390> will<00:02:19.390> then<00:02:19.600> simply

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
it is seated correctly will then simply

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.260 
it is seated correctly will then simply
tighten<00:02:21.160> all<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.570> screws<00:02:24.120> once<00:02:25.120> your
