 open a new tab and enter my 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.050

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:41.770
 I will leave the link in the description of 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:43.690
 good video already inside the page if 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.720
 they want to read the description and if not then 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.190

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.370
 well here you can see the four games 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.230
 which has just gone up if you questions 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.540
 why they are so few is because just 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.519
 I just started it and then every four 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.899
 games that upload each tutorial that I will do 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.899
 to download xd 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.290
 here they choose the game that is more of their 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.500
 I like it and they click or double click on 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.500
 the picture 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.450
 in this case I chose in silent hill 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.200
 after they give you click they will take you 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.210
 to a page of half steak some 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.399
 Sometimes it asks for that code but in some 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.860
 sometimes not good then we put it and then 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.070
 we click on where it says authorize the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.070
 outlaw 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.049
 since he has authorized us to download 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.220
 we give it in download so that it starts 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.950
 download 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.140
 We give it in saved file and after 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.210
 We put the folder where we want it 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.410
 be saved is more advisable than 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.410
 keep on the desk 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.110
 and the download will start and I canceled it 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.110
 because I already downloaded it 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.399
 now that if you want to download the 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.799
 four games you just have to go to my 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:14.390
 page and we click where it says packs 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:17.030
 of games ps x super nintendo and 64 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.950
 and we click on this image this one 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.050
 will lead to another half aspire page 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.480
 but instead of downloading just one game 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.240
 download the four games together that 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.930
 they are river 2 nai creatures dragon ball 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.150
 final to ball and silence and already being in 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.100
 the page is given in download to save 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.100
 desktop files and save 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.170
 and the download will start and I canceled it 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.170
 because I already downloaded it 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.410
 and 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.480
 well after you have already downloaded it 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.700
 they minimize the window and go to 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.099
 desk will help the rar file that 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.900
 I leave the download 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.090
 you right click and already extract here 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.569
 then they will begin to extract the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.569
 records 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.790
 already done this only take the files 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.830
 driver 2 and the denario creatures and 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:26.720
 they also extract them as we did with the 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:28.640
 first file that we download good you 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.500
 we double click and it will open a 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.720
 window what they have to do is 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.640
 drag the file that is inside 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.239
 from that window they drag it to 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.239
 desk 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.440
 once it has been extracted it closes the window and 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.680
 they do the same procedure with the other 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.680
 archive 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.480

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.470
 missing something x 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.250
 if they want the rar files and the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.250
 can eliminate 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.060

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.830

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.800

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:54.139
