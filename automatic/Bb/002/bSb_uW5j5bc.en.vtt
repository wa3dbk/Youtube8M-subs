 madonna david snow capitalism 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:50.730
 or was it 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:57.870
 The fire department needs an old sock 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:01.780
 neonga a knit thread great nobility 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.160
 small needle and such small clouds 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.080
 that does not get over one 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.880
 Make us start as such 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.710
 first you take from the top of the 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.310
 sock because what you stretch 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.310
 lets and cuts out half of it 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.740
 So it's a small square results 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.210
 then it opened and take you now 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.079
 from a small needle and snowing 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.270
 input agreed a quota and yes then 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.920
 you take the ugly side makes itself 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.090
 up so as to 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:54.049
 folded and then you put off 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:56.689
 down completely one page in and now 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.429
 Just make it backward if you are 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.259
 I know that you know him when 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.969
 not then you have to get away from 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.929
 Steam and your mother show there goes 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.929
 actually quite simple 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.329
 that's just what's up to now 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.069
 fully sewn on top is then stuck 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.590
 again from the top of the inside 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.799
 not so pure that it is the other side 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.359
 touched and yes it just makes it so 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.670
 would like to pull something together 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:35.189
 the just because the needle stuck through 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.569
 just pull it together 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.489
 Now with it the needle then 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.290
 Attach attachment you 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.290
 just clean the needle from all sides 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.830
 now it just makes him one 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:00.200
 knot it to fasten it now 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.760
 it dies to the right and eventually 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.879
 a little bit back with it 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.010
 look out then you take one 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:11.900
 garden that fits well makes you one 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.150
 knot and take your big needles with it 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.290
 it fits through and bad of the 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.230
 side of it near side just in 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.790
 from the bottom so it stops and I have 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.049
 because now a triangle pattern 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.840
 of course you can cut it like that 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.840
 Do as you want your apps 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.660
 pommel again makes needle and thread and 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.519
 is in the middle of the former pure and 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.489
 still firmly in the other side 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.549
 plug in as if you have that on 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.810
 your needle the pompom and puts in the 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.760
 cap in the middle pure and pulls tight 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.120
 Now this dies again with the 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.000
 bommel inside and fortified now so 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.709
 Just like the needle of 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.250
 pierce all sides and on again 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.250
 make knots 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:05.930
 like that and then cut off again 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:09.770
 teach and now with it 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.570
 it fits the holes of your apps 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.780
 just by doing such a night 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.489
 Niederrhein makes and thus her up 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.489
 where you have to decide the holes 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:27.560
 other side now, of course, too 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.640
 so now two holes at both 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.490
 pages are like that and now it's on 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.380

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.180
 of course he still needs him and 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.800
 just cut it out of a sock 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.060
 such a little want to strip 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.830

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.550

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.730
 so sew together so that there is no 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.130
 station so and then just times 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.990

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.040

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.590
