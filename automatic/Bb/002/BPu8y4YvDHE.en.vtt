00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.710
 send and build this 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.789
 The reason is that I have meat here once 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.279
 I 've got pure here in front of me 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.240
 rink meat shoulder meat and 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.550
 belly meat city â€‹â€‹belly can there 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.780
 take back bacon or ham 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.989
 the fed sections as always 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:46.010
 I have him I already have one 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:48.390
 crash already shredded spices salt 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.640
 and of course my kitchen machines 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.449
 here in wolf have three millimeters 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.920
 slices of glasses 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.190
 then I always have a kitchen machine 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.930
 I'll do it all ok 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.079
 and the whole thing is going to happen now 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.300
 I have you now so we have one now 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.830
 Meat mincer situated we let now 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.460
 first time with the meat and the Swiss 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.860
 meat through 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.360
 and the need can be extra through 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.610
 I'll show you such a small one 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.170
 sections because it is relatively noisy but 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.650
 many of us know that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.830
 of course okay then it works now 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.830
 Come on 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.590
 so I have it all now 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.580
 let it pass and how it goes on 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.660
 I tell you now 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.390
 Now I will do that 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.390
 lean meat comes in that more 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.110
 and that comes a reasonable education 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.450
 I 'll get it first in the beginning 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.580
 now my chef so its the main bridge 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.390
 sentence 4 1 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.400
 mps who the whole now first 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.010
 dry run always says first 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.010
 run as ten round 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.680
 so now i start 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.620
 so now not to 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:38.640
 here half the ice here 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:43.410
 to do it in and if it is now 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.130
 is nice to run a little longer 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.910
 so that the whole thing a soft fine 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.910
 mass 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.230
 the whole thing already has a nice fine 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.570
 Consistency looks good as it does 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.870
 should be 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:40.100
 Now I start here my needs 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:41.510
 Add and ice ice so the rest so 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:49.460
 and now I'll give mine right away 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:51.170
 Add spices if I have 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.190
 practically now, as you said 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.180
 I like that to be 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.330
 So now I have to round 30 times like that 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.950
 let's see how far the whole enemy 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.280
 But more is likely 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.280
 Not be 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:18.640
 so check the whole thing 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:22.620
 to look at the whole thing 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.620
 the ice is already spreading 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.440
 that looks pretty good too 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.560
 already become relative 1 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.810
 now I leave it again so 10 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.680
 so I'm running this 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.680
 again quite well distributed 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.199
 So and feet two days I show you 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.340
 but now the whole thing is that you have one 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.789
 kitchen machine rausgeholt 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.650
 here my appearance reason loads as already 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.930
 have said here before, I would like 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.880
 to make a phishing of and how to 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.009
 Now the theater is now in one 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.419
 man to bio i hope my little ones 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.349
 darkness you like me again 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.349
 said yes
