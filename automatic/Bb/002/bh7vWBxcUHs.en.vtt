that no but that's what that guy said he

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.320 
that no but that's what that guy said he
would<00:04:54.340> potentially<00:04:55.340> give<00:04:55.610> but<00:04:56.090> then<00:04:56.210> his

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
would potentially give but then his

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.730 
would potentially give but then his
customer<00:04:56.780> backed<00:04:56.990> out<00:04:57.170> when<00:04:57.320> he<00:04:57.380> found<00:04:57.590> out<00:04:57.680> it
