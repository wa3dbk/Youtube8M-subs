00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
there is this trend of taking pretty

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.880 
there is this trend of taking pretty
unelectable<00:00:29.369> things<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.990> belt<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.500> then

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
unelectable things like a belt and then

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.440 
unelectable things like a belt and then
shoving<00:00:32.099> electronics<00:00:32.730> into<00:00:32.910> them<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.210> making

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
shoving electronics into them and making

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
them smart I think this trend is going

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.770 
them smart I think this trend is going
to<00:00:35.309> benefit<00:00:35.670> humanity<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.540> long<00:00:36.750> run

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.229 
to benefit humanity in the long run
because<00:00:37.350> some<00:00:38.010> things<00:00:38.040> need<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.610> smart<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239

what the hell now my biggest concern

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.590 
what the hell now my biggest concern
isn't<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.250> pedometer<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.939> isn't<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
isn't the pedometer it isn't the

isn't the pedometer it isn't the
waistline<00:01:21.930> trend<00:01:22.200> analysis<00:01:22.680> though<00:01:22.860> that

waistline trend analysis though that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.469 
waistline trend analysis though that
graph<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.790> incredibly<00:01:24.180> boring

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
graph is going to be incredibly boring

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.999 
graph is going to be incredibly boring
because<00:01:24.689> how<00:01:24.990> quickly<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:25.710> waistline

change and seriously that they use the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.819 
change and seriously that they use the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
you know there's I can kind of guess why

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.480 
you know there's I can kind of guess why
they<00:02:24.750> wouldn't<00:02:25.110> make<00:02:25.290> their<00:02:25.560> goals<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.250> first

they wouldn't make their goals the first

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.620 
they wouldn't make their goals the first
thing<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.640> comes<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:26.940> mind<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.600> worth

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
thing that comes to mind is is it worth

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.750 
thing that comes to mind is is it worth
fifty<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.410> sixty<00:02:28.680> dollars<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.430> keep<00:02:29.610> my

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
fifty to sixty dollars to keep my

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.370 
fifty to sixty dollars to keep my
beverages<00:02:30.390> warm<00:02:30.780> at<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.990> constant<00:02:31.230> temperature

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
beverages warm at a constant temperature

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.800 
beverages warm at a constant temperature
for<00:02:31.860> 45<00:02:32.220> minutes<00:02:32.460> my<00:02:33.090> first<00:02:33.300> answer<00:02:33.540> was<00:02:33.570> no

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
for 45 minutes my first answer was no

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.120 
for 45 minutes my first answer was no
because<00:02:34.110> my<00:02:34.320> home<00:02:34.470> brewed<00:02:34.680> coffee<00:02:34.920> has

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
because my home brewed coffee has

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.980 
because my home brewed coffee has
costing<00:02:35.520> me<00:02:35.610> like<00:02:35.760> seventeen<00:02:36.210> cents<00:02:36.480> per<00:02:36.690> cup

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
costing me like seventeen cents per cup

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.540 
costing me like seventeen cents per cup
so<00:02:37.320> yeah<00:02:37.590> I'm<00:02:37.650> not<00:02:37.770> really<00:02:37.830> worried<00:02:38.310> about<00:02:38.370> it

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
so yeah I'm not really worried about it

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.430 
so yeah I'm not really worried about it
and<00:02:38.940> again<00:02:39.270> I'm<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.480> pretty<00:02:39.660> reasonable<00:02:39.870> person

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
and again I'm a pretty reasonable person

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.050 
and again I'm a pretty reasonable person
I<00:02:40.500> was<00:02:40.620> trying<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.890> think<00:02:40.950> about<00:02:41.160> what<00:02:41.310> things

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
I was trying to think about what things

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.760 
I was trying to think about what things
could<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.420> consume<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:42.930> my<00:02:43.020> wireless<00:02:43.290> heated

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
could I consume in my wireless heated

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.100 
could I consume in my wireless heated
nano<00:02:44.010> mug<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:45.210> would<00:02:45.450> require<00:02:45.630> me<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.930> keep

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
nano mug that would require me to keep

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.230 
nano mug that would require me to keep
it<00:02:46.170> warm<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:46.680> 25<00:02:47.130> minutes<00:02:47.430> now<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.060> first

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
it warm for 25 minutes now the first

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.400 
it warm for 25 minutes now the first
thing<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.450> came<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.690> mind<00:02:48.870> was<00:02:48.960> all<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.230> weird

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
it's kind of like their instruction

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.190 
it's kind of like their instruction
manual<00:03:18.420> there<00:03:18.540> they're<00:03:18.720> telling<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.019> these

are<00:03:19.410> all<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.830> things<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.340> need<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.640> know

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
are all the things that you need to know

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.759 
are all the things that you need to know
about<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.300> mug<00:03:21.540> there's<00:03:22.170> different<00:03:22.590> light

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
about the mug there's different light

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.350 
about the mug there's different light
settings<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.370> have<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.610> charge<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:24.030> after

seven<00:03:24.840> cups<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.290> coffee<00:03:25.680> that's<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.550> another

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
seven cups of coffee that's just another

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.550 
seven cups of coffee that's just another
thing<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.269> my<00:03:27.330> life<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.750> have<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.110> plug<00:03:28.320> in

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
thing in my life that I have to plug in

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.600 
thing in my life that I have to plug in
and<00:03:28.800> that's<00:03:29.070> probably<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.459> thing<00:03:29.580> that

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
and that's probably the thing that

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.680 
and that's probably the thing that
bothers<00:03:29.910> me<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.120> most<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.480> they've

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
bothers me the most is that they've

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.810 
bothers me the most is that they've
taken<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:31.050> really<00:03:31.320> dumb<00:03:31.860> thing<00:03:32.130> added<00:03:32.730> a

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
taken this really dumb thing added a

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.430 
taken this really dumb thing added a
bunch<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.060> electronics<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.050> but<00:03:34.260> then<00:03:34.380> they

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
bunch of electronics to it but then they

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.960 
bunch of electronics to it but then they
make<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.739> any<00:03:34.890> easier<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.340> use<00:03:35.580> they<00:03:35.730> made<00:03:35.850> it

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
make it any easier to use they made it

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.210 
make it any easier to use they made it
even<00:03:36.060> more<00:03:36.180> tedious<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:37.019> use<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:37.950> we're<00:03:38.100> going

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
even more tedious to use so we're going

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.440 
even more tedious to use so we're going
to<00:03:38.310> go<00:03:38.340> from<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.700> thing<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.000> stores<00:03:39.269> all<00:03:39.390> the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
to go from the thing that stores all the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.030 
to go from the thing that stores all the
hot<00:03:39.600> water<00:03:39.840> or<00:03:39.959> hot<00:03:40.140> beverages<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.860> thing

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
hot water or hot beverages to the thing

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.680 
hot water or hot beverages to the thing
that's<00:03:41.220> going<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.430> make<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.670> hot<00:03:41.850> water<00:03:42.090> for

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
that's going to make the hot water for

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.210 
that's going to make the hot water for
your<00:03:42.810> beverage<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.350> that's<00:03:43.560> going<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.920> be<00:03:44.010> the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
your beverage and that's going to be the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.009 
your beverage and that's going to be the
app<00:03:44.400> kettle<00:03:45.120> now<00:03:45.540> what's<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.780> first<00:03:45.959> thing

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
app kettle now what's the first thing

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.050 
app kettle now what's the first thing
that<00:03:46.170> comes<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.380> mind<00:03:46.560> when<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.739> say<00:03:46.830> app<00:03:47.220> kettle

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
that comes to mind when I say app kettle

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.250 
that comes to mind when I say app kettle
were<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:48.390> thinking<00:03:48.660> it's<00:03:48.810> gonna<00:03:48.870> be<00:03:49.019> like<00:03:49.140> an

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
were you thinking it's gonna be like an

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.810 
were you thinking it's gonna be like an
iphone<00:03:49.590> case<00:03:49.769> where<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:49.980> can<00:03:50.070> boil<00:03:50.250> water<00:03:50.430> and

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
iphone case where you can boil water and

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.430 
iphone case where you can boil water and
still<00:03:51.030> be<00:03:51.120> able<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:51.420> like<00:03:51.570> surf<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.050> internet

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
still be able to like surf the internet

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.320 
still be able to like surf the internet
at<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.860> same<00:03:53.040> time<00:03:53.280> it's<00:03:53.730> not<00:03:53.910> because<00:03:54.180> that

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
at the same time it's not because that

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.759 
at the same time it's not because that
would<00:03:54.450> be<00:03:54.480> absolutely<00:03:54.870> ridiculous<00:03:55.650> and

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
would be absolutely ridiculous and

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.009 
would be absolutely ridiculous and
useless<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.640> app<00:03:56.760> kettle<00:03:57.150> will<00:03:57.360> allow<00:03:57.750> us<00:03:57.780> to

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
useless the app kettle will allow us to

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.410 
useless the app kettle will allow us to
reimagine<00:03:58.620> what<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:58.980> cattle<00:03:59.430> actually<00:03:59.880> does<00:04:00.150> so

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
reimagine what a cattle actually does so

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.660 
reimagine what a cattle actually does so
let's<00:04:01.019> go<00:04:01.290> take<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.620> look<00:04:01.860> at<00:04:02.010> what<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.220> kettle

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
let's go take a look at what a kettle

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.400 
let's go take a look at what a kettle
does<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.330> container<00:04:03.660> that<00:04:04.019> has<00:04:04.200> water

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
does the container that has water

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.590 
does the container that has water
there's<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.130> base<00:04:05.489> that<00:04:05.519> either<00:04:05.940> has<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.239> heating

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
there's a base that either has a heating

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.820 
there's a base that either has a heating
element<00:04:06.690> or<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:07.140> put<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.350> on<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.530> stove

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
element or you put it on the stove

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
when's when the water gets hot if you

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
is done so that's the kettle let the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.930 
is done so that's the kettle let the
entire<00:04:19.799> process<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.280> boiling<00:04:20.489> water<00:04:20.519> is<00:04:20.760> very

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
entire process of boiling water is very

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.550 
entire process of boiling water is very
straight<00:04:21.209> for<00:04:21.419> there's<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.930> very<00:04:22.169> low<00:04:22.530> chance

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
straight for there's a very low chance

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.020 
straight for there's a very low chance
that<00:04:23.130> you're<00:04:23.250> going<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.430> screw<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:23.729> up<00:04:23.820> though

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
that you're going to screw it up though

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.969 
that you're going to screw it up though
I'm<00:04:24.150> pretty<00:04:24.479> sure<00:04:24.660> some<00:04:24.990> people<00:04:25.260> have<00:04:25.500> the

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
I'm pretty sure some people have the

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.020 
I'm pretty sure some people have the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
the temperature plays such an important

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.550 
the temperature plays such an important
part<00:05:12.330> so<00:05:12.630> being<00:05:12.840> able<00:05:12.930> to<00:05:13.080> control<00:05:13.260> exactly

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
part so being able to control exactly

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.830 
part so being able to control exactly
what<00:05:14.160> temperature<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:14.790> water<00:05:15.300> is<00:05:15.510> going<00:05:15.720> to

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
what temperature the water is going to

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.250 
what temperature the water is going to
be<00:05:16.020> at<00:05:16.230> yeah<00:05:16.980> maybe<00:05:17.370> good<00:05:18.300> idea<00:05:18.510> but<00:05:18.990> do<00:05:19.169> you

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260

really need to have all these extra

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.850 
really need to have all these extra
things<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.690> app<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.290> cloud<00:05:22.530> based

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
things the app the cloud based

and<00:05:25.650> watching<00:05:26.040> your<00:05:26.160> water<00:05:26.460> boil<00:05:27.139> useless

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
and watching your water boil useless

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.020 
and watching your water boil useless
information<00:05:28.440> so<00:05:29.190> that's<00:05:29.340> all<00:05:29.490> i<00:05:29.520> got<00:05:29.760> for<00:05:29.790> what

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
information so that's all i got for what

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.310
