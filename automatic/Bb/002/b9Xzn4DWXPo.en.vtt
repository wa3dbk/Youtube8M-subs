00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:26.259
 the moth determines the fall direction of the 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:30.460
 baumes has a diameter of about 20 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.660
 meter is necessarily a fall returns 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.269
 create 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:42.910
 The traffic consists of the elementary school 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:47.260
 and I am a falcon, the falcon is pea close 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.500
 the floor horizontally cut the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.989
 deep the case notch sole should be 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.840
 fifth to a quarter of 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.079
 trunk diameter 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.289
 the fall returns at an angle of 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:07.930
 45 degrees to the case notched uncut 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:09.240
 Sole and there you have to take a break 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.250
 to meet 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.929
 but they must not and circumcised 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:20.549
 become 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:24.759
 the falcons correspond to the case captive 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.250
 The depth of the fall notch sole is supposed to be one 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.130
 fifth to a quarter of 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.030
 be coming diameter 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:37.810
 the folding roof with at an angle of 45 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:42.909
 degree to case cup sole cut 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:46.600
 the fall height corresponds to the fall notch 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.020
 Deep control over the operation 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.020
 the case 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.649
 correct the fa cup 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.540
 if necessary with strong voices 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.620
 prevent cuts cuts that 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:17.610
 tearing open the stem profi proficient so 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.610
 Dad see you again that's clear
