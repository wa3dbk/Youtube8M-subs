00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
okay I'm going to show you a problem

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.110 
okay I'm going to show you a problem
that<00:00:03.570> I<00:00:03.659> had<00:00:03.870> with<00:00:03.990> my<00:00:04.110> 94<00:00:04.620> Ranger<00:00:05.100> that<00:00:05.759> it

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
that I had with my 94 Ranger that it

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.709 
that I had with my 94 Ranger that it
wasn't<00:00:06.359> starting<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:08.990> your<00:00:11.360> 94<00:00:12.360> Ranger

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
wasn't starting this is your 94 Ranger

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.030 
wasn't starting this is your 94 Ranger
looks<00:00:12.960> similar<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.679> it's<00:00:13.950> a

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
looks similar to this it's a

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.490 
looks similar to this it's a
four-cylinder<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.809> starter<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.560> actually

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
four-cylinder the starter is actually

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.890 
four-cylinder the starter is actually
here<00:00:21.050> right<00:00:22.050> below<00:00:22.230> here<00:00:23.180> is<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.449> starter

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
here right below here is the starter

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.660 
here right below here is the starter
passenger<00:00:26.960> back<00:00:27.960> left<00:00:28.380> side<00:00:28.680> if<00:00:29.369> you're

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
passenger back left side if you're

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.209 
passenger back left side if you're
facing<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.269> vehicle<00:00:30.679> that<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.949> where<00:00:32.189> to

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
facing the vehicle that is where to

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.729 
facing the vehicle that is where to
start<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.820> at<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.390> below<00:00:33.899> here<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:37.050> problem

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
start is at a below here so the problem

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.260 
start is at a below here so the problem
was<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:39.469> it<00:00:40.469> had<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.219> connector<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.030> here

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
was that it had this connector on here

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.010 
was that it had this connector on here
for<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> mission<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.040> believe<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.780> was

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
for the mission I believe so this was

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
for the mission I believe so this was
this<00:00:46.500> was<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> problem<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.789> wires<00:00:48.059> was

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
this was the problem the wires was

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.029 
this was the problem the wires was
corroded<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.469> loose<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.680> was<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.860> going

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
corroded and loose so I was just going

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.180 
corroded and loose so I was just going
to<00:00:53.070> replace<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.550> solenoid<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:55.010> somebody<00:00:56.010> had

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
to replace the solenoid but somebody had

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.490 
to replace the solenoid but somebody had
told<00:00:56.399> me<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.879> wouldn't<00:00:57.059> start<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:57.629> day<00:00:57.899> so

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
told me it wouldn't start one day so

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.349 
told me it wouldn't start one day so
someone<00:00:58.829> told<00:00:59.129> me<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.820> go<00:00:59.969> underneath

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
someone told me to just go underneath

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.000 
someone told me to just go underneath
there<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.870> hit<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.469> didn't<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.829> where

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
there and hit it but I didn't know where

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.319 
there and hit it but I didn't know where
it<00:01:02.039> was<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.609> couldn't<00:01:02.850> find<00:01:03.090> any

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
it was that and I couldn't find any

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.920 
it was that and I couldn't find any
video<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.660> show<00:01:03.989> me<00:01:04.170> where<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.470> was<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
video to show me where it was that and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.010 
video to show me where it was that and
it's<00:01:06.930> right<00:01:07.790> right<00:01:08.790> back<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.510> if<00:01:09.750> you're

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
it's right right back here if you're

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.800 
it's right right back here if you're
looking<00:01:10.320> at<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> engine<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.630> you're

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
looking at the engine so if you're

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.330 
looking at the engine so if you're
looking<00:01:12.900> at<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> engine<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.770> right<00:01:14.040> down

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
looking at the engine it's right down

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.469 
looking at the engine it's right down
here<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:16.250> instead<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.490> hitting<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.970> starter<00:01:18.420> I

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
here so instead of hitting the starter I

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
here so instead of hitting the starter I
hit<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.960> arm<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:20.810> hit<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.189> move<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.369> wires

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
hit the arm I hit the move the wires

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.760 
hit the arm I hit the move the wires
around<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.570> truck<00:01:24.810> started<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:27.770> since

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
around and the truck started so since

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.679 
around and the truck started so since
then

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.319 

and<00:01:35.140> one<00:01:35.590> of<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:35.799> wires<00:01:36.039> tapped<00:01:36.490> just<00:01:37.090> like<00:01:37.299> a

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
and one of the wires tapped just like a

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:43.050 
and one of the wires tapped just like a
press-on<00:01:39.990> flick<00:01:40.990> just<00:01:41.319> like<00:01:41.499> that<00:01:41.799> and<00:01:42.490> other

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
press-on flick just like that and other

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.809 
press-on flick just like that and other
one<00:01:43.240> was<00:01:43.450> a<00:01:43.479> larger<00:01:44.200> one

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
one was a larger one

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:50.160 
one was a larger one
since<00:01:45.819> then<00:01:46.240> though<00:01:47.640> once<00:01:48.640> I<00:01:48.850> bought<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.990> new

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
since then though once I bought the new

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.550 
since then though once I bought the new
starter<00:01:51.240> Ford<00:01:52.240> explained<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.729> problem<00:01:55.560> that

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
starter Ford explained the problem that

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.709 
starter Ford explained the problem that
this<00:01:57.219> sometimes<00:01:58.380> get<00:01:59.380> loose<00:02:00.209> or<00:02:01.209> corroded

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
this sometimes get loose or corroded

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.959 
this sometimes get loose or corroded
from<00:02:02.319> the<00:02:02.439> elements<00:02:02.979> there's<00:02:03.159> no<00:02:03.340> protection

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
from the elements there's no protection

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.940 
from the elements there's no protection
around<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.539> and<00:02:04.719> as<00:02:04.899> you<00:02:05.079> can<00:02:05.229> see<00:02:05.289> if<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:05.770> can

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
around it and as you can see if you can

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.369 
around it and as you can see if you can
read<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.369> there<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:07.629> tells<00:02:07.989> you<00:02:08.579> and<00:02:10.379> they

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
read that there it tells you and they

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:17.550 
read that there it tells you and they
provided<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.280> with<00:02:12.579> the<00:02:15.629> new<00:02:16.629> fix<00:02:17.079> for<00:02:17.410> it

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
provided you with the new fix for it

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.850 
provided you with the new fix for it
it's<00:02:17.860> called<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.190> eyelets<00:02:18.670> post<00:02:19.420> type

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
it's called the eyelets post type

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.530 
it's called the eyelets post type
basically<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:21.129> have<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.489> crimp<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:22.209> white

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
basically you have to crimp this white

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.680 
basically you have to crimp this white
here<00:02:24.599> just<00:02:25.599> clip<00:02:26.079> that<00:02:26.319> off<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.910> strip<00:02:28.269> harder

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
here just clip that off the strip harder

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.069 
here just clip that off the strip harder
to<00:02:28.780> wire<00:02:28.959> off<00:02:29.459> it's<00:02:30.459> inserted<00:02:31.239> inside<00:02:31.599> here<00:02:32.410> I

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
to wire off it's inserted inside here I

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.360 
to wire off it's inserted inside here I
saw<00:02:37.019> crimp<00:02:38.019> it<00:02:38.170> down<00:02:38.379> like<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:38.889> see<00:02:39.099> with<00:02:39.250> the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
saw crimp it down like you see with the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.629 
saw crimp it down like you see with the
pictured<00:02:39.760> air<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.389> then<00:02:41.049> melt<00:02:41.609> what<00:02:42.609> a

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:42.639 
pictured air and then melt what a

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.059 
pictured air and then melt what a
lighter<00:02:43.060> just<00:02:43.420> melted<00:02:43.900> around<00:02:44.019> Ansel

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
lighter just melted around Ansel

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.890 
lighter just melted around Ansel
the<00:02:45.459> wires<00:02:45.730> won't<00:02:46.060> be<00:02:46.209> exposed<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.810> the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
the wires won't be exposed to the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.039 
the wires won't be exposed to the
elements<00:02:46.930> anymore<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.420> solved<00:02:49.989> the

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
elements anymore and that solved the

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.509 
elements anymore and that solved the
problem<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:50.799> like<00:02:51.180> they<00:02:52.180> said<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.660> would<00:02:52.930> and

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
problem just like they said it would and

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.020 
problem just like they said it would and
I<00:02:54.519> didn't<00:02:54.819> have<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.060> worry<00:02:55.269> about<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:57.040> car<00:02:58.000> not

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
I didn't have to worry about the car not

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.680 
I didn't have to worry about the car not
struck<00:02:58.690> not<00:02:58.870> started<00:02:59.319> anymore<00:02:59.739> but<00:03:00.669> that<00:03:01.480> is

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
struck not started anymore but that is

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.449 
struck not started anymore but that is
the<00:03:01.930> solution

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
the solution

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.869 
the solution
that<00:03:04.459> is<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.849> solution<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.599> problem<00:03:06.879> so

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
that is the solution to the problem so

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.020 
that is the solution to the problem so
if<00:03:08.090> you're<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.659> 94<00:03:09.230> Ranger<00:03:09.829> -<00:03:10.790> what's<00:03:10.969> a

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
if you're in 94 Ranger - what's a

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.720 
if you're in 94 Ranger - what's a
four-cylinder<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.079> started<00:03:12.609> what<00:03:13.609> you

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
four-cylinder is and started what you

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.039 
four-cylinder is and started what you
could<00:03:13.849> do<00:03:14.000> is<00:03:14.150> use<00:03:14.390> something<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.810> stick<00:03:15.019> down

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
could do is use something to stick down

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.349 
could do is use something to stick down
there<00:03:15.469> move<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.859> wires<00:03:16.099> around<00:03:16.400> just<00:03:17.150> move

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
there move the wires around just move

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.190 
there move the wires around just move
them<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.629> little<00:03:17.900> bit<00:03:18.079> and<00:03:18.349> it<00:03:18.950> should<00:03:18.980> start<00:03:19.549> if

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
them a little bit and it should start if

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.720 
them a little bit and it should start if
you're<00:03:21.200> having<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.590> similar<00:03:22.099> problem<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.700> I

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
you're having a similar problem that I

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.330 
you're having a similar problem that I
was<00:03:22.969> having<00:03:23.680> wasn't<00:03:24.680> nothing<00:03:24.889> really<00:03:25.069> wrong

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
was having wasn't nothing really wrong

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.849 
was having wasn't nothing really wrong
with<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.700> starter<00:03:26.150> itself<00:03:26.569> it<00:03:27.349> was<00:03:27.469> just<00:03:27.709> the

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
with the starter itself it was just the

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.459 
with the starter itself it was just the
wires<00:03:28.129> but<00:03:29.000> since<00:03:29.569> I<00:03:29.689> was<00:03:29.840> down<00:03:30.109> there<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.439> I

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:30.469 
wires but since I was down there and I

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.860 
wires but since I was down there and I
was<00:03:30.590> messing<00:03:30.859> with<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.519> said<00:03:32.389> I<00:03:32.420> was<00:03:32.689> going

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
was messing with it I said I was going

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.740 
was messing with it I said I was going
to<00:03:32.930> go<00:03:33.079> ahead<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.560> replace<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.970> start<00:03:35.299> I<00:03:35.480> was

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
to go ahead and replace to start I was

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.009 
to go ahead and replace to start I was
not<00:03:36.049> going<00:03:36.439> to<00:03:36.650> him<00:03:37.299> fiddle<00:03:38.299> with<00:03:38.450> that<00:03:38.480> again

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
hard enough trying trying to figure out

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.970 
hard enough trying trying to figure out
just<00:03:55.519> look<00:03:56.180> down<00:03:56.450> straight<00:03:56.930> down<00:03:57.200> from<00:03:57.409> here
