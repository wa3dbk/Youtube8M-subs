also consider you know hitting the bell
on<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:23.030> open<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:24.290> can<00:02:24.440> consider<00:02:24.829> just

on the open you can consider just
hitting<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.579> top<00:02:25.819> it<00:02:26.269> all<00:02:26.420> depends<00:02:26.750> on<00:02:26.810> what

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
hitting the top it all depends on what

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.750 
hitting the top it all depends on what
sound<00:02:27.410> you're<00:02:27.650> looking<00:02:27.680> for<00:02:28.099> how<00:02:28.310> much<00:02:28.489> of<00:02:28.670> an

the right hand is just going to play
eighth<00:03:41.220> notes<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.880> I'll<00:03:42.209> probably<00:03:42.510> be

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
eighth notes and I'll probably be

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.290 
eighth notes and I'll probably be
accenting<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.770> the<00:03:44.100> anne's<00:03:44.310> more<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.000> I'll

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
accenting that the anne's more so I'll

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.570 
accenting that the anne's more so I'll
have<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.780> hi-hat<00:03:46.170> on<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:47.250> tip<00:03:47.519> on<00:03:47.720> beat<00:03:48.720> one

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
have the hi-hat on the tip on beat one

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.500 
have the hi-hat on the tip on beat one
shoulder<00:03:50.580> on<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.030> end<00:03:51.239> tip<00:03:52.050> b1<00:03:52.709> or<00:03:52.890> b2

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
shoulder on the end tip b1 or b2

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.500 
shoulder on the end tip b1 or b2
shoulder<00:03:54.510> on<00:03:54.600> n2p<00:03:55.350> 3<00:03:55.769> children<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.819> tip

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
shoulder on n2p 3 children and tip

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.320 
shoulder on n2p 3 children and tip
before<00:03:57.709> shoulder<00:03:58.709> on<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.860> end<00:03:59.120> okay<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:00.180> it

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
before shoulder on the end okay so it

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.539 
before shoulder on the end okay so it
might<00:04:00.480> be<00:04:00.600> opposite<00:04:01.470> from<00:04:01.950> what<00:04:02.130> you're<00:04:02.310> used

beats one and then tip on the end and if

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:11.809 
beats one and then tip on the end and if
that's<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.010> sound<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.340> want<00:04:11.549> for<00:04:11.760> these
