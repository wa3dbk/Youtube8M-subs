00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.160 
for lunch and then after work as well I
would<00:01:54.030> probably<00:01:54.930> get<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> couple

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
would probably get a couple

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.550

cheeseburgers<00:01:56.479> that<00:01:57.479> was<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> really<00:01:58.079> big

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
cheeseburgers that was a really big

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
meat-eater tons of dairy as well I grew

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.639 
meat-eater tons of dairy as well I grew
up<00:02:02.009> across<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> street<00:02:02.939> from<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.899> dairy<00:02:04.320> farm

up across the street from a dairy farm

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.280 
up across the street from a dairy farm
so<00:02:04.979> I'd<00:02:05.759> probably<00:02:06.060> drank<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.659> gallon<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:07.049> milk<00:02:07.170> a

so I'd probably drank a gallon of milk a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.290

day

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
day

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.280

felt better than that and just keep
feeling<00:04:15.530> better<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:16.010> better<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.310> better

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
feeling better and better and better

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.500 
feeling better and better and better
I've<00:04:17.720> been<00:04:17.960> in<00:04:18.200> such<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.520> fog<00:04:19.520> for<00:04:19.549> so<00:04:20.239> long<00:04:20.450> I

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
I've been in such a fog for so long I

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.250 
I've been in such a fog for so long I
didn't

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
didn't

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.340 
didn't
realize<00:04:21.530> what<00:04:21.710> good<00:04:22.280> could<00:04:22.580> feel<00:04:22.790> like<00:04:23.350> so

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
realize what good could feel like so

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.570 
realize what good could feel like so
after<00:04:24.650> a<00:04:24.710> year<00:04:24.800> of<00:04:25.250> being<00:04:25.460> raw<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:27.830> felt<00:04:28.460> like<00:04:28.550> a

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
after a year of being raw I felt like a

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.190 
after a year of being raw I felt like a
kid<00:04:28.880> I<00:04:29.120> felt<00:04:29.390> like<00:04:29.540> I<00:04:29.600> was<00:04:29.720> 18<00:04:30.050> but<00:04:30.350> I<00:04:30.410> was<00:04:30.590> 37<00:04:31.070> I

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
kid I felt like I was 18 but I was 37 I

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.620 
kid I felt like I was 18 but I was 37 I
decided<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.410> start<00:04:33.590> running<00:04:33.890> again<00:04:33.980> I<00:04:34.630> hadn't

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
decided to start running again I hadn't

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.320 
decided to start running again I hadn't
run<00:04:35.870> since<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:37.030> think<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.180> quit<00:04:38.480> in<00:04:38.690> 1988

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
run since I think I quit in 1988

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.520 
run since I think I quit in 1988
so<00:04:41.330> from<00:04:41.600> 1988<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:43.480> 2005<00:04:44.480> I<00:04:44.960> was<00:04:45.170> not<00:04:45.380> an

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
so from 1988 to 2005 I was not an

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.870 
so from 1988 to 2005 I was not an
athlete<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.210> started<00:04:47.540> running<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:48.880> had

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
athlete and I started running and had

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.440 
athlete and I started running and had
some<00:04:50.240> really<00:04:50.620> astounding<00:04:52.030> progress<00:04:53.030> right

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
some really astounding progress right

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.790 
some really astounding progress right
from<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.690> start<00:04:53.900> so<00:04:54.050> I<00:04:54.170> thought<00:04:54.410> about<00:04:54.530> making

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
from the start so I thought about making

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.920 
from the start so I thought about making
a<00:04:54.980> documentary<00:04:55.280> about<00:04:55.640> it<00:04:55.790> and<00:04:56.090> that's<00:04:56.720> how

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
a documentary about it and that's how

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.560 
a documentary about it and that's how
the<00:04:56.990> running<00:04:57.260> raw<00:04:57.380> project<00:04:57.830> began<00:04:58.070> I<00:04:58.570> didn't

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
the running raw project began I didn't

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.060 
the running raw project began I didn't
know<00:04:59.630> what<00:04:59.750> I<00:04:59.780> was<00:04:59.930> doing<00:05:00.260> kind<00:05:00.590> of<00:05:00.710> fell<00:05:00.890> into

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
know what I was doing kind of fell into

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.310 
know what I was doing kind of fell into
it<00:05:01.220> I<00:05:01.700> didn't<00:05:02.150> really<00:05:02.390> know<00:05:02.510> much<00:05:02.660> about<00:05:02.720> the

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
it I didn't really know much about the

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.990 
it I didn't really know much about the
diet<00:05:03.530> specifics<00:05:04.220> or<00:05:04.370> physiology<00:05:04.970> or

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
diet specifics or physiology or

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.970 
diet specifics or physiology or
biochemistry<00:05:05.570> that's<00:05:05.900> all<00:05:06.050> something<00:05:06.740> I've

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
biochemistry that's all something I've

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.860 
biochemistry that's all something I've
learned<00:05:07.130> lately<00:05:07.580> kind<00:05:08.420> of<00:05:08.510> fell<00:05:08.630> into<00:05:08.780> this

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
learned lately kind of fell into this

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.680 
learned lately kind of fell into this
and<00:05:09.230> learned<00:05:09.590> along<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:10.250> way<00:05:10.400> it<00:05:11.060> wasn't<00:05:11.420> it

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
and learned along the way it wasn't it

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.600 
and learned along the way it wasn't it
wasn't<00:05:11.870> a<00:05:11.990> no-brainer<00:05:12.410> right<00:05:12.890> from<00:05:13.040> the<00:05:13.130> start

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
wasn't a no-brainer right from the start

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.630 
wasn't a no-brainer right from the start
definitely<00:05:14.480> a<00:05:15.310> learning<00:05:16.310> process<00:05:18.430> and<00:05:19.430> fell

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
definitely a learning process and fell

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.930 
definitely a learning process and fell
on<00:05:19.730> my<00:05:19.760> face<00:05:20.000> a<00:05:20.330> lot<00:05:21.580> that's<00:05:22.580> how<00:05:22.700> you<00:05:22.790> learn

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
on my face a lot that's how you learn

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.640 
on my face a lot that's how you learn
you<00:05:23.120> fall<00:05:23.300> on<00:05:23.390> your<00:05:23.510> face<00:05:23.690> and<00:05:24.080> then<00:05:24.410> you<00:05:24.500> get

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
you fall on your face and then you get

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.080 
you fall on your face and then you get
up<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:25.070> you<00:05:25.190> try<00:05:25.370> something<00:05:25.730> new<00:05:25.850> and<00:05:25.880> then

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
up and you try something new and then

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.340 
up and you try something new and then
you<00:05:26.180> fall<00:05:26.330> on<00:05:26.360> your<00:05:26.450> face<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:26.870> you<00:05:26.930> get<00:05:27.110> up<00:05:27.230> and

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
you fall on your face and you get up and

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.300 
you fall on your face and you get up and
you<00:05:27.440> try<00:05:27.620> something<00:05:27.980> new

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
you try something new

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.710 
you try something new
and<00:05:29.020> I've<00:05:30.020> posted<00:05:30.380> videos<00:05:30.710> online<00:05:30.950> where<00:05:31.720> I

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
and I've posted videos online where I

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.900 
and I've posted videos online where I
really<00:05:33.710> don't<00:05:33.920> agree<00:05:34.130> with<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:34.430> information

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
really don't agree with the information

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.190 
really don't agree with the information
that<00:05:35.060> I<00:05:35.090> shared<00:05:35.360> in<00:05:35.510> them<00:05:35.630> because<00:05:36.080> I've

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
that I shared in them because I've

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.020 
that I shared in them because I've
learned<00:05:36.500> since<00:05:36.800> then<00:05:36.980> and<00:05:37.340> maybe<00:05:37.670> that's<00:05:37.940> not

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
learned since then and maybe that's not

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.300 
learned since then and maybe that's not
the<00:05:38.180> best<00:05:38.300> way<00:05:38.540> to<00:05:38.630> do<00:05:38.870> it<00:05:39.020> but<00:05:39.860> I<00:05:39.920> leave<00:05:40.130> those

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
the best way to do it but I leave those

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.980 
the best way to do it but I leave those
videos<00:05:40.670> up<00:05:40.880> because<00:05:41.180> I<00:05:41.270> want<00:05:41.480> people<00:05:41.540> to<00:05:41.780> see

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
videos up because I want people to see

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
my journey I don't want them to just see

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.020 
my journey I don't want them to just see
where<00:05:44.690> I<00:05:44.720> am<00:05:44.900> now<00:05:45.140> I<00:05:45.530> want<00:05:46.130> to<00:05:46.190> see<00:05:46.370> I<00:05:46.640> want<00:05:46.760> them

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
to see where I came from what I've been

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.280 
to see where I came from what I've been
through<00:05:48.800> what<00:05:49.400> the<00:05:49.490> process<00:05:49.880> looked<00:05:50.090> like<00:05:50.290> so

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
through what the process looked like so

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.570 
through what the process looked like so

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
a lot of those videos are quite

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.370 
a lot of those videos are quite
embarrassing<00:05:53.120> to<00:05:53.240> me<00:05:53.270> but<00:05:53.600> that's<00:05:53.870> part<00:05:54.350> of

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
embarrassing to me but that's part of

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.470 
embarrassing to me but that's part of
the<00:05:54.470> journey<00:05:54.620> and<00:05:54.920> that's<00:05:55.100> that's<00:05:55.910> me<00:05:56.180> falling

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
the journey and that's that's me falling

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.410 
the journey and that's that's me falling
on<00:05:56.600> my<00:05:56.690> face<00:05:56.720> and<00:05:57.350> because<00:05:58.190> of<00:05:58.220> that<00:05:58.760> fall<00:05:59.150> I

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
on my face and because of that fall I

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.570 
on my face and because of that fall I
got<00:05:59.660> up<00:05:59.840> and<00:06:00.020> learned<00:06:00.200> something<00:06:00.580> and

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
got up and learned something and
