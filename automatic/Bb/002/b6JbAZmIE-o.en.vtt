00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
focus on operating Laura of something we

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.200 
focus on operating Laura of something we
could<00:01:02.130> only<00:01:02.309> do<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.730> next-gen<00:01:04.549> for<00:01:05.549> Lara<00:01:05.790> her

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
could only do on next-gen for Lara her

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.639 
could only do on next-gen for Lara her
hair<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.540> long<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> biggest<00:01:07.170> element<00:01:07.530> she'll

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
hair is long the biggest element she'll

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:08.959 
hair is long the biggest element she'll
constantly<00:01:08.159> see<00:01:08.369> from<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.579> third-person

so<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.020> added<00:01:13.140> trust<00:01:13.469> effects<00:01:13.770> custom<00:01:14.250> written

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
so we added trust effects custom written

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:15.889 
so we added trust effects custom written
and<00:01:14.610> custom<00:01:14.939> optimized<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.570> next-gen

other ways we wanted to upgrade Laura

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.090 
other ways we wanted to upgrade Laura
was<00:01:37.810> specifically<00:01:38.320> looking<00:01:38.650> at<00:01:38.770> her<00:01:38.860> skin

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
was specifically looking at her skin

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.700 
was specifically looking at her skin
it's<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:39.790> very<00:01:40.090> big<00:01:40.330> deal<00:01:40.540> it's<00:01:41.140> another<00:01:41.440> part

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
it's a very big deal it's another part

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.350 
it's a very big deal it's another part
of<00:01:41.830> her<00:01:41.950> character<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.520> see<00:01:42.730> a<00:01:42.910> lot<00:01:43.150> and

of her character that you see a lot and
she<00:01:43.570> goes<00:01:43.720> through<00:01:43.870> so<00:01:44.260> many<00:01:44.440> big<00:01:44.650> changes<00:01:45.070> in

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
she goes through so many big changes in

she goes through so many big changes in
this<00:01:45.220> world<00:01:45.460> where<00:01:46.000> she<00:01:46.150> gets<00:01:46.300> muddy<00:01:46.720> or

this world where she gets muddy or

this world where she gets muddy or
bloody<00:01:47.800> or<00:01:48.070> wet<00:01:48.730> from<00:01:48.940> all<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.150> rain<00:01:49.330> or<00:01:49.750> when

or hangs from various areas it adds that
nice<00:03:39.040> subtle<00:03:39.400> nuance<00:03:39.850> that<00:03:39.940> when<00:03:40.150> people<00:03:40.270> see

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
nice subtle nuance that when people see

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.120 
nice subtle nuance that when people see
it<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.900> just<00:03:41.290> makes<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.620> world<00:03:41.800> feel<00:03:42.070> more

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
it it just makes the world feel more

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.160 
it it just makes the world feel more
realistic<00:03:42.550> it<00:03:43.180> makes<00:03:43.360> her<00:03:43.630> feel<00:03:43.840> more

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
realistic it makes her feel more

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.229 
realistic it makes her feel more
grounded<00:03:44.320> and<00:03:44.800> cohesive<00:03:45.340> rather<00:03:45.700> than<00:03:45.910> props

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
grounded and cohesive rather than props

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.940 
grounded and cohesive rather than props
that<00:03:46.360> are<00:03:46.450> just<00:03:46.630> stuck<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.080> her<00:03:47.230> this<00:03:47.739> gear

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
that are just stuck to her this gear

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.630 
that are just stuck to her this gear
that<00:03:48.130> she<00:03:48.250> tied<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.670> her<00:03:48.760> in<00:03:48.850> a<00:03:48.880> realistic<00:03:49.209> way

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
that she tied to her in a realistic way

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.160 
that she tied to her in a realistic way
so<00:03:51.640> this<00:03:51.760> is<00:03:51.940> just<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.209> glimpse<00:03:52.600> at<00:03:52.750> how<00:03:52.900> we<00:03:52.959> made

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
so this is just a glimpse at how we made

it next-gen Lara from the different
effects<00:03:56.230> we<00:03:56.380> added<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.280> dynamically

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790
