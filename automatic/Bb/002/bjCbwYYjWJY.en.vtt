00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.519
 Hi everybody 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.339
 so today in this video we will see how to make a 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.829
 generator hdecommer the stone 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:19.599
 very simple and especially very effective to use so reasoning a 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.869
 small example 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.080
 a spade 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.029
 Michel 6 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.029
 I do not know anything 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.029
 so we go immediately to the field to be able to how 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.140
 proceeds are we 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.809
 to make this tab system not right now huh 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.180
 so percent and here we are on the ground so at first remains 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.710
 to demonstrate how to make the cholesterol generator 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 ap however people are looking to come 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.610
 what cowardice of the heavy 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.810
 then the other 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.090
 in the mythical 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.280
 stingy 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.790
 we will judge source 4 frame I put four captains privateers 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.440
 tourist or any other date 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 it's a heartbreaker to make for them she looks very heavy 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.620
 finally it will be a little movie 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.980
 afp 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.340
 cutting 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.890
 any other example 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.280
 his wife and all their loved ones are immense 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.790
 p 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.270
 classic allah 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.289
 in case of agreement 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.289
 so now we will be able to 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.920
 how 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.260
 use 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.310
 the pistons 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.520
 donkalor 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.610
 appear satisfied morning the Bloc of politics I take myself to the afp 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.610
 g 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 since that date 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.160
 in the blood 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.350
 gold 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.120
 donkalor at first we will place a bistro like this site 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.120
 my heart that this piston afp in a tank 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.830
 brunel so those who are in fact he is going 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.960
 pushed the cobol stone block 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.479
 and so who will bring it on the piston for example I'll trade 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.299
 so if and allow us after 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.969
 to get the agreement from the uci and after 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.189
 to make it go up and then get them back 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.369
 so then we created a system 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.369
 in the offer so in the day of August 5 in Rome 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:31.699
 the repeaters to create the current system which is regular so we are 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.099
 cooked and picard like that 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.519
 then for May the answer sounds at each end 10 repeaters and 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.519
 for the muppets all at the end of an endless 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.759
 so then 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:52.789
 thanks to torfou he withdrew quickly made sure that the current of his expectations 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.499
 the current is on the way it works 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.319
 the current and regular 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.729
 in the following we will make the areq stone arrive at each block 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.959
 since then 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.649
 here 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:12.649
 the current april 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.769
 and since a skeptic 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.129
 she then 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.369
 we will get the flow to the second 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.369
 the pump attendant 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.089
 and 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.109
 we will look at what it gives 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.199
 so there as the shore she transforms herself 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.819
 the inch piston 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.269
 and then that powerful there 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.609
 so allow that of the common 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.919
 so that since the hallways is why you have updated gets unlocked 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.919
 finally why you put chests 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:54.590
 but I fell 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.709
 controlled race near the road 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.169
 this hard line of the army 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.739
 individuals except theatrical turn Paris turns 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.619
 if the French who no longer takes any point 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:08.339
 strength 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:10.969
 we will put corses block the runway exit 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:13.339
 and we prevent them all doubts 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.239
 that's what I want is that way 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.449
 this will do with ethics the blockade has traded its stuff all started 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:20.919
 yahoo 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.919
 ok ok edmonton but that's it 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.789
 it opens up all the energy 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.789
 julien reactor block 3 but what am I at home 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.559
 the block what stops there 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:38.559
 he does not receive any guarantee he left here 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.180
 philippe richard team of tours 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.409
 at this level 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:43.680
 rejected 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.259
 the document 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.539
 block party rave mr clement and ceara traorÃ© 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:52.339
 as for those who risk it to be very aesthetic an agreement 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.169
 so here is the video here so it's really not complicated 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.270
 and especially very practical so after course 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.620
 all you have to do is hide it under the ground when you can see it 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.099
 in the copy at the beginning the video 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.379
 so I hope this stroller this video pleased you cuba thank you to you 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.889
 still have given me this idea to have helped me 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.990
 so here is so if you have questions about everything do not hesitate I 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.009
 reached my dream 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.120
 See you soon for 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.159
 only the numbers what 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.099
 such
