00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.899 
like it'll hold up to complete
submersion<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.890> fine<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.520> don't<00:01:35.790> know

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
submersion just fine but I don't know

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.160 
submersion just fine but I don't know
why<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.210> would<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.509> submerging<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.020> on

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
why you would be submerging this on

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.749 
why you would be submerging this on
water<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.829> don't<00:01:38.189> think<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.520> should<00:01:38.670> even

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
water so I don't think you should even

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.550 
water so I don't think you should even
bother<00:01:39.000> trying<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.049> definitely<00:01:40.409> looks

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
bother trying but it definitely looks

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.230 
bother trying but it definitely looks
like<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.799> splash<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.430> water<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.939> there<00:01:42.090> is

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
like a splash of water here and there is

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.359 
like a splash of water here and there is
no<00:01:42.270> match<00:01:42.659> for<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.130> said<00:01:44.280> this

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
no match for this now like I said this

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.429 
no match for this now like I said this
one<00:01:44.549> cost<00:01:44.759> under<00:01:44.970> $10<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.810> holds<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.229> many

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
one cost under $10 and it holds as many

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.440 
one cost under $10 and it holds as many
cards<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.860> think<00:01:46.920> anyone<00:01:47.399> would<00:01:47.549> need<00:01:47.759> but

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
cards as I think anyone would need but

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.749 
cards as I think anyone would need but
this<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.780> costs<00:01:49.200> somewhere<00:01:49.530> more<00:01:49.860> around<00:01:50.070> $5

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
this one costs somewhere more around $5

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.359 
this one costs somewhere more around $5
and<00:01:51.030> same<00:01:51.689> idea<00:01:52.049> no<00:01:52.320> problem<00:01:52.740> knocking<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.280> on

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
and same idea no problem knocking it on

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.609 
and same idea no problem knocking it on
some<00:01:53.610> wood<00:01:53.759> there<00:01:54.000> nice<00:01:54.780> little<00:01:55.079> class<00:01:55.320> but

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
some wood there nice little class but

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.380 
some wood there nice little class but
they're<00:01:55.710> not<00:01:55.860> nice<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.030> holds

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
they're not nice as that and it holds

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.709 
they're not nice as that and it holds
two<00:01:58.079> CF<00:01:58.380> cards<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.430> SD<00:01:59.759> cards<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.299> did

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
two CF cards and for SD cards I did

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.539 
two CF cards and for SD cards I did
notice<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.380> sell<00:02:01.770> because<00:02:02.070> yeah<00:02:02.460> all

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
notice this one sell because yeah all

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.920 
notice this one sell because yeah all
these<00:02:02.700> rubber<00:02:02.909> sells<00:02:03.180> basically<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.780> same

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
these rubber sells basically the same

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.719 
these rubber sells basically the same
thing<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.890> one<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> little<00:02:05.430> looser

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
thing but this one is a little looser

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.190 
thing but this one is a little looser
doesn't<00:02:06.149> holding<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.479> tight<00:02:06.719> but<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.960> guess<00:02:07.110> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
doesn't holding this tight but I guess I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.510 
doesn't holding this tight but I guess I
could<00:02:07.259> just<00:02:07.350> show<00:02:08.009> me<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> little<00:02:08.340> bit<00:02:08.459> of

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
could just show me a little bit of

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.520 
could just show me a little bit of
sliver<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.330> paper<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.899> there's<00:02:10.020> some<00:02:10.229> make<00:02:10.410> it

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
sliver of paper and there's some make it

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.650 
sliver of paper and there's some make it
squeeze<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
squeeze and

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.570 
squeeze and
hold<00:02:11.870> them<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.110> little<00:02:12.380> better<00:02:12.560> but<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:13.130> mean

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
hold them a little better but I mean

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.370 
hold them a little better but I mean
yeah<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.210> just<00:02:14.450> wouldn't<00:02:14.750> trust<00:02:14.960> that<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.170> should

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
yeah I just wouldn't trust that I should

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.720 
yeah I just wouldn't trust that I should
cut<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.650> off<00:02:15.830> because<00:02:15.950> I'm<00:02:16.250> not<00:02:16.340> gonna<00:02:16.520> trust

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
cut that off because I'm not gonna trust

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.190 
cut that off because I'm not gonna trust
my<00:02:16.910> date<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.240> a<00:02:17.300> little<00:02:17.510> chain<00:02:17.750> like<00:02:17.960> that

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
my date it's a little chain like that

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.940 
my date it's a little chain like that
but<00:02:18.890> anyways<00:02:19.190> these<00:02:19.790> two<00:02:20.060> things<00:02:20.360> had

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
but anyways these two things had

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.260 
but anyways these two things had
practically<00:02:21.950> no<00:02:22.040> cost<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.670> your<00:02:22.760> budget<00:02:23.150> and

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
practically no cost to your budget and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.240 
practically no cost to your budget and
they<00:02:23.600> add<00:02:23.720> practically<00:02:24.320> no<00:02:24.500> size<00:02:24.800> or<00:02:25.040> weight

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
they add practically no size or weight

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.490 
they add practically no size or weight
to<00:02:25.490> your<00:02:25.640> camera<00:02:26.090> bag<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.540> they<00:02:27.380> are

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
to your camera bag and they are

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.160 
to your camera bag and they are
certainly<00:02:28.010> far<00:02:28.640> better<00:02:28.910> than<00:02:29.720> doing<00:02:29.930> one<00:02:30.140> of

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
certainly far better than doing one of

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.890 
certainly far better than doing one of
these

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.070
