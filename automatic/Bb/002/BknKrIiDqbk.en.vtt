their name I'll have it up on the screen
here<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.160> moment

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
here in a moment

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.429 
here in a moment
and<00:00:27.630> basically<00:00:29.510> this<00:00:30.510> viewer<00:00:30.869> was<00:00:31.109> watching

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
and basically this viewer was watching

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.440 
and basically this viewer was watching
one<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.590> my<00:00:31.710> old<00:00:31.920> videos<00:00:32.130> from<00:00:32.730> blender<00:00:33.300> two

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
okay so I you know I figured it'd be

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.170 
okay so I you know I figured it'd be
there<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.229> not<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.890> spent<00:01:38.400> about<00:01:38.460> 10-15

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.490 
there but if not I spent about 10-15
minutes<00:01:39.210> trying<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.720> find<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.350> not

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
minutes trying to find this it's not

minutes trying to find this it's not
there<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.740> tried<00:01:41.040> going<00:01:41.189> into<00:01:42.119> edit<00:01:42.630> mode<00:01:42.990> and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
there I tried going into edit mode and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.740 
there I tried going into edit mode and
having<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.740> look<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.340> tried<00:01:44.610> looking<00:01:44.939> over<00:01:45.240> here

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750

having a look I tried looking over here
for<00:01:46.049> an<00:01:46.140> option<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.009> noticed<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.670> when<00:01:47.759> I

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.910 
for an option I noticed that when I
start<00:01:48.119> typing<00:01:48.479> something<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.409> brings<00:01:49.619> up<00:01:49.799> this

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
paste the file over there but we'd only

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.929 
paste the file over there but we'd only
let<00:01:53.399> me<00:01:53.490> paste<00:01:53.700> one<00:01:54.090> line<00:01:54.329> at<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> time<00:01:55.369> I<00:01:56.369> tried
