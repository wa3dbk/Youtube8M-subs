so this is a fresh flash
there<00:00:20.119> were<00:00:20.269> two<00:00:20.599> images<00:00:21.140> one<00:00:21.769> was

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.780 

operating<00:00:25.500> system<00:00:25.860> flesh<00:00:26.100> yeah<00:00:26.400> there<00:00:26.580> was<00:00:26.760> a

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
operating system flesh yeah there was a

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.420 
operating system flesh yeah there was a
firmware<00:00:27.180> flash<00:00:28.430> performed<00:00:29.430> both<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.760> them

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
firmware flash performed both of them

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.000 
firmware flash performed both of them
read<00:00:32.119> both<00:00:32.270> of<00:00:32.330> them<00:00:32.510> on<00:00:32.810> using<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.410> flasher

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
read both of them on using the flasher

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.670 
read both of them on using the flasher
3.5<00:00:35.350> so

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.420 

as<00:00:38.980> you<00:00:39.100> can<00:00:39.280> see<00:00:39.430> there<00:00:39.610> is<00:00:39.700> no<00:00:39.850> response

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.140 

when<00:00:45.760> these<00:00:45.850> two<00:00:45.969> fingers

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:56.850 

and<00:00:49.600> does<00:00:49.780> what<00:00:49.990> we<00:00:50.110> wrote

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.400 

ladies<00:00:57.520> one<00:00:57.760> finger

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:12.899 

can't<00:01:03.950> select<00:01:04.340> a<00:01:04.460> menu

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.100 

and<00:01:13.360> then<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:14.039> desktop<00:01:15.039> gets<00:01:15.340> tweaked<00:01:16.110> notice

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
and then the desktop gets tweaked notice

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.109 
and then the desktop gets tweaked notice
it<00:01:17.289> shifted<00:01:17.740> over

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.440 

can't<00:01:23.780> decide<00:01:24.140> whether<00:01:24.380> this<00:01:24.649> is<00:01:24.860> the

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
can't decide whether this is the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.030 
can't decide whether this is the
touchscreen<00:01:27.450> problem<00:01:28.320> or

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
touchscreen problem or

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.370 
touchscreen problem or
controller<00:01:30.730> problem<00:01:31.240> which<00:01:31.870> is<00:01:31.990> an<00:01:32.140> actual

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
controller problem which is an actual

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.499 
controller problem which is an actual
hardware<00:01:33.030> problem<00:01:34.030> for<00:01:34.990> a

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.429 

some<00:01:39.140> sort<00:01:39.380> of<00:01:39.409> software<00:01:40.039> problem<00:01:40.430> I<00:01:41.229> think<00:01:42.229> I

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
some sort of software problem I think I

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.410 
some sort of software problem I think I
want<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.680> press<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.310> software<00:01:43.820> issue<00:01:44.030> with

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
want to press the software issue with

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.789 
want to press the software issue with
firmware<00:01:44.930> on<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.350> FOS<00:01:46.420> reflash

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
firmware on the FOS reflash

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.649 
firmware on the FOS reflash
so<00:01:49.369> at<00:01:49.430> this<00:01:49.579> point<00:01:49.909> I<00:01:50.090> need<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.390> decide

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
so at this point I need to decide

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.760 
so at this point I need to decide
whether<00:01:51.100> it's<00:01:52.100> worth<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.700> invest<00:01:52.729> into

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
whether it's worth it to invest into

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.049 
whether it's worth it to invest into
another<00:01:54.770> LCD<00:01:56.049> screen
