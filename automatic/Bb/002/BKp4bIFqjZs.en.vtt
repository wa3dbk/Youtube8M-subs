00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.660 
the two movies she was in she's barely
featured<00:02:00.180> at<00:02:00.540> all<00:02:00.719> like<00:02:01.500> Thomas<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> magic

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
featured at all like Thomas in the magic

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.959 
featured at all like Thomas in the magic
railroad<00:02:02.790> she<00:02:03.360> was<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.780> main<00:02:04.110> focus<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.880> an

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
railroad she was the main focus to an

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.389 
railroad she was the main focus to an
extent<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:07.020> never<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.560> saw<00:02:07.770> her<00:02:07.799> like

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
extent but we never really saw her like

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.820 
extent but we never really saw her like
her<00:02:08.670> because<00:02:08.879> we<00:02:09.090> saw<00:02:09.300> lady<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.500> without<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
her because we saw lady just without the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.080 
her because we saw lady just without the
face

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
face

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.220 
face
so<00:02:12.930> we<00:02:13.560> really<00:02:14.250> didn't<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.150> ladies<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.019> main

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
so we really didn't have ladies the main

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.460 
so we really didn't have ladies the main
focus<00:02:16.860> up<00:02:17.099> until<00:02:17.610> like<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.540> last<00:02:18.569> five<00:02:19.050> or<00:02:19.080> ten

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
focus up until like the last five or ten

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.610 
focus up until like the last five or ten
minutes<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> movie<00:02:20.220> as<00:02:21.170> for<00:02:22.170> calling<00:02:22.470> all

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
minutes of the movie as for calling all

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.800 
minutes of the movie as for calling all
engines<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.400> other<00:02:23.580> movie<00:02:23.970> she<00:02:24.150> was<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.480> she

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
engines the other movie she was in she

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.830 
engines the other movie she was in she
appeared<00:02:25.170> for<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.920> little<00:02:26.459> dream<00:02:26.940> Thomas<00:02:27.599> had

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
appeared for a little dream Thomas had

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.990 
appeared for a little dream Thomas had
that's<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:29.010> she<00:02:29.069> hasn't<00:02:29.400> appeared<00:02:29.580> much<00:02:29.819> in

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
that's it so she hasn't appeared much in

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.180 
that's it so she hasn't appeared much in
the<00:02:30.090> TV<00:02:30.450> series<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.349> guess<00:02:31.799> people<00:02:32.160> like

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
the TV series but I guess people like

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.390 
the TV series but I guess people like
her<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.269> they<00:02:33.360> kept<00:02:33.810> free<00:02:34.110> releasing<00:02:35.040> her<00:02:35.160> she

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
her and they kept free releasing her she

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.309 
her and they kept free releasing her she
was<00:02:35.489> also<00:02:35.640> one<00:02:35.879> of<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.060> first<00:02:36.299> female<00:02:36.629> engines

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
was also one of the first female engines

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.770 
was also one of the first female engines
I<00:02:37.470> believe<00:02:37.760> engine<00:02:38.760> why<00:02:38.910> she<00:02:39.209> was<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.480> first

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
I believe engine why she was the first

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.250 
I believe engine why she was the first
one<00:02:40.459> before<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.610> know<00:02:41.730> Emily<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.480> Rosie<00:02:42.930> and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
one before you know Emily and Rosie and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.309 
one before you know Emily and Rosie and
Molly<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.860> now<00:02:44.640> Caitlin<00:02:45.329> and<00:02:45.360> all<00:02:45.840> these<00:02:46.049> new

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
Molly and now Caitlin and all these new

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.039 
Molly and now Caitlin and all these new
and<00:02:46.560> neutered<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:47.069> don't<00:02:47.280> know<00:02:47.370> something<00:02:48.049> yeah

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
and neutered I don't know something yeah

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.199 
and neutered I don't know something yeah
this<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.349> my<00:02:49.500> discussion<00:02:49.980> on<00:02:50.099> Lady<00:02:50.340> expect

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
this is my discussion on Lady expect

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.809 
this is my discussion on Lady expect
splatter<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.410> dodge<00:02:52.709> next<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.400> then<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.610> think

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
splatter and dodge next and then I think

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.460 
splatter and dodge next and then I think
it<00:02:53.940> can<00:02:54.090> assume<00:02:54.390> who<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.840> last<00:02:55.049> one<00:02:55.319> for

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
it can assume who is the last one for

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.650 
it can assume who is the last one for
