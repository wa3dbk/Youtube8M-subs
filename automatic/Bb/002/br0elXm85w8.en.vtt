00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
it can vary and this is because my

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.740 
it can vary and this is because my
viewer<00:00:17.400> Astrid<00:00:17.910> has<00:00:18.090> asked<00:00:18.330> me<00:00:18.390> something

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
viewer Astrid has asked me something

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.359 
viewer Astrid has asked me something
related<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.920> know<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.100> made<00:00:20.310> a

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
related to this and I know I made a

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.580 
related to this and I know I made a
video<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:21.000> orchid<00:00:21.420> fragrance<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.350> past

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
but this is a bit different so i will

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560 
but this is a bit different so i will
tell<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.890> today<00:00:26.160> based<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.150> orchids<00:00:27.480> that

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
tell you today based on the orchids that

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.689 
tell you today based on the orchids that
i<00:00:27.689> had<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.380> cases<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.800> i<00:00:28.949> had<00:00:29.220> how

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
i had and the cases that i had how

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.669 
i had and the cases that i had how
fragrance<00:00:30.179> can<00:00:30.390> vary<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:31.410> factors

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
fragrance can vary and what factors

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.670 
fragrance can vary and what factors
actually<00:00:32.219> influence<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.300> now<00:00:33.899> first<00:00:34.230> off<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
actually influence it now first off the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.350 
actually influence it now first off the
age<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.309> orchid<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.090> actually

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
age of the orchid this can actually

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.540 
age of the orchid this can actually
influence<00:00:36.710> fragrance<00:00:37.710> quite<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> lot

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
influence fragrance quite a lot

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.549 
influence fragrance quite a lot
particularly<00:00:39.329> if<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> very<00:00:40.260> young

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
particularly if you have a very young

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.619 
particularly if you have a very young
plant<00:00:40.920> which<00:00:41.219> blooms<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> first<00:00:42.090> time<00:00:42.329> as

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
plant which blooms for the first time as

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.360 
plant which blooms for the first time as
you<00:00:43.050> might<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.379> blooms<00:00:43.739> might<00:00:43.980> not<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.280> as

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you might know blooms might not be as

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.549 
you might know blooms might not be as
showy<00:00:44.700> or<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.750> flower<00:00:45.930> spiked<00:00:46.320> in

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
showy or the flower spiked in

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.350 
showy or the flower spiked in
fluorescence<00:00:47.039> might<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.940> big<00:00:48.180> as

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
fluorescence might not be as big as

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.450 
fluorescence might not be as big as
expected<00:00:48.960> when<00:00:49.469> dealing<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.950> very<00:00:50.039> young

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
expected when dealing with a very young

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.760 
expected when dealing with a very young
orchid<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.239> fragrance<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.989> affected<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:52.739> well

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
orchid but fragrance is affected as well

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.040 
orchid but fragrance is affected as well
the<00:00:53.489> best<00:00:53.699> example<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> ring

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
the best example that I have is the ring

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.740 
the best example that I have is the ring
Caritas<00:00:55.500> Bangkok<00:00:55.980> sunset<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.730> any<00:00:57.180> case<00:00:57.480> this

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
Caritas Bangkok sunset in any case this

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.439 
Caritas Bangkok sunset in any case this
orchid<00:00:58.170> was<00:00:58.410> young<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.699> first<00:00:59.940> time<00:01:00.270> it

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
orchid was young so the first time it

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.510 
orchid was young so the first time it
bloomed<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.930> had<00:01:01.109> absolutely<00:01:01.350> no<00:01:02.160> fragrance

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
bloomed it had absolutely no fragrance

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.729 
bloomed it had absolutely no fragrance
at<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:03.030> although<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:04.080> orchid<00:01:04.470> was

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
at all although this orchid was

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.100 
at all although this orchid was
advertised<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:05.909> fragrant<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.960> was<00:01:07.080> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
advertised to be fragrant and I was a

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.410 
advertised to be fragrant and I was a
bit<00:01:07.439> disappointed<00:01:08.310> now<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.850> second

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
bit disappointed now the second

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.300 
bit disappointed now the second
flowering<00:01:10.049> came<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.680> much<00:01:10.860> beautiful

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
flowering came with much beautiful

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.719 
flowering came with much beautiful
flowers<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.150> also<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> fragrance<00:01:13.920> which<00:01:14.520> was

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
flowers and also a fragrance which was

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.460 
flowers and also a fragrance which was
more<00:01:15.000> than<00:01:15.180> actually<00:01:15.600> expected<00:01:16.049> from<00:01:16.229> this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
more than actually expected from this

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.440 
more than actually expected from this
orchid<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.490> flowers<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.000> followed

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
orchid and the flowers that followed

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.230 
orchid and the flowers that followed
were<00:01:18.780> indeed<00:01:19.259> fragrant<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:19.979> well<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.790> this

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
were indeed fragrant as well so this

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020 
were indeed fragrant as well so this
orchid<00:01:21.659> took<00:01:21.960> some<00:01:22.229> time<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.560> adapt<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
orchid took some time to adapt to the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.179 
orchid took some time to adapt to the
new<00:01:24.210> environment<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.229> how<00:01:25.470> her<00:01:25.740> flowers

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
new environment to how her flowers

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.490 
new environment to how her flowers
should<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.150> all<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.750> flowerings<00:01:28.259> ever

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
should be and all the flowerings ever

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.249 
should be and all the flowerings ever
since<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.130> been<00:01:29.159> very<00:01:29.670> nicely<00:01:30.030> fragrant<00:01:30.720> so

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
since have been very nicely fragrant so

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.140 
since have been very nicely fragrant so
first<00:01:31.500> thing<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.040> influence<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
first thing that can influence the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.480 
first thing that can influence the
fragrance<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.689> an<00:01:33.840> orchid<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.439> its<00:01:34.860> age<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
fragrance of an orchid is its age the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.760 
fragrance of an orchid is its age the
younger<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.060> orchid<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.900> more<00:01:37.079> prone<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.650> is

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
younger the orchid the more prone it is

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.190 
younger the orchid the more prone it is
to<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.369> release<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.060> full<00:01:39.390> potential<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:40.020> its

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
to not release the full potential of its

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.649 
to not release the full potential of its
fragrance<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:41.130> release<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.729> at<00:01:41.880> all<00:01:42.060> now

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
fragrance or not release it at all now

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.899 
fragrance or not release it at all now
second<00:01:43.020> factor<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.350> season<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:44.610> are<00:01:44.729> some

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
second factor is season there are some

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.910 
second factor is season there are some
orchids<00:01:45.270> which<00:01:45.450> tend<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.840> prefer<00:01:46.020> particular

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
orchids which tend to prefer particular

orchids which tend to prefer particular
growing<00:01:47.430> conditions<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> case<00:01:48.570> of

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
growing conditions like in the case of

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.319 
growing conditions like in the case of
Nellie<00:01:49.110> Eyler<00:01:49.649> she<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.340> actually<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.970> cool

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
Nellie Eyler she is actually a cool

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.210 
Nellie Eyler she is actually a cool
grower<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.840> she<00:01:52.200> struggles<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.829> bit<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.070> my

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
grower and she struggles a bit in my

orchid went through some trouble she is

orchid went through some trouble she is
spending<00:02:50.990> quite<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.500> lot<00:02:51.710> of<00:02:51.830> energy<00:02:52.070> in

spending quite a lot of energy in

spending quite a lot of energy in

producing a new root system if it's the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.430 
producing a new root system if it's the

does<00:02:57.890> not<00:02:58.220> give<00:02:59.120> out<00:02:59.270> as<00:02:59.450> much<00:02:59.630> energy<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.380> the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
does not give out as much energy to the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.500 
does not give out as much energy to the
blooms<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.550> blooms<00:03:01.790> might<00:03:02.000> actually<00:03:02.180> be

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
blooms so the blooms might actually be

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.110 
blooms so the blooms might actually be
smaller<00:03:02.900> smaller<00:03:03.770> in<00:03:04.130> numbers<00:03:04.520> as<00:03:04.700> well<00:03:04.730> and

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
smaller smaller in numbers as well and

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.020 
smaller smaller in numbers as well and
also<00:03:05.440> lack<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.710> fragrance<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.370> are<00:03:07.490> used<00:03:07.790> to

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
also lack the fragrance you are used to

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.850 
also lack the fragrance you are used to
so<00:03:08.330> I<00:03:08.360> would<00:03:08.720> say<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.290> third<00:03:09.560> major

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
so I would say that the third major

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.550 
so I would say that the third major
factor<00:03:10.490> that<00:03:10.700> makes<00:03:11.000> fragrance<00:03:11.570> variable<00:03:12.380> is

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
factor that makes fragrance variable is

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.340 
factor that makes fragrance variable is
the<00:03:12.980> health<00:03:13.250> of<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.730> orchid<00:03:14.180> first<00:03:14.810> factor

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
the health of the orchid first factor

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.140 
the health of the orchid first factor
which<00:03:15.710> can<00:03:15.950> influence<00:03:16.160> fragrance<00:03:16.940> is

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
which can influence fragrance is

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.870 
which can influence fragrance is
genetics<00:03:17.930> unfortunately<00:03:18.830> we<00:03:19.010> cannot<00:03:19.400> do<00:03:19.610> much

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
genetics unfortunately we cannot do much

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.420 
genetics unfortunately we cannot do much
here<00:03:20.360> so<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:20.900> have<00:03:21.260> an<00:03:21.380> example<00:03:21.710> the<00:03:21.980> hands<00:03:22.160> well

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
here so I have an example the hands well

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.480 
here so I have an example the hands well

it<00:03:28.130> might<00:03:28.580> have<00:03:28.850> a<00:03:28.880> fragrance<00:03:29.420> some<00:03:29.840> say<00:03:30.140> that

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
it might have a fragrance some say that

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.780 
it might have a fragrance some say that
this<00:03:30.500> work<00:03:30.710> it<00:03:30.830> does<00:03:31.220> indeed<00:03:31.430> have<00:03:31.610> a

fragrance now somewhere in her parentage
she<00:03:34.370> might<00:03:34.550> have<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:35.060> fragrant<00:03:35.630> parent<00:03:36.170> but

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
she might have a fragrant parent but

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.490 
she might have a fragrant parent but
because<00:03:37.130> seeds<00:03:37.700> can<00:03:38.030> vary<00:03:38.300> greatly<00:03:38.390> from<00:03:38.930> one

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
because seeds can vary greatly from one

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.230

to<00:03:39.740> another<00:03:39.860> even<00:03:40.370> though<00:03:40.670> you<00:03:40.820> might<00:03:41.180> not

notice<00:03:41.990> the<00:03:42.830> difference<00:03:43.280> physically<00:03:43.910> let's

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
notice the difference physically let's

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.420 
notice the difference physically let's
say<00:03:44.360> fragrance<00:03:45.320> might<00:03:45.710> lack<00:03:46.070> in<00:03:46.250> some

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
say fragrance might lack in some

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.820 
say fragrance might lack in some
individuals<00:03:46.760> so<00:03:47.390> this<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:47.870> one<00:03:48.200> example<00:03:48.410> that

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
individuals so this is one example that

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.100 
individuals so this is one example that
I<00:03:48.890> have<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.460> also<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:49.970> second<00:03:50.420> example<00:03:50.780> is<00:03:51.050> the

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
I have and also a second example is the

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.130 
I have and also a second example is the

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
fragrant so forth factor is indeed

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.970 
fragrant so forth factor is indeed
genetics<00:04:05.240> this<00:04:05.720> is<00:04:05.870> not<00:04:06.020> as<00:04:06.230> widely<00:04:06.470> spread

remember her plumes were a particular

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.790 
remember her plumes were a particular
color<00:04:28.850> pattern<00:04:29.420> her<00:04:29.930> fragrance<00:04:30.560> is<00:04:30.740> a

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
particular color pattern as well it is

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.740 
particular color pattern as well it is
not<00:04:33.470> as<00:04:33.710> intense<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:34.520> might<00:04:34.760> not<00:04:34.910> be<00:04:34.970> as<00:04:35.300> sweet

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
not as intense it might not be as sweet

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.740 
not as intense it might not be as sweet
as<00:04:35.990> other<00:04:36.730> specimens<00:04:37.730> from<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.240> encyclical

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
as other specimens from the encyclical

as other specimens from the encyclical
deidre<00:04:39.440> family<00:04:39.950> and<00:04:40.160> this<00:04:40.430> is<00:04:40.580> because<00:04:40.730> the

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
deidre family and this is because the

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.080 
deidre family and this is because the
species<00:04:41.780> itself<00:04:41.960> is<00:04:42.460> variable<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:43.910> the

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
species itself is variable so the

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.630 
species itself is variable so the
fragrance<00:04:44.600> will<00:04:44.870> vary<00:04:45.230> accordingly<00:04:45.920> some

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
fragrance will vary accordingly some

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
these are topics that I actually covered

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.470 
these are topics that I actually covered
in<00:05:16.040> my<00:05:16.190> previous<00:05:16.550> video<00:05:16.730> which<00:05:17.150> you<00:05:17.270> can<00:05:17.450> find

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.470 
in my previous video which you can find
here<00:05:17.990> actually<00:05:18.500> so<00:05:19.280> I<00:05:19.310> will<00:05:19.640> not<00:05:19.790> go<00:05:20.030> into<00:05:20.060> them

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
here actually so I will not go into them

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.690 
here actually so I will not go into them
but<00:05:20.870> for<00:05:21.140> the<00:05:21.320> main<00:05:21.530> part<00:05:21.830> an<00:05:22.100> orchid<00:05:22.580> that

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
but for the main part an orchid that

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.000 
but for the main part an orchid that

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
which are not hydrated why not release

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.810 
which are not hydrated why not release
