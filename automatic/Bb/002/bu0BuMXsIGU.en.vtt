00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.550
 Hello dear viewers 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.570
 preparing for the new planting season 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.030
 just begins 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.220
 in the fall it would seem that you can do in 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.560
 garden in late October early November 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.529
 but it is at this time that we begin 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.330
 sow various cultures advantage 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.939
 under winter seeding is that we can 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.349
 get a fresh crop for 2-3 weeks 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.920
 earlier than usual 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.020
 In addition, we have significantly reduced the time 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.040
 works in the garden in the spring since part 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.590
 we have already completed 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.719
 the most important thing when sowing beets and others 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.620
 crops before winter is right to choose 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.530
 planting time 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.320
 best to sow beets in late October 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.950
 in early November when the earth is already in time 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.469
 cool down if the snow fell is not scary 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.010
 air temperature should be -24 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.239
 degrees 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.340
 and soil temperature plus 24 seeds 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.949
 in no case should have time to hold a 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.920
 Only swell on Dima can sow 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.020
 different cultures onion garlic celery 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.479
 radishes and herbs 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.030
 Today we will talk and under winter sowing 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.890
 beets when choosing seeds need first 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.869
 turn to pay attention to them 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.900
 cold resistance and remember that for 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.119
 underground seed sowing required on 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.700
 20-25 percent more than for spring 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.020
 for underground sowing are perfect 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.380
 early ripe varieties 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.270
 bolting- resistant bed for 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.220
 beet crops before winter 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.500
 should be placed on high well 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.500
 lit place since sunlight 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.600
 promotes early maturation 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.090
 root crops and their more intense 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.380
 for dyeing prepare bed for under 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.049
 winter sowing beets 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.420
 necessary in advance until the soil is frozen 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.899
 so it will be much easier for you to dig 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.579
 break up lumps and pick weeds 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.799
 beets do not like very acidic soil on 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.700
 which grows sedge plantain and others 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.860
 weeds therefore before sowing the soil 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.290
 organic fertilizer must be applied 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.979
 at the rate of 5 liters per meter 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.340
 square 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.069
 dolomite flour at the rate of half a liter per 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.120
 one meter square and phosphorus-potash 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.340
 fertilizers 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.900
 calculations 10-15 grams per meter 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.510
 square I prepared a bed in advance 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.970
 dug over the soil and weeds climbed 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.150
 made the necessary fertilizers and 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.069
 leveled the bed rake now you can 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.379
 assign to start sowing beets 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.599
 no special rules for sowing 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.569
 beets before winter there is not everything is done exactly 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.640
 as well as spring seeds are sown on 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.150
 distance of 5-10 centimeters from each 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.340
 a friend to a depth of 35 centimeters now I'm 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.170
 I'll make the grooves they should be exactly 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.510
 same as the grooves that you make 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.739
 in the spring 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.739
 depth should be 35 cm 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.380
 the distance between the grooves 30-40 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.380
 centimeters 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.650
 now under winter sowing the seeds are not 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.210
 need not how to handle remember that 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.710
 seeds and earth should be dry 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.890
 carefully sow beets and sprinkle 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.890
 by land 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.900
 we sow seeds at a distance of 35 cm 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.050
 can be used for backfilling 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.680
 loose nutrient ground for this 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:43.030
 mix in equal proportions river 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.430
 sand plain ground and a little 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.990
 rotten compost I already did it 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.990
 I 'll start falling asleep now 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:27.099
 the ground must be warm therefore keep 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:29.979
 his house in Sarajevo for mulching 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:31.899
 downs thanks perfect purple 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.169
 camp top or special ground for 

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:34.169
 seedlings 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:48.240
 in the spring when the snow melts need to be removed 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:50.699
 all the material that you covered beets 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.710
 for the winter and fertilize 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.439
 and also a little blasting the entire top layer 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.899
 soil if you want to harvest on 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:06:01.110
 a week earlier you can cover the crops 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:04.529
 film removal is needed when they start 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.479
 appear first shoots after about 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:09.210
 six days after emergence 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.469
 they will need to be won remember that 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.770
 beet like others 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:16.199
 sown under the winter plants are not approaches 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.849
 for long-term storage that's actually 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:22.789
 and all I wanted to tell you 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:22.789
 I wish you a good harvest and good luck
