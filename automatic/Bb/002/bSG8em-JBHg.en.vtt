00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:04.600
 the pearl jewelery wants to amaze documentaries &amp; blessed of once again 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.980
 let the name I appreciate artistic craftsmanship up-close 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.980
 Venetian 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.800
 the diffusion of the skilful glass processing is born in the states you are not 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.210
 the one in the lagoon of Venice and from the thirteenth century for reasons of 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.210
 security continues on the island of Murano where all the furnaces are kept 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.919
 first located in the historic center 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.749
 this millenary undoubtedly one of the most famous symbols in the world of 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:32.640
 made in Italy 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.970
 that it transmits its secrets from generation to generation and despite 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.420
 attempts nobody can reveal pietradura masterpieces of the same 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.640
 uniqueness and in the same terenzio 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.410
 an experience really enters a laboratory of the parliamentary teachers 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.719
 very pleasant also for the environment in which one finds oneself 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.829
 the enormous variety of colors of glass canes ready to be 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.180
 transformed into small works of art 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.360
 the multitude of work tools was called fire 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.280
 eliminate creative lab folders 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.040
 and like this apprentice but 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.040
 sea ​​san really picturesque features 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.330
 the work station of the ironworks 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.260
 Dominican chinchar terms indicates the artist who performs the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.890
 work 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.960
 because of his sitting in front of the so-called fire chamber 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.330
 this is a kind of refractory material that produces a 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.890
 heat ranging from 800 integrals 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.890
 allows you to maintain heat stability 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.490
 the body of the craft is protected by a spark arrester back while the hands are protected 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.900
 who work must endure a very high temperature 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.350
 before enchanting me with the artistic performance of only some specimens 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.210
 of infinite variety of textiles 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.880
 achievable with the hands of our prayers we see some basic elements 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.310
 of Venetian creations here are the more or less thick glass filaments of 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.580
 diameter that will be used as pinelli to create meticulous hercules 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.740
 on earth 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.550
 and whether it is female from flame-heated life sticks and pulled 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.960
 manually the material that thanks to the work experience you will succeed 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.080
 penis diameter strategy needed 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.060
 a particular life is that called reteccia woven warm glass where 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.380
 scratch the fusion of more bacchetti numana wisdom an internal design to the 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.199
 life itself 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.369
 it is natural that the higher the number of teeth used in the 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:20.999
 creating a salt 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.809
 the greater its complexity of realization its value 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:28.880
 in detail these flat ones will be used to make the belt 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.340
 basic element of the pages in a typical niche dish that does not constitute the 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.270
 central band and then lateral with respect to the end of the pearl 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:40.789
 it's a life of irina adventures 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:44.529
 it was no legend that the famous aventurine became a typical material 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:48.909
 of the Venetian tradition of discovery by chance as suggested by the 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.470
 name for fortune 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.699
 in a desert 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.869
 given the volcanic creation of the fused suspensions connected to the beginning 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:58.809
 they revealed the peculiar brilliance 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.689
 of this powder of mixed frogs and crystals 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.219
 the ball you see now, for example, is composed of adventurine belts 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.459
 a processing by mail moment goal 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.459
 and is enriched by a decoration of tiny little leaves 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.869
 the execution is true of the work 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:18.399
 provides first of all the creation of the so-called soul of the 3rd 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.739
 the soul of the pearl is the initial glass casting that prepares the base up 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.790
 which will eventually go to apply the gold leaf and on which later several 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.790
 passages would be a final stage of decorum 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.249
 we come to you that the soul of the party 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:39.409
 but in his hand two glass rods that he is about to run on a wand of 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.139
 ravenna metal chosen because it is the only one to have the wait is over 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.079
 identical to that of vasodilatation glass in the heating phase 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.509
 in short, it is equal to the dilation of the back and also in the cooling phase 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:55.019
 the good material has the same that ended in re-entering that entails 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.549
 the lowest incidence of breakage possible our career begins with the rivetta 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.760
 in the copper wire 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.309
 containing when necessary 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:08.379
 the so-called bronzino is used to help obtain the desired shape and bay 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.749
 nocturnal because the incandescent glass does not stick to this 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:14.009
 material 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:19.009
 when the movement is between the thumb and forefinger the others can 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.859
 support only 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.370
 it should be noted that the Arianna thread always turns only forward towards the outside 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.120
 can never possibly change around 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.710
 sico you told her and downloaded the old doc ordering all the movements 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.050
 another great difficulty 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.120
 without I could never stop 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.460
 this said our career is one of the most complicated things to learn 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:45.249
 in any case the great precision of the leather does not only manifest itself in the hands 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:46.520
 but that the eye 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.070
 for example the ability to cast the exact amount behind 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.930
 to add the desired shape one acquires only with experience 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.099
 that of the brown ray leather cooperates with great patience the meticulousness 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.020
 there is a school who teaches glass-making courses 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.660
 tenerife climate does not respect the fire 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.130
 but to learn to be productive and therefore not just an artisan artist 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.129
 need years of experience 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:15.119
 as it contracts the production manuality comes from tamarri di 

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:17.139
 laboratory 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.199
 the versatility of Murano glass lends itself to endless applications 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.430
 to satisfy your curiosity about the artistic processing stages 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.250
 if the precious decorations of the pearls are good for you and to understand how they are made 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.750
 cooling and prepared by threading command to absolutely follow the 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.009
 next episode thanks for being with us
