factory glass bottle is going to have a
harder<00:01:16.470> spout<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.430> not<00:01:17.729> leak<00:01:18.060> proof<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.920> it

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
harder spout it is not leak proof so it

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.590 
harder spout it is not leak proof so it
will<00:01:20.159> leak<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.610> tip<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.790> upside<00:01:21.030> down<00:01:21.240> and

will leak if you tip it upside down and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.320 
will leak if you tip it upside down and
there's<00:01:22.290> no<00:01:22.470> travel<00:01:22.890> case<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.460> one<00:01:23.640> the

there's no travel case with that one the
cool<00:01:24.540> thing<00:01:24.570> about<00:01:24.780> life<00:01:25.140> factory<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.860> go

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
cool thing about life factory as you go

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.550 
cool thing about life factory as you go
even<00:01:26.460> higher<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.479> now<00:01:27.630> make<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.869> 12-ounce

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
even higher up they now make a 12-ounce

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.999 
even higher up they now make a 12-ounce
straw<00:01:29.040> cap<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.270> has<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.500> spout<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:31.799> that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
straw cap so it has a spout here that

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.359 
straw cap so it has a spout here that
just<00:01:32.189> comes<00:01:32.460> out<00:01:32.960> if<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.110> open<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.710> pose<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
just comes out if we open it up pose a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.179 
just comes out if we open it up pose a
silicone<00:01:35.970> straw<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> inside<00:01:37.170> once<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.070> get

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
silicone straw on the inside once we get

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.190 
silicone straw on the inside once we get
to<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.490> size<00:01:38.759> caps<00:01:39.689> will<00:01:39.869> become

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
to this size caps will become

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.929 
to this size caps will become
interchangeable<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.460> from<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.729> straw

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
interchangeable you can go from a straw

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.139 
interchangeable you can go from a straw
cap<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> flat<00:01:42.689> cap<00:01:42.930> or<00:01:43.200> spout<00:01:43.820> as<00:01:44.820> far<00:01:45.119> as

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
cap to a flat cap or spout as far as

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.539 
cap to a flat cap or spout as far as
these<00:01:45.479> sizes<00:01:45.750> all<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.259> these<00:01:46.590> caps<00:01:46.950> nipples

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
these sizes all of these caps nipples

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.100 
these sizes all of these caps nipples
and<00:01:47.850> sippie's<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.420> interchangeable<00:01:48.930> between

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
and sippie's are interchangeable between

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.950 
and sippie's are interchangeable between
the<00:01:49.439> bottle<00:01:49.710> sizes<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.310> well<00:01:50.570> similar<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.689> pura

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the bottle sizes as well similar to pura

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.280 
the bottle sizes as well similar to pura
and<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.159> sippy<00:01:53.790> cup<00:01:54.000> will<00:01:54.570> go<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
and so the sippy cup will go on to the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.190 
and so the sippy cup will go on to the
smaller<00:01:56.009> bottle<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.700> vice<00:01:56.939> versa<00:01:57.240> whatever

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
smaller bottle and vice versa whatever

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.050 
smaller bottle and vice versa whatever
you<00:01:58.409> want<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:58.829> they<00:01:59.430> are<00:01:59.579> coming<00:01:59.909> out<00:02:00.000> with

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
you want to do they are coming out with

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.969 
you want to do they are coming out with
a<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:00.570> great<00:02:00.719> straw<00:02:01.110> cap<00:02:01.350> option<00:02:01.829> as<00:02:01.950> well

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
a really great straw cap option as well

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.679 
a really great straw cap option as well
which<00:02:02.340> will<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.579> comparable<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> light

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
which will be comparable to the light

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.419 
which will be comparable to the light
factory<00:02:03.930> one<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
factory one and that is it that is the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.410 
factory one and that is it that is the
comparison<00:02:08.819> between<00:02:09.090> my<00:02:09.509> factory<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.200> pure
