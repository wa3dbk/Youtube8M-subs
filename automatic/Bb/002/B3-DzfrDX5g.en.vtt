I don't know if I want to take that

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.030 
I don't know if I want to take that
chance<00:03:42.689> like<00:03:43.689> I<00:03:43.810> said<00:03:44.049> I'm<00:03:44.170> dying<00:03:44.439> to<00:03:44.680> throw<00:03:44.889> it

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
chance like I said I'm dying to throw it

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.929 
chance like I said I'm dying to throw it
but<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:46.720> know<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:47.079> really<00:03:47.709> really<00:03:48.370> like<00:03:48.700> this

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
but you know I really really like this

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.150 
but you know I really really like this
piece<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:49.599> want<00:03:49.840> it<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.109> stay<00:03:51.040> intact<00:03:51.639> so<00:03:52.510> I

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
piece and I want it to stay intact so I

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.819 
piece and I want it to stay intact so I
guess<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.519> will<00:03:54.760> see<00:03:55.060> if<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.449> itch<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:56.709> know

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
guess I will see if the itch you know

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.890 
guess I will see if the itch you know
gets<00:03:57.129> too<00:03:57.340> bad<00:03:57.579> and<00:03:57.819> I<00:03:57.879> have<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.239> throw<00:03:58.449> it<00:03:58.660> but

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
gets too bad and I have to throw it but

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.449 
gets too bad and I have to throw it but

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.129 
as for now I think I'm going to hold off
