except this time we're going to be doing

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.600 
except this time we're going to be doing
it<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:12.150> hard<00:00:12.840> mode<00:00:13.049> now<00:00:13.950> if<00:00:14.040> you've<00:00:14.219> seen<00:00:14.429> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
it on hard mode now if you've seen the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.550 
it on hard mode now if you've seen the
video<00:00:14.880> where<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.240> solo<00:00:15.540> beat<00:00:15.900> reverse<00:00:16.320> their

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
video where I solo beat reverse their

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.260 
video where I solo beat reverse their
best<00:00:16.830> part<00:00:17.130> with<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.490> hunter<00:00:17.789> with<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
best part with the hunter with the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.359 
best part with the hunter with the
normal<00:00:18.840> difficulty<00:00:19.289> then<00:00:19.890> you'll<00:00:20.039> notice

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
normal difficulty then you'll notice

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.320 
normal difficulty then you'll notice
that<00:00:20.400> there's<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.910> be<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.060> lot<00:00:21.300> of

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
that there's going to be a lot of

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.060 
that there's going to be a lot of
similarities<00:00:22.050> between<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.590> two<00:00:22.619> because

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
similarities between the two because

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.679 
similarities between the two because
we're<00:00:23.400> basically<00:00:23.760> going<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.269> using<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
we're basically going to be using the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.200 
we're basically going to be using the
same<00:00:24.930> strategy<00:00:25.619> which<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.340> try<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:26.970> stay

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
same strategy which is to try to stay

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.570 
same strategy which is to try to stay
invisible<00:00:27.510> as<00:00:27.900> long<00:00:28.109> as<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.439> can<00:00:28.680> by<00:00:29.340> using

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
invisible as long as you can by using

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.179 
invisible as long as you can by using
your<00:00:29.880> melee<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.570> by<00:00:30.900> crouching<00:00:31.260> now<00:00:31.949> I'm<00:00:32.009> not

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
your melee and by crouching now I'm not

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.650 
your melee and by crouching now I'm not
going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> waste<00:00:32.520> any<00:00:32.759> time<00:00:32.820> when<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.270> comes<00:00:33.450> to

class setup in this video anyways the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.850 
class setup in this video anyways the
only<00:00:51.570> difference<00:00:51.899> between<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.320> setup<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.680> have

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
only difference between the setup I have

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.069 
only difference between the setup I have
now<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.910> setup<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> use<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> normal

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
now in the setup that I use the normal

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.139 
now in the setup that I use the normal
mode<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.340> I'm<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.699> using<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
mode is that I'm going to be using the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.080 
mode is that I'm going to be using the
icebreaker<00:00:57.840> instead<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.920> murmur<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.699> my

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
icebreaker instead of the murmur as my

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.910 
icebreaker instead of the murmur as my
special<00:01:00.329> weapon<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.530> reason<00:01:01.710> i<00:01:01.890> chose

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
special weapon and the reason i chose

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.509 
special weapon and the reason i chose
the<00:01:02.309> icebreaker<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.690> because<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:05.010> one<00:01:05.250> it

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the icebreaker it's because for one it

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.060 
the icebreaker it's because for one it
has<00:01:05.670> plus<00:01:05.909> 2<00:01:06.090> character<00:01:06.570> agility<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.290> 42<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
has plus 2 character agility and 42 it

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.700 
has plus 2 character agility and 42 it
makes<00:01:08.280> enemies<00:01:08.600> explode<00:01:09.600> when<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.290> kill<00:01:10.590> them

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
makes enemies explode when you kill them

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.620 
makes enemies explode when you kill them
and<00:01:10.890> when<00:01:11.250> they<00:01:11.280> explode<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:12.090> also<00:01:12.240> kill

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and when they explode they also kill

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.870 
and when they explode they also kill
other<00:01:12.960> enemies<00:01:13.470> around<00:01:13.770> them<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> didn't

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
other enemies around them now I didn't

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.609 
other enemies around them now I didn't
really<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> icebreaker<00:01:15.780> justice<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
really do the icebreaker justice and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.609 
really do the icebreaker justice and
this<00:01:17.430> playthrough<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.689> usually<00:01:19.110> when<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.290> solo

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
this playthrough but usually when I solo

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.380 
this playthrough but usually when I solo
this<00:01:19.950> diversity<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.670> part<00:01:20.939> whether<00:01:21.180> it's

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
this diversity of this part whether it's

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.510 
this diversity of this part whether it's
all<00:01:21.509> normal<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:21.990> hard<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.619> tend<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> use<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
all normal or hard I tend to use the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
all normal or hard I tend to use the
icebreaker<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.630> whenever<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:25.020> bunch<00:01:25.229> of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
icebreaker and whenever a bunch of

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.320 
icebreaker and whenever a bunch of
enemies<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.979> behind<00:01:26.400> me<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.820> can't<00:01:27.119> use<00:01:27.180> my

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
enemies get behind me and I can't use my

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.929 
enemies get behind me and I can't use my
melee<00:01:27.840> or<00:01:27.869> Crouch<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.829> end<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:29.490> using<00:01:29.700> my

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
melee or Crouch I end up using my

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.300 
melee or Crouch I end up using my
icebreaker<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.470> takes<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> lot<00:01:32.189> of

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
icebreaker and it takes out a lot of

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.609 
icebreaker and it takes out a lot of
enemies<00:01:32.729> at<00:01:33.000> once<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.320> only<00:01:34.439> other

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
enemies at once and the only other

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.620 
enemies at once and the only other
difference<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.280> my<00:01:35.369> class<00:01:35.610> setup<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.390> now

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
difference in my class setup is that now

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.560 
difference in my class setup is that now
I'm<00:01:36.810> using<00:01:36.990> my<00:01:37.500> new<00:01:38.009> raid<00:01:38.340> armor<00:01:38.909> which<00:01:39.299> got<00:01:39.540> me

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
I'm using my new raid armor which got me

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.710 
I'm using my new raid armor which got me
two<00:01:39.810> level<00:01:40.079> 32<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> intellect<00:01:41.909> discipline

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
two level 32 so the intellect discipline

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.780 
two level 32 so the intellect discipline
and<00:01:42.899> strength<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> slightly<00:01:43.950> different<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
and strength is slightly different I

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.580 
and strength is slightly different I
would<00:01:45.060> recommend<00:01:45.390> trying<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.020> invest<00:01:46.409> in

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
would recommend trying to invest in

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.380 
would recommend trying to invest in
strength<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.130> much<00:01:47.310> as<00:01:47.490> possible<00:01:47.670> because

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
strength as much as possible because

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.270 
strength as much as possible because
that<00:01:48.780> will<00:01:48.899> allow<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.470> use<00:01:49.619> your<00:01:49.829> mail<00:01:50.130> a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
that will allow you to use your mail a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.219 
that will allow you to use your mail a
special<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.970> when<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.450> use<00:01:51.720> your<00:01:51.869> mail<00:01:52.079> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
special and when you use your mail a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.740 
special and when you use your mail a
special<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.250> go<00:01:53.430> invisible<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.509> would

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
special you go invisible so I would

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.719 
special you go invisible so I would
definitely<00:01:54.780> recommend<00:01:55.280> trying<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.549> some

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
definitely recommend trying to get some

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.609 
definitely recommend trying to get some
armor<00:01:57.060> with<00:01:57.210> strength<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.259> even<00:01:58.409> if

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
armor with strength in it but even if

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.990 
armor with strength in it but even if
you<00:01:58.740> don't<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:58.979> armor<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> light<00:01:59.880> of

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
you don't have armor with the light of

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.280 
you don't have armor with the light of
strength<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.390> should<00:02:00.570> still<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.990> able<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
strength you should still be able to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.230 
strength you should still be able to
solo<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.829> first<00:02:02.070> part<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.909> don't<00:02:03.149> have

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
solo this first part and you don't have

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.959 
solo this first part and you don't have
to<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.509> level<00:02:03.810> 32<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.890> solo<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.430> first<00:02:05.670> part

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
to be level 32 to solo this first part

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.440 
to be level 32 to solo this first part
on<00:02:06.119> heart<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.200> also<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.860> level<00:02:08.550> 31<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
on heart you can also be level 31 and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.380 
on heart you can also be level 31 and
although<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> haven't<00:02:10.470> seen<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.979> or<00:02:11.190> tried<00:02:11.580> it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
although I haven't seen it or tried it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.690 
although I haven't seen it or tried it
you<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.170> at<00:02:13.290> level<00:02:13.560> 30<00:02:13.800> as<00:02:14.010> well<00:02:14.280> now

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
you can do it at level 30 as well now

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.280 
you can do it at level 30 as well now
when<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:14.940> comes<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.330> strategy<00:02:15.569> are<00:02:15.930> using

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
when it comes to the strategy are using

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.050 
when it comes to the strategy are using
this<00:02:16.410> video<00:02:16.709> obviously<00:02:17.610> you're<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.940> be

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
this video obviously you're going to be

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.760 
this video obviously you're going to be
switching<00:02:18.390> between<00:02:18.480> your<00:02:18.810> melee<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.500> you're

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
switching between your melee and you're

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.890 
switching between your melee and you're
crouching<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.580> would<00:02:20.910> recommend<00:02:21.209> using<00:02:21.630> your

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
crouching I would recommend using your

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.199 
crouching I would recommend using your
crouching<00:02:22.500> whenever<00:02:22.860> possible<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.730> trying

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
crouching whenever possible and trying

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.330 
crouching whenever possible and trying
to<00:02:24.360> save<00:02:24.569> your<00:02:24.720> melee<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.440> those<00:02:25.590> emergency

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
to save your melee for those emergency

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.640 
to save your melee for those emergency
situations<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.360> then<00:02:27.780> for<00:02:27.959> whatever<00:02:28.110> reason

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
situations and then for whatever reason

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.800 
situations and then for whatever reason
you're<00:02:28.800> crouching<00:02:29.310> isn't<00:02:29.730> working<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.330> your

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
you're crouching isn't working and your

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.140 
you're crouching isn't working and your
mail<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.170> specialism<00:02:31.740> fool<00:02:32.100> remember<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:33.000> can

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
mail a specialism fool remember you can

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.970 
mail a specialism fool remember you can
always<00:02:33.240> go<00:02:33.540> invisible<00:02:33.810> by<00:02:34.170> using<00:02:34.410> your<00:02:34.590> super

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
always go invisible by using your super

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.860 
always go invisible by using your super
ability<00:02:35.430> but<00:02:35.760> i<00:02:35.820> would<00:02:36.060> recommend<00:02:36.540> saving

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
ability but i would recommend saving

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.080 
ability but i would recommend saving
your<00:02:37.380> super<00:02:37.740> ability<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.520> very<00:02:38.730> end

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
your super ability to the very end

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.960 
your super ability to the very end
because<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.989> lot<00:02:40.230> easier<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:41.160> do<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.760> end

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
because it's a lot easier to do the end

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.120 
because it's a lot easier to do the end
of<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.569> traverse<00:02:42.870> attia<00:02:43.110> best<00:02:43.350> part<00:02:43.590> if<00:02:43.860> you

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
of the traverse attia best part if you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.310 
of the traverse attia best part if you
have<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.340> super<00:02:44.820> ability<00:02:45.239> fool<00:02:45.450> as<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:46.170> will

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
have a super ability fool as you will

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.350 
have a super ability fool as you will
see<00:02:46.350> later<00:02:46.770> on<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.310> video<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:48.120> also<00:02:48.239> want

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
see later on in the video you also want

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.729 
see later on in the video you also want
to<00:02:48.510> make<00:02:48.570> sure<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.050> set<00:02:49.230> your<00:02:49.410> agility

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
to make sure that you set your agility

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.100 
to make sure that you set your agility
as<00:02:50.100> high<00:02:50.280> as<00:02:50.459> possible<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.450> also<00:02:51.630> doesn't

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
as high as possible and it also doesn't

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.949 
as high as possible and it also doesn't
hurt<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.590> invest<00:02:53.250> in<00:02:53.459> some<00:02:53.640> armor<00:02:54.090> as<00:02:54.209> well<00:02:54.450> now

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
hurt to invest in some armor as well now

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.870 
hurt to invest in some armor as well now
when<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.170> comes<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.470> recovery<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.250> my<00:02:56.580> opinion

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
when it comes to recovery in my opinion

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.540 
when it comes to recovery in my opinion
it's<00:02:57.390> basically<00:02:57.989> pointless<00:02:58.530> during<00:02:59.370> the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
it's basically pointless during the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.400 
it's basically pointless during the
traversa<00:02:59.970> t<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.360> part<00:03:00.630> because<00:03:01.230> more

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
traversa t of this part because more

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.540 
traversa t of this part because more
often<00:03:01.560> than<00:03:01.739> not<00:03:01.830> when<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.160> go<00:03:02.280> invisible

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
often than not when you go invisible

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.520 
often than not when you go invisible
you'll<00:03:02.970> have<00:03:03.150> plenty<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.570> time<00:03:03.660> for<00:03:04.380> your

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
you'll have plenty of time for your

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.500 
you'll have plenty of time for your
health<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.920> recover<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.880> instead<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.269> would

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
health to recover so instead I would

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.660 
health to recover so instead I would
just<00:03:06.690> focus<00:03:06.870> on<00:03:07.200> trying<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.220> increase<00:03:08.519> your

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
just focus on trying to increase your

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.210 
just focus on trying to increase your
agility<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.750> armor<00:03:10.380> as<00:03:10.560> much<00:03:10.860> as<00:03:11.010> possible

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
agility and armor as much as possible

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.759 
agility and armor as much as possible
and<00:03:11.700> don't<00:03:11.970> even<00:03:12.239> worry<00:03:12.450> about<00:03:12.540> recovery<00:03:13.260> now

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
and don't even worry about recovery now

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
invisible and at this point the bridge

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.010 
invisible and at this point the bridge
is<00:05:32.800> really<00:05:33.130> close<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.400> being<00:05:33.790> activated<00:05:34.360> so

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
is really close to being activated so

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.600 
is really close to being activated so
you<00:05:35.080> may<00:05:35.320> be<00:05:35.380> able<00:05:35.590> to<00:05:35.770> cross<00:05:36.010> the<00:05:36.220> bridge<00:05:36.430> at

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
you may be able to cross the bridge at

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.300 
you may be able to cross the bridge at
this<00:05:36.760> point<00:05:37.090> but<00:05:37.270> if<00:05:37.450> not<00:05:37.810> walk<00:05:38.530> away<00:05:38.919> from<00:05:39.160> the

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
this point but if not walk away from the

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.740 
this point but if not walk away from the
thralls<00:05:39.610> you<00:05:39.910> probably<00:05:40.210> want<00:05:40.390> to<00:05:40.450> hide<00:05:40.600> behind

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
thralls you probably want to hide behind

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.080 
thralls you probably want to hide behind
a<00:05:40.990> rock<00:05:41.230> or<00:05:41.260> something<00:05:41.440> like<00:05:41.800> I<00:05:42.010> do<00:05:42.070> and<00:05:42.460> crouch

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
a rock or something like I do and crouch

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.270 
a rock or something like I do and crouch
because<00:05:43.990> you're<00:05:44.140> crouched<00:05:44.440> should<00:05:45.100> have

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
because you're crouched should have

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.520 
because you're crouched should have
reset<00:05:45.730> by<00:05:45.910> this<00:05:46.120> point<00:05:46.390> anyways<00:05:47.169> once<00:05:47.380> you

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
reset by this point anyways once you

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.920 
reset by this point anyways once you
crouch<00:05:47.890> and<00:05:48.220> go<00:05:48.550> invisible<00:05:48.850> the<00:05:49.600> bridge

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
crouch and go invisible the bridge

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.050 
crouch and go invisible the bridge
should<00:05:50.260> definitely<00:05:50.800> be<00:05:50.980> fully<00:05:51.250> activated<00:05:51.820> at

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
should definitely be fully activated at

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.880 
should definitely be fully activated at
this<00:05:52.270> point<00:05:52.570> and<00:05:52.870> you<00:05:53.169> can<00:05:53.350> just<00:05:53.500> walk<00:05:53.710> across

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
this point and you can just walk across

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.460 
this point and you can just walk across
like<00:05:54.490> I<00:05:54.669> do<00:05:54.730> now<00:05:55.360> obviously<00:05:55.510> this<00:05:56.080> method

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
like I do now obviously this method

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.900 
like I do now obviously this method
doesn't<00:05:56.620> work<00:05:56.740> for<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:57.070> other<00:05:57.190> classes<00:05:57.730> like

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
doesn't work for the other classes like

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.280 
doesn't work for the other classes like
I<00:05:58.060> said<00:05:58.270> if<00:05:58.419> you<00:05:58.510> want<00:05:58.690> to<00:05:58.780> see<00:05:58.900> me<00:05:59.020> try<00:05:59.230> this
