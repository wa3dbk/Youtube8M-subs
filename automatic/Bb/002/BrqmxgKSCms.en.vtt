SUV<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.230> probably<00:00:16.500> gonna<00:00:16.619> be<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
SUV this is probably gonna be the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.240 
SUV this is probably gonna be the
fastest<00:00:17.580> SUV<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.600> market<00:00:19.140> over<00:00:19.260> 500

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
fastest SUV on the market over 500

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.730 
fastest SUV on the market over 500
horsepower<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:21.689> what<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:21.990> did<00:00:22.170> on<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.470> one

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
horsepower so what we did on this one

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.040 
horsepower so what we did on this one
was<00:00:22.949> an<00:00:23.100> escort<00:00:23.550> radar<00:00:24.119> system<00:00:24.570> with<00:00:24.750> laser

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
was an escort radar system with laser

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.910 
was an escort radar system with laser
defense<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:26.359> 9500<00:00:27.359> CI<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:28.170> exact

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
defense a 9500 CI to be exact

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.049 
defense a 9500 CI to be exact
so<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.609> truly<00:00:30.119> built<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:32.059> undetectable

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
so it's a truly built in undetectable

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.510 
so it's a truly built in undetectable
radar<00:00:33.450> system<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:34.170> laser<00:00:34.469> diffusion<00:00:35.190> so

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
radar system with laser diffusion so

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.100 
radar system with laser diffusion so
obviously<00:00:35.820> you'll<00:00:36.030> know<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.390> there's<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.660> radar

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
obviously you'll know if there's a radar

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.650 
obviously you'll know if there's a radar
gun<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> neighborhood<00:00:38.700> or<00:00:38.969> if<00:00:39.510> you're

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
gun on in the neighborhood or if you're

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.990 
gun on in the neighborhood or if you're
hit<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:39.870> laser<00:00:40.320> it'll<00:00:40.829> give<00:00:40.980> them<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.219> mixed

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
hit with laser it'll give them a mixed

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.770 
hit with laser it'll give them a mixed
reading<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> basically<00:00:45.059> I'll<00:00:45.239> take<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
reading so basically I'll take you on a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.410 
reading so basically I'll take you on a
tour<00:00:46.020> around<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.530> car<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.969> rear<00:00:48.149> portion

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
like the license plate on this car we

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.399 
like the license plate on this car we
took<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.970> different<00:01:39.270> approach<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:40.020> mounting

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
took a different approach to mounting

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.889 
took a different approach to mounting
the<00:01:40.530> display<00:01:41.009> customer<00:01:41.939> did<00:01:42.150> not<00:01:42.329> want<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.720> see

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
the display at all or be able to conceal

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.240 
the display at all or be able to conceal
it<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:46.500> usually<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.250> custom<00:01:47.700> high-end

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
it we usually do the custom high-end

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.340 
it we usually do the custom high-end
mirror<00:01:50.250> mount<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:51.840> did<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.170> this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
mirror mount but what we did for this

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.760 
mirror mount but what we did for this
client<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:54.090> removed<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.750> stock<00:01:55.110> ashtray

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
client is we removed the stock ashtray

client is we removed the stock ashtray
built<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.549> nice<00:01:56.759> little<00:01:57.060> flush<00:01:57.540> panel<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.320> it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
built a nice little flush panel with it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.550 
built a nice little flush panel with it
at<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.710> slight<00:01:59.100> angle<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> when<00:02:00.899> he's<00:02:01.020> driving

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
at a slight angle so when he's driving

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.560 
at a slight angle so when he's driving
him<00:02:01.890> or<00:02:02.040> his<00:02:02.159> passenger<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.909> keep<00:02:03.090> an<00:02:03.270> eye<00:02:03.390> on

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
him or his passenger can keep an eye on

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.959 
him or his passenger can keep an eye on
the<00:02:03.719> status<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:05.490> let's<00:02:05.670> say<00:02:05.790> they

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
the status of it but let's say they
