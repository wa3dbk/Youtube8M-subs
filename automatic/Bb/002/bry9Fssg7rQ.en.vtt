00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello and welcome to jacky 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.210
 today i will give you the top 10 of the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.389
 most popular apps in germany 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.190
 imagine 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.670
 and I will also tell you 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.420
 how much of german iphone user this 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.180
 have installed app on your phone 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.160
 Number 10 is and what the app does it 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.810
 actually pretty cool and though 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.150
 for example, in a nightclub 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.760
 since and a song hears and does not know 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.369
 as the song is called and who sinks or 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.239
 has produced then just starts 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.469
 bye m 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.660
 Click to listen and then it gets tight 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.430
 analyze the song and you exactly 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.469
 say what the title is who it is 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.780
 produces and you also one 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.680
 youtube link spits out very handy 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.840
 Number nine is google maps and 18 3 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.610
 percent of iphone users have google 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.289
 Maps on your phone and I can too 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.780
 understand why google maps is 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.170
 in my opinion the best maps app 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.739
 for your iphone much better than apple 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.830
 Maps because simply the search function around 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.229
 a little better you can easily 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.080
 Subways restaurants bars clubs and so on 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.150
 Search further and I find the maps 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.549
 green google maps app is just great 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.400
 reliable and definitely one 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.490
 download worth number eight is the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 German railway navigator and at least 19 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.500
 6 percent of the users have this web on 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.520
 I personally install your iphone 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.150
 I have never used it 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.200
 but I think it is very practical 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.990
 to pick out train connections and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.090
 possibly also to book tickets 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.320
 Number 7 is the facebook 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.830
 messenger and i think most 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.180
 become 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.540
 at least 21 9 have the same 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.990
 facebook messenger installed and yes he 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.940
 is simply an app with her 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.160
 on your facebook account with yours 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.750
 Friends can chat on seat number 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.430
 six we have skype and 24 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.910
 that it is almost a quarter of all German 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.010
 Alps users have skype installed this 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.060
 is a software with her over 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.980
 voice-over-ip that means internet 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.960
 telephony via internet with yours 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.600
 can call friends for free 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.060
 both over the voice and over 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.580
 video of course you can do it all 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.760
 chat normally via text and also files 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.959
 Transfer and number five with place 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.350
 25 7 is amazon mobile 's mobile app 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.959
 from the online shopping portal Amazon 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.410
 There is really everything there 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:45.340
 can only think of electronics over 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.290
 clothes to food can 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.970
 you can buy everything on Amazon 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.790
 that's why the big ones, too 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.630
 popularity in place number four is 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.610
 youtube and 30.7 of you use too 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.290
 the youtube app on the iphone 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.230
 many of you also times look a 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.300
 channel via the youtube app and jana 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.700
 Of course, you can do it very practically 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.620
 Unfortunately, no videos upload over the 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.330
 youtube app for that you have to then 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.030
 download yet another app 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.550
 but who does not have it of you yet and 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.010
 so far youtube videos about the 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.510
 safari browser should look 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.940
 maybe consider the youtube app 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.360
 To load on place number three is eBay 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.989
 mobile and you have access to it 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.060
 the auction house ebay from your iphone 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.950
 From her you can bid for her article 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.230
 can 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.580
 set article and take the photos directly 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.590
 shoot with your iphone 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.590
 so if you have a lot to sell and 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.720
 Buy and always on the hunt for 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.420
 the latest bargains are then invites 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.300
 ebay mobile down to space 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.180
 number two and that's really blatant 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.280
 62 5% of iphone users have it 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.110
 the whatsapp messenger is installed 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.060
 and I believe most of us 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.470
 young people use the backpack 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.870
 messenger I personally find 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.239
 more practical because he is much more reliable 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.920
 faster than the facebook messenger 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:11.310
 and you easily synonymous videos and audio 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.630
 Send messages and place 1 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.359
 unbeaten at 63 2 percent so almost 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.229
 three almost two thirds of the German 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.700
 iphone users have facebook installed 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.889
 and of course it is clearly facebook 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.350
 practically around with his friends in 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.200
 stay in touch to upload photos and 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.570
 yes to watch his timeline 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.220
 So these were the top ten and I have to 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.520
 few surprises say 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.770
 relatively boring the whole I mean 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.050
 Of course, it's clear that the most popular 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.970
 apps are known to all of us 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.280
 that is why I will certainly be in the 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.139
 next day again a new video 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.690
 do with those in my opinion 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.030
 best apps but not everyone 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.350
