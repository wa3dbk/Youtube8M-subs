00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.339
 the staff that the advent of the book the 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.049
 cookies and this besides being one more in 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.630
 my mailbox in my mailbox 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.910
 mail numbers are good in the last two 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.070
 weeks I did not see the video because in the other 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.109
 I do not remember exactly the week 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.330
 reason for not recording I thought that 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.460
 time to record a video worthy of the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.170
 home run number 100 and this week 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.029
 Now I have not recorded because of the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.710
 carnival because at the carnival audience at 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.599
 Blog is half low the crowd will enjoy 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.519
 do not stay much on the internet 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.170
 then ended this week rolled only 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.700
 a review a promotion that I will 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.940
 talk at the end of the video as 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.460
 always but good looks in my box 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.579
 even without me I separated the last one 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.750
 The company that I did was a little earlier. 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.140
 Carnival 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.180
 it's really just before the carnival I 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 I bought four books from these four 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.559
 books I already have one already you 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.300
 seemed to show why I understood 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.820
 Do not you know that I'm obsessed with 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.359
 a book of equals 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 It's kind of strange, but you understand the other. 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.860
 book is one of the following reviews here 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.049
 of the blog the other two did not buy in 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.960
 A tribute even to my two dear ones. 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.510
 cibele 's girlfriends read the tale and libya 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.740
 leiturista leave the link of their blogs 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.869
 down here for those who want to know 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.970
 a kiss for the two and I'll start 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.860
 speaking of these two 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.200
 The first one I bought was 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.920
 blood the fourth book of the academy series 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.290
 of charney vampires used to prefer one 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.659
 book in English only as I already had 1 2 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.189
 and 3 of a promotion that had the Portuguese 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.150
 not only now decided to do the series 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.189
 Portuguese 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.630
 I still have not started reading, do not have 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.259
 I guess I'll only read when I 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.470
 have all but it 's soon she 's riding 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:46.170
 the author and the series that was good at 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.400
 Price wise, I thought it was worth it. 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.610
 feather 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.100
 second book is but also another 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.520
 author the ones the hand of mig end the groom 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.200
 from my best friend who is aaa to aa 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.600
 two books are from the publisher act 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.610
 including this book I have ever wanted 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.590
 long time because I wanted a book the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:14.390
 big thing and I liked what the agent was 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.480
 So whatever you have to do is give a new 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.680
 concept on the cover is a woman 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.050
 doing good wants me badly wants me with a 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:27.650
 flower a drawing is the right choice to stay 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.030
 with us I do not remember the name of the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.750
 The book that I'm going to 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.540
 You know what it is you do not know. 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.200
 so the black and white hoodie with 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.670
 details in red and I do not remember 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.400
 finally name 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.190
 finally a bubble her book that I have read and 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.800
 I liked it, but I did not like it that way. 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.750
 understood and they commented the fiancÃ© 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.269
 my best friend the best of you 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.430
 first that the country has already heard 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.590
 author then decided to buy only stops 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.140
 buy it was missing 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.910
 so I spent a lot of time hunting and then 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.320
 finally found it available and bought 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.840
 I hope it's one of the next lines. 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.940
 readings because the continuation of it I already 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.940
 I have to leave for the publishing house in the county. 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.030
 what anger I can not remember 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.580
 not good 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.050
 so that's a lot of time brings two that 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.599
 I'm missing you, I hope. 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.450
 like your recommendations 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.599
 good third book for him this one 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.750
 I already have but this one is with the cover of the 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.610
 movie I've done so far on the blog I'm going 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.790
 let him down here a safe haven 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.920
 nicolas sparks left the year concept 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.040
 I had to buy again because of the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.709
 beautiful letter and I'm crazy to see you 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.489
 I really want to make a movie debut soon 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:52.110
 so here with consegur despite type 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:54.269
 she be the first in the book there is no end 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.849
 I think I imagined the main couple 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.930
 a bit different but by the trailer I think 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.209
 that I like 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.459
 here are another one for my collection of 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.900
 to participate in the biennial this year in 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.739
 August then another program gives a link 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.599
 down here 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.239
 another book you seem to have shown 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.190
 this same company I've read and is the 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.010
 book that will roll review this week 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.620
 which is the finale is the fourth book in the series 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.989
 purple becca fitzpatrick from the publisher 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.410
 has just seen you a little bit 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.110
 different so she sees in the middle of waiting 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:32.820
 but in a different way from the others 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.720
 I can explain the future is the end of 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.270
 series 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.150
 so I bought because I wanted to read 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.310
 As soon as I enjoyed silence, I 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.350
 I'll leave the link of the review that the 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.750
 rudi relaxing and quiet here 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.300
 underneath and 23 silence was my favorite 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.760
 in the series the first I found 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.560
 people for too many twilight but 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.410
 Third was not wonderful so I had 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.660
 a high expectation for the room and 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.120
 like this 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.220
 I was a bit disappointed I confess 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.070
 I will not say why now but not so 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.620
 It was expected but the good series of one 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:15.170
 more or less dignified way 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:16.850
 although in collapse here this one here 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.460
 It was the four books I bought 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.350
 now recently what I chose 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.200
 to show in this in Mecca if mail 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.230
