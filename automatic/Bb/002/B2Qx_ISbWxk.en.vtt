00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
live game we're trying to ensure that

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.830 
live game we're trying to ensure that
your<00:00:43.050> dog<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.469> sitting<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.309> flush<00:00:44.670> okay<00:00:45.390> so

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
your dog is sitting to the flush okay so

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.500 
your dog is sitting to the flush okay so
by<00:00:46.350> using<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.770> planted<00:00:47.460> pigeon<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.300> can

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
by using a planted pigeon we can

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.090 
by using a planted pigeon we can
simulate<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.050> very<00:00:49.410> easily<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
simulate that very easily and get a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.250 
simulate that very easily and get a
regular<00:00:50.399> flush<00:00:51.030> contact<00:00:51.570> flush<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> nice

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
regular flush contact flush with a nice

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.459 
regular flush contact flush with a nice
sip<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.920> sort<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.160> intermediate<00:00:53.730> age<00:00:54.469> dog

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
sip so sort of intermediate age dog

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.920 
sip so sort of intermediate age dog
would<00:00:55.620> leave<00:00:55.770> maybe<00:00:56.010> 12<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.969> 14<00:00:57.300> months<00:00:57.510> old<00:00:57.780> by

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
would leave maybe 12 to 14 months old by

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.020 
would leave maybe 12 to 14 months old by
the<00:00:57.989> time<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.800> stage<00:01:01.850> okay<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:02.910> if

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the time we get to that stage okay so if

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.399 
the time we get to that stage okay so if
you<00:01:03.120> haven't<00:01:03.270> done<00:01:03.390> your<00:01:03.539> training<00:01:03.719> correctly

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
you haven't done your training correctly

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.859 
you haven't done your training correctly
what<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.680> go<00:01:04.799> wrong<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.460> dog<00:01:06.240> rushes<00:01:06.689> in

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
what can go wrong is the dog rushes in

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.929 
what can go wrong is the dog rushes in
and<00:01:07.260> tries<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.500> chase<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.040> Dove<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.549> that's
