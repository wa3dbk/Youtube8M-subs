I'd like to share with you how to do a

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.990 
I'd like to share with you how to do a
bright<00:00:14.200> hopes<00:00:14.469> block<00:00:14.860> without<00:00:15.459> having<00:00:15.910> an

differs<00:00:19.150> from<00:00:19.300> a<00:00:19.449> log-cabin<00:00:19.630> because<00:00:20.560> they

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
differs from a log-cabin because they

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.100 
differs from a log-cabin because they
both<00:00:21.040> start<00:00:21.430> with<00:00:21.580> the<00:00:21.700> center<00:00:22.000> square<00:00:22.360> but<00:00:22.990> on

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
both start with the center square but on

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.359 
both start with the center square but on
a<00:00:23.140> log<00:00:23.439> cabin<00:00:24.009> you<00:00:24.579> add<00:00:24.990> logs<00:00:25.990> to<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:27.070> center

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
a log cabin you add logs to the center

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.179 
a log cabin you add logs to the center
square<00:00:27.759> and<00:00:28.059> they<00:00:28.450> change<00:00:28.899> in<00:00:29.110> size<00:00:29.349> as<00:00:29.739> you<00:00:30.040> go

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
square and they change in size as you go

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.729 
square and they change in size as you go
out<00:00:30.399> in<00:00:30.610> the<00:00:30.640> block<00:00:30.939> in<00:00:31.660> a<00:00:31.869> bright<00:00:32.110> hopes<00:00:32.410> block

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.670 
out in the block in a bright hopes block
the<00:00:33.399> rectangles<00:00:34.239> are<00:00:34.480> all<00:00:34.690> cut<00:00:34.989> the<00:00:35.140> same<00:00:35.380> size

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
the rectangles are all cut the same size

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.310 
the rectangles are all cut the same size
to<00:00:36.010> surround<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.550> center<00:00:36.850> square<00:00:37.210> so<00:00:37.989> what

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
to surround the center square so what

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.020 
to surround the center square so what
we're<00:00:38.530> going<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.800> do<00:00:39.070> is<00:00:39.430> start<00:00:39.820> with<00:00:39.969> a

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
we're going to do is start with a

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.700 
we're going to do is start with a
partial<00:00:40.510> seam<00:00:40.780> which<00:00:41.020> will<00:00:41.230> make<00:00:41.469> it<00:00:41.500> possible

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
partial seam which will make it possible

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.310 
partial seam which will make it possible
for<00:00:42.280> us<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.579> sew<00:00:42.910> all<00:00:43.180> of<00:00:43.210> these<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.809> complete

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
for us to sew all of these and complete

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.250 
for us to sew all of these and complete
this<00:00:44.499> block<00:00:44.829> very<00:00:45.460> quickly<00:00:45.760> and<00:00:46.030> easily<00:00:46.269> so

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
this block very quickly and easily so

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.720 
this block very quickly and easily so
the<00:00:47.440> first<00:00:47.679> thing<00:00:47.890> we're<00:00:48.039> going<00:00:48.190> to<00:00:48.280> do<00:00:48.460> is

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.759 
the first thing we're going to do is
take<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.120> center<00:00:49.420> Square<00:00:49.809> and<00:00:50.079> put<00:00:50.620> it<00:00:50.739> right

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
take the center Square and put it right

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.410 
take the center Square and put it right
sides<00:00:51.309> together<00:00:51.519> on<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.570> dark<00:00:52.839> rectangle<00:00:53.589> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
sides together on the dark rectangle and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.590 
sides together on the dark rectangle and
I'm<00:00:55.420> going<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:55.749> take<00:00:56.050> a<00:00:56.079> pin<00:00:56.499> and<00:00:57.239> place<00:00:58.239> it

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
I'm going to take a pin and place it

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.770 
I'm going to take a pin and place it
about<00:00:58.960> 2/3<00:00:59.649> of<00:00:59.890> the<00:00:59.949> way<00:01:00.100> down<00:01:00.249> now<00:01:00.879> it<00:01:01.600> is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
about 2/3 of the way down now it is

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.930 
about 2/3 of the way down now it is
pointing<00:01:02.350> towards<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.920> side<00:01:03.129> I<00:01:03.159> need<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.699> sew

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
pointing towards the side I need to sew

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.240 
pointing towards the side I need to sew
but<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:04.659> other<00:01:04.870> reason<00:01:05.379> I<00:01:05.470> put<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:05.830> pin<00:01:06.100> in

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
but the other reason I put this pin in

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.430 
but the other reason I put this pin in
there<00:01:06.430> is<00:01:06.610> because<00:01:07.150> I<00:01:07.540> want<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:07.870> remind<00:01:08.170> myself

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
there is because I want to remind myself

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.260 
there is because I want to remind myself
that<00:01:08.770> I<00:01:08.890> am<00:01:08.979> only<00:01:09.250> going<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.610> sew<00:01:09.760> a<00:01:09.790> partial

that I am only going to sew a partial

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.790 
that I am only going to sew a partial
seam<00:01:10.479> so<00:01:10.659> I<00:01:10.690> want<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.050> stop<00:01:11.229> sewing<00:01:11.500> right

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
seam so I want to stop sewing right

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.590

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
same bar to the sewing machine and sew a

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.800 
same bar to the sewing machine and sew a
quarter<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:15.880> an<00:01:15.939> inch<00:01:16.060> right<00:01:16.390> down<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.780> that

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
quarter of an inch right down to that

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.039 
quarter of an inch right down to that
pin<00:01:17.189> now<00:01:18.189> see<00:01:18.430> I<00:01:18.460> sewed<00:01:18.909> about<00:01:19.210> 2/3<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:19.899> the<00:01:19.960> way

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
pin now see I sewed about 2/3 of the way

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.310 
pin now see I sewed about 2/3 of the way
down<00:01:20.409> here<00:01:20.860> I<00:01:21.009> use<00:01:21.670> black<00:01:22.030> thread<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.810> would

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
down here I use black thread I would

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.380 
down here I use black thread I would
normally<00:01:23.530> use<00:01:23.829> a<00:01:24.159> neutral<00:01:24.790> color<00:01:24.939> of<00:01:25.090> thread

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
normally use a neutral color of thread

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.850 
normally use a neutral color of thread
that<00:01:25.420> matched<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.990> fabrics<00:01:26.380> better<00:01:26.619> but<00:01:26.829> I

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
that matched the fabrics better but I

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.149 
that matched the fabrics better but I
wanted<00:01:27.159> this<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.490> show<00:01:27.700> up<00:01:27.969> on<00:01:28.439> camera<00:01:29.439> so<00:01:30.130> I

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
wanted this to show up on camera so I

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.399 
wanted this to show up on camera so I
have<00:01:30.579> a<00:01:30.610> partial<00:01:30.939> seam<00:01:31.390> here<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:31.990> now<00:01:32.229> I'm

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
have a partial seam here and now I'm

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.819 
have a partial seam here and now I'm
going<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.710> go<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.250> press<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.119> seam<00:01:34.390> open<00:01:34.829> now

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
going to go and press the seam open now

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.679 
going to go and press the seam open now
you<00:01:35.890> can<00:01:36.189> see<00:01:36.460> since<00:01:36.789> I<00:01:36.939> press<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.420> seam<00:01:37.659> open

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
you can see since I press the seam open

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.920 
you can see since I press the seam open
that<00:01:38.439> I<00:01:38.469> can<00:01:38.829> take<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.369> put<00:01:40.030> this<00:01:40.240> rectangle

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
that I can take and put this rectangle

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.170 
that I can take and put this rectangle
right<00:01:41.079> sides<00:01:41.500> together<00:01:41.680> on<00:01:42.100> here<00:01:42.399> and<00:01:42.520> they

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
right sides together on here and they

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.230 
right sides together on here and they
are<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.450> exact<00:01:43.899> same<00:01:43.990> length<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.700> I'm<00:01:45.909> going

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
are the exact same length so I'm going

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.569 
are the exact same length so I'm going
to<00:01:46.299> flip<00:01:46.509> this<00:01:46.780> over<00:01:47.079> because<00:01:47.439> I<00:01:47.680> always<00:01:48.159> sew

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
to flip this over because I always sew

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.910 
to flip this over because I always sew
from<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.909> size<00:01:49.119> that<00:01:49.479> has<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.840> most<00:01:49.990> seams<00:01:50.380> if

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
from the size that has the most seams if

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.069 
from the size that has the most seams if
I<00:01:51.159> sew<00:01:51.369> from<00:01:51.579> this<00:01:51.850> side<00:01:52.119> there's<00:01:52.479> no<00:01:52.689> seams

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
I sew from this side there's no seams

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.289 
I sew from this side there's no seams
and<00:01:53.380> so<00:01:53.710> these<00:01:53.920> could<00:01:54.189> be<00:01:54.250> flipped<00:01:54.729> by<00:01:55.240> the

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
and so these could be flipped by the

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.539 
and so these could be flipped by the
feed<00:01:55.600> dogs<00:01:55.810> on<00:01:56.020> my<00:01:56.140> sewing<00:01:56.350> machine<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:57.369> it

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
feed dogs on my sewing machine so it

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.639 
feed dogs on my sewing machine so it
always<00:01:57.700> makes<00:01:58.060> sense<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.780> sew<00:01:59.020> from<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.439> top

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
always makes sense to sew from the top

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.520 
always makes sense to sew from the top
so<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.009> can<00:02:00.340> control<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.939> seam<00:02:01.240> so<00:02:01.960> I'm<00:02:02.229> going

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
so I can control the seam so I'm going

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.029 
so I can control the seam so I'm going
to<00:02:02.740> once<00:02:03.130> again<00:02:03.509> put<00:02:04.509> a<00:02:04.539> pin<00:02:04.810> here<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.380> because

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
to once again put a pin here and because

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.520 
to once again put a pin here and because
this<00:02:06.250> one<00:02:06.520> may<00:02:06.700> flip<00:02:07.000> down<00:02:07.270> I'm<00:02:07.600> going<00:02:08.020> to<00:02:08.140> just

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
this one may flip down I'm going to just

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.070 
this one may flip down I'm going to just
pin<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:08.979> in<00:02:09.369> position<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.149> it<00:02:10.300> stays<00:02:10.570> up<00:02:10.869> and

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
pin that in position so it stays up and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.990 
pin that in position so it stays up and
I<00:02:11.980> can<00:02:12.250> now<00:02:12.460> so<00:02:12.820> a<00:02:13.030> full<00:02:13.330> seam<00:02:14.490> now<00:02:15.490> I've<00:02:15.730> sewn<00:02:15.970> a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
I can now so a full seam now I've sewn a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.060 
I can now so a full seam now I've sewn a
quarter<00:02:16.450> inch<00:02:16.630> seam<00:02:16.720> again<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.530> use<00:02:17.800> black

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
quarter inch seam again I use black

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.890 
quarter inch seam again I use black
thread<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.730> would<00:02:18.850> show<00:02:19.000> up<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.270> camera<00:02:19.780> but

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
thread so it would show up on camera but

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.449 
thread so it would show up on camera but
I<00:02:19.959> would<00:02:20.140> normally<00:02:20.500> use<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.709> neutral<00:02:21.010> thread

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
I would normally use a neutral thread

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.920 
I would normally use a neutral thread
and<00:02:21.670> now<00:02:22.090> I'm<00:02:22.209> going<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.420> take<00:02:22.599> it<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
and now I'm going to take it to the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.240 
and now I'm going to take it to the
ironing<00:02:22.959> board<00:02:23.349> and<00:02:23.650> press<00:02:23.860> that's

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
ironing board and press that's

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.390 
ironing board and press that's
open<00:02:24.630> I've<00:02:25.630> now<00:02:25.900> added<00:02:25.930> two<00:02:26.620> rectangles<00:02:27.250> to

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
open I've now added two rectangles to

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.820 
open I've now added two rectangles to
the<00:02:27.520> center<00:02:27.850> block<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:28.990> can<00:02:29.140> see<00:02:29.200> this

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
the center block and as you can see this

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.450 
the center block and as you can see this
is<00:02:30.070> my<00:02:30.250> straight<00:02:30.580> side<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.630> matches<00:02:32.460> this

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
is my straight side that matches this

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.850 
is my straight side that matches this
rectangle<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.720> I'm<00:02:34.930> going<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.320> put<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.650> right

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
rectangle so I'm going to put it right

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.940 
rectangle so I'm going to put it right
sides<00:02:36.220> together<00:02:36.930> but<00:02:37.930> once<00:02:38.170> again<00:02:38.380> I'm<00:02:38.740> going

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
sides together but once again I'm going

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.890 
sides together but once again I'm going

you remember that partial seam we sewed

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.710 
you remember that partial seam we sewed
in<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.680> beginning<00:03:12.130> now<00:03:12.820> I'm<00:03:13.180> just<00:03:13.390> going<00:03:13.660> to

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
in the beginning now I'm just going to

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.229

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
flip this piece of fabric out of the way

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.900 
flip this piece of fabric out of the way
and<00:03:17.459> put<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.489> pin<00:03:18.760> there<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.290> now<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:21.310> is

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
and put a pin there and now this is

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.630 
and put a pin there and now this is
totally<00:03:22.300> flat<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.560> I'm<00:03:23.739> going<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.040> place<00:03:24.280> that

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
totally flat so I'm going to place that

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.560 
totally flat so I'm going to place that
on<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:25.090> rectangle<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.489> now<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.520> can<00:03:28.000> sew<00:03:28.239> that

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
on the rectangle and now I can sew that

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.630 
on the rectangle and now I can sew that
complete<00:03:29.019> seam<00:03:30.360> so<00:03:31.360> I<00:03:31.390> have<00:03:31.600> eliminated

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
complete seam so I have eliminated

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.460 
complete seam so I have eliminated
having<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.760> do<00:03:33.880> an<00:03:33.970> inset<00:03:34.390> seam<00:03:34.690> by<00:03:34.989> starting

with<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:35.709> partial<00:03:36.010> seam<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:37.030> see<00:03:37.239> how<00:03:37.390> this

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
with that partial seam so see how this

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.780 
with that partial seam so see how this
is<00:03:37.780> matching<00:03:38.049> up<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.620> now<00:03:38.920> I'm<00:03:39.160> going<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.549> sew

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
that for camera because I would have

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.399 
that for camera because I would have
used<00:04:07.219> a<00:04:07.400> more<00:04:07.549> neutral<00:04:07.939> color<00:04:08.120> I'm<00:04:08.510> going<00:04:09.290> to

and then all we have to do is go finish
that<00:04:15.769> partial<00:04:16.370> seam<00:04:16.609> and<00:04:16.910> our<00:04:17.509> block<00:04:17.720> is

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
that partial seam and our block is

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.860 
that partial seam and our block is
complete<00:04:18.759> now<00:04:19.759> on<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.180> reverse<00:04:20.449> side<00:04:20.660> of<00:04:20.810> the

complete now on the reverse side of the
block<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:21.289> can<00:04:21.440> see<00:04:21.620> that<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:21.829> pressed<00:04:22.130> all<00:04:22.370> the

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
block you can see that I pressed all the

block you can see that I pressed all the
seams<00:04:22.759> open<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.509> now<00:04:24.080> all<00:04:24.440> I<00:04:24.470> have<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:24.889> do<00:04:25.190> is

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
seams open and now all I have to do is

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
seams open and now all I have to do is
go<00:04:26.240> back<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:27.370> so<00:04:28.370> this<00:04:28.789> partial<00:04:29.030> seam<00:04:29.389> from

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
go back and so this partial seam from

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.510 
go back and so this partial seam from
here<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.900> here<00:04:30.169> because<00:04:30.919> I<00:04:31.130> started

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
here to here because I started

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.800 
here to here because I started
two-thirds<00:04:31.940> of<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.210> way<00:04:32.330> down<00:04:32.570> in<00:04:32.750> the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
two-thirds of the way down in the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.810 
two-thirds of the way down in the
beginning<00:04:33.139> this<00:04:33.650> is<00:04:33.710> laying<00:04:34.099> flat<00:04:34.430> at<00:04:34.669> this

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
beginning this is laying flat at this

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.610 
beginning this is laying flat at this
point<00:04:35.120> so<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:35.389> don't<00:04:35.750> have<00:04:35.990> a<00:04:36.020> pucker<00:04:36.320> right

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
point so I don't have a pucker right

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.320 
point so I don't have a pucker right
there<00:04:36.889> so<00:04:37.400> I'm<00:04:37.580> going<00:04:37.759> to<00:04:37.789> take<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.240> the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
there so I'm going to take it to the

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.540 
there so I'm going to take it to the
sewing<00:04:38.509> machine<00:04:38.599> and<00:04:39.169> I<00:04:39.710> am<00:04:39.800> going<00:04:40.250> to<00:04:40.370> turn

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
sewing machine and I am going to turn

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.310 
sewing machine and I am going to turn
the<00:04:40.759> wheel<00:04:40.940> on<00:04:40.970> the<00:04:41.240> side<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.780> machine<00:04:42.139> to

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
the wheel on the side of the machine to

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.070 
the wheel on the side of the machine to
make<00:04:42.500> sure<00:04:42.770> my<00:04:43.039> needle<00:04:43.099> goes<00:04:43.580> right<00:04:44.090> in<00:04:44.389> that

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
same line where I stopped sewing so I

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.800 
same line where I stopped sewing so I

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
finished block and here there is our

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.439

completed<00:04:56.750> bright<00:04:57.020> hopes<00:04:57.259> block<00:04:58.000> see<00:04:59.000> we<00:04:59.300> did

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
completed bright hopes block see we did

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.270 
completed bright hopes block see we did
not<00:04:59.570> have<00:04:59.750> to<00:04:59.900> sew<00:05:00.110> any<00:05:00.410> of<00:05:00.680> these<00:05:00.800> in<00:05:01.009> set

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
not have to sew any of these in set

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.339 
not have to sew any of these in set
points<00:05:01.729> because<00:05:02.300> traditionally<00:05:02.930> they<00:05:03.139> had

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
points because traditionally they had

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.620 
points because traditionally they had
you<00:05:03.680> start<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.520> sew<00:05:04.699> a<00:05:04.729> seam<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:05.360> then<00:05:05.510> when

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
you start to sew a seam and then when

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.570 
you start to sew a seam and then when
you<00:05:05.750> added<00:05:06.020> this<00:05:06.169> one<00:05:06.380> you<00:05:06.620> would<00:05:06.740> go<00:05:06.949> in<00:05:07.250> and

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
you added this one you would go in and

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.339 
you added this one you would go in and
sew<00:05:08.120> a<00:05:08.150> quarter<00:05:08.419> an<00:05:08.659> inch<00:05:08.810> away<00:05:08.930> from<00:05:09.020> this

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
sew a quarter an inch away from this

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.500 
sew a quarter an inch away from this
point<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.949> rotate<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.610> have<00:05:10.760> to<00:05:10.909> go<00:05:11.060> out<00:05:11.240> and

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
point and rotate and have to go out and

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.659 
point and rotate and have to go out and
you<00:05:11.840> would<00:05:11.990> repeat<00:05:12.470> that<00:05:12.500> process<00:05:12.949> three

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
you would repeat that process three

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.570 
you would repeat that process three
times<00:05:13.880> and<00:05:14.389> it's<00:05:15.199> very<00:05:15.680> hard<00:05:16.159> to<00:05:16.250> do<00:05:16.550> that

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
times and it's very hard to do that

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.370 
times and it's very hard to do that
because<00:05:17.030> you<00:05:17.330> always<00:05:17.690> end<00:05:17.870> up<00:05:17.930> with<00:05:18.110> a<00:05:18.139> little

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
because you always end up with a little

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.170 
because you always end up with a little
pucker<00:05:18.620> and<00:05:18.860> thread<00:05:19.099> sewing<00:05:19.340> at<00:05:19.550> these<00:05:19.729> points

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
pucker and thread sewing at these points

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.270 
pucker and thread sewing at these points
this<00:05:20.720> way<00:05:20.930> you<00:05:20.990> can<00:05:21.260> make<00:05:21.409> this<00:05:21.620> block<00:05:21.949> in<00:05:22.220> a

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
this way you can make this block in a

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.779 
this way you can make this block in a
matter<00:05:22.490> of<00:05:22.580> 15<00:05:23.060> minutes<00:05:23.419> and<00:05:23.659> it's<00:05:24.409> effortless

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
matter of 15 minutes and it's effortless

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.250 
matter of 15 minutes and it's effortless
so<00:05:25.789> this<00:05:26.030> is<00:05:26.180> one<00:05:26.330> of<00:05:26.419> my<00:05:26.510> favorite<00:05:26.840> blocks<00:05:27.050> to

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
so this is one of my favorite blocks to

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.439 
so this is one of my favorite blocks to
make<00:05:27.470> you<00:05:27.949> can<00:05:28.099> also<00:05:28.280> fussy<00:05:28.789> cut<00:05:28.970> something<00:05:29.330> in

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
make you can also fussy cut something in

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.870 
make you can also fussy cut something in
the<00:05:29.539> center<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.050> so<00:05:30.650> it's<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.919> great<00:05:31.190> block<00:05:31.699> to

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
the center and so it's a great block to

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.879 
the center and so it's a great block to
use<00:05:32.060> for<00:05:32.330> children's<00:05:32.720> quilts<00:05:33.080> so<00:05:33.500> I<00:05:33.560> hope<00:05:33.740> you

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
use for children's quilts so I hope you

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.430 
use for children's quilts so I hope you
had<00:05:34.039> a<00:05:34.070> good<00:05:34.250> time
