that showed the Batmobile and him
standing<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.590> mean<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.830> could<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.610> I

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
standing there I mean that could be it I

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.310 
standing there I mean that could be it I
don't<00:01:15.240> know<00:01:15.330> could<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.659> where<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> setting

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
don't know could be where the setting

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.570 
don't know could be where the setting
was<00:01:16.500> maybe<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.280> where<00:01:17.430> he<00:01:17.549> keeps<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.540> in

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
was maybe that's where he keeps this in

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.890 
was maybe that's where he keeps this in
Metropolis<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.790> don't<00:01:20.970> know<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.210> know<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.750> just

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
Metropolis I don't know I know I just

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.359 
Metropolis I don't know I know I just
it's<00:01:22.350> gonna<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.799> interesting<00:01:23.009> because

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it's gonna be interesting because

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.330 
it's gonna be interesting because
obviously<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.659> Batman<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.830> Metropolis

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
obviously if Batman is in Metropolis

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.800 
obviously if Batman is in Metropolis
he's<00:01:26.490> got<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> keep<00:01:26.850> his<00:01:26.909> goodie<00:01:27.240> somewhere

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
he's got to keep his goodie somewhere

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.020 
he's got to keep his goodie somewhere
and<00:01:28.020> I'm<00:01:28.110> sure<00:01:28.290> he<00:01:28.380> has<00:01:28.530> little<00:01:29.250> spots<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
and I'm sure he has little spots and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.700 
and I'm sure he has little spots and
everything<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.390> I'm<00:01:30.479> I'm<00:01:30.930> guessing<00:01:31.680> that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
everything and I'm I'm guessing that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.230 
everything and I'm I'm guessing that
