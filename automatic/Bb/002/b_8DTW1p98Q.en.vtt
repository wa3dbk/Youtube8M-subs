00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.330
 Kim has been reading for 10 years and in the shadow of his big brother the 9 11 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.389
 with the gt4 it seems temporary that posh shows the potential of 

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:28.079
 the sports car with mid engine 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.039
 parts of the gt3 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.090
 to ward off the mouth of a little s 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.260
 to return and ct 4 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
 it must turn into parties 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.770
 michael 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.789
 but well what makes that is certainly 4 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.870
 so different from a normal kids 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.870
 that is the chassis and its components of the gt3 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.640
 it is a completely different track width than a normal game and requires 30 millimeters 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.380
 lower than the normal parts 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.410
 Companies that wanted the engine facts horsepower more than the 7 6 7 6 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.220
 yes finally it seems that those chickens now come to a point where you have yes 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.220
 this is really a very intense sports lane 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.240
 but actually you notice that without her to go you drive away with this car 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.020
 you hear the mechanical bull 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.020
 you hear a yellow-red howl 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.610
 you can only get it with a manual gearbox 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.970
 click clack 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.050
 pokers shorter than with the gts all of those extreme measures 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.720
 you can get you with chairs 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.049
 that sit so low that they nail the right place 9 18 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:45.899
 even that 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.000
 without a club is not sufficient in the low sun you put the solar 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.250
 and then you really feel it 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.210
 anyone can be the car 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.430
 behind dynamic motion 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.130
 as if there was some sort of extension of your backbone 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.950
 takes place so one becomes by car 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.600
 good that we are therefore quiet to ride on the public road the lake 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.600
 how hard he is 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.489
 Normally a tent set so incredibly hard in that position that is too 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.989
 what's under the lap time moors list put seven minutes back twice 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:21.979
 and in the arrest 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.189
 that is actually only possible 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.499
 a billiard table on the circuit of portimao so beautiful 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:29.649
 league 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.119
 I'm going now 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:34.539
 put the eu in place 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.629
 sport button pressing kim 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.149
 then you m m between gas function when switching back very brutal 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:43.379
 hard this week 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.379
 after that the party can really start 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.839
 if i am my career estate 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.699
 send them in at least as well on the inside 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.299
 not normal 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.339
 with less power than in a row 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:06.479
 nine disapproval s also has to do with the joining hands trajectory 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:10.529
 no one says turned 180 degrees on the couch sitting behind a ball beautifully in it 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:13.819
 Aim two other bathers who work a day when you take everything off 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.989
 but that mid-engine that makes this car so 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.989
 nobody is like that 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.879
 with this car you will quickly become one 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.509
 dentergem part of the plan 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:28.799
 this all does open 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.799
 andrej martin 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.639
 When you just don't need the car Dendermonde weighs 20 pounds 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.279
 I remember that I had a game and drove the GTS and there you have it 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.279
 6 I want more options a man has robbed 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.169
 this car you can just be very fast creatures 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.360
 by eliminating those flops between guests really good choice in terms of 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.689
 neatly catch new thom 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.300
 but with this one 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.030
 the first hours with a package with the stage not the moment many of these 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.129
 lies seems to be what 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.129
 and if needed 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.270
 but also no pdk he argues of being available 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.680
 only with manual gearbox 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.059
 what a car 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:59.550
 lee 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.659
 the vt4 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.659
 which brings them the cobblestone road to another injury 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:07.889
 why do you have to compare this with what comes close 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.529
 maybe we are at Schiphol 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.529
 don't think that they have this anywhere 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.189
 the card is crooked 4 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:20.560
 yes this is now too luxurious car of 2015 I have driven that I just know 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:23.029
 this is really another dimension
