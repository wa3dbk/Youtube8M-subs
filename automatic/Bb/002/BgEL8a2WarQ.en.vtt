just to shoot down the site 74 you
obviously<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.630> best<00:00:33.809> sub<00:00:33.989> machine<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
obviously is the best sub machine and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.729 
obviously is the best sub machine and
the<00:00:34.440> use<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:34.829> example<00:00:35.309> but<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
the use for this example but it it's a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.500 
the use for this example but it it's a
pretty<00:00:37.920> fun<00:00:38.190> class<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.610> play<00:00:38.790> around<00:00:38.879> with<00:00:39.270> and

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
domination pro is nomination pro is a

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.559 
domination pro is nomination pro is a
game<00:03:43.099> type<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:43.489> made<00:03:43.669> up<00:03:43.819> back<00:03:44.060> when<00:03:44.269> would<00:03:44.480> he

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
game type I made up back when would he

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.780 
game type I made up back when would he
challenged<00:03:45.200> me<00:03:45.380> to<00:03:45.590> make<00:03:45.919> a<00:03:45.950> new<00:03:46.160> game<00:03:46.370> type<00:03:46.609> up

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
challenged me to make a new game type up

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.089 
challenged me to make a new game type up
we<00:03:46.910> challenged<00:03:47.389> everybody<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:48.049> my<00:03:48.590> idea<00:03:48.950> was

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
we challenged everybody and my idea was

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.879 
we challenged everybody and my idea was
domination<00:03:49.760> pro<00:03:50.000> but<00:03:50.900> domination<00:03:51.739> pro

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
domination pro but domination pro

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.580 
domination pro but domination pro
basically<00:03:52.370> consists<00:03:52.760> of<00:03:52.940> is<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.870> be<00:03:54.019> a<00:03:54.049> 3<00:03:54.349> flag

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
basically consists of is it be a 3 flag

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.220 
basically consists of is it be a 3 flag
just<00:03:54.889> like<00:03:55.099> this<00:03:55.340> like<00:03:56.120> right<00:03:56.389> now<00:03:56.599> we<00:03:57.109> have

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
just like this like right now we have

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.800 
just like this like right now we have
all<00:03:57.260> three<00:03:57.590> flags<00:03:57.980> so<00:03:58.639> if<00:03:58.879> I<00:03:59.030> was<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.239> die<00:03:59.540> at

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
all three flags so if I was to die at

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.020 
all three flags so if I was to die at
this<00:03:59.989> point<00:04:00.349> I<00:04:00.620> would<00:04:01.010> not<00:04:01.639> be<00:04:01.790> able<00:04:01.819> to

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
this point I would not be able to

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.059 
this point I would not be able to
respond<00:04:02.510> until<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.109> other<00:04:03.260> team<00:04:03.500> took<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.739> flag

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
respond until the other team took a flag

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.309 
respond until the other team took a flag
back<00:04:04.340> this<00:04:05.299> would<00:04:05.540> keep<00:04:05.690> people<00:04:06.079> from<00:04:06.230> being

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
back this would keep people from being

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.219 
back this would keep people from being
dominated<00:04:07.160> at<00:04:07.400> this<00:04:07.549> point<00:04:07.850> but<00:04:08.600> to<00:04:08.750> offset

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:09.229 
dominated at this point but to offset

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:11.770 
dominated at this point but to offset
that<00:04:09.259> we<00:04:10.039> would<00:04:10.250> be<00:04:10.400> getting<00:04:10.579> five<00:04:11.150> points

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
that we would be getting five points

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.300 
that we would be getting five points
just<00:04:12.410> like<00:04:12.470> headquarters

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
just like headquarters

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.370 
just like headquarters
continually<00:04:13.819> however<00:04:14.480> long<00:04:14.810> we<00:04:14.959> held<00:04:15.230> the

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
continually however long we held the

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.949 
continually however long we held the
triple<00:04:15.739> cap<00:04:15.950> this<00:04:16.820> is<00:04:16.970> kinda<00:04:17.239> Bennett<00:04:17.540> is<00:04:17.750> what

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
triple cap this is kinda Bennett is what

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.590 
triple cap this is kinda Bennett is what
kind<00:04:18.139> of<00:04:18.489> motivate<00:04:19.489> people<00:04:19.639> to<00:04:19.820> triple<00:04:20.389> cap

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
kind of motivate people to triple cap

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.500 
kind of motivate people to triple cap
and<00:04:20.870> not<00:04:21.350> spawn<00:04:21.709> trap<00:04:22.070> people<00:04:22.400> only<00:04:22.730> to<00:04:23.210> flag

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
and not spawn trap people only to flag

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.350 
and not spawn trap people only to flag
that<00:04:24.139> you<00:04:24.200> know<00:04:24.470> thing<00:04:24.800> like<00:04:25.040> that<00:04:25.210> what<00:04:26.210> you

the other thing that we be added into

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.460 
the other thing that we be added into
the<00:04:28.100> game<00:04:28.250> as<00:04:28.639> if<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.389> have<00:04:29.660> a<00:04:29.690> to<00:04:29.990> flag

the game as if you have a to flag
domination<00:04:31.160> cap<00:04:31.370> there<00:04:32.060> is<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.480> five-second

they're<00:04:37.639> weaker<00:04:38.060> a<00:04:38.210> chance<00:04:38.960> to<00:04:39.320> basically

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
they're weaker a chance to basically

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.370 
they're weaker a chance to basically
come<00:04:40.340> back<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:40.850> capture<00:04:41.030> a<00:04:41.300> B<00:04:41.720> flag<00:04:42.050> or

come back and capture a B flag or

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.800 
come back and capture a B flag or
something<00:04:42.770> like<00:04:42.919> that<00:04:42.980> so<00:04:43.430> it's<00:04:44.330> kind<00:04:44.600> of<00:04:44.660> like

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
something like that so it's kind of like

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.860 
something like that so it's kind of like
war<00:04:45.169> you<00:04:45.830> remember<00:04:46.130> war<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.760> black<00:04:47.270> ops<00:04:47.540> and

and you want you were down a flag you
got<00:04:52.160> it<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.340> got<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:52.610> three<00:04:52.910> second<00:04:53.300> delay

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
got it you got that three second delay

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.840 
got it you got that three second delay
if<00:04:54.650> you're<00:04:54.740> down<00:04:54.889> two<00:04:55.040> flags<00:04:55.310> you<00:04:55.460> got<00:04:55.550> 25

if you're down two flags you got 25

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.450 
if you're down two flags you got 25
second<00:04:56.330> kind<00:04:57.229> of<00:04:57.320> like<00:04:57.500> that<00:04:57.710> it<00:04:58.130> didn't

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
second kind of like that it didn't

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.710 
second kind of like that it didn't
really<00:04:58.580> affect<00:04:58.760> too<00:04:59.090> much<00:04:59.240> flow<00:04:59.479> of<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.690> game

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
really affect too much flow of the game

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.870 
really affect too much flow of the game
and<00:04:59.900> its<00:05:00.290> spawning<00:05:00.740> waves<00:05:01.160> so<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:01.639> wouldn't

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
and its spawning waves so you wouldn't

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.490 
and its spawning waves so you wouldn't
get<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:02.090> entire<00:05:02.330> three<00:05:02.690> or<00:05:02.840> five<00:05:03.050> second

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
get the entire three or five second

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.440 
get the entire three or five second
every<00:05:03.650> time<00:05:03.860> but<00:05:04.430> there<00:05:04.580> would<00:05:04.760> be<00:05:04.790> that<00:05:05.120> delay

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
every time but there would be that delay

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.750 
every time but there would be that delay
in<00:05:05.690> between<00:05:06.110> responding<00:05:06.740> instantly<00:05:07.160> which

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
in between responding instantly which

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.210 
in between responding instantly which
could<00:05:07.970> give<00:05:08.150> some<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.990> ability<00:05:09.740> to<00:05:09.860> grab<00:05:10.070> an

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
could give some I the ability to grab an

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.920 
could give some I the ability to grab an
extra<00:05:10.340> flag<00:05:10.700> you<00:05:10.910> see<00:05:11.090> I<00:05:11.150> get<00:05:11.300> my<00:05:11.419> first<00:05:11.630> death

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
extra flag you see I get my first death

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.129 
extra flag you see I get my first death
right<00:05:12.200> there<00:05:12.700> and<00:05:13.700> I<00:05:14.479> think<00:05:14.750> that<00:05:14.900> would<00:05:14.990> make

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
right there and I think that would make

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.050 
right there and I think that would make
the<00:05:15.320> game<00:05:15.500> mode<00:05:15.740> more<00:05:16.220> balanced<00:05:16.910> in<00:05:17.030> my<00:05:17.180> book<00:05:17.450> I

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
the game mode more balanced in my book I

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.650 
the game mode more balanced in my book I
serious<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:20.210> seriously<00:05:20.780> seriously<00:05:21.320> do<00:05:22.660> there

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
serious a seriously seriously do there
