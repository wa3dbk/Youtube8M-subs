00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
t-zone so of course we always want to

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.230 
t-zone so of course we always want to
keep<00:00:27.599> our<00:00:27.840> face<00:00:28.140> moisturized<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:29.970> really

keep our face moisturized so it's really

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.770 
keep our face moisturized so it's really
just<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.599> matter<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.869> application<00:00:32.540> what<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.570> like

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
just a matter of application what I like

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.090 
just a matter of application what I like
to<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.290> actually<00:00:34.410> take<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.800> brush

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
to do is to actually take a brush

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.549 
to do is to actually take a brush
because<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.820> absorbs<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.300> lot<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.809> product

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
because it absorbs a lot of the product

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.250 
because it absorbs a lot of the product
and<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.860> can<00:00:38.399> deposit<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.940> onto<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.480> skin

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.690 

sparingly<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.649> your<00:00:43.800> t-zone<00:00:44.010> which<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.520> right

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
sparingly in your t-zone which is right

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.330 
sparingly in your t-zone which is right
here<00:00:45.320> which<00:00:46.320> are<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> areas<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.309> going

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
here which are the areas that are going

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.639 
here which are the areas that are going
to<00:00:47.550> produce<00:00:48.149> more<00:00:48.510> oil<00:00:48.570> naturally<00:00:49.469> anyway<00:00:51.649> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
to produce more oil naturally anyway and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.100 
to produce more oil naturally anyway and
really<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.640> dust<00:00:53.910> some<00:00:54.300> moisture<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.050> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
really just dust some moisture on so to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.869 
really just dust some moisture on so to
speak<00:00:55.489> then<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.760> lather<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:58.789> for<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
speak then we can lather it up for the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.790 
speak then we can lather it up for the
outside<00:01:00.300> areas<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.870> face<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.410> might

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
outside areas of the face that might

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.820 
outside areas of the face that might
normally<00:01:02.070> need<00:01:02.520> more<00:01:02.699> moisture

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.640 

water-based<00:01:11.830> moisturizers<00:01:12.700> are<00:01:13.659> going<00:01:14.440> to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
water-based moisturizers are going to

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.070 
water-based moisturizers are going to
give<00:01:15.430> that<00:01:15.460> extra<00:01:15.790> hydration<00:01:16.390> because<00:01:16.930> it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
give that extra hydration because it

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.020 
give that extra hydration because it
does<00:01:17.229> have<00:01:17.380> water<00:01:17.650> included<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.490> the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
does have water included and the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.080 
does have water included and the
majority<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.509> it<00:01:19.720> is<00:01:19.840> liquid<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.549> it<00:01:24.670> really<00:01:24.880> is

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
majority of it is liquid so it really is

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.230 
majority of it is liquid so it really is
all<00:01:25.420> in<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.690> matter<00:01:25.869> of<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.080> application<00:01:30.240> you

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
all in the matter of the application you

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.320 
all in the matter of the application you
can<00:01:31.420> use<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.659> sponge<00:01:31.930> as<00:01:32.170> well<00:01:32.380> but<00:01:33.149> like<00:01:34.149> I<00:01:34.270> said

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
can use a sponge as well but like I said

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.149 
can use a sponge as well but like I said
the<00:01:34.990> brush<00:01:35.259> allows<00:01:35.799> you<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.250> dictate<00:01:38.159> amounts

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
the brush allows you to dictate amounts

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:48.380 
the brush allows you to dictate amounts
and<00:01:39.399> portions<00:01:40.330> better

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.310 

under<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.200> eyes<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.620> great<00:01:49.830> too

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320
