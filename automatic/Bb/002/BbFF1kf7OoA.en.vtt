00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.940
 Now there is a little one left 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.719
 ranges or characteristics luminous 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:14.070
 Features video for smaller lamps 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:17.810
 up to 800 lumen around there we start 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.039
 with the ohl 120 with the 9 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.990
 we are closer to this one now 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.580
 barn range I guess that 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.740
 I am still 50 meters to the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.760
 barn 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:32.130
 I've had that a bit already 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:36.660
 problems so stefan what do you have now me 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.809
 have the phoenix pg 32 ultimate here 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.809
 edition 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.789
 she will come along a bit further 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.570
 given to me lumen 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.079
 So the big guy often really did 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.079
 nice light 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.739
 against it again in ec 25 a 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.790
 Brand new ones that do not even buy out 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.790
 market is 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.990
 how is he getting on? 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.990
 you can already see that, as in the 7 Series has lux 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.770
 against it now also an oath choir the 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.890
 North Korea 4 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.330
 this really very powerful battery 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.160
 lamp with four aa batteries and the gives 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.310
 already gas and now here in 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.190
 Kuwait in the stefan has the same 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.000
 now in neutral white the a4 in front of envy 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.450
 Chorus, yes, you can see it, too, I think 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.450
 the difference 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.390
 yes you can already see the difference 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:02:01.659
 so and what else do we have one for you ? 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.579
 hedgehog 25 c 2 that is not so with ours 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.369
 best-selling currently as straight 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.090
 Police security services because they 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.220
 is very strong or was around with the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.660
 20,000 lux although the a4 even one 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.140
 piece was stronger I think that comes 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.940
 on the commission europe 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.870
 yes exactly comes naturally again 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.870
 Show now the a4 against it 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.920
 they give themselves so much now but for 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.190
 An AAA Battery Lambert is easy 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.049
 awesome the part 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:50.250
 so now I have to conclude 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:51.180
 a little gigs 25 of eagle day that 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.720
 is a bit stronger now 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.709
 in principle 28 10 650 he 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.420
 one after the other is natural 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.450
 Now a little bit stronger than that 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.450
 the h4
