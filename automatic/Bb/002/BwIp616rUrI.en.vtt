00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.030
 with the first question why you decided 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.030
 to do youtuber 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.480
 this recipe very attentions and then 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.450
 not for long 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.210
 the themes 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.920
 hear me say good in the comments yet 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.110
 dead let's say you can 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.390
 I understand very legitimate reasons 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.100
 then which ones were and the two more 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.989
 great satisfaction and everything great 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.370
 disappointment after opening the canal 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.640
 after adding maybe a certain one 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.180
 success then more successes e 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.940
 disappointments that succeed the animals that 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.280
 he only knows it well, despite me 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.970
 I knew what happened to you though 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.710
 not so not so in such then great 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.710
 lesson success 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:05.649
 various stupid comments that have been 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:08.110
 under the videos that the inter has amazed i 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.920
 comments coming is a classic of 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.970
 the internet that there was to consider and 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:21.159
 youtube a job for all purposes I have 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:24.250
 more a hobby not knowing that you can give 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.740
 quality content in versions of 5 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.080
 euro because otherwise in Italy 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.420
 unfortunately the contents made in Italy 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.399
 while in Italy they are Italian 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.740
 follow from america that you understand the 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:43.140
 English then a wheelus suitcase already 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.140
 this money can come 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.180
 Italy today we put only in that 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.060
 times 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.190
 understood okay instead think about the gods 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.510
 Gameplay channels is the way you do 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.200
 take care of video games in your opinion 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.880
 could could lead to this 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.510
 a superficialization one 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.940
 trivializing video games themselves 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.479
 Americans do not like me ever because ever 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.479
 seen 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.299
 at 15 they spread just might 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.340
 to show the pleasures never high official 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.230
 look i think the damage study this 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.689
 which to it is official car was 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.000
 already bad is a player can not do in 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.159
 so much to dominate the race of a couple of 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.980
 all one only that they are too many e 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:34.769
 balloons that want neither the content for 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.769
 me to be created that you look at though 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.040
 and always talking about video games as much as 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.030
 you think they influenced yours 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.620
 on your life video games is one 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.139
 percentage of those who are young 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.139
 after you too in your childhood 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.780
 look 50 but certainly also because 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.540
 English I knew and loved as if 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.880
 those who now pass many questions to 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.100
 school I answered because maybe some 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.700
 medieval game maybe something because 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.920
 I was studying too, even if it wasn't 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.920
 also of opens the mind towards certain 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.970
 small films then the concept 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.099
 districts opens the mind certain fields that 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.420
 school and parents friends do not 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.420
 they can understand 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.120
 and your favorites apart from final fantasy 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.120
 anyway 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:44.290
 playstation ps3 more films that benefits 5 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.290
 different terminals 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.740
 and in your opinion the great sagas 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.110
 big brand videogames as per 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.310
 final fantasy example and many cases are 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.930
 now history 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.180
 or there is still hope that it will return 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.990
 to the glories of the past history history 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.310
 hospital 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.920
 and now that the eighth generation 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.380
 videogame and reality that future 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.720
 prospects also respond with words 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.000
 then I this vaccination bible 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.290
 I see it as a face of the first one not 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.759
 has changed 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.139
 look what sculli is half of jesi 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:26.240
 would like to be mps 4 all absence is not 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:31.550
 a generation is a 7.5 effect but a 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:35.720
 graphic update on wii u 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.340
 then it is a penultimate question which is 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.949
 what from the world of video games? 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.880
 would like to do great perhaps beyond 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.880
 the youtube experience 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.140
 then also say I don't know and why not in 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.180
 actually I know it is that there are so many things where 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.940
 choose the most relevant one myself 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.800
 turning with a david killer saying 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.980
 since I enjoy it a lot even though 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.300
 so the talkers are the same 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.460
 maybe someone notices michael 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.190
 film could give me an offer 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.630
 gladly accept shitty movies like that 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.260
 I do not know 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.250
 useless brain drain that is useless 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.500
 tell 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.180
 needless to say one last last 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.250
 one last question a comment 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.910
 also yelled if you want to hacking 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.910
 returns 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.350
 and I finished it at first to play it a 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.830
 everyone told me it's better 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.639
 of the others better than the first 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.440
 it's true even for those who remember a little 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.720
 major mask but I don't want to compare it 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.900
 minimally even losing it that he resorted to 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.900
 sometimes the fact of good weather is done is 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.210
 alive cooler than others but it is always a 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.100
 morante blend I don't do with video 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.930
 to make it easy to say everything because it would be 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.750
 one repeat the other two children 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.110
 nothing a play I understand goes 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.190
 well 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.190
 thank you for your time
