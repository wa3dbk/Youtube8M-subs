00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.440
 hi guys to the new kitchen video in 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.999
 this video will show you how not 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.680
 never throw anything away because mine 

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:09.750
 bananas were blackening and therefore 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.849
 decided to make a banana cake e 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.230
 very soft and delicate nuts but 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.389
 obviously you should like bananas 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.580
 because the taste will feel so much 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.160
 all right four pieces of butter 100 grams 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.840
 cinnamon a spoon flour 250 grams 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.850
 half a bag of yeast 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.360
 us 100 grams chopped us a hint of 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.250
 salt a pinch of healthy 20 was a yolk 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.440
 the velino and vanillina a sachet of 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.780
 sugar 120 grams obviously below 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.520
 I will put all the recipe in writing 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.530
 and things less a little more comfortable 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.420
 Now we begin with our with our 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.440
 method 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.200
 I take my butter at a temperature 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.930
 environment the weight they were directly 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.579
 100 grams and after having thought it 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.110
 put in this bowl is using the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.970
 white bowl that has a bowl of 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.070
 normal plastic as it's fine 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.899
 this bowl because I don't have to do 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.460
 no no cooking I have to 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.170
 simply insert it goes into the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.760
 ingredients 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.980
 Let's move on to the next ingredients 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.840
 or take me to sugar I have to 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.069
 this too weighs and they are exactly 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.499
 120 grams once kicked I put it 

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:15.569
 this too in the bowl together 

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:17.310
 to the butter that I had put before like 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:19.049
 notice I put the phone over the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.549
 caen guide to see exactly the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.929
 recipe that was obviously taken from 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.939
 saffron yellow 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:27.359
 after which I take a pinch of salt and 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.639
 I add it to the mixture 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.979
 first thing you need to do now 

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:34.679
 you have to mister the mixture 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.539
 obviously I turn on kamut because 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.819
 I use the campus during each 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.719
 processing you can obviously do 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.969
 also all by hand 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.770
 simply in a bowl is one 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.539
 question of comfort and above all of 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.450
 choice as you know I did this 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.759
 choice then put at speed 1 e 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.179
 start to mix everything 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.819
 as you can see they are well depopulated 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.979
 butter always used the whisk k 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.499
 because it's comfortable after that I have to 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.679
 then add a new one at a time 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:06.810
 first the egg and start a little 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.310
 mix and then the yolk of course if 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.200
 you do it by hand a little more comfortable 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.970
 because you will see better what you have to do 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.600
 you have to take bananas now 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.240
 and snap them flat or crush them 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.070
 to reduce it to portiglia in this way and me 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.600
 I got 4 bananas that were in it 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.240
 I was really in refrigerators 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.850
 very black I thought they were now 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.680
 mature when they were not open instead 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.630
 absolutely black and therefore mistaken 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.660
 but I never started the cake mi 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.370
 he was going to do it and then I made one 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.950
 time has crushed as you can see it is 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.900
 practically reduced to cream what 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.020
 do what you do you need to add it to 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.750
 made from before and put it on forever 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:51.230
 to mix what you need to do next 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:55.590
 you have to take the nuts and the nuts were 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.540
 In fact you have to chop 100 grams 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.080
 I'm taking the nuts and then putting them on 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.870
 in the mixer I obviously begin to chop them 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.540
 once encrypted I have to add 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.459
 obviously to the compound 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.890
 I did n't buy them already used 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.080
 because I think a little more constant 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.360
 and it doesn't cost any territory at all 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.280
 as you can see, just a little or only in 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.040
 chop don't hold too much because they are 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.920
 becomes flour must be chopped but 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.360
 you must still feel slightly e 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.360
 obviously I add them to the mixture 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.230
 once he took the nuts and added them well 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.790
 well the mixture 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.220
 what we have to do now 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.450
 weigh the flour then take the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.489
 flour and flour were 250 grams 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.440
 obviously we weigh on the scale is one 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.510
 once weighed it is understood that the 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.340
 quantitative is what you want 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.880
 you are also this all in the 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.430
 bowl 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.930
 if you don't have the campus what do you do in 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.590
 put each in the bowl 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.720
 stirred a little and then weighs that 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.519
 the rest of the things you choose a little 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.950
 you as you are most qualified to do it 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.720
 I did everything, however 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.670
 speed 1 then occasionally of course 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.060
 I stopped because of me that has to stand there 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.070
 knead 1,700 hours over the flour now 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.769
 let us put the yeast and the cinnamon 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:20.079
 vanillin then the cinnamon was a 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.240
 teaspoon the yeast was 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:26.120
 half a bag of yeast and the valleys and the 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.800
 vanillina a sachet I repeat this to you 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.810
 I got the recipe from the yellow site 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.810
 saffron then I'll put it down here in the boxes 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.900
 information the whole procedure is 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.090
 obviously the recipe I used 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.220
 a question you like bananas 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.710
 in the sense that I really like them 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.020
 I liked the cake more than how 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.880
 dessert like with breakfast is me 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.950
 loved it let me know if you 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.570
 you liked it once too anyway 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.910
 stirred that you see the mixture a 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.770
 what place did I get my pan 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.180
 I usually always put them there 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.980
 baking paper 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.680
 after which I started to pour the 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.300
 compound that is quite enough 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.370
 liquid as you see in the sense that 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.210
 of course you have to get help from a 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.490
 teaspoon and poured all the mixture 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.430
 I leveled it slightly to not have 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.710
 too many strange things over some high ones 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.510
 he leveled slightly once 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.490
 obviously clean the bowl well 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.050
 because there must be no leftovers 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.790
 therefore we must waste nothing 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.130
 once well cleaned well well well well 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.730
 well well in the bowl what I do 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:31.280
 I turn on the oven at 180 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.470
 I take it slightly at a temperature 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.430
 Once he fears in temperature I admit the 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.290
 cake pan inside for 45 50 minutes leaves 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.740
 cool this is the cake made e 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.120
 over 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.460
 what did I do for sugar 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.130
 he had begun to cover the 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.470
 above as you know I am allergic to 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.870
 milk and milk by-products so I do n't know 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.660
 almost never cakes made with milk or cakes 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.780
 with the cream then powdered sugar in 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.690
 industrial quantity of decorations 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.750
 dark chocolate but I never use the 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.820
 cream so you will never or almost never see it 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.280
 the use of cream in my cakes 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.720
 for this reason here however put the 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.850
 icing sugar and then what I do there 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.350
 I put chocolate chips on it 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.120
 you can put whatever you want 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.820
 this cake is really delicious 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.440
 especially at breakfast or as a snack 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.090
 I hope you like it if you have any questions or 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.240
 anything else where you always write them here 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.240
 under
