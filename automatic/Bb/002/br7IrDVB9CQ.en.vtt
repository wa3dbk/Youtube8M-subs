my<00:03:11.200> hands<00:03:11.409> do<00:03:11.709> get<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:11.980> bit<00:03:12.190> tingly<00:03:12.549> so<00:03:13.269> for<00:03:13.510> a

it's<00:03:16.730> not<00:03:16.879> going<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.090> kill<00:03:17.270> me<00:03:17.420> you<00:03:17.660> know<00:03:17.690> so<00:03:18.050> I

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
it's not going to kill me you know so I

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.229 
it's not going to kill me you know so I
wasn't<00:03:18.349> too<00:03:18.680> worried<00:03:19.040> about<00:03:19.129> that<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:20.060> main

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
wasn't too worried about that the main

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.460 
wasn't too worried about that the main
reason<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:20.540> like<00:03:20.569> these<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:20.959> they've<00:03:21.260> got<00:03:21.379> the

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
reason I like these is they've got the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.770 
reason I like these is they've got the
integrated<00:03:22.040> five<00:03:22.489> setting<00:03:23.000> power<00:03:23.390> switch

integrated five setting power switch

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.320 
integrated five setting power switch
they've<00:03:24.440> also<00:03:24.620> got<00:03:24.920> an<00:03:25.010> LED<00:03:25.190> built<00:03:25.910> into<00:03:26.209> the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
they've also got an LED built into the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.790 
they've also got an LED built into the
right<00:03:26.510> grip<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:27.200> let<00:03:27.319> you<00:03:27.379> know<00:03:27.500> when<00:03:27.680> they're

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
right grip to let you know when they're

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.309 
right grip to let you know when they're
on<00:03:27.830> or<00:03:28.040> off<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.489> best<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.269> all<00:03:29.390> they<00:03:29.780> just<00:03:30.050> wire

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
on or off and best of all they just wire

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.220 
on or off and best of all they just wire
directly<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.519> battery<00:03:31.780> with<00:03:32.780> an<00:03:32.900> inline

directly to the battery with an inline

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.520 
directly to the battery with an inline
fuse<00:03:33.620> provided<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.660> what's<00:03:35.660> even<00:03:35.810> better<00:03:35.959> is

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
fuse provided and what's even better is

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.620 
fuse provided and what's even better is
they<00:03:36.769> detect<00:03:37.190> when<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.430> bike<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.700> running<00:03:38.000> so

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
they detect when the bike is running so

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.330 
they detect when the bike is running so
they<00:03:38.720> turn<00:03:38.989> on<00:03:39.019> and<00:03:39.230> off<00:03:39.440> when<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:39.980> bike<00:03:40.160> is

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
they turn on and off when the bike is

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.660 
they turn on and off when the bike is
running

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
running

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.059 
running
I<00:03:40.790> guess<00:03:41.269> they<00:03:41.510> work<00:03:41.750> by<00:03:41.989> win<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.890> bikes

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
I guess they work by win the bikes

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.830 
I guess they work by win the bikes
running<00:03:43.340> your<00:03:43.880> bike<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.239> obviously<00:03:44.480> producing

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
running your bike is obviously producing

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.869 
running your bike is obviously producing
a<00:03:44.900> bit<00:03:45.049> more<00:03:45.200> charge<00:03:45.440> from<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.920> stator<00:03:46.190> your

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
a bit more charge from the stator your

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.520 
a bit more charge from the stator your
battery<00:03:47.180> voltage<00:03:47.510> will<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.690> bit<00:03:47.870> higher<00:03:48.170> when

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
battery voltage will a bit higher when

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.259 
battery voltage will a bit higher when
you<00:03:48.680> turn<00:03:48.860> your<00:03:48.950> bike<00:03:49.130> off<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.670> it's<00:03:50.150> not

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
you turn your bike off and it's not

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.210 
you turn your bike off and it's not
generating<00:03:50.480> electricity<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.709> voltage<00:03:52.040> will

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
generating electricity the voltage will

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.940 
generating electricity the voltage will
drop<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.760> these<00:03:53.269> detect<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:54.230> voltage<00:03:54.680> drop

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
drop and these detect that voltage drop

drop and these detect that voltage drop
and<00:03:55.190> they<00:03:55.519> turn<00:03:55.730> themselves<00:03:55.910> off<00:03:56.269> so<00:03:57.140> it's

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
and they turn themselves off so it's

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.240 
and they turn themselves off so it's
very<00:03:57.290> clever<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:57.860> haven't<00:03:58.069> got<00:03:58.160> to<00:03:58.220> worry

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
very clever you haven't got to worry

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.890 
very clever you haven't got to worry
about<00:03:58.519> turning<00:03:58.730> them<00:03:58.910> off<00:03:59.060> their<00:03:59.450> integrated

and me to have to fix them on with and
they're<00:04:30.620> reasonably<00:04:31.010> priced<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:31.520> mean<00:04:31.669> these

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
they're reasonably priced I mean these

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.520 
they're reasonably priced I mean these
were<00:04:31.970> sixty<00:04:32.360> pounds<00:04:32.840> so<00:04:33.020> they're<00:04:33.200> not<00:04:33.350> the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
were sixty pounds so they're not the

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.140 
were sixty pounds so they're not the
most<00:04:33.710> expensive<00:04:34.070> grips<00:04:34.490> on<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:34.669> market

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
most expensive grips on the market

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.790 
most expensive grips on the market
they're<00:04:35.660> not<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:35.930> cheapest<00:04:36.320> grips<00:04:36.560> on<00:04:36.740> the

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
they're not the cheapest grips on the

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.620 
they're not the cheapest grips on the
market<00:04:37.190> they<00:04:37.340> sit<00:04:37.700> somewhere<00:04:38.090> in<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.360> middle

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
market they sit somewhere in the middle

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.040 
market they sit somewhere in the middle
but<00:04:39.260> with<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:39.500> integrated<00:04:40.450> spun<00:04:41.450> I<00:04:41.750> think

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
but with the integrated spun I think

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.050 
but with the integrated spun I think
they<00:04:42.169> look<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.470> neatest<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:43.220> like<00:04:43.910> I<00:04:44.000> said

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
they look the neatest and like I said

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.879 
they look the neatest and like I said
the<00:04:44.270> quality<00:04:44.600> of<00:04:44.690> them<00:04:44.870> looks<00:04:45.080> good<00:04:45.320> as<00:04:45.440> well<00:04:45.470> I

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
the quality of them looks good as well I

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.610 
the quality of them looks good as well I
mean<00:04:46.100> they're<00:04:46.250> a<00:04:46.280> little<00:04:46.430> bit<00:04:46.729> a<00:04:47.410> little<00:04:48.410> bit

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
mean they're a little bit a little bit

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.440 
mean they're a little bit a little bit
plasticky<00:04:48.979> looking<00:04:49.669> if<00:04:49.970> you<00:04:50.060> look<00:04:50.210> very

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450

issues whereby the they wouldn't fit on

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.980 
issues whereby the they wouldn't fit on
they<00:05:45.130> seemed<00:05:45.340> a<00:05:45.400> little<00:05:45.640> bit<00:05:45.790> tight<00:05:46.120> and<00:05:46.780> I<00:05:46.870> had

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
to actually do a bit of sanding of the

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.330

bars<00:05:49.180> to<00:05:49.570> actually<00:05:49.870> slip<00:05:50.170> them<00:05:50.350> on<00:05:50.470> especially

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
bars to actually slip them on especially

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.010 
bars to actually slip them on especially
on<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:51.670> throttle<00:05:52.090> side<00:05:52.330> where<00:05:52.690> you've<00:05:52.810> got

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
on the throttle side where you've got

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.230 
on the throttle side where you've got
the<00:05:53.140> sleeve<00:05:53.470> for<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:53.860> throttle<00:05:54.100> quite<00:05:54.970> tight

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
the sleeve for the throttle quite tight

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.480 
the sleeve for the throttle quite tight
I<00:05:55.480> mean<00:05:55.510> but<00:05:55.930> these<00:05:56.110> are<00:05:56.470> not<00:05:56.770> dock<00:05:57.220> bars

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
this is the the big test okay that's it

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.620 
this is the the big test okay that's it
fitted<00:06:25.870> tested<00:06:26.710> very<00:06:27.310> very<00:06:27.580> happy<00:06:27.970> when<00:06:28.540> you

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
fitted tested very very happy when you

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.500 
fitted tested very very happy when you
turn<00:06:28.810> the<00:06:28.900> bike<00:06:28.990> off<00:06:29.380> the<00:06:29.800> grips<00:06:30.490> go<00:06:30.790> off<00:06:31.000> so

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
turn the bike off the grips go off so

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.450 
turn the bike off the grips go off so
almost<00:06:32.050> instantaneous<00:06:32.830> they<00:06:32.980> detect<00:06:33.340> that

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
almost instantaneous they detect that

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.770 
almost instantaneous they detect that
the<00:06:33.580> battery<00:06:33.880> voltage<00:06:33.910> has<00:06:34.330> been<00:06:34.510> cut<00:06:34.750> and

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
the battery voltage has been cut and

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.560 
the battery voltage has been cut and
they<00:06:34.990> turn<00:06:35.200> off<00:06:35.610> they're<00:06:36.610> nice<00:06:36.820> and<00:06:36.850> toasty

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
take about ten minutes to get fully warm
