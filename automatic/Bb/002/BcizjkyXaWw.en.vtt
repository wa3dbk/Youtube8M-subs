00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.060
 hello everyone good if you eat before 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.240
 people today we are going to see another secret of the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.449
 sv as we already know the other day that you 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.629
 teaches in the video the improved sv is 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.930
 called used the veil shady so much 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.089
 in die rex as in buried as in all 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.790
 the places where the sv is when the 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:43.970
 we improve then it means that not from 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.040
 user called dark veil 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.190
 that name as you saw in the 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.519
 last video that takes you out of this weapon 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.280
 it referred to the ghost of buried 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.610
 because he is the only person and the only 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.839
 where there is a veil in this game 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.970
 gloomy at the moment then this we 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.149
 is teaching something about history 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.190
 that importance that woman has in 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:14.899
 this story and that gives a then not what 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.720
 we can know exactly but why 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:21.470
 and here's the video today the importance 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.409
 of today's video because we use the sv 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.819
 to do that permancer that is here 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.550
 Only EmpÃºries is the only place 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:36.950
 where you can perform this permanent 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.740
 and it's with the same sv with that same 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.770
 weapon and for what reason for what reason 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.280
 some reason there will be no because if that weapon 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.520
 in die race we use it to do that 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.520
 system 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.039
 the soul that is based on its moment 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.900
 and it's that important part that is 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.170
 to be able to move the shine balls 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.720
 to be able to move them from there to the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.810
 dragons 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.090
 that weapon has to have a meaning 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.860
 special and that's why here in buried it 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.580
 used to play superman but 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.310
 that gives you more 30 each time you kill 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.940
 a zombie instead of the normal thing that would be 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.970
 10 points is not given 10 out of 10 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.790
 It gives you 30 in 30 but here 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.360
 is the key to doing it to get 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.770
 this premium but the key to everything is 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.320
 do it from afar 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.120
 you have to do it from a distance if it's a 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.750
 sniper 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.610
 it's logical but what else is behind 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.400
 this is what we have to 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.500
 try to perceive not because that is the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.620
 mystery of knowing man but and of his 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.440
 relationship with the story that weapon has 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.159
 than being the only weapon with which 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.950
 get that perman but it's not worth another 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:07.690
 type of weapons only that the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.819
 user of grim speed from afar 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.530
 us when we are in day race as 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.510
 I have commented 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.780
 we need that weapon for interest 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.680
 but 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.020
 what we did or rather that he did that 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.050
 woman from afar 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.940
 long ago 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:33.540
 long distance that made this woman 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:36.870
 so that in die rice we could 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.340
 use that weapon and in buried the 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.780
 we used to do in superman but 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.090
 that woman did something a long time ago 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:52.040
 in the distance from afar 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.380
 did something that changed the story 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.610
 Did something 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:02.510
 she did not know herself and that's why 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:05.090
 traumatized she committed suicide for that when 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:10.610
 we got a superman perk is 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:14.480
 plus 30 s 3 means the third plan of 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.730
 maxis she contributes part of the 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.610
 story for that third plan of some 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.560
 way because you look at the first plan 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:26.350
 failure the second plan also failed 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.830
 but what this woman did 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.630
 contributes to that third plan from maxis to 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.940
 that part of the story that we do not know 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.720
 yet 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:42.730
 and that in the future we will discover it 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:45.640
 that's why they give us more 30 because she 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:49.990
 somehow contributed to that third 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:53.230
 maxis plan the improved weapons its 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.350
 name and those berg ferm 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.970
 they tell us about history but today the 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.630
 of w 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.590
 pw because it's there also on that wall 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:09.050
 and what name does it have? 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.050
 will have some link with the sv 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.580
 until the next video
