00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.650
 when we need help we look at a 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.390
 side and other 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.480
 we hope favors here and there we are 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.759
 in front of a big problem and we do not see 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:28.849
 solutions but raise your eyes today 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:33.170
 because your help comes from above 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:38.350
 Lord of the heavens and earth 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:43.280
 Psalm 121 verse 1 to 3 says 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:46.850
 I will raise my eyes to the mountains from where 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.049
 my help will come, my help comes from 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:54.140
 jehovah who made the heavens and the earth 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:58.129
 will not give your foot to the slide or 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.939
 slumber that keepeth thee will not behold 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.760
 the one who keeps 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:06.070
 Israel 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.360
 there are difficult times situations 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.750
 complicated that we all have to confront 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.920
 where everything seems difficult hostile without 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:21.299
 exit as saturated by enemies and 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.580
 there seems to be no solutions in sight 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.979
 we run from here to there trying to 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.030
 solve everything with our forces 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:34.509
 but we see the problem as impossible is 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.840
 in that moment when we should lift 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.899
 our eyes because our help 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.470
 comes from the man who does not sleep for 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.030
 save us and give us your relief victory 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.819
 will not come expecting the favor of the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.569
 men or appealing to human compassion 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:55.840
 nor trusting in the wisdom of 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:02:00.190
 others all true blessing and help 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.459
