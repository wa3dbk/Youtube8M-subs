00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:15.030
 until she opens this prosthesis here in a 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.600
 museum alone she purposely open 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.480
 to show that silicone even with 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.310
 capsule of the open prosthesis she did not 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.529
 does not leak 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.609
 then you do not have that danger of a woman 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.590
 that I have silicone is to leak into having a 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.540
 another problem so home to him 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.280
 burst the tear 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.690
 how does one know if there like me 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.430
 I told you how the person knows when 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.579
 you read can rip a thing so 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.200
 the first advice I give you 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.020
 patient is the following you do not know 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.789
 nothing if you did not notice anything different 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.660
 do not worry for sure when there is a 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.969
 rupture of the prosthesis since there may be 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.079
 a small display of this content 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.210
 internal 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.160
 anyway he will not leak it 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.750
 increases her chance a little 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:11.430
 capsular contracture 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.470
 is the following is wrapped of any body 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.200
 strange that the body was placed a 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.060
 ocular shoulder hip prosthesis 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.630
 anything that is a body goes 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.780
 create a barrier between the inner 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.189
 of the body and this prosthesis is as it were 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.119
 for example that plastic bag 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.229
 natural that the body creates a wrap 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.390
 prosthesis this is normal and is not a disease 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.630
 no own and still there molinha 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.610
 one day this capsule can contract and 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.990
 when she contracted notes that 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.759
 If you touch the pump you can tell that it 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.979
 prosthesis is not hard but it will give 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.030
 feeling that it's hard continuous proof 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.009
 soft 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.600
 so this is the capsule contracture so 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.090
 increases the chance of happening when 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.560
 you have a break but even you 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.750
 have a break 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.880
 otherwise you can leave 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.710
 this prosthetic it will not cause problem 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.649
 no your health 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.420
 and even though the capsular contracture 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.530
 happen this will not be putting in 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.870
 health risk 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.330
 the patient if she has no problem with 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.530
 that if it has not bothered her 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.120
 can leave and what are the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.110
 chances of a break 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.760
 50 are very low you see that today in 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.209
 The prostheses have a lot of 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.780
 resistance does not suffer a traction of 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.770
 prosthesis to decide magnitude within the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.800
 body 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.620
 even under a matter of an accident 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.970
 of a trauma hardly happens to you 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.769
 one's own future and this is a 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.880
 possibility is low but it is a 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.970
 possibility 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.010
 if one day happens and generate some 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.170
 symptom there you can look for a 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.510
 plastic surgeon to make the exchange 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.720
 of this prosthesis but if you have not felt 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:06.720
 nothing need not be doing reviews 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.920
 and is periodic if all is well 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.880
 rivalry has no expiration date 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.630
 it is very common to talk about ten years later 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.070
 huh 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.380
 today we do not talk about it anymore 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.170
 any owner with the prosthesis can 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.130
 happen one day but it can happen 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.140
 years ten years twenty years later or can 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.000
 never happen comments the woman perceives 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.209
 that something happened one of the 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.760
 The most common symptoms are the 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.220
 of feeling that the prosthesis was 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.260
 certain that she does not actually play and she 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.079
 realize that it's hard she realizes that 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.239
 It's hard as they have not bothered you. 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:52.079
 The patient does not even have to change 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.030
 need not act is one of the rare cases in the 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.799
 medicine you do not have to act so 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.209
 preventively 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.209
 you can expect to happen 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.900
 is
