00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 hi to all today I want to talk to you about 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.620
 this wonderful claude b turtle 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.880
 this is not the basic model, therefore 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.690
 be careful when you go to 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:17.160
 buy it this is the basic model yes 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.500
 turn on changes colors does not sound while 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:27.300
 this thing 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:30.980
 you can see more sounds too 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.860
 another feature can be connected 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.430
 via bluetooth with a phone or 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.030
 with a tablet via bluetooth and now 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.800
 I'll show you how you just press 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.800
 twice you see this lights up 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.629
 connect the blue light with bluetooth 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.640
 of your phone on your tablet 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.199
 when you hear or who may be beeping 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.230
 say that it is connected then you go 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.109
 on the cloud application you have 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.390
 downloaded there are two versions 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.909
 free is a paid version but it costs 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.040
 type neuro 80 and go and listen to the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.140
 songs you made with yours 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.590
 children or the one they are already on 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.630
 Let me explain what protection you can 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.140
 from your mobile on your tablet 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.920
 you can increase the value 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.920
 or you can reduce it all you can 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.780
 do also from another room like him and 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.270
 of some media and beyond 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.750
 in the other room I can decide yes 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.090
 turn off the thirst turn it on if raise 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.030
 whatever you're turning down the volume is 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.770
 programmable I put it 30 minutes 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.050
 because I know that those are more or less the time 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.320
 in which he puts my son for 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.700
 fall asleep and your mistress for 30 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:59.310
 28 30 minutes the turtle will turn off in 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.039
 the more you can also put the music that 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.990
 there is that we have on our phone 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:11.340
 on the tablet and I'll show you how to give 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:15.180
 on our mobile phone I go 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:20.750
 on my music and our turtle 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.750
 a small radio becomes a home 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.440
 this turtle now because he has 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.580
 There are many features fun 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.240
 play there go 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.880
 they give in that he does everything but I do 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:47.070
 I highly recommend buying these 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.380

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.030
