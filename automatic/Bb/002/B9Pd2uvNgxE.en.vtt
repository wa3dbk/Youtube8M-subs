00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 the ends and 20 hyundai 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.509
 Surely you should have already heard 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.280
 talk about it 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.500
 but what's in this Korean South hatch 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.960
 that everybody talks about car talking 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.009
 tested version 1.0 comfort and account 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.049
 now for you 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.049
 the details about the model check 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.519
 released at the end of 2012 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.769
 hyundai hb 20 was launched with only 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.910
 a proposal to beat the current popular 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.190
 sold in brazil 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.160
 so the model is sold with motor 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.239
 1.0 three-cylinder with 80 horsepower or 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.100
 1.6 with 128 horses both bi-fuel 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.989
 besides the two engines the list of 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.829
 equipment is also great what you 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.829
 check next 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.199
 good staff if inside the hb 20 is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.199
 very well finished, huh? 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.590
 it was hyundai's purpose to let him 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.300
 a bit more expensive than the popular ones 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.930
 with slightly more sophisticated finish 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.510
 huh 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.510
 so here he gets the upholstery of 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.820
 soft but it ends up being little he 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.000
 I could have come more here or 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.060
 least because in my case a person from 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.979
 one meter and 75 or so you finish 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.590
 finding even in this depth here 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.330
 from the car so here more or less and here 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.890
 he is beginning to annoy people 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.530
 lower than this can fit 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.259
 perfectly the car and it will not 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.810
 both handle so much that she gets 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.229
 just a little detail with your chrome 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.979
 but it's plastic the whole car in one 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.450
 hard plastic talking of a car 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.000
 popular 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.149
 but it is sophisticated at the same time 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.210
 this original hyundai radio here that 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.810
 can also be replaced by one of the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.390
 you 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.390
 Only then you lose entering the cd but 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.520
 few people use cd nowadays so the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.560
 with a bluetooth is better because there 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.770
 You can answer the phone and listen to your 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.120
 songs directly from the phone without 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.710
 put here in the usb input 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.440
 however 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.220
 if you are not with one with radio with 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.710
 bluetooth 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.630
 in the case of this model hyundai offers 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:27.480
 this car here with this tip and show 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.710
 that even you guys then you put 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.680
 there you plug it in and connect that tip 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.860
 on your ipod or iphone 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.740
 remembering that this cable is where 32 pins 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.230
 that apple then calls in the most 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.560
 new this is shorter than me 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.380
 I'll show you 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.080
 it no longer works so you will have 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.620
 that use a pen drive which is what the 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.280
 people were using 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.590
 Leaving us, we're talking about the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.120
 radio just turn on the vehicle here then 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.740
 always turn on the vehicle you have to put 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.320
 the foot in the clutch then implanted in 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:09.480
 trip here came we called here 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.600
 people turn on the radio they can not 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:18.480
 so here we have the radio with mp3 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:22.410
 the seasons for you to change stations 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.150
 volume off is all normal is that the 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.140
 people have the command we change the 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:33.150
 radio stations there and here is the 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:36.290
 changing to mfm 1 fm 2 and sbt will 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.000
 leave the volume on the hill 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.460
 the volume is very simple the commands in the 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.370
 ka wheel of 20 and in case of who 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.970
 is bluetooth here you have to call and 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.980
 off call allie the control panel. 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:56.310
 instruments is simple to understand and the 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.600
 button 30 here you can have all 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.770
 information so far it is showing 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.470
 autonomy 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:06.120
 here the average consumption is making 961 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:10.080
 good consumption for a car 1.0 is 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.830
 stopped the car is average speed is the 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.020
 time we walked with the car is the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.940
 partial odometer and the total number of people 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:22.049
 walked with the vehicle 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.610
 autonomy is quite simple and very 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.770
 easy to understand so whenever you 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.030
 I mean, you have to hold the tri 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.210
 for a while then 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:34.020
 zero the partial odometer if people 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.480
 hold the 30 here he will generate there he 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.370
 does not generate all other data then 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.350
 You always have to enter from 1 and it will be 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.610
 he is good but at the same time it is bad 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.070
 because you always have to do when 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.680
 all in some vehicles and can 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.880
 squeeze no trip for example and he 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.740
 It will be all Sunday for you. 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.580
 here are the commands to clear the 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.050
 glasses ne 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.090
 so we saw that the glass 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.530
 rear here is the timer level 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.140
 this side lighting that is not here 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.490
 automatic then that always off 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.200
 the note in which if we disconnect the 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.030
 external lighting 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.980
 the light becomes clearer when people 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:16.370
 turn on the light stays a bit lower 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.169
 This is due when you are at night. 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.000
 the lighting is so strong that it ends 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.290
 bothering you entered they reduce a 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.930
 low light 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.690
 however if you like to ride with cars 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.190
 and during the day with the lighthouse from mile to 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.770
 light is all weaknesses you do not 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.520
 Can you see what you are talking about? 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.520
 displayed on the dashboard 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.360
 here is the electric rearview mirror then 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.850
 placing the left side to the people 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:47.820
 your left side or right side 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:52.950
 right here and we'll sort it out here at 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.560
 more here in the ac over the ceiling has 11 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.479
 by tokyo 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.320
 here you turn off the lights but if 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:02.940
 shake you turn down ever so 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.610
 it will always be on 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:10.260
 if you have any open door and here it goes 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:12.060
 is always on here in the sun visor has 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.330
 lighting 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.630
 the passenger and if you close it goes 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.630
 pay 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:24.750
 to the passenger's withdrawal of support 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.750
 It has a buffer so it will not hit. 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.290
 is telling here a little about the 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.250
 Behavior of the GÃ¡vea 20 on the street 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.120
 if we let the air conditioning 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.980
 connected it consumes much more gas 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.500
 car gets a little more chuchu is like 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.140
 as it is a 1.0 car of three 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.490
 but we do not leave the air 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.150
 conditioning on 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:56.050

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.380
 smart logical you can not require 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.380
 much of a thousand car 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.020
