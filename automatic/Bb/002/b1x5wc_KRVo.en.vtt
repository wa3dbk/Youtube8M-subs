00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.930
 we want to know how they are living 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.910
 you the sister of daniel is this 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.670
 situation that was generated in the last 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.690
 hours look at us we are not well 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.300
 because the truth is we're not 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.980
 accustomed to these situations I 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.319
 it seems that they are things that have to 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.589
 fix them privately that they do not 

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:24.130
 it is necessary to make it public and not to do 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:26.439
 so much scandal with something that I think 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.939
 that got out of hand at 23 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.699
 they were aware that they were coming 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.949
 so badly to make this decision if 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.320
 We knew that they were not good but not that 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.199
 I was going to get to such an extreme situation 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.059
 how was the relationship with them in 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.800
 family I always say we get together in the 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.100
 my dad's house we were always good 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.289
 all together sometimes she did not come 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.199
 she was meeting with her friends that bothered her 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.940
 to him and I do not know if I calculate yes 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.760
 that it was if we were all in 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.469
 family gathered I guess he would want 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.850
 be with her her brother is a person 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:02.050
 violent not for nothing if it is 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.750
 to someone very 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.659
 fuzzy bo say how I for example am 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.250
 a jealous person and I am not to be saved 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.890
 things if I have to say something to you 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.420
 I'm going to say it and if I'm angry at the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.619
 moment out there he raised his voice if not 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.869
 it means that it is a person 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.810
 aggressive with her they talked they were sent 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.850
 a message I have spoken we have 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.159
 sent messages I have treatment for the baby 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.550
 because he's my nephew and I like to have 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.500
 cordial treatment with my ex- sisters-in-law too 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.360
 my brother always takes care of his 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.509
 children that nobody says he does not 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.080
 because it is a lie if you have had problems 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.149
 is with moms not with kids and not 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.130
 if all right today a publication came out 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.840
 a newspaper a girl called a thousand and 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.190
 tÃ¡vora that says it is committed 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.979
 with your brother who is going to marry 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.619
 you know we had no idea that existed 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.060
 even in static I do not know if it's 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.280
 true or not true I can not 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.840
 confirm or deny because I do not know we 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.060
 would report something like that I fell in love with 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.710
 another I'm married but the truth is very strange 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.539
 is the truth that yes it is very rare and 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.429
 that comes out to say publicly or what 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.080
 I do not know if I tweet me what was it 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.849
 what he did but it is not very rare 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.970
 rare situations you know where you live 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.550
 brother 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.320
 at this moment we do not know close friends 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.000
 the family told me that he 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.500
 he feels very bad about this and he feels that 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.750
 always wants to be a family and that 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.730
 It always goes wrong, you think it's like that and I 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.310
 I think that it always bets on everyone 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.230
 and can never get to have the family 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.970
 that he really wants worried about 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.280
 there not see your nephew now that he's 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.400
 the one away from her does not worry me because 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.900
 I know that I think I would like to think that she does not 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.990
 will be able to stop seeing the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.640
 nene everything else I calculate that if 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.490
 this got out of hand is because 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.050
 I want to calculate that he does not lose 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.940
 contact with the baby that we 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.950
 no, but well, I do not think it was 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.240
 the best way you know who called the 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.580
 attention that jimena will take 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.440
 morrison to record because he had no one 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.090
 he would take care of it and maybe he was afraid that he would 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.400
 I did not know where I was going to 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.470
 be if that surprised me because my 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.280
 brother is unable to get rid of that 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.160
 not the truth that took me by surprise and 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.380
 so I know morrison bad garden like that 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.880
 which I think is from the morning until 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.680
 the afternoon in the garden and the past 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.840
 look for the afternoon in the garden and 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.730
 ask how was the relation of 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.950
 Daniel with the other women 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.870
 with elena and with mine look at them hill 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.390
 they were separated then they came 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.450
 very little time here so no 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.970
 we had a lot of connection with it let's say 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.610
 and with 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.470
 with the Italian we have excellent 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.050
 relationship come here with the girls 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.580
 they were a little while ago the truth 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.190
 that we have no problem with 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.100
 none if they have problems is a 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.200
 problem of them but the truth that 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.390
 I think it's all right as daniel 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.730
 Osvaldo for many this talk about him and 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.920
 good without knowing it as I would describe it 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.380
 it's your brother he's an excellent 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.580
 person beyond everything they say 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.580
 cut by him
