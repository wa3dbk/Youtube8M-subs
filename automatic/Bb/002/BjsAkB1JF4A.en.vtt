00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
sticks and this is basically I think

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.770

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
impregnated or dipped fatwood and if

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.370 
impregnated or dipped fatwood and if
you're<00:01:57.680> not<00:01:57.770> an<00:01:57.950> area<00:01:58.280> that's<00:01:58.369> really<00:01:59.380> prone

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
you're not an area that's really prone

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.020 
you're not an area that's really prone
to<00:02:00.590> having<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:00.920> good<00:02:01.190> supply<00:02:01.430> of<00:02:01.460> fat<00:02:01.729> what<00:02:01.910> it

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
to having a good supply of fat what it

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
was a Ferro rod based test now that

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.030 
was a Ferro rod based test now that
lights<00:03:41.450> up<00:03:41.569> pretty<00:03:41.780> easily<00:03:41.989> put<00:03:42.650> my<00:03:42.770> knife<00:03:42.890> on
