great spin I'll flip you over quite a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.410 
great spin I'll flip you over quite a
bit<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.680> use<00:01:32.009> two<00:01:32.280> turns<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.150> just

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
bit and use two turns and then just

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.319 
bit and use two turns and then just
extend<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:34.409> knees<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.790> are<00:01:35.820> D<00:01:36.150> cap

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
extend your knees and there we are D cap

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.210 
extend your knees and there we are D cap
there's<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.290> lot<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.770> done<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:38.159> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
there's a lot that can be done with that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.740 
there's a lot that can be done with that
move<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.520> there's<00:01:38.729> probably<00:01:39.150> about<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.360> billion

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
move it there's probably about a billion

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.819 
move it there's probably about a billion
ways<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.110> set<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.590> there's<00:01:40.740> probably

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
ways to set it up and there's probably

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.440 
ways to set it up and there's probably
better<00:01:41.189> destruction<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:41.970> get<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.329> it

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
better destruction you can get with it

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.600 
better destruction you can get with it
so<00:01:43.290> let's<00:01:43.439> just<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> look<00:01:43.770> at<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> replay

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
so let's just have a look at the replay

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.130 
so let's just have a look at the replay
and<00:01:44.909> I'd<00:01:44.970> love<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.390> some<00:01:45.600> replays<00:01:46.049> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and I'd love to get some replays and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.690 
and I'd love to get some replays and
maybe<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.439> people<00:01:46.649> doing<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.009> much<00:01:47.460> better

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
maybe of people doing it much better

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.770 
maybe of people doing it much better
