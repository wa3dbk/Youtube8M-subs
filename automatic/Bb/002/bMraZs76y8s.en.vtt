out<00:06:29.469> if<00:06:29.860> this<00:06:30.249> really<00:06:30.519> works<00:06:30.849> um<00:06:31.409> but<00:06:32.409> as<00:06:32.649> of

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
out if this really works um but as of

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.279 
out if this really works um but as of
now<00:06:33.179> the<00:06:34.179> past<00:06:34.449> few<00:06:34.569> days<00:06:34.779> that<00:06:34.809> I've<00:06:35.110> been

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289

using it I feel like it does work

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:38.639 
using it I feel like it does work
because<00:06:37.479> it's<00:06:37.659> actually<00:06:38.049> been<00:06:38.199> clearing<00:06:38.499> at
