00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.070
 good then let's explain how 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.530
 put the iphone screen on the 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.270
 computer there are different tools 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.170
 for this look what else I like the 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.170
 reflector 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.340
 about life 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.100
 this is the official page I bought it 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.610
 the crack there online because this 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.280
 mine fire did not work for me and the 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.710
 I bought the download and it was perfect not 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.500

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.610
 nice here 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.610

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.750
 we double- click will appear here in the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.570
 of tasks we set and I am informed not 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.160
 you do not even collaborate if you do not want 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.100
 this is to choose the type of 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.360
 device that has the name of the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.660
 computer that will appear in the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.910
 mobile phone and the password that the lift signals 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.510
 but if they are at home, it does not 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.030
 they need to put 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.350
 well once we have done this already with 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.350
 the reflector 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.870
 online active we go to the mobile 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.610
 We raise the center tab 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.670
 control and now you will see it is already there 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.440
 well look for it they have to lift 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.850
 the president of control center and here 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.730
 they will appear to airplay click on iphone and 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.280
 the name is not a computer and they give 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.620
 duplicate and already have on your screen the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.229
 iphone on the computer and I with the 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.180
 crack version because this one when I set your 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.570
 application that I do not know why but in the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.340
 mobile jumped from computer not from Eden 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.130
 from the computer to the iphone all the time pam 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.400
 pam pam and you can not if you stay towards 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.440
 the west by by downloading the official and 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.440
 company are ten euros 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:00.050
 Well, you see here they have the 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:03.980
 mobile screen the same and with the 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:08.979
 Right click on win now and 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:11.890
 could enter full screen 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.860
 remove the frame to the mobile if they do not want 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.280
 in the frame change the color to white 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.280
 or black 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.239
 I like more white can also 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.450
 record videos 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.570
 change the size of the mobile do it in 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.570
 big 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.030
 yes, it serves because if we do like this 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.500
 Thank you 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:45.380
 black landscape 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.090
 we can choose the mobile to the youngsters 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.860
 or whatever we want 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:55.150
 for example used 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.830
 the cold gba and then nothing can play 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.550
 exactly the games because the screen 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.150
 of the perfect computer where I'm going to 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.150
 no problem 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.440
 and automatic orientation is for us 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.020
 let's put again in here the same 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.430
 we are in the application that 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.430
 it can be landscape 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.940
 vertical as it is for example 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.100
 the calendar and us turning the 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.590
 mobile device will change 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.920
 directly to the screen you will see another 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.030
 once changed this is very practical 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.270
 provided they have the option of 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.710
 automatic orientation and nothing because I 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.710
 I think that 's all 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.510
 so I hope you liked it and 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.290
 nothing 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.290
 until next time
