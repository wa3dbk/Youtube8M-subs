bringing the people behind our food to
life<00:00:03.500> let<00:00:04.500> me<00:00:04.529> talk<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.799> little<00:00:04.950> bit<00:00:05.310> first

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
life let me talk a little bit first

life let me talk a little bit first
about<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.270> wage<00:00:06.450> reporter<00:00:06.899> truffle<00:00:07.230> oils<00:00:07.470> are

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
about the wage reporter truffle oils are

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.580 
about the wage reporter truffle oils are
made<00:00:07.859> years<00:00:08.670> ago<00:00:08.730> they<00:00:09.420> were<00:00:09.480> able<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:09.960> isolate

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
made years ago they were able to isolate

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.980 
made years ago they were able to isolate
the<00:00:11.219> strongest<00:00:11.639> gasses<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.360> truffles<00:00:12.660> and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
the strongest gasses in truffles and

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.530 
the strongest gasses in truffles and
then<00:00:13.559> synthesize<00:00:14.009> them<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.790> then<00:00:15.120> put<00:00:15.389> them

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
then synthesize them and then put them

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.779 
then synthesize them and then put them
inside<00:00:15.780> extra-virgin<00:00:16.740> olive<00:00:16.770> oil<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:17.640> what

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
inside extra-virgin olive oil so what

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.910 
inside extra-virgin olive oil so what
you<00:00:17.910> get<00:00:18.119> from<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> very<00:00:19.230> strong<00:00:19.650> very

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
you get from that is a very strong very

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.189 
you get from that is a very strong very
powerful<00:00:20.070> oil<00:00:20.670> which<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.330> extremely<00:00:21.900> popular

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
powerful oil which is extremely popular

on<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.310> market<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.689> bit<00:00:25.199> unfair

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
on the on the market it's a bit unfair

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.439 
on the on the market it's a bit unfair
to<00:00:25.650> call<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.220> synthetic<00:00:26.699> gas<00:00:26.910> because<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
to call it a synthetic gas because the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.870 
to call it a synthetic gas because the
gas<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.840> actually<00:00:28.680> reproduced<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.609> has<00:00:29.699> never

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
in the truffle the fact of the matter is

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.490 
in the truffle the fact of the matter is
though<00:00:37.829> truffles<00:00:38.730> contain<00:00:39.120> upwards<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:40.020> 50

different volatile organic compounds

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.290 
different volatile organic compounds
what<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.780> call<00:00:42.989> VOCs<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> common<00:00:45.149> make

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
what we call VOCs so the common make

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.510 
what we call VOCs so the common make
combination<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.200> all<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.559> those<00:00:46.800> compounds

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
combination of all of those compounds

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.840 
combination of all of those compounds
makes<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.480> olfactory<00:00:48.930> reception<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
truffle oil something far more complex

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.310 
truffle oil something far more complex
and<00:00:53.219> what<00:00:53.309> we've<00:00:53.460> ever<00:00:53.699> experienced<00:00:54.480> when<00:00:55.289> I

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and what we've ever experienced when I

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.319 
and what we've ever experienced when I
began<00:00:55.620> my<00:00:55.829> experimentation<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.879> production

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
began my experimentation and production

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.479 
began my experimentation and production
of<00:00:57.420> our<00:00:57.510> truffle<00:00:57.870> oil<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.559> was<00:00:59.100> able<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.370> achieve

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
of our truffle oil I was able to achieve

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.580 
of our truffle oil I was able to achieve
a<00:00:59.730> method<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.390> producing<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.140> truffle<00:01:01.500> oil

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
a method of producing a truffle oil

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.889 
a method of producing a truffle oil
which<00:01:02.219> pulls<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.760> many<00:01:03.059> many<00:01:03.359> more<00:01:03.600> those

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
which pulls in many many more those

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.320 
which pulls in many many more those
volatile<00:01:04.320> organic<00:01:04.710> compounds<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> end

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
volatile organic compounds so the end

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.390 
volatile organic compounds so the end
result<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.380> see<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.010> naturally

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
result and what you see in a naturally

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.340 
result and what you see in a naturally
infused<00:01:08.760> truffle<00:01:09.180> oil<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.570> always<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
infused truffle oil is always going to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.130 
infused truffle oil is always going to
be<00:01:10.409> milder<00:01:11.040> than<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.729> synthetically<00:01:12.450> infused

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
be milder than a synthetically infused

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.340 
be milder than a synthetically infused
truffle<00:01:13.560> oil<00:01:13.909> but<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.420> also<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.840> lot<00:01:16.110> more

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
truffle oil but it's also a lot more

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.920 
truffle oil but it's also a lot more
complex<00:01:16.860> because<00:01:17.700> basically<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
complex because basically you have a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.770 
complex because basically you have a
large<00:01:19.320> grouping<00:01:19.890> 45<00:01:20.490> or<00:01:20.759> 50<00:01:21.060> volatile<00:01:21.450> organic

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
large grouping 45 or 50 volatile organic

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.060 
large grouping 45 or 50 volatile organic
compounds<00:01:22.350> now<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.950> oil<00:01:23.479> with<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
compounds now in that oil with the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.530 
compounds now in that oil with the
European<00:01:26.070> version<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:27.150> maybe

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
European version so you get one maybe

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.990 
European version so you get one maybe
two<00:01:27.869> different<00:01:28.409> gases<00:01:28.860> which<00:01:29.340> although<00:01:29.610> very

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
two different gases which although very

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.690 
two different gases which although very
makes<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:30.750> very<00:01:30.810> strong<00:01:31.320> oil<00:01:31.700> tends

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
makes for a very very strong oil tends

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.240 
makes for a very very strong oil tends
to<00:01:32.909> miss<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.420> nuance<00:01:33.810> which<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:35.159> what

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to miss the nuance which is really what

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.319 
to miss the nuance which is really what
the<00:01:35.340> squirrels<00:01:35.670> are<00:01:35.790> looking<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the squirrels are looking for in the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.130 
the squirrels are looking for in the
forest<00:01:37.460> when<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.579> eat<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> truffle<00:01:39.390> by<00:01:39.810> itself

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
forest when you eat a truffle by itself

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.350 
forest when you eat a truffle by itself
it<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.470> doesn't<00:01:40.740> taste<00:01:40.979> all<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.460> good<00:01:41.729> it

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it really doesn't taste all that good it

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.469 
it really doesn't taste all that good it
tastes<00:01:42.689> nutty<00:01:43.049> buttery<00:01:43.680> kind<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.479> raw

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
tastes nutty buttery kind of like a raw

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.109 
tastes nutty buttery kind of like a raw
mushroom<00:01:46.130> but<00:01:47.130> once<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.520> swallow<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
mushroom but once you swallow it and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.660 
mushroom but once you swallow it and
your<00:01:48.390> stomach<00:01:48.780> acids<00:01:49.170> work<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.799> very<00:01:50.340> soon

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
your stomach acids work on it very soon

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.940 
your stomach acids work on it very soon
what<00:01:50.939> you'll<00:01:51.090> find<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.799> bit

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
what you'll find is you get a little bit

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.100 
what you'll find is you get a little bit
of<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.399> call<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.820> truffle<00:01:54.240> burp<00:01:54.509> about<00:01:54.869> 10

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
of what we call a truffle burp about 10

eventually go flat those gases will find

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.580 
eventually go flat those gases will find
a<00:03:16.489> way<00:03:16.639> out<00:03:16.940> of<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.329> truffle<00:03:17.690> oil<00:03:17.780> at<00:03:18.139> one<00:03:18.349> time

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
a way out of the truffle oil at one time

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.699 
a way out of the truffle oil at one time
whether<00:03:19.220> they<00:03:19.310> make<00:03:19.639> it<00:03:19.790> through<00:03:20.060> the

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
whether they make it through the

whether they make it through the
interstices<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.430> cap<00:03:22.639> imperfections<00:03:23.599> of

oxygen over a period of time the gases

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.670 
oxygen over a period of time the gases
will<00:03:28.910> find<00:03:29.239> their<00:03:29.389> way<00:03:29.419> out<00:03:29.569> so<00:03:30.169> the<00:03:30.260> important

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
will find their way out so the important

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.319 
will find their way out so the important
thing<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.889> remember<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.459> keep<00:03:31.700> your<00:03:31.940> truffle
