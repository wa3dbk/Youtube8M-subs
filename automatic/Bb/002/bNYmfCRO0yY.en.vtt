00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
in the song structure I'd suggest using

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.110 
in the song structure I'd suggest using
a<00:00:35.760> digital<00:00:35.910> tuner<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> zoom<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.399> if

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
a digital tuner to get the zoom in if

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.950 
a digital tuner to get the zoom in if
you<00:00:39.210> want<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> play<00:00:39.510> along<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.470 
you want to play along with the
recording<00:00:40.699> but<00:00:41.699> kept<00:00:41.910> holding<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> second

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
recording but kept holding the second

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.540 
recording but kept holding the second
fret<00:00:42.660> I'm<00:00:43.500> playing<00:00:43.769> with<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.519> because

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
fret I'm playing with that just because

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.030 
fret I'm playing with that just because
it's<00:00:44.760> easier<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.120> sing<00:00:45.710> let's<00:00:46.710> start<00:00:46.949> as

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
it's easier to sing let's start as

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.970 
it's easier to sing let's start as
always<00:00:47.339> by<00:00:47.600> playing<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.750> singing<00:00:48.920> some<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
always by playing and singing some of

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.079 
always by playing and singing some of
the<00:00:50.040> songs<00:00:50.250> over<00:00:50.400> here<00:00:50.610> how<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.730> sounds<00:00:51.059> and

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
the songs over here how it sounds and

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:52.670 
the songs over here how it sounds and
then<00:00:51.239> we'll<00:00:51.360> go<00:00:51.449> into<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> cinah<00:00:52.409> start

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
then we'll go into in the cinah start

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.990 
then we'll go into in the cinah start
breaking<00:00:52.949> everything<00:00:53.190> down<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.400> stymied

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
breaking everything down so stymied

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:15.000 
breaking everything down so stymied
diverse

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.660 

Oh

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.550 

that's<00:01:21.270> half<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.840> first<00:01:22.080> we're<00:01:22.260> just

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
that's half of the first we're just

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.590 
that's half of the first we're just
going<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.860> repeat<00:01:23.150> we're<00:01:24.150> out<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:24.510> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
going to repeat we're out to get the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.120 
going to repeat we're out to get the
second<00:01:24.840> half<00:01:24.990> obviously<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:26.010> we're

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
second half obviously and then we're

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.410 
second half obviously and then we're
going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> listen<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.090> chorus<00:01:27.300> now

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.240 

and<00:01:40.990> that's<00:01:41.200> half<00:01:41.410> of<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.860> course<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.220> just

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
and that's half of the course you just

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.650 
and that's half of the course you just
want<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.550> repeat<00:01:42.820> that<00:01:42.850> around<00:01:43.180> again<00:01:43.480> the

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
want to repeat that around again the

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.150 
want to repeat that around again the
same<00:01:43.810> football<00:01:44.170> progression<00:01:44.800> to<00:01:44.950> get<00:01:45.070> the

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
same football progression to get the

same football progression to get the
second<00:01:45.430> half<00:01:45.510> okay<00:01:46.510> so<00:01:46.570> now<00:01:46.780> let's<00:01:47.020> have<00:01:47.110> a

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
second half okay so now let's have a

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.950 
second half okay so now let's have a
look<00:01:47.380> at<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.070> chords<00:01:48.690> remember<00:01:49.690> gradual

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
look at the chords remember gradual

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.630 
look at the chords remember gradual
change<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.170> tuning<00:01:50.410> so<00:01:51.250> things<00:01:51.490> are<00:01:51.550> gonna

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
change the tuning so things are gonna

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.640 
change the tuning so things are gonna
seem<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:51.850> bit<00:01:51.970> different

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
seem a bit different

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.010 
seem a bit different
first<00:01:53.650> chords<00:01:53.950> gonna<00:01:54.100> make<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.960> make<00:01:55.960> that

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
first chords gonna make that make that

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.560 
first chords gonna make that make that
point<00:01:56.350> here<00:01:56.590> we're<00:01:56.770> playing<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:57.250> d5<00:01:57.730> but<00:01:58.480> it's

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
point here we're playing a d5 but it's

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.390 
point here we're playing a d5 but it's
the<00:01:58.660> same<00:01:58.840> shape<00:01:59.170> that<00:01:59.740> we<00:01:59.860> would<00:01:59.980> play<00:02:00.160> for<00:02:00.220> an

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
the same shape that we would play for an

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.490 
the same shape that we would play for an
E<00:02:00.520> minor<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:00.970> standard<00:02:01.270> tuning<00:02:01.390> okay<00:02:01.570> so<00:02:01.780> your

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
E minor in standard tuning okay so your

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.600 
E minor in standard tuning okay so your
heads<00:02:02.620> around<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:03.010> fact<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:03.220> we've<00:02:03.400> changed

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
heads around the fact that we've changed

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.170 
heads around the fact that we've changed
the<00:02:03.730> tuning<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.810> concentrate<00:02:05.350> on<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.500> shapes

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the tuning and concentrate on the shapes

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.530 
the tuning and concentrate on the shapes
obviously<00:02:07.180> recognizing<00:02:08.170> names<00:02:09.149> after<00:02:10.149> refer

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
obviously recognizing names after refer

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.450 
obviously recognizing names after refer
to<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.780> name<00:02:10.929> so<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:11.170> can<00:02:11.250> look<00:02:12.250> in<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
to the name so you can look in the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.830 
to the name so you can look in the
description<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.880> stuff<00:02:13.030> but<00:02:13.150> concentrate<00:02:13.660> on

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
description of stuff but concentrate on

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.390 
description of stuff but concentrate on
remembering<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.380> shapes<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.920> order<00:02:15.310> of

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
remembering the shapes and the order of
