00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
hello there and ah strange here again

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.900 
hello there and ah strange here again
turning<00:00:04.020> my<00:00:04.170> phone<00:00:04.350> off<00:00:04.410> so<00:00:04.859> it's<00:00:05.279> less<00:00:05.490> noisy

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
turning my phone off so it's less noisy

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.000 
turning my phone off so it's less noisy
but<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:06.930> just<00:00:07.080> wanted<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.410> show<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.740> little

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
but I just wanted to show you a little

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.070 
but I just wanted to show you a little
further<00:00:08.250> into<00:00:09.000> my<00:00:09.120> workflow<00:00:09.330> when<00:00:09.660> I'm<00:00:09.780> doing

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
further into my workflow when I'm doing

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.620 
further into my workflow when I'm doing
to<00:00:10.200> make<00:00:10.320> my<00:00:10.500> new<00:00:10.620> film<00:00:10.940> so<00:00:11.940> since<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.480> showed

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
to make my new film so since I showed

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.940 
to make my new film so since I showed
you<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.840> little<00:00:12.990> bit<00:00:13.139> something<00:00:13.650> about<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
you a little bit something about the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.440 
you a little bit something about the
morphs<00:00:14.309> how<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.610> was<00:00:14.730> gonna<00:00:14.880> use<00:00:15.089> them<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.389> I

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
morphs how it was gonna use them so I

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.700 
morphs how it was gonna use them so I
figured<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.780> should<00:00:15.809> show<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.139> actually<00:00:16.590> how<00:00:16.619> I

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
figured I should show you actually how I

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.450 
figured I should show you actually how I
make<00:00:16.980> them<00:00:17.160> too<00:00:17.660> so<00:00:18.660> I'm<00:00:19.140> here<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.439> ZBrush<00:00:20.039> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
make them too so I'm here in ZBrush and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.890 
make them too so I'm here in ZBrush and
this<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.789> one<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.150> just<00:00:21.180> finished<00:00:21.750> making

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
this is one that I just finished making

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.740 
this is one that I just finished making
the<00:00:22.109> morphs<00:00:22.410> too<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.830> as<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.090> see<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.570> have

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
the morphs too and as you can see I have

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.839 
the morphs too and as you can see I have
all<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> different<00:00:25.410> morphs<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.920> these<00:00:26.580> layers

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
all the different morphs in these layers

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.420 
all the different morphs in these layers
here<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:30.210> way<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.390> did<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.399> I

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
here and the way I did this is that so I

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.060 
here and the way I did this is that so I
have<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> spreadsheet<00:00:33.710> with<00:00:34.710> all<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
have a spreadsheet with all the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.560 
have a spreadsheet with all the
different<00:00:35.250> facial<00:00:35.520> expressions<00:00:35.760> for<00:00:36.390> all<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
different facial expressions for all the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.510 
different facial expressions for all the
different<00:00:36.840> characters<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.890> need<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.250> use

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
different characters that I need to use

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.150 
different characters that I need to use
so<00:00:39.469> you<00:00:40.469> know<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.620> wrote<00:00:40.800> out<00:00:40.980> all<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
so you know I wrote out all the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.190 
so you know I wrote out all the
characters<00:00:41.640> then<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.879> decided<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.809> facial

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
characters then I decided what facial

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.410 
characters then I decided what facial
expressions<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.800> needed<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.430> then<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.239> go

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
expressions I needed and then I just go

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.860 
expressions I needed and then I just go
through<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.780> load<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.320> head<00:00:47.210> into<00:00:48.210> ZBrush<00:00:48.570> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
through I load the head into ZBrush and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.590 
through I load the head into ZBrush and
then<00:00:48.960> make<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> morphs<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.710> export<00:00:50.370> them<00:00:50.600> so

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
then make the morphs and export them so

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.439 
then make the morphs and export them so
I<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:53.100> want<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.340> show<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.550> kind<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.210> little

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
I just want to show you kind of a little

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.600 
I just want to show you kind of a little
bit<00:00:54.570> about<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.960> process<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.710> how<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.309> goes

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
bit about that process and how that goes

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.729 
bit about that process and how that goes
so<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.360> you're<00:00:57.570> following<00:00:58.079> along<00:00:58.170> or<00:00:58.559> doing

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
so if you're following along or doing

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
so if you're following along or doing
something<00:00:59.010> similar<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.579> these<00:01:00.300> aren't<00:01:00.510> like

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
something similar and these aren't like

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.719 
something similar and these aren't like
super<00:01:01.590> crazy<00:01:01.859> advanced<00:01:03.979> ZBrush<00:01:04.979> techniques

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
super crazy advanced ZBrush techniques

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.270 
super crazy advanced ZBrush techniques
or<00:01:05.970> something<00:01:06.439> it's<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.680> pretty<00:01:07.890> normal

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
or something it's just pretty normal

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.580 
or something it's just pretty normal
stuff<00:01:08.400> but<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.150> kind<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.420> good<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.990> know<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
stuff but it's kind of good you know to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.080 
stuff but it's kind of good you know to
see<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.010> action<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:13.080> here's<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:14.010> head<00:01:14.430> from

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
see it in action so here's a head from

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.469 
see it in action so here's a head from
cinema<00:01:15.450> 4d<00:01:16.009> that<00:01:17.009> was<00:01:17.130> exported<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.820> an<00:01:18.000> obj

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
cinema 4d that was exported as an obj

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.109 
cinema 4d that was exported as an obj
which<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:18.960> imported<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:20.100> all<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:20.700> I'm

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
which I just imported so all I do I'm

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.850 
which I just imported so all I do I'm
gonna<00:01:21.360> work<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> same<00:01:21.960> subdivision<00:01:22.229> level

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
gonna work at the same subdivision level

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.590 
gonna work at the same subdivision level
because<00:01:23.070> I'm<00:01:23.189> creating<00:01:23.430> morphs<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.420> this

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
because I'm creating morphs for this

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.789 
because I'm creating morphs for this
exact<00:01:25.020> geometry<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.280> level<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:28.110> want

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
exact geometry at this level so I want

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.730 
exact geometry at this level so I want
to<00:01:28.890> use<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> layer<00:01:29.250> menu<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.079> to<00:01:31.079> help<00:01:31.290> me<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
to use a layer menu and to help me so I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.590 
to use a layer menu and to help me so I
have<00:01:31.979> my<00:01:32.250> spreadsheet<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> piece<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.479> paper

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
have my spreadsheet on a piece of paper

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.870 
have my spreadsheet on a piece of paper
with<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> character<00:01:34.500> name<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:35.579> all<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
with the character name and then all the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.539 
with the character name and then all the
different<00:01:36.150> phases<00:01:36.329> or<00:01:36.930> morphs<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.040> that

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
different phases or morphs that that

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.390 
different phases or morphs that that
character<00:01:39.119> needs<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> decide<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
character needs so I decide if it's a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.800 
character needs so I decide if it's a
little<00:01:41.520> kid<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.090> they'll<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.509> cute

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
little kid then they'll have like cute

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.210 
little kid then they'll have like cute
faces<00:01:43.170> or<00:01:43.290> something<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> mean

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
faces or something if it's like a mean

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.770 
faces or something if it's like a mean
person<00:01:44.549> or<00:01:44.850> something<00:01:45.090> I'll<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.299> cute<00:01:45.600> faces

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
person or something I'll have cute faces

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.260 
person or something I'll have cute faces
will<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.140> more<00:01:46.369> disgusting<00:01:47.369> or<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.149> know

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
will have more disgusting or you know

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.270 
will have more disgusting or you know
faces<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.049> there<00:01:49.439> are<00:01:49.560> appropriate<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:50.100> their

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
faces it there are appropriate for their

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.499 
faces it there are appropriate for their
character<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.869> then<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.259> my<00:01:53.509> workstation

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
character so and then on my workstation

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.060 
character so and then on my workstation
like<00:01:54.930> right<00:01:55.140> underneath<00:01:55.380> my<00:01:55.619> monitor

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
like right underneath my monitor

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.770 
like right underneath my monitor
probably<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.790> would<00:01:57.000> be<00:01:57.149> right<00:01:57.420> here<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.630> have

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
probably like would be right here I have

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.260 
probably like would be right here I have
a<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:57.990> tiny<00:01:58.259> mirror<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.520> when<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.969> come<00:02:00.149> up

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
a little tiny mirror so when I come up

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.550 
a little tiny mirror so when I come up
to<00:02:00.420> an<00:02:00.479> expression<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:01.229> look<00:02:01.320> at<00:02:01.439> myself

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
to an expression I just look at myself

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.469 
to an expression I just look at myself
in<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.860> mirror<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.340> make<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.850> face<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
in the mirror and make that face and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.530 
in the mirror and make that face and
then<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.840> go<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.649> kind<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.070> mimic<00:02:05.340> it

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
then I go in here and kind of mimic it

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.830 
then I go in here and kind of mimic it
so<00:02:06.540> let's<00:02:07.140> get<00:02:07.320> something<00:02:08.179> I'll<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.660> one

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
so let's get something I'll just do one

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.290 
so let's get something I'll just do one
face<00:02:10.080> show<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.349> how<00:02:10.440> do<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.530> do<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.340> make

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
face show you how do you do it so I make

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.760 
face show you how do you do it so I make
a<00:02:12.330> new<00:02:12.510> layer<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.110> now<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.290> can

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
a new layer so now I can

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.520 
a new layer so now I can
and<00:02:14.420> sculpt<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.510> here<00:02:15.720> do<00:02:15.900> whatever<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.260> want

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
and sculpt on here do whatever I want

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.710 
and sculpt on here do whatever I want
and<00:02:16.860> it'll<00:02:17.310> be<00:02:17.730> saved<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.240> lair<00:02:18.450> like<00:02:18.690> a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
and it'll be saved in this lair like a

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.320 
and it'll be saved in this lair like a
morph<00:02:18.990> so<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.950> brush<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.580> like<00:02:20.790> using<00:02:21.090> a

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
morph so the brush that I like using a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.880 
morph so the brush that I like using a
lot<00:02:21.510> for<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.320> move

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
lot for this is the move

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.370 
lot for this is the move
topological<00:02:23.430> brush<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.270> I'll<00:02:24.510> turn<00:02:24.870> symmetry

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
topological brush and I'll turn symmetry

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.820 
topological brush and I'll turn symmetry
on<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.790> then<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:27.210> have<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.570> in<00:02:27.720> two<00:02:27.900> O's<00:02:28.110> for

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
on and then I have it in two O's for

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.560 
on and then I have it in two O's for
that<00:02:29.100> I'm<00:02:29.190> using<00:02:29.220> but<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.820> know<00:02:29.910> any<00:02:30.090> tablet

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
that I'm using but you know any tablet

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.490 
that I'm using but you know any tablet
is<00:02:30.630> good<00:02:30.750> for<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:30.960> or<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.350> probably

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
is good for this or you can probably

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.140 
is good for this or you can probably
even<00:02:31.680> use<00:02:31.770> your<00:02:31.890> mouse<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.850> all<00:02:32.970> you're<00:02:33.060> going

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
even use your mouse so all you're going

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.520 
even use your mouse so all you're going
to<00:02:33.240> do<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.450> move<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.810> points<00:02:34.110> around<00:02:34.200> so

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
to do is move the points around so

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.500 
to do is move the points around so
imagine<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.250> static<00:02:35.790> face<00:02:36.030> or<00:02:36.360> your

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
imagine this is a static face or your

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.420 
imagine this is a static face or your
neutral<00:02:36.840> face<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.320> then<00:02:37.440> I'm<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:37.710> modifying

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
neutral face and then I'm just modifying

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.300 
neutral face and then I'm just modifying
this<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.850> make<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.150> different<00:02:39.570> faces<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:41.280> I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
this to make the different faces so I

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.940 
this to make the different faces so I
want<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.730> make<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.880> scared<00:02:42.390> face<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.620> I'm<00:02:43.770> not

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
want to make a scared face so I'm not

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.160 
want to make a scared face so I'm not
some<00:02:44.160> expert<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:44.940> like<00:02:45.090> faces<00:02:45.660> or<00:02:45.900> facial

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
some expert in like faces or facial

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.350 
some expert in like faces or facial
whatever<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.400> would<00:02:47.520> be<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.880> do<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.120> kind<00:02:48.330> of

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
whatever you would be to do this kind of

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.530 
whatever you would be to do this kind of
stuff<00:02:48.570> all<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.080> look<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.440> mirror<00:02:49.530> and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
with my eyes and then my brows kind of

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.460 
with my eyes and then my brows kind of
come<00:03:01.050> down<00:03:01.380> like<00:03:02.070> this<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:03.450> goes<00:03:03.720> up<00:03:03.960> and

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
come down like this and this goes up and

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.940 
come down like this and this goes up and
then<00:03:05.340> my<00:03:06.120> mouth<00:03:06.420> kind<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.990> turns<00:03:07.230> into<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.560> frown

then my mouth kind of turns into a frown

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.260 
then my mouth kind of turns into a frown
more<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:10.520> and<00:03:11.520> when<00:03:11.700> I'm<00:03:11.790> looking<00:03:11.910> at<00:03:12.150> the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
more so and when I'm looking at the

scared face so all I'm doing is looking

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.210 
scared face so all I'm doing is looking
in<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.550> mirror<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.560> then<00:03:43.560> just<00:03:43.800> using<00:03:44.010> this

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
in the mirror and then just using this

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.210 
in the mirror and then just using this
move<00:03:44.430> topological<00:03:45.270> brush<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:47.040> know<00:03:47.130> you

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
move topological brush and you know you

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.520 
move topological brush and you know you
have<00:03:47.370> your<00:03:47.519> smooth<00:03:47.819> brush<00:03:48.090> on<00:03:48.390> shift<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.350> if

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
have your smooth brush on shift so if

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.460 
have your smooth brush on shift so if
you<00:03:49.620> start<00:03:50.730> up<00:03:50.989> just<00:03:51.989> um<00:03:52.230> you

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
you start up just um you

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.500 
you start up just um you
know<00:03:52.739> smooth<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.190> out<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.310> little<00:03:53.430> bit<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:53.850> this

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
know smooth it out a little bit and this

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.960 
know smooth it out a little bit and this
isn't<00:03:54.870> like<00:03:55.050> a<00:03:55.290> perfect<00:03:56.040> scared<00:03:56.400> face<00:03:56.670> because

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
isn't like a perfect scared face because

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.550 
isn't like a perfect scared face because
this<00:03:57.060> guy<00:03:57.239> has<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.480> really<00:03:57.630> weird-looking<00:03:58.170> face

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
it off and then I can go make another

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.809 
it off and then I can go make another
one<00:04:09.540> so<00:04:10.110> let's<00:04:10.350> just<00:04:10.530> make<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:11.010> one<00:04:11.069> like<00:04:11.580> a

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
one so let's just make this one like a

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.830 
one so let's just make this one like a
happy<00:04:12.299> one<00:04:12.510> or<00:04:12.660> something<00:04:12.989> so<00:04:13.769> let's<00:04:14.430> go<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:15.060> I

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
happy one or something so let's go and I

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.569 
happy one or something so let's go and I
found<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.229> lot<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.410> times<00:04:16.620> when<00:04:16.919> using<00:04:17.310> big

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
found a lot of times when using big

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.039 
found a lot of times when using big
brushes<00:04:17.820> like<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.239> cuz<00:04:18.450> I'm<00:04:18.540> doing<00:04:18.840> real

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
brushes like this cuz I'm doing real

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.110 
brushes like this cuz I'm doing real
broad<00:04:19.320> movements<00:04:19.889> it<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.519> lot<00:04:20.700> of<00:04:20.729> times<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.090> has

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
broad movements it a lot of times it has

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.940 
broad movements it a lot of times it has
a<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.870> wants<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.229> like<00:04:22.350> move<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.650> nose<00:04:22.800> around

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
a it wants to like move the nose around

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.940 
a it wants to like move the nose around
so<00:04:23.310> then<00:04:23.460> I'll<00:04:23.580> mask<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.270> nose<00:04:24.540> out<00:04:24.780> so<00:04:25.740> that

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
so then I'll mask the nose out so that

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.400 
so then I'll mask the nose out so that
you<00:04:26.070> can't<00:04:26.280> really<00:04:26.430> move<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:27.050> so<00:04:28.050> we<00:04:28.169> can<00:04:28.320> do

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
you can't really move it so we can do

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.310 
you can't really move it so we can do
some<00:04:28.560> other<00:04:28.620> things<00:04:28.950> here<00:04:29.720> without<00:04:30.720> screwing

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
some other things here without screwing

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.640 
some other things here without screwing
the<00:04:31.470> nose<00:04:31.620> all<00:04:31.830> up<00:04:32.010> so<00:04:32.270> let's<00:04:33.270> do<00:04:33.479> a<00:04:33.840> crappy

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
the nose all up so let's do a crappy

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:43.670 
the nose all up so let's do a crappy
smile<00:04:35.280> here<00:04:38.210> yes<00:04:39.560> wow<00:04:40.560> I'm<00:04:40.740> so<00:04:41.010> happy<00:04:41.720> and<00:04:42.720> then

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
smile here yes wow I'm so happy and then

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.850 
smile here yes wow I'm so happy and then
you<00:04:43.830> know<00:04:43.950> then<00:04:44.190> we<00:04:44.340> would<00:04:44.490> have<00:04:44.700> a<00:04:45.650> layer<00:04:46.650> for

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
you know then we would have a layer for

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.700 
you know then we would have a layer for
aisle<00:04:49.860> okay

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
aisle okay

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.750 
aisle okay
so<00:04:52.710> now<00:04:52.830> we<00:04:52.919> can<00:04:53.070> go<00:04:53.160> through<00:04:53.190> here<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.700> you

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
so now we can go through here and you

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.520 
so now we can go through here and you
can<00:04:53.910> see<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.180> scared<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:55.740> oh<00:04:56.640> this<00:04:57.270> one<00:04:57.530> so

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
can see the scared and oh this one so

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.950 
can see the scared and oh this one so
then<00:04:58.710> all<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.160> do<00:04:59.370> is<00:04:59.669> export<00:05:00.180> them<00:05:00.419> I<00:05:00.570> turn<00:05:00.750> off

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
then all I do is export them I turn off

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.440 
then all I do is export them I turn off
the<00:05:01.560> groups<00:05:01.919> and<00:05:02.130> all<00:05:02.220> this<00:05:02.340> stuff<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:02.850> then<00:05:03.210> I

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
the groups and all this stuff and then I

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.590 
the groups and all this stuff and then I
just<00:05:03.660> go<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:04.229> morph<00:05:04.530> turn<00:05:05.130> it<00:05:05.280> on<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.760> then

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
just go to the morph turn it on and then

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.800 
just go to the morph turn it on and then
export<00:05:07.140> it<00:05:07.229> as<00:05:07.350> an<00:05:07.500> obj<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.340> then<00:05:09.330> load<00:05:09.570> that

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
export it as an obj and then load that

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.210 
export it as an obj and then load that
and<00:05:09.990> turn<00:05:10.140> that<00:05:10.260> into<00:05:10.440> a<00:05:10.530> morph<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:10.919> cinema<00:05:11.190> 4d

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
and turn that into a morph and cinema 4d

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.250 
and turn that into a morph and cinema 4d
and<00:05:11.550> then<00:05:11.760> I<00:05:11.820> go<00:05:11.940> through<00:05:12.120> my<00:05:12.210> layers<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.930> go

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
and then I go through my layers and go

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.110 
and then I go through my layers and go
through<00:05:13.440> all<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.650> characters<00:05:14.070> till<00:05:14.970> it's

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
through all the characters till it's

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.800 
through all the characters till it's
done<00:05:15.390> so<00:05:16.340> just<00:05:17.340> with<00:05:17.490> this<00:05:17.669> in<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.210> mirror<00:05:18.630> and

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
done so just with this in a mirror and

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.690 
done so just with this in a mirror and
the<00:05:18.930> move<00:05:19.110> topological<00:05:19.830> brush<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:20.400> a<00:05:20.669> little

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
the move topological brush and a little

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.200 
the move topological brush and a little
bit<00:05:21.030> of<00:05:21.740> masking<00:05:22.740> and<00:05:22.979> then<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:23.820> know<00:05:23.910> you<00:05:23.970> can

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
bit of masking and then you know you can

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.540 
bit of masking and then you know you can
go<00:05:24.360> press<00:05:25.020> X<00:05:25.289> and<00:05:25.470> go<00:05:25.530> into<00:05:25.650> a<00:05:25.740> symmetry<00:05:26.280> for

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
go press X and go into a symmetry for

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.240 
go press X and go into a symmetry for
for<00:05:26.880> faces<00:05:27.240> to<00:05:27.389> to<00:05:27.690> adjust<00:05:27.990> things<00:05:28.440> but<00:05:29.130> this

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
for faces to to adjust things but this

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.670 
for faces to to adjust things but this
is<00:05:29.430> the<00:05:29.550> way<00:05:29.669> that<00:05:30.000> I'm<00:05:30.240> using<00:05:30.510> cinema<00:05:31.320> 4d<00:05:31.530> of
