 it is compatible lte at home and then 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.090
 around the design 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.950
 it appears that certainly off that all 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.470

 2 megapixel camera based 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.729
 versions and operators to the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.550
 negative pizzas that missed the states 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.770
 United 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.799
 I think that I 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:21.200
 nice specialties 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.820
 we have a taste because on our left on the 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.480
 right lock it unlock 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.480
 the knives fly 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.650
 the volume canton here on the left 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.930
 sorry that's not all he'll find 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.990
 after 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.590
 m 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.590
 we go from cnom 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.110
 listen again and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.010
 in four years 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.260
 the overlay of lg ayache 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.820
 with some heads that of 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.850
 friendly going to very well 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.670
 the interface only on 4 x hd etc with 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.130
 some differences m 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.740
 there was always thought that my words that 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.080
 allows 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.980
 access to purchases 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.500
 no no 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.790
 elan it is what we can 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.370
 m 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.230
 we can actually make a payment from 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.730
 a screenshot always shown 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.519
 good that's it I think you already have 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.170
 seen what kind of key features on 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.510
 mike is only valid on this terminal 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.340
 must still because it gave 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.050
 5 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.050
 the video you can watch 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.050
 1 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.150
 an idea of ​​an island in the video 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.189
 see here with little robert 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.750
 it's totally that he did not say that 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.920
 it's the first thing can be 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.450
 interesting if you watch videos 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.780
 of family that kind of things about 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.780
 divx 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.520
 good evening 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.460
 I find second thing you are in 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.660
 watch a video you receive 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.660
 a tackle at for example your luck 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.760
 in fact the coup 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.010
 opacity of the video 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.010
 I'm talking about m like that is 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.310
 continue to manipulate the interface 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.090
 was going to answer a text message c 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.160
 that the video still actually in the 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.480
 vines 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.850
 and then there they will return a guest 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.440
 it's interesting that you hide 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.780
 your bad 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.790
 what it can give 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.560
 I know that copy paste 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.540
 it may be a small harm because 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.160
 see the video in transparency 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.290
 but why pass a course and innovate 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.920
 it's to tell you one device 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.640
 for the rest we will see that during tests 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.640
 the date of 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.850
 we determine 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.670
 it's not necessarily a certainty 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.270
 iaea 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.270
 what we heard 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.569
 and who wants is that everything is there 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.260
 today on this device from and 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.260
 I hope this little town 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.360
