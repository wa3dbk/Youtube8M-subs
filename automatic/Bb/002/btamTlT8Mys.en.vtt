00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
and then two in the middle and that's

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.089 
and then two in the middle and that's
just<00:02:45.329> a<00:02:45.420> practice<00:02:45.840> pushing<00:02:46.109> off<00:02:46.410> it's<00:02:46.920> not

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
just a practice pushing off it's not

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.789 
just a practice pushing off it's not
really<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.819> replicate<00:02:48.450> skating<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.470> work

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
really to replicate skating and work

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.349 
really to replicate skating and work
your<00:02:49.980> skating<00:02:50.250> muscles<00:02:50.730> or<00:02:50.970> give<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.299> a

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
your skating muscles or give you a

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.930 
your skating muscles or give you a
workout<00:02:51.870> from<00:02:52.170> skating<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:53.190> think<00:02:53.790> it's

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
workout from skating I think it's

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.210 
workout from skating I think it's
basically<00:02:54.120> for<00:02:54.569> beginner<00:02:55.470> players<00:02:55.950> who<00:02:56.099> would

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
basically for beginner players who would

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.250 
basically for beginner players who would
need<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.459> work<00:02:56.579> on<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:56.849> Drive<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.720> if<00:02:57.959> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
need to work on this Drive so if the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.839 
need to work on this Drive so if the
players<00:02:58.500> are<00:02:58.650> running<00:02:58.829> on<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.190> ice<00:02:59.340> the

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
players are running on the ice the

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.210 
players are running on the ice the
rotating<00:03:00.480> discs<00:03:00.840> won't<00:03:01.079> allow<00:03:01.349> them<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.829> get<00:03:02.190> a

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
rotating discs won't allow them to get a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.710 
rotating discs won't allow them to get a
full<00:03:02.459> thrust<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.909> get<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> full<00:03:03.239> thrust<00:03:03.569> they

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
full thrust you get a full thrust they

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.890 
full thrust you get a full thrust they
have<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.930> push<00:03:04.260> off<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.940> give<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:05.970> nice<00:03:06.209> solid

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
have to push off and give a nice solid

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.770 
have to push off and give a nice solid
push<00:03:07.109> and<00:03:07.440> straight<00:03:08.250> back<00:03:08.430> 45-degree<00:03:09.359> angle

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
push and straight back 45-degree angle

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.050 
push and straight back 45-degree angle
to<00:03:10.170> move<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:10.950> next<00:03:11.069> disc<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:11.940> it's

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
to move to the next disc so it's

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.360 
to move to the next disc so it's
basically<00:03:12.329> teaching<00:03:12.840> your<00:03:13.319> foot<00:03:13.889> movement

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
basically teaching your foot movement

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.129 
basically teaching your foot movement
and<00:03:14.579> your<00:03:14.760> location<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.389> your<00:03:15.510> stride<00:03:15.840> and

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
and your location and your stride and

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.229 
and your location and your stride and
the<00:03:16.200> angle<00:03:16.799> you<00:03:16.919> have<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.130> push<00:03:17.310> off<00:03:17.519> on<00:03:17.760> so

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
the angle you have to push off on so

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.909 
the angle you have to push off on so
that's<00:03:18.389> the<00:03:18.569> purpose<00:03:19.139> the<00:03:19.260> rotating<00:03:19.620> discs

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
that's the purpose the rotating discs

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.069 
that's the purpose the rotating discs
next<00:03:20.459> we<00:03:20.549> have<00:03:20.700> these<00:03:20.910> rectangle<00:03:21.540> pieces<00:03:21.690> it's

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
next we have these rectangle pieces it's

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.750 
next we have these rectangle pieces it's
two<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.290> these<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.859> they<00:03:23.010> fit<00:03:23.220> similar<00:03:23.579> to

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
two of these and they fit similar to

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.849 
two of these and they fit similar to
have<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.030> rotating<00:03:24.450> disc<00:03:24.660> will<00:03:24.900> but<00:03:25.530> instead

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
have the rotating disc will but instead

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.530 
have the rotating disc will but instead
of<00:03:26.040> moving<00:03:26.609> forwards<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.120> just<00:03:27.299> move<00:03:27.419> them

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
of moving forwards you just move them

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.479 
of moving forwards you just move them
side<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.780> side<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.799> can<00:03:29.129> put<00:03:29.340> them

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
side to side so you can put them

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.589 
side to side so you can put them
anywhere<00:03:29.760> along<00:03:30.389> this<00:03:30.780> edge<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.349> there's

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
anywhere along this edge and there's

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.150 
anywhere along this edge and there's
multiple<00:03:33.599> spots<00:03:33.840> where<00:03:34.139> you<00:03:34.169> can<00:03:34.319> put<00:03:34.500> them<00:03:34.650> so

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
multiple spots where you can put them so

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.680 
multiple spots where you can put them so
you<00:03:35.250> can<00:03:35.549> make<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.910> shorter<00:03:36.389> or<00:03:36.569> longer

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
you can make the shorter or longer

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.270 
you can make the shorter or longer
depending<00:03:37.019> on<00:03:37.349> how<00:03:37.470> far<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.769> want<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.069> slide

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
depending on how far you want to slide

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.520 
depending on how far you want to slide
but<00:03:39.030> these<00:03:39.180> ones<00:03:39.449> once<00:03:40.019> again<00:03:40.199> it's<00:03:40.379> not

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
but these ones once again it's not

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.189 
but these ones once again it's not
really<00:03:40.889> exactly<00:03:41.069> like<00:03:41.609> skating<00:03:41.940> but<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.900> can

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
really exactly like skating but you can

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.379 
really exactly like skating but you can
push<00:03:43.560> off<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.129> that<00:03:44.549> will<00:03:44.669> teach<00:03:44.879> players<00:03:45.150> to

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
push off and that will teach players to

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.289 
push off and that will teach players to
use<00:03:45.480> their<00:03:45.660> edges<00:03:46.669> with<00:03:47.669> these<00:03:47.879> it's<00:03:48.150> nice

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
use their edges with these it's nice

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.400 
use their edges with these it's nice
because<00:03:48.449> you<00:03:48.540> can<00:03:48.690> practice<00:03:49.019> your<00:03:49.169> lateral

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
because you can practice your lateral

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.930 
because you can practice your lateral
movements<00:03:50.010> can<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.340> slide<00:03:50.609> it<00:03:50.730> back<00:03:50.910> and

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
movements can you slide it back and

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.000 
movements can you slide it back and
forth<00:03:51.180> while<00:03:51.930> your<00:03:52.079> stick<00:03:52.290> handling<00:03:52.590> it's

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
forth while your stick handling it's

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.259 
forth while your stick handling it's
kind<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.250> cool<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.459> do<00:03:53.699> it<00:03:53.849> while<00:03:54.090> you're

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
kind of cool to do it while you're

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.610 
kind of cool to do it while you're
sticking<00:03:54.629> with<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.930> pockets<00:03:55.349> head<00:03:55.470> is

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
sticking with the pockets head is

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.530 
sticking with the pockets head is
standing<00:03:55.919> still

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
standing still

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.810 
standing still
it's<00:03:57.960> slide<00:03:58.230> back<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.650> forth<00:03:58.710> the<00:03:59.100> same<00:03:59.250> size

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
it's slide back and forth the same size

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.660 
it's slide back and forth the same size
that<00:03:59.850> flair<00:04:00.440> for<00:04:01.440> move<00:04:01.710> it's<00:04:02.160> similar<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.550> that

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
that flair for move it's similar to that

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.000 
that flair for move it's similar to that
motion<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.630> can<00:04:03.780> pull<00:04:03.990> your<00:04:04.110> side<00:04:04.530> stack<00:04:04.830> from

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
motion you can pull your side stack from

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.950 
motion you can pull your side stack from
slide<00:04:05.250> over<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:05.700> grab<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:05.910> top<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:06.630> it's<00:04:06.780> kind

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
slide over and grab the top so it's kind

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.170 
slide over and grab the top so it's kind
of<00:04:07.020> a<00:04:07.170> cool<00:04:07.530> addition<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.610> stick<00:04:08.820> handling

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
of a cool addition to stick handling

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.610 
of a cool addition to stick handling
instead<00:04:09.660> of<00:04:09.750> just<00:04:09.840> standing<00:04:10.080> still<00:04:10.320> you<00:04:10.500> have

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
instead of just standing still you have

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.930 
instead of just standing still you have
a<00:04:10.650> bit<00:04:10.800> of<00:04:10.890> movement<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:11.820> think

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
a bit of movement in it so I think

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.820 
a bit of movement in it so I think
that's<00:04:12.150> pretty<00:04:12.360> cool<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:12.960> now<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:13.620> going<00:04:13.800> to

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
that's pretty cool and now it's going to

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.900 
that's pretty cool and now it's going to
be<00:04:13.920> my<00:04:14.010> overall<00:04:14.400> thoughts<00:04:14.610> with<00:04:14.850> slide

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
be my overall thoughts with slide

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.370 
be my overall thoughts with slide
overall<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.180> g1<00:04:18.480> extreme<00:04:18.780> side<00:04:18.989> bar<00:04:19.230> it's<00:04:19.320> a

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
overall the g1 extreme side bar it's a

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.080 
overall the g1 extreme side bar it's a
pretty<00:04:19.590> cool<00:04:19.830> product<00:04:20.100> just<00:04:20.730> going<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.940> talk

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
pretty cool product just going to talk

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.820 
pretty cool product just going to talk
about<00:04:21.420> what<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:21.900> like<00:04:22.140> but<00:04:22.350> I<00:04:22.410> didn't<00:04:22.710> like

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
about what I like but I didn't like

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.590 
about what I like but I didn't like
first<00:04:23.250> I'll<00:04:23.400> start<00:04:23.490> with<00:04:23.730> what<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.120> wasn't<00:04:24.330> too

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
first I'll start with what I wasn't too

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.310 
first I'll start with what I wasn't too
keen<00:04:24.810> about<00:04:24.980> first<00:04:25.980> one<00:04:26.130> would<00:04:26.280> be<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.730> price

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
keen about first one would be the price

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.440 
keen about first one would be the price
$379<00:04:28.350> it's<00:04:28.590> pretty<00:04:28.920> steep<00:04:29.210> quite<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.240> bit<00:04:30.390> of

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
$379 it's pretty steep quite a bit of

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.180 
$379 it's pretty steep quite a bit of
money<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.660> pay<00:04:30.960> but<00:04:31.500> I<00:04:31.560> guess<00:04:31.770> you're<00:04:31.920> getting

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
money to pay but I guess you're getting

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.550 
money to pay but I guess you're getting
a<00:04:32.250> fairly<00:04:32.700> big<00:04:33.030> sized<00:04:33.450> slide<00:04:33.900> board<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:34.500> you

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
a fairly big sized slide board and you

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.800 
a fairly big sized slide board and you
can<00:04:34.710> do<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.800> few<00:04:35.040> things<00:04:35.070> on<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:35.670> so<00:04:36.150> there's<00:04:36.720> a

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
can do a few things on it so there's a

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.810 
can do a few things on it so there's a
pros<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.110> cons<00:04:37.290> there<00:04:37.710> another<00:04:38.460> thing<00:04:38.640> that<00:04:38.760> I

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
pros and cons there another thing that I

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.130 
pros and cons there another thing that I
didn't<00:04:39.030> really<00:04:39.120> like<00:04:39.210> about<00:04:39.390> it<00:04:39.720> was<00:04:40.110> the

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
didn't really like about it was the

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.160 
didn't really like about it was the
stoppers<00:04:41.010> they're<00:04:41.550> not<00:04:41.700> really

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
stoppers they're not really

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.570 
stoppers they're not really
ergonomically<00:04:43.170> designed<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:44.100> catch<00:04:44.400> your

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
ergonomically designed to catch your

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.260 
ergonomically designed to catch your
feet<00:04:44.790> and<00:04:45.030> push<00:04:45.450> off<00:04:45.690> of<00:04:46.310> they<00:04:47.310> work<00:04:47.640> like<00:04:48.180> you

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
feet and push off of they work like you

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.270 
feet and push off of they work like you
can<00:04:48.420> stop<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:48.900> push<00:04:49.020> off<00:04:49.230> them<00:04:49.470> but<00:04:49.650> it'd<00:04:50.250> be

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
can stop and push off them but it'd be

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.010 
can stop and push off them but it'd be
nice<00:04:50.520> if<00:04:50.580> they<00:04:50.940> had<00:04:51.060> some<00:04:51.270> foam<00:04:51.510> padding

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
nice if they had some foam padding

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.720 
nice if they had some foam padding
included<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.860> maybe<00:04:53.010> just<00:04:53.280> some<00:04:53.610> different

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
included and maybe just some different

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.240 
included and maybe just some different
shapes<00:04:54.210> maybe<00:04:55.050> for<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.350> disc<00:04:55.620> make<00:04:56.070> them<00:04:56.190> a

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
shapes maybe for the disc make them a

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.250 
shapes maybe for the disc make them a
cone<00:04:56.460> shape<00:04:56.790> with<00:04:57.030> foam<00:04:57.240> all<00:04:57.450> around<00:04:57.690> it<00:04:57.870> maybe

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
cone shape with foam all around it maybe

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260 
cone shape with foam all around it maybe
easier<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.710> push<00:04:58.890> off<00:04:59.100> of<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.610> feel<00:05:00.120> nice

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
easier to push off of and feel nice

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.120 
easier to push off of and feel nice
around<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.630> feet<00:05:00.840> I<00:05:01.020> notice<00:05:01.620> just<00:05:01.950> from

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
around the feet I notice just from

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.100 
around the feet I notice just from
sliding<00:05:02.400> back<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:02.670> forth<00:05:02.880> quite<00:05:03.390> a<00:05:03.450> bit<00:05:03.720> that

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
sliding back and forth quite a bit that

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.630 
sliding back and forth quite a bit that
the<00:05:04.260> outsides<00:05:04.620> my<00:05:04.800> feet<00:05:05.010> starting<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.430> hurt<00:05:05.520> a

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
the outsides my feet starting to hurt a

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.790 
the outsides my feet starting to hurt a
bit<00:05:05.670> so<00:05:06.360> that's<00:05:06.540> one<00:05:06.810> thing<00:05:07.050> for<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.350> stoppers

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
bit so that's one thing for the stoppers

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.190 
bit so that's one thing for the stoppers
the<00:05:08.730> next<00:05:08.970> thing<00:05:09.180> is<00:05:09.360> for<00:05:09.390> sliding<00:05:09.900> back<00:05:10.170> and

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
the next thing is for sliding back and

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.990 
the next thing is for sliding back and
forth<00:05:10.440> I<00:05:10.920> didn't<00:05:11.130> really<00:05:11.280> notice<00:05:11.430> this<00:05:11.700> when<00:05:11.910> I

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
forth I didn't really notice this when I

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.210 
forth I didn't really notice this when I
was<00:05:12.180> sliding<00:05:12.390> from<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.990> disk<00:05:13.290> to<00:05:13.500> disk<00:05:13.530> but

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
was sliding from the disk to disk but

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.740 
was sliding from the disk to disk but
when<00:05:14.370> I'm<00:05:14.430> sliding<00:05:14.640> back<00:05:15.030> and<00:05:15.060> forth<00:05:15.270> that

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
when I'm sliding back and forth that

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.410 
when I'm sliding back and forth that
ball<00:05:15.990> these<00:05:16.200> holes<00:05:16.500> lined<00:05:16.860> up<00:05:17.040> and<00:05:17.250> it<00:05:18.180> doesn't

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
ball these holes lined up and it doesn't

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.940 
ball these holes lined up and it doesn't
really<00:05:18.510> impede<00:05:19.050> your<00:05:19.230> sliding<00:05:19.620> it's<00:05:19.740> just<00:05:19.890> a

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
really impede your sliding it's just a

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.190 
really impede your sliding it's just a
bit<00:05:20.100> of<00:05:20.160> annoyance<00:05:20.400> so<00:05:21.120> it's<00:05:21.510> not<00:05:21.930> really<00:05:22.170> that

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
bit of annoyance so it's not really that

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.570 
bit of annoyance so it's not really that
big<00:05:22.500> a<00:05:22.530> deal<00:05:22.710> I<00:05:22.830> just<00:05:23.010> thought<00:05:23.070> I'd<00:05:23.220> mention<00:05:23.520> it

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
big a deal I just thought I'd mention it

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.920 
big a deal I just thought I'd mention it
for<00:05:23.640> the<00:05:23.820> review<00:05:23.970> and<00:05:24.390> you<00:05:24.600> know<00:05:24.690> maybe

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
for the review and you know maybe

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.290 
for the review and you know maybe
someone<00:05:25.230> else<00:05:25.440> might<00:05:25.590> notice<00:05:25.890> it<00:05:26.040> there<00:05:26.300> but

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
someone else might notice it there but

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.880 
someone else might notice it there but
it's<00:05:27.600> know<00:05:27.690> works<00:05:27.900> great<00:05:28.170> for<00:05:28.200> sliding<00:05:28.740> and

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
it's know works great for sliding and

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.620 
it's know works great for sliding and
that's<00:05:29.340> what<00:05:29.610> I'm<00:05:29.730> going<00:05:29.850> to<00:05:29.910> get<00:05:30.030> to<00:05:30.180> next<00:05:30.480> is

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
that's what I'm going to get to next is

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.850 
that's what I'm going to get to next is
the<00:05:30.810> things<00:05:30.990> that<00:05:31.110> I<00:05:31.170> really<00:05:31.440> did<00:05:31.650> like<00:05:31.830> about

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
the things that I really did like about

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.910 
the things that I really did like about
the<00:05:32.190> slide<00:05:32.400> board<00:05:33.440> one<00:05:34.440> thing<00:05:34.560> that<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:34.710> really

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
the slide board one thing that I really

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.590 
the slide board one thing that I really
liked<00:05:35.100> about<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:35.400> slide<00:05:35.610> board<00:05:35.910> is<00:05:36.090> how<00:05:36.330> well

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
liked about the slide board is how well

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.090 
liked about the slide board is how well
you<00:05:36.630> can<00:05:36.990> actually<00:05:37.320> slide<00:05:37.560> on<00:05:37.770> it<00:05:37.920> when<00:05:38.040> you

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
you can actually slide on it when you

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.950 
you can actually slide on it when you
have<00:05:38.220> the<00:05:38.280> booties<00:05:38.520> on<00:05:38.760> you<00:05:39.240> push<00:05:39.450> off<00:05:39.690> and

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
have the booties on you push off and

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.330 
have the booties on you push off and
slide<00:05:40.169> from<00:05:40.410> one<00:05:40.440> end<00:05:40.770> right<00:05:40.980> to<00:05:41.100> the<00:05:41.190> other

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
slide from one end right to the other

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.430 
slide from one end right to the other
feels<00:05:41.940> really<00:05:42.150> cool<00:05:42.360> to<00:05:42.540> be<00:05:42.660> sliding<00:05:43.020> sideways

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
feels really cool to be sliding sideways

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.350 
feels really cool to be sliding sideways
like<00:05:43.830> that<00:05:43.890> similar<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.610> how<00:05:44.730> you<00:05:44.790> are<00:05:44.940> on<00:05:45.120> the

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
like that similar to how you are on the

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.670 
like that similar to how you are on the
ice<00:05:45.480> so<00:05:45.990> I<00:05:46.020> thought<00:05:46.169> that<00:05:46.260> was<00:05:46.350> really<00:05:46.440> cool

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
ice so I thought that was really cool

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.040 
ice so I thought that was really cool
and<00:05:46.740> also<00:05:46.950> with<00:05:47.250> a<00:05:47.280> POC<00:05:47.580> rubber<00:05:48.480> puck<00:05:48.750> or<00:05:49.020> a

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
and also with a POC rubber puck or a

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.850 
and also with a POC rubber puck or a
training<00:05:49.350> puck

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
training puck

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.100 
training puck
they<00:05:50.160> both<00:05:50.400> slide<00:05:50.669> very<00:05:51.090> well<00:05:51.330> on<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.990> slide

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
they both slide very well on the slide

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.510 
they both slide very well on the slide
verse<00:05:52.410> that's<00:05:52.530> really<00:05:52.800> cool<00:05:53.070> you<00:05:53.370> can

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
verse that's really cool you can

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.430 
verse that's really cool you can
practice<00:05:53.970> stick<00:05:54.150> handling<00:05:54.480> and<00:05:54.720> if<00:05:55.169> you<00:05:55.260> just

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
practice stick handling and if you just

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.930 
practice stick handling and if you just
use<00:05:55.590> it<00:05:55.620> for<00:05:55.890> that<00:05:55.980> alone<00:05:56.280> you're<00:05:56.700> going<00:05:56.820> to

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
use it for that alone you're going to

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.559 
use it for that alone you're going to
use<00:05:57.300> out<00:05:57.510> of<00:05:57.540> it<00:05:57.750> because<00:05:58.320> you<00:05:58.830> can<00:05:58.950> practice

00:05:59.559 --> 00:05:59.569 
use out of it because you can practice

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.179 
use out of it because you can practice
handling<00:05:59.960> you<00:06:00.349> don't<00:06:00.499> really<00:06:00.649> need<00:06:00.830> to<00:06:00.889> slide

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:01.189 
handling you don't really need to slide

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:02.439 
handling you don't really need to slide
on<00:06:01.339> if<00:06:01.460> you<00:06:01.520> don't<00:06:01.639> want<00:06:01.849> to<00:06:01.999> you<00:06:02.119> can<00:06:02.240> put<00:06:02.270> on

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
on if you don't want to you can put on

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.570 
on if you don't want to you can put on
shoes<00:06:02.689> you<00:06:03.319> run<00:06:03.559> around<00:06:03.649> the<00:06:03.889> outside<00:06:03.949> and

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
shoes you run around the outside and

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.209 
shoes you run around the outside and
pack<00:06:04.729> mystic<00:06:05.089> Hamming<00:06:05.479> and<00:06:05.659> stop<00:06:05.929> stars<00:06:06.469> going

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
pack mystic Hamming and stop stars going

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:08.980 
pack mystic Hamming and stop stars going
side<00:06:07.490> to<00:06:07.520> side<00:06:07.610> so<00:06:07.999> your<00:06:08.119> quick<00:06:08.300> movements<00:06:08.839> and

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
side to side so your quick movements and

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.230 
side to side so your quick movements and
its<00:06:09.679> really<00:06:09.979> good<00:06:10.189> for<00:06:10.219> stick<00:06:10.729> handing<00:06:11.029> on<00:06:11.119> it

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
its really good for stick handing on it

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.939 
its really good for stick handing on it
so<00:06:11.330> I<00:06:11.360> thought<00:06:11.479> that<00:06:11.629> was<00:06:11.719> pretty<00:06:11.839> cool<00:06:12.169> I'm

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:12.949 
so I thought that was pretty cool I'm

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.129 
so I thought that was pretty cool I'm
not<00:06:13.099> too<00:06:13.249> sure<00:06:13.429> about<00:06:13.459> the<00:06:13.969> overall<00:06:14.599> quality

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
not too sure about the overall quality

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:16.179 
not too sure about the overall quality
in<00:06:15.469> the<00:06:15.559> long<00:06:15.770> run

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:16.189 
in the long run

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:17.949 
in the long run
but<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.639> was<00:06:16.849> reading<00:06:17.089> on<00:06:17.149> their<00:06:17.270> website<00:06:17.719> that

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:17.959 
but I was reading on their website that

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:20.049 
but I was reading on their website that
if<00:06:18.199> you<00:06:18.289> put<00:06:18.469> furniture<00:06:18.679> furniture<00:06:19.309> polish<00:06:19.669> on

00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:20.059 
if you put furniture furniture polish on

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:22.109 
if you put furniture furniture polish on
then<00:06:20.719> it<00:06:20.839> will<00:06:20.929> keep<00:06:21.110> it<00:06:21.229> nice<00:06:21.349> and<00:06:21.409> smooth<00:06:21.830> so

00:06:22.109 --> 00:06:22.119 
then it will keep it nice and smooth so

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:25.239 
then it will keep it nice and smooth so
just<00:06:23.119> stuff<00:06:23.360> for<00:06:23.569> a<00:06:23.629> general<00:06:23.929> care<00:06:24.169> if<00:06:24.469> you<00:06:25.009> do

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:25.249 
just stuff for a general care if you do

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:26.859 
just stuff for a general care if you do
have<00:06:25.429> the<00:06:25.550> slide<00:06:25.759> board<00:06:25.999> and<00:06:26.179> you<00:06:26.240> notice<00:06:26.599> it's

00:06:26.859 --> 00:06:26.869 
have the slide board and you notice it's

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:28.659 
have the slide board and you notice it's
not<00:06:27.020> sliding<00:06:27.619> as<00:06:27.800> well<00:06:27.949> as<00:06:28.099> it<00:06:28.249> first<00:06:28.490> did

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
not sliding as well as it first did

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.669 
not sliding as well as it first did
maybe<00:06:29.179> put<00:06:29.389> some<00:06:29.539> furniture<00:06:29.719> polish<00:06:30.289> on<00:06:30.649> it

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:30.679 
maybe put some furniture polish on it

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:33.459 
maybe put some furniture polish on it
and<00:06:31.039> it'll<00:06:31.399> slide<00:06:31.759> a<00:06:31.789> lot<00:06:31.939> better<00:06:32.319> the<00:06:33.319> next

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:33.469 
and it'll slide a lot better the next

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:34.689 
and it'll slide a lot better the next
thing<00:06:33.589> I<00:06:33.619> really<00:06:33.800> liked<00:06:33.949> about<00:06:34.009> sideboard<00:06:34.610> is

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
thing I really liked about sideboard is

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:36.279 
thing I really liked about sideboard is
the<00:06:34.789> multiple<00:06:35.149> applications<00:06:35.809> I've<00:06:36.080> used

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
the multiple applications I've used

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:37.540 
the multiple applications I've used
other<00:06:36.409> slide<00:06:36.680> boards<00:06:37.009> and<00:06:37.159> you<00:06:37.219> can<00:06:37.249> only

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
other slide boards and you can only

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.579 
other slide boards and you can only
slide<00:06:37.759> back<00:06:37.999> and<00:06:38.149> forth<00:06:38.209> this<00:06:38.959> one<00:06:39.199> is<00:06:39.319> kind<00:06:39.529> of

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:39.589 
slide back and forth this one is kind of

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:41.529 
slide back and forth this one is kind of
cool<00:06:39.800> because<00:06:39.979> it's<00:06:40.249> so<00:06:40.399> big<00:06:40.669> you<00:06:40.969> can<00:06:41.300> slide

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:41.539 
cool because it's so big you can slide

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:43.540 
cool because it's so big you can slide
feel<00:06:41.809> from<00:06:42.020> one<00:06:42.169> corner<00:06:42.439> to<00:06:42.589> the<00:06:42.979> middle<00:06:43.129> from

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
feel from one corner to the middle from

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.219 
feel from one corner to the middle from
the<00:06:43.580> middle<00:06:43.879> to<00:06:43.909> the<00:06:44.059> other<00:06:44.209> corner<00:06:44.479> and<00:06:44.869> you

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 
the middle to the other corner and you

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:46.749 
the middle to the other corner and you
can<00:06:45.319> also<00:06:45.499> slide<00:06:45.830> back<00:06:46.069> and<00:06:46.249> forth<00:06:46.459> and<00:06:46.669> you

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 
can also slide back and forth and you

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:47.949 
can also slide back and forth and you
can<00:06:46.879> also<00:06:47.029> use<00:06:47.240> it<00:06:47.360> for<00:06:47.389> stick<00:06:47.659> handling

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:47.959 
can also use it for stick handling

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:49.779 
can also use it for stick handling
because<00:06:48.229> it's<00:06:48.379> so<00:06:48.499> big<00:06:48.709> and<00:06:48.949> that's<00:06:49.459> the<00:06:49.639> next

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:49.789 
because it's so big and that's the next

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:50.829 
because it's so big and that's the next
thing<00:06:49.879> that<00:06:49.999> I<00:06:50.089> really<00:06:50.300> liked<00:06:50.449> about<00:06:50.509> is<00:06:50.719> the

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:50.839 
thing that I really liked about is the

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:53.589 
thing that I really liked about is the
size<00:06:51.080> it's<00:06:51.769> very<00:06:52.069> big<00:06:52.610> you<00:06:52.789> can<00:06:52.909> use<00:06:53.089> it<00:06:53.419> with<00:06:53.569> a

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 
size it's very big you can use it with a

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:55.119 
size it's very big you can use it with a
couple<00:06:54.019> people<00:06:54.169> if<00:06:54.439> you<00:06:54.529> want<00:06:54.709> so<00:06:54.919> if<00:06:54.979> your

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:55.129 
couple people if you want so if your

couple people if you want so if your
friends<00:06:55.519> over<00:06:55.699> you<00:06:55.789> both<00:06:56.059> practice<00:06:56.479> to<00:06:56.629> camp

00:06:56.859 --> 00:06:56.869 
friends over you both practice to camp

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:59.290 
friends over you both practice to camp
on<00:06:57.050> it<00:06:57.110> practice<00:06:57.649> passing<00:06:57.860> and<00:06:58.309> you<00:06:59.059> can<00:06:59.179> do

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300

some sliding while your stick handling

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.350 
some sliding while your stick handling
so<00:07:01.279> that's<00:07:01.399> a<00:07:01.550> pretty<00:07:01.819> cool<00:07:02.089> overall

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
so that's a pretty cool overall

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.329 
so that's a pretty cool overall
application<00:07:02.779> one<00:07:03.499> thing<00:07:03.740> that<00:07:03.860> I<00:07:03.889> wish<00:07:04.159> they

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:04.339 
application one thing that I wish they

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:06.159 
application one thing that I wish they
had<00:07:04.459> gotten<00:07:04.699> is<00:07:05.089> the<00:07:05.360> stopper<00:07:05.599> it's<00:07:05.869> just<00:07:06.019> make

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:06.169 
had gotten is the stopper it's just make

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:07.269 
had gotten is the stopper it's just make
them<00:07:06.319> a<00:07:06.349> bit<00:07:06.439> more<00:07:06.619> comfortable<00:07:06.830> and<00:07:07.249> that

00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:07.279 
them a bit more comfortable and that

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:09.429 
them a bit more comfortable and that
would<00:07:07.519> really<00:07:08.330> improve<00:07:08.749> the<00:07:08.899> overall<00:07:08.930> quality

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:09.439 
would really improve the overall quality

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:11.499 
would really improve the overall quality
in<00:07:09.680> my<00:07:09.800> mind<00:07:10.069> that's<00:07:10.789> the<00:07:10.939> overall<00:07:11.209> review
