00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.240
 hello everyone is not far away my 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.670
 hands-on training 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.590
 training for which I have prepared very 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.230
 large amount of information received 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.390
 only on my own personal experience got this 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.480
 information you save yourself from mistakes and 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.859
 significantly accelerate and their development 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.589
 today I will tell you about visualization 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.769
 a project on this topic from a to z 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.820
 we will deal with you forever 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.769
 visualization is exactly the transfer 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.509
 thought out to the smallest detail decorative 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.030
 elements using drawing on paper 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.950
 or computer graphics which 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.620
 allows you to visually understand how will 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.100
 look like this or that accessory 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.590
 decorative area 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.390
 or project as a whole unfortunately not all 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.400
 decorators are artists and not everyone can 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.530
 understandable to portray a beautiful picture 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.410
 future activities on a piece of paper 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.110
 I personally find it much easier to use 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.760
 computer so consider the creation 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.010
 visualization using photoshop 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.170
 it is visualization that makes it clear to 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.180
 client exactly how the decorator will 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.290
 look like an event right up to 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.869
 the smallest details 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.700
 and it also makes working on 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.799
 the site itself because now everyone who 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.240
 involved in the creation of the holiday were 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.369
 know exactly what it will be 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.840
 now on the example of non-standard candy 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.799
 bar and i will show you how to create 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.799
 visualization i 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.060
 Seemingly the days of our training, I will teach you 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.580
 create similar visualizations which 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.800
 I am sure it will be very helpful to you 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.030
 creative work with you was Natalia 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.170
 Dmitry, see you at the training 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.170
 great decor
