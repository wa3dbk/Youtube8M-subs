Oh

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.090 

I<00:01:03.269> didn't<00:01:04.269> think<00:01:04.360> our<00:01:04.510> offense<00:01:04.900> executed<00:01:05.500> like

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
I didn't think our offense executed like

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.760 
I didn't think our offense executed like
they're<00:01:06.280> capable<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.880> tonight<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.630> it<00:01:08.590> gives

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
they're capable of tonight and it gives

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.920 
they're capable of tonight and it gives
us<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:08.979> great<00:01:09.130> chance<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.690> maybe<00:01:10.690> add<00:01:10.900> a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
us a great chance to maybe add a

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.960 
us a great chance to maybe add a
different<00:01:11.320> sense<00:01:11.500> of<00:01:11.650> urgency<00:01:11.800> we<00:01:12.670> struggled

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
different sense of urgency we struggled

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.030 
different sense of urgency we struggled
in<00:01:13.330> general<00:01:13.720> offensively<00:01:14.320> I<00:01:14.440> don't<00:01:14.650> think<00:01:14.860> we

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
in general offensively I don't think we

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.560 
in general offensively I don't think we
were<00:01:15.220> in<00:01:15.340> great<00:01:15.640> britain<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:16.090> didn't<00:01:16.300> think<00:01:16.390> we

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
were in great britain I didn't think we

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.110 
were in great britain I didn't think we
were<00:01:16.690> super<00:01:16.900> sharp<00:01:17.350> execution-wise<00:01:18.010> I<00:01:18.490> did

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
were super sharp execution-wise I did

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.520 
were super sharp execution-wise I did
think<00:01:19.360> we<00:01:19.420> capitalize<00:01:20.020> on<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.350> field

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
think we capitalize on the field

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
think we capitalize on the field
position<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.070> was<00:01:21.160> created<00:01:21.369> through

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
position that was created through

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.830 
position that was created through
special<00:01:21.970> teams<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.390> defensive

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
special teams and the defensive

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.980 
special teams and the defensive
turnovers<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.619> bat<00:01:24.070> part<00:01:24.690> in<00:01:25.690> terms<00:01:25.869> of

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
turnovers and a bat part in terms of

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.450 
turnovers and a bat part in terms of
sustaining<00:01:26.470> drives<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.010> meeting<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.310> God

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
sustaining drives and meeting the God

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.450 
sustaining drives and meeting the God
with<00:01:27.700> precision<00:01:28.090> that<00:01:28.990> partner<00:01:29.470> certainly

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
with precision that partner certainly

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.790 
with precision that partner certainly
wasn't<00:01:30.640> evident<00:01:31.090> today<00:01:31.509> I<00:01:31.840> still<00:01:32.350> think<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.619> got

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
wasn't evident today I still think I got

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.359 
wasn't evident today I still think I got
lucky<00:01:32.950> at<00:01:33.190> home<00:01:33.369> I<00:01:34.800> did<00:01:35.800> I<00:01:35.830> did<00:01:35.979> some<00:01:36.250> good

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
lucky at home I did I did some good

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.280 
lucky at home I did I did some good
things<00:01:36.430> today<00:01:36.729> I<00:01:36.850> did<00:01:37.119> some<00:01:37.300> did<00:01:38.259> some

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
things today I did some did some

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.810 
things today I did some did some
not-so-good<00:01:38.920> things<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.310> so<00:01:39.369> I'm<00:01:39.490> still<00:01:39.729> just

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
not-so-good things and so I'm still just

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.150 
not-so-good things and so I'm still just
learning<00:01:40.149> as<00:01:40.210> I<00:01:40.360> go<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:41.590> I<00:01:41.619> think<00:01:41.860> again<00:01:42.100> I

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
learning as I go but I think again I

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.980 
learning as I go but I think again I
think<00:01:42.340> what's<00:01:42.640> exciting<00:01:42.789> is<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.479> still<00:01:43.869> haven't

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
think what's exciting is I still haven't

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.870 
think what's exciting is I still haven't
played<00:01:44.170> my<00:01:44.289> best<00:01:44.320> game<00:01:44.710> and<00:01:44.920> or<00:01:45.430> what<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:45.729> know

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
played my best game and or what I know

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.850 
played my best game and or what I know
I'm<00:01:46.060> capable<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.660> and<00:01:46.899> I<00:01:47.140> think<00:01:47.200> our<00:01:47.530> office

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
I'm capable of and I think our office

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.520 
I'm capable of and I think our office
hasn't<00:01:48.810> put<00:01:49.810> out<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:50.050> display<00:01:50.320> that<00:01:50.440> were

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
hasn't put out the display that were

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.469 
hasn't put out the display that were
capable<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:50.979> what<00:01:51.190> I<00:01:51.490> would<00:01:51.729> say<00:01:51.910> is<00:01:52.030> a<00:01:52.060> lot<00:01:52.360> of

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
capable of what I would say is a lot of

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.050 
capable of what I would say is a lot of
Harvey's<00:01:52.780> yards<00:01:53.200> weren't<00:01:53.890> his<00:01:54.550> runs<00:01:54.789> weren't

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
Harvey's yards weren't his runs weren't

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.800 
Harvey's yards weren't his runs weren't
blocked<00:01:55.240> necessarily<00:01:55.990> well<00:01:56.170> he<00:01:56.470> just<00:01:56.500> simply

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
blocked necessarily well he just simply

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.630 
blocked necessarily well he just simply
had<00:01:58.810> great<00:01:59.080> vision<00:01:59.320> and<00:01:59.740> wouldn't<00:02:00.520> go<00:02:00.610> down

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
had great vision and wouldn't go down

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.359 
had great vision and wouldn't go down
and<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:01.660> I<00:02:01.690> wasn't<00:02:02.229> crediting<00:02:02.619> necessarily

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
and so I wasn't crediting necessarily

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.639 
and so I wasn't crediting necessarily
the<00:02:03.580> holes<00:02:03.789> that<00:02:04.060> we<00:02:04.180> opened<00:02:04.660> and<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.470> wasn't

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
the holes that we opened and I wasn't

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.430 
the holes that we opened and I wasn't
crediting<00:02:06.070> necessarily<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.729> execution<00:02:07.300> of

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
crediting necessarily the execution of

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.550 
crediting necessarily the execution of
the<00:02:08.440> run<00:02:08.619> game<00:02:08.830> but<00:02:09.220> him<00:02:09.459> specifically<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:11.380> was

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
the run game but him specifically it was

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.160 
the run game but him specifically it was
