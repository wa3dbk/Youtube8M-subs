00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.230
 good 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.880
 hello friends welcome to the garage 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.300
 It gives a lot of taste as always 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.750
 say hello today we have a garage 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:42.040
 rainy but very fun and novel 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.710
 let's talk about the new cherokee jeep 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.989
 2014 and we will also talk about this 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.860
 preciousness in the chevrolet corvette 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.720
 stingray also 2014 but let's start with 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.390
 the cherokee jeep 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.850
 you are going to remember a time where 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.300
 mexico was for sale the grand 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.400
 cherokee and the cherokee sports that was 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.740
 thing of ten years maybe 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.790
 the cherokee sport was one of the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.820
 trucks with best sale in the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.180
 history of jeep and it was a truck so 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.150
 successful that later jeep wanted to repeat that 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.740
 success with a truck much larger than 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:32.820
 it was the commander but it did not work for the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.950
 proportion then what was supposed 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.340
 that was the evolution of the Cherokee 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.540
 sport appeared freedom and freedom 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.320
 and it worked well for the first generation 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.290
 but not so in the others why in the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.540
 change of jeep generation decides 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.760
 again call this truck 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.330
 cherokee as it was always called the 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.640
 liberty in europe was never the liberty 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.890
 in europe he always called cherokee and so 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.430
 it's called a new 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.580
 but it has absolutely nothing to do 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.319
 with freedom except that it occupies that 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.510
 place that had the freedom in jeep 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:16.620
 for some time then there is 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.810
 is let's say the compact sv in turn 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.470
 of the jeep brand that under the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.520
 iron what there was not 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.700
 the base is the alfa romeo platform 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.270
 giulietta that is also the platform 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.810
 of the dodge dart but has news 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.850
 obviously the news is that the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.400
 platform will be this but it is a 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.060
 truck is not a car but having 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.590
 that platform helps a lot in the management 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.390
 of the van of that we're going to talk in 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.870
 a little bit more let's start with the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.930
 aesthetics a lot of people do not like the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.390
 new Cherokee and I can understand that 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.570
 also at the first moment that I saw her 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.270
 I found it too daring design 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.150
 shocking even ugly and I know that a lot 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.270
 people find that ugly more than anything 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.530
 owing to the very thin headlights is due to 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:15.290
 this grill with a fold that is little 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.320
 usual that the front of the 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.820
 grill has a fold or is here or 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.010
 is here is almost always in the 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:26.330
 vertical and up is the chest is 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.630
 occupies the two areas let's say the front and 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.170
 the top of the chest 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.480
 and that gives it a very different air 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.450
 today today I see her now and I love her 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:42.160
 I really like the truck, it seems to me 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.830
 an exclusive unique daring design that 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.450
 those little headlights seems to me in the 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:52.240
 look as well as look at me like that 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.960
 so you're watching I love you 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.700
 challenge that that sends me that 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.080
 I think the truck looks great 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.150
 I repeat and I understand who does not like the 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.500
 sides are very clean and this version 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.720
 is the basic version is the version 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.360
 called the attitude that is the input 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.370
 to the Cherokee in our country here 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.290
 we have the logo the attitude there will be 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.140
 four versions in mexico latitude 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.140
 limited premium limit and three mouths 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.510
 the first three bring the same engine 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.760
 I also talk about that in a little while more the 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.940
 the backside I also like and 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.010
 it is also different if they are posted here 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.330
 this central part very clean many 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.479
 use the plate here 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.490
 jlp decided to put it down also the 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.389
 skulls are very thin and has a 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.310
 very exclusive design this little eyelash that 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.400
 it comes out that it's the tear coming out here from 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.660
 the skulls give a pretty touch 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.600
 interesting inside we see a 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.290
 to see where a good space of the 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.780
 trunk that I need at least 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.120
 in this version I'm sure that it 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.310
 You can buy as optional and it will come 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.170
 in the higher versions a cover 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.770
 to hide what is in the air of 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.340
 load 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.800
 here we have a spare tire of 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.810
 full size what is very good 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.280
 decreases the size of the trunk 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.140
 volume of the trunk especially if it 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:24.450
 you consider as such that it is up to here 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:26.550
 but it's a reasonable volume of one is 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.680
 of the largest is not the most 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.960
 girls what is very high to climb 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.150
 an object here is going to cost you something 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.980
 I work these handles from here to pull 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:41.070
 they are quite good in the back 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.990
 let's find a good space and well 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.940
 in the seat is set for me 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.580
 I have a good leg space 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.530
 it is very good headspace that is going to 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.210
 decrease especially in the frontal area 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.030
 in the versions with sunroof 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:00.319
 in the central part I still have a 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:02.270
 good space I do not meddle too much 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:05.960
 I do not get too involved in the area of 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.699
 two passengers say is a truck in 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.390
 which five people will be able to travel 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:14.160
 with relative ease 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.920
 There is air outlet outlet 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.010
 conditioning side handles 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.890
 lights for the environment the finished 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.810
 they are good the fabric not so much of this 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.750
 front part is fine but this part 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.470
 I do not like the design with the 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.770
 apparent seams are fine but 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:39.090
 I repeat that I am not convinced by the fact 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:41.880
 of the quality of the fabric obviously 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:46.120
 can fold the seats and here we have 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:49.810
 a flat floor from 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.850
 the trunk now the interior where 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.199
 it really matters where a 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.030
 person as long as he is 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:59.110
 driving the truck if you can not 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:01.960
 I like it and I like it very much 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:05.800
 only the design seems good to me if 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.510
 remember the dodge dart a bit but what 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.729
 remember is not the same is not a 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.020
 invitation is not a is the same as the 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.600
 give but higher 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.520
 this is a different truck 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:20.879
 You have the key here 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.440
 the key is the traditional chrysler 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:26.170
 the goal here in a slot for 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.009
 to learn the truck then here 

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:32.419
 you have a 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:34.520
 a good level of finished and I'm going to 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:37.580
 talk a little more about those finished 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:41.199
 from its management right now we come back 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:44.809
 of a commercial cut we go to him and 

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:47.379
 let's come back we're coming back here very soon 

00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:47.379
 The garage
