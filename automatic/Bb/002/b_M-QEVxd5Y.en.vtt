00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello you love in my today 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.210
 video is about the initial equipment 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.470
 if a cat is to move in 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.389
 this video is about the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.759
 most important things you guys 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.719
 should purchase before a cat 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.030
 to move in 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.460
 there are also as for dogs on the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.490
 POS market very much accessories and things 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.500
 which are totally unnecessary and out of this 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.869
 I just see the video around you 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.510
 simply the most important and necessary 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.279
 show things so much fun 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.279
 one of the most important things of course 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.370
 As with networks I recommend as well 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.489
 with cats on ceramic nets or these 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.710
 aluminum resorting pet bowls has 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.469
 as I said just the advantage that they 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.570
 very really very long hold like 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.390
 mouth video already mentioned slip this 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.070
 plastic cups very ugly 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.500
 or if you form the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.110
 more often such bubbles 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.329
 that's why you just got better 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.699
 turn if next to ceramic or aluminum 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.609
 Buy apples because I recommend you 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.650
 also to buy several nets because lukas 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.930
 time for several meals that you 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.060
 but at least clean apparatus on 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.729
 something else, of course, very important 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.710
 is at least a litter box 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.049
 there are also differences between 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.009
 open litter box and closed 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.590
 carsten klude 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.650
 he could ask your breeding in advance 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.840
 or animal home which types katzenklo 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.400
 this cat has been used before and 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.680
 You can then just as I said 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.540
 take over with it the cat too 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.729
 Of course you too fast 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.340
 housebroken will be something else 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.049
 The important thing is for the litter box 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.810
 a small shovel with her that 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.390
 cat litter out of shovels yes 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.060
 cat litter used anyway as well 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.700
 as I said the cat litter what the cat 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.159
 already knows as of the same brand and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.720
 just changed that should over 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.930
 So not really staying with you 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.070
 a kind of cat litter, what else 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.650
 makes sense 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.229
 such a document to the litter box there is 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.420
 The coffers are very happy that cats 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.690
 a bouquet and there it is easy 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.039
 easier if the cat litter of these 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.990
 The mat will come easy 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.660
 pick up and pour out 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.030
 a simpler thing to do with the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.190
 Vacuum cleaner twice a day there must 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.610
 then you also need for the litter box 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.410
 So I recommend you your own 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.740
 Bins will be the old lumpy 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.050
 can do pure cat litter that's 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.030
 still pretty important for what, of course 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.459
 also one of the most important things is 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.730
 is a box cat tree respectively 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.640
 such a stark landscape but go in 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.130
 The room should be clean where you are 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.440
 simply most often stops at 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.330
 converted into cats scratch from the customer 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.100
 imagine where you maybe just 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.690
 at least one hour a day striking 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.330
 the cat will not use this 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.280
 that is why it is always recommended 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.530
 Cats scratching in the living room too 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.720
 or if you are very common 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.970
 stayed in the kitchen is to him in the 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.220
 so always place your kitchen as possible 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.290
 put on where most lewis 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.030
 is in turn shape space somewhere 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.160
 offside is the cashier this 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.680
 of course not allowed and will 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.140
 then yes to the furniture to create 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.000
 which is also often used by cats 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.340
 now is no need to purchase 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.400
 but is a heater rug the 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.049
 really cost me so much so must 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.370
 I just put the cat next to it 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.260
 heating can lay 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.780
 that will be like I said very much 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.209
 then you also need for that 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.400
 katz if you drive to the vet with her 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.829
 Or she picks up one, of course 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.630
 you will find transportboxes in every one 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.120
 or maybe it could be online 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.310
 order it looks after that 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.769
 possibility is big enough that his 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.450
 cat has just enough space 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.740
 then what I think, too 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.050
 absolutely listened to 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.840
 is a brush for cats so cats 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.060
 just love to be the brush 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.250
 Clear that it is not necessarily that now 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.560
 Biggest cats have to be when they go to 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.440
 for example, a short fur but have the 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.990
 just relax so beautiful here, and 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.670
 I find that to be my feeling 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.100
 opinion after that should necessarily with 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.920
 purely if you have a flat-cat 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.230
 it is also very advisable son cats 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.000
 Buy now for your balcony 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.100
 the cat also simply on the balcony 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.549
 then I could be quite what I am 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.690
 Great is especially for 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.550
 home cats to the example cats 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.350
 grass because the cat has in the apartment 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.360
 just not the opportunity to go out 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.670
 and there to eat the grass 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.550
 that's why you own this yourself 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.740
 The cat gets the cat that cat 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.180
 always has one available too 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.010
 The most important things are natural 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.500
 toys for the cat there are these 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:45.120
 small game mice or very many 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.310
 other toys to errors or something like that 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.840
 fishing as you have to look as well 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.670
 cats are very toy 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.580
 picky at the beginning not too much 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.440
 buy and just look there too 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.690
 for a kind of toy your cat 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.720
 you can play things most of the time 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.430
 also easily tinker is to 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.750
 you can also find plenty in the net 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.600
 maybe I'll do a video 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.850
 where i just show you where you are 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.600
 make a very simple cat toy 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.830
 what is so funny can be so 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.690
 playballs but they really have to be big 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.850
 enough that the cat does not 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.400
 which can swallow as well 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.040
 did that even with many cats 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.640
 the 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.140
 spieltrieb and I find includes the 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.020
 smoked place looks for the cat 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.550
 in the space itself is so often 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.170
 She likes to sleep in bed or with her 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.110
 just sleep on her cats 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.790
 Scratching tree are gladly taken eg also 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.300
 still so cartons if you just like that 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.190
 empty cartons are in there to climb the 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.650
 Cats like to clean them 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.440
 may such a pillow or such a beautiful 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.390
 cuddly blanket rows sets that will 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.580
 also gladly accepted by 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.080
 cats so that was the most important thing 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.850
 one for the first purchase of one 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.410
 cat I need I hope was the

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.390
 thoughts are playing a cat
