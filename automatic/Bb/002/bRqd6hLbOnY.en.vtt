about an inch of compost and that's
going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> act<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.950> base<00:00:35.160> layer<00:00:35.309> where<00:00:35.820> all

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
going to act as a base layer where all

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.139 
going to act as a base layer where all
the<00:00:36.120> nutrients<00:00:36.660> are<00:00:36.809> then<00:00:37.579> secondly<00:00:38.579> every

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the nutrients are then secondly every

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.889 
the nutrients are then secondly every
inch<00:00:39.620> we're<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.829> plant<00:00:41.070> three<00:00:41.460> seeds

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
inch we're going to plant three seeds

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.619 
inch we're going to plant three seeds
along<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:44.100> cover<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> couple

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
along it and then cover it with a couple

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.170 
along it and then cover it with a couple
of<00:00:45.780> inches<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.590> normal<00:00:46.829> soil<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.520> let's

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
of inches of just normal soil so let's

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.430 
of inches of just normal soil so let's
start<00:00:48.510> by<00:00:48.750> filling<00:00:49.079> up<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.950> rain<00:00:50.340> gutter<00:00:51.440> so

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
start by filling up this rain gutter so

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.189 
start by filling up this rain gutter so
here<00:00:52.680> I'm<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:52.890> feeding<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:54.660> rain<00:00:54.960> gutter

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
here I'm just feeding up the rain gutter

here I'm just feeding up the rain gutter
with<00:00:55.469> some<00:00:55.649> homemade<00:00:56.010> compost<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.789> what<00:00:57.629> we

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
with some homemade compost and what we

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.959 
with some homemade compost and what we
will<00:00:58.170> be<00:00:58.289> doing<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.680> using<00:00:59.039> two<00:00:59.430> rain<00:00:59.640> gutters

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
will be doing is using two rain gutters

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.279 
will be doing is using two rain gutters
because<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.300> do<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.600> quite<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> lot<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.050> piece

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
because we do like quite a lot of piece

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
to scijoy so it's really easy I'm just

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.520 
to scijoy so it's really easy I'm just
continuing<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.729> fill<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.689> up<00:01:15.780> with<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.049> compost

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
continuing to fill it up with a compost

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.710 
continuing to fill it up with a compost
about<00:01:16.860> 1/8<00:01:17.280> inch<00:01:17.549> deep<00:01:19.729> okay<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.210> peas<00:01:21.420> I'm

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
about 1/8 inch deep okay so the peas I'm

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.380 
about 1/8 inch deep okay so the peas I'm
using<00:01:21.930> here<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.500> meteor<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> they're<00:01:24.150> only

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
using here a meteor and they're only

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.510 
using here a meteor and they're only
dwarf<00:01:24.869> piece<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.310> get

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
dwarf piece because you can get

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.020 
dwarf piece because you can get
different<00:01:27.530> height<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.610> normal

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
different height so the normal

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.690 
different height so the normal
traditional<00:01:30.420> piece<00:01:30.990> grows<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.799> about<00:01:31.890> 6<00:01:32.520> feet

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
traditional piece grows to about 6 feet

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.060 
traditional piece grows to about 6 feet
tall<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.150> these<00:01:33.720> drauf<00:01:34.020> peas<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.560> good<00:01:34.920> for

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
tall but these drauf peas are good for

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.010 
tall but these drauf peas are good for
small<00:01:35.310> space<00:01:35.579> gardens<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.270> then<00:01:36.390> go<00:01:36.540> about<00:01:36.659> 2

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
small space gardens and then go about 2

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.560 
small space gardens and then go about 2
feet<00:01:37.200> tall<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.150> I'm<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.390> do

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
feet tall so just what I'm going to do

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.830 
feet tall so just what I'm going to do
is<00:01:40.140> place<00:01:40.890> three<00:01:41.759> seeds<00:01:42.470> in<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.530> row<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:45.720> then

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
is place three seeds in a row and then

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.179 
is place three seeds in a row and then
leave<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.500> an<00:01:46.649> inch<00:01:48.020> maybe<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.680> over<00:01:49.920> an

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
leave like an inch maybe just over an

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.270 
leave like an inch maybe just over an
inch<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:51.450> plant<00:01:51.720> another<00:01:52.140> three<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.130> then

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
inch and plant another three and then

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.420 
inch and plant another three and then
just<00:01:53.430> continue<00:01:54.350> doing<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.710> may<00:01:56.189> take<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
just continue doing that may take a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.920 
just continue doing that may take a
couple<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:57.119> minutes<00:01:57.649> but<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
couple of minutes but just do it for the

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.359 
couple of minutes but just do it for the
desired<00:02:00.930> length<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.680> rain<00:02:01.829> gutter<00:02:02.100> you

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
desired length of the rain gutter you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.170 
desired length of the rain gutter you
would<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:03.770> now<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.829> must<00:02:05.100> be<00:02:05.250> wondering<00:02:05.280> why

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
would like now you must be wondering why

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.730 
would like now you must be wondering why
should<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.810> put<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.530> rain

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
should you just put it in the rain

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.499 
should you just put it in the rain
gutter<00:02:08.009> why<00:02:08.489> can't<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:08.879> put<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.300> into

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
gutter why can't you just put it into

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.809 
gutter why can't you just put it into
the<00:02:09.599> ground<00:02:09.780> well<00:02:10.229> theoretically<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.610> can

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
the ground well theoretically you can

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.430 
the ground well theoretically you can
put<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.150> straight<00:02:12.270> into<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> ground<00:02:12.989> but<00:02:13.379> a

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
put it straight into the ground but a

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.790 
put it straight into the ground but a
good

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
good

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.520 
good
think<00:02:13.950> about<00:02:14.190> using<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.300> rain<00:02:15.510> gutter<00:02:15.690> first<00:02:16.170> is

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
think about using a rain gutter first is

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.700 
think about using a rain gutter first is
that<00:02:16.710> actually<00:02:17.250> two<00:02:17.430> good<00:02:17.640> ways<00:02:18.200> first<00:02:19.200> way<00:02:19.470> is

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
that actually two good ways first way is

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.940 
that actually two good ways first way is
that<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.370> stops<00:02:20.760> mice<00:02:21.420> from<00:02:21.990> eating<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.650> seeds

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
that it stops mice from eating the seeds

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.130 
that it stops mice from eating the seeds
and<00:02:23.550> we've<00:02:23.760> had<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.910> big<00:02:24.150> problem<00:02:24.480> with<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.840> my

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
and we've had a big problem with like my

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.170 
and we've had a big problem with like my
season<00:02:25.530> board<00:02:25.830> bean<00:02:26.070> seeds<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.670> pea<00:02:26.850> seeds

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
season board bean seeds and pea seeds

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.090 
season board bean seeds and pea seeds
and<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.960> can<00:02:28.110> actually<00:02:28.230> see<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.680> tunnels

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
and you can actually see the tunnels

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.440 
and you can actually see the tunnels
underneath<00:02:29.430> where<00:02:29.730> they've<00:02:29.880> just<00:02:30.030> gone<00:02:30.210> along

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
underneath where they've just gone along

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.230 
underneath where they've just gone along
eating<00:02:30.960> all<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.410> seeds<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.090> good

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
eating all of the seeds so it's a good

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.040 
eating all of the seeds so it's a good
way<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.450> stop<00:02:33.900> mice<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.440> also<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.130> other<00:02:35.370> way

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
way to stop mice and also the other way

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.320 
way to stop mice and also the other way
is<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.380> it's<00:02:37.980> really<00:02:38.280> easy<00:02:38.310> when<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.030> dig<00:02:39.300> a

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
is that it's really easy when you dig a

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.420 
is that it's really easy when you dig a
little<00:02:39.450> trench<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.320> can<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:40.680> slide<00:02:41.010> all<00:02:41.370> of

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
little trench you can just slide all of

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.690 
little trench you can just slide all of
the<00:02:41.760> plants<00:02:42.210> off<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.560> just<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.670> easy

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
the plants off and it's just so easy

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.370 
the plants off and it's just so easy
I'll<00:02:45.060> show<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.810> another<00:02:45.990> video

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
I'll show you that in another video

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.250 
I'll show you that in another video
where<00:02:46.710> I'll<00:02:46.800> be<00:02:46.920> planting<00:02:47.400> these<00:02:47.550> out<00:02:47.760> and

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
where I'll be planting these out and

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.080 
where I'll be planting these out and
you'll<00:02:49.260> see<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:49.680> yourself<00:02:50.010> how<00:02:50.190> simple<00:02:51.000> the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
you'll see for yourself how simple the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.210 
you'll see for yourself how simple the
methods<00:02:51.480> are<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.950> finally<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.580> get<00:02:54.030> some

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
methods are and so finally just get some

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.730 
methods are and so finally just get some
general<00:02:56.220> soil<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:58.010> fill<00:02:59.010> over<00:02:59.450> the<00:03:00.450> seeds<00:03:00.750> up

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
general soil and fill over the seeds up

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.910 
general soil and fill over the seeds up
to<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.160> top<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:06.450> then<00:03:06.630> after<00:03:07.140> you've<00:03:07.290> done

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
to the top and then after you've done

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.490 
to the top and then after you've done
all<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:09.180> don't<00:03:09.420> want<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.870> place<00:03:10.260> it

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
all this you don't want to place it

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.760 
all this you don't want to place it
somewhere<00:03:10.890> high<00:03:11.310> where<00:03:11.850> any<00:03:12.750> my<00:03:13.020> Scott<00:03:13.410> reach

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
somewhere high where any my Scott reach

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.240 
somewhere high where any my Scott reach
it<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:15.180> know<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.660> few<00:03:16.470> days<00:03:16.620> about<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:16.980> week

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
it and you know a few days about a week

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.030 
it and you know a few days about a week
or<00:03:17.460> so<00:03:17.870> start<00:03:18.870> seeing<00:03:19.140> some<00:03:19.380> spots<00:03:19.680> appear

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
or so start seeing some spots appear

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.780 
or so start seeing some spots appear
usually<00:03:20.280> run<00:03:20.550> two<00:03:20.820> weeks<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.440> then<00:03:22.580> wait<00:03:23.580> for

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
usually run two weeks and then wait for

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.180 
usually run two weeks and then wait for
them<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.090> go<00:03:24.209> about<00:03:24.390> an<00:03:24.570> inch<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:25.290> two<00:03:25.680> inches

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
them to go about an inch to two inches

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.160 
them to go about an inch to two inches
tall<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.670> then<00:03:26.820> I'll<00:03:27.090> be<00:03:27.360> showing<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.900> in
