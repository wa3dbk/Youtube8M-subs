they'll be sure and I update with you
called<00:00:05.370> mobile<00:00:05.940> substrate<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.899> if<00:00:07.620> you

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
called mobile substrate and if you

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.250 
called mobile substrate and if you
haven't<00:00:08.040> been<00:00:08.460> using<00:00:08.820> mobile<00:00:09.360> substrate<00:00:09.599> I

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
haven't been using mobile substrate I

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.660 
haven't been using mobile substrate I
can<00:00:10.469> tell<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.740> at<00:00:10.889> night<00:00:11.099> it's<00:00:11.250> something

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
can tell you at night it's something

can tell you at night it's something
that<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:11.940> need<00:00:12.559> installed<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:14.809> probably

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
that you need installed and probably

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.769 
that you need installed and probably
when<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.550> downloaded<00:00:17.550> winterboard<00:00:18.330> if<00:00:18.630> you

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
when you downloaded winterboard if you

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.310 
when you downloaded winterboard if you
have<00:00:19.020> winterboard<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.890> think<00:00:20.220> it's<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.699> cold

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
have winterboard I think it's a cold

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
existing download with it as well and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
existing download with it as well and
what<00:00:25.019> mobile<00:00:25.650> substrate<00:00:25.920> does<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.900> sort<00:00:28.260> of

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
what mobile substrate does is it sort of

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.040 
what mobile substrate does is it sort of
like<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> safe<00:00:29.250> mode<00:00:29.640> if<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.119> will<00:00:30.330> if<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.689> have

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
like a safe mode if you will if you have

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.170 
like a safe mode if you will if you have
a<00:00:32.660> tweak<00:00:33.660> that's<00:00:34.050> causing<00:00:34.530> some<00:00:34.739> problems

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
a tweak that's causing some problems

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.630 
a tweak that's causing some problems
mobile<00:00:36.180> substrate<00:00:36.420> will<00:00:36.989> put<00:00:37.260> your

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
mobile substrate will put your

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.930 
mobile substrate will put your
springboard<00:00:38.640> into<00:00:38.969> what's<00:00:39.719> called<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.170> sigh<00:00:40.410> of

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
springboard into what's called a sigh of

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.880 
springboard into what's called a sigh of
sort<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> recovery<00:00:42.989> not<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.260> recovery

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
sort of like a recovery not a recovery

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.830 
sort of like a recovery not a recovery
but<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> safe<00:00:44.520> mode<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.059> really<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> only<00:00:45.480> way<00:00:45.809> I

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
but a safe mode is really the only way I

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.900 
but a safe mode is really the only way I
know<00:00:46.079> how<00:00:46.110> explaining<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.190> know<00:00:47.579> you've

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
know how explaining I know you've

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.930 
know how explaining I know you've
probably<00:00:47.940> seen<00:00:48.570> your<00:00:48.750> springboard<00:00:49.350> say<00:00:49.940> such

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
probably seen your springboard say such

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.819 
probably seen your springboard say such
and<00:00:51.120> such<00:00:51.300> cause<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.930> springboard<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.500> crash

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
and such cause the springboard to crash

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.260 
and such cause the springboard to crash
it's<00:00:53.219> now<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.820> safe<00:00:54.180> mode<00:00:54.210> hit<00:00:54.840> restart<00:00:55.410> to

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
it's now in safe mode hit restart to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.389 
it's now in safe mode hit restart to
reboot<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.480> device<00:00:57.680> well<00:00:58.680> that's<00:00:58.949> mobile

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
reboot the device well that's mobile

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.700 
reboot the device well that's mobile
substrate<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.989> something<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
substrate and that is something that you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.350 
substrate and that is something that you
can<00:01:01.920> use<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.640> order<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:05.090> troubleshoot<00:01:06.090> any

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
can use in order to troubleshoot any

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.679 
can use in order to troubleshoot any
type<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.340> tweak<00:01:08.340> or<00:01:08.700> something<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.360> just

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
type of tweak or something if you just

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.679 
type of tweak or something if you just
download<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.260> week<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.890> causes<00:01:11.159> your

download at week and it causes your

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.160 
download at week and it causes your
device<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.720> go<00:01:13.110> into<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.530> loop<00:01:13.979> or<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:15.170> crash

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
every time you try to reboot then you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.609 
every time you try to reboot then you
can<00:01:18.570> your<00:01:19.259> device<00:01:19.680> should<00:01:20.369> go<00:01:20.640> into<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.720> safe

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
can your device should go into to safe

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.370 
can your device should go into to safe
mode<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.950> mobile<00:01:23.520> substrate<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.320> allow<00:01:25.320> you

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
your device into like that safe mode

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.170 
your device into like that safe mode
when<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.439> booting<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.729> after<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
when it's booting up right after you

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.030 
when it's booting up right after you
turn<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.439> hold<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> power<00:01:47.009> button

automatically put your device into that
mobile<00:01:56.790> substrate<00:01:57.290> safe<00:01:58.290> mode<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.640> let<00:02:00.240> me<00:02:00.270> try

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
mobile substrate safe mode so let me try

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.649 
mobile substrate safe mode so let me try
to<00:02:00.780> show<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.170> what<00:02:01.560> I'm<00:02:01.710> talking<00:02:01.740> about<00:02:02.189> here

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
to show you what I'm talking about here

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.110 
to show you what I'm talking about here
we'll<00:02:03.659> go<00:02:03.810> ahead<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.200> turn<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.740> device<00:02:04.860> off

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.510 

once<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.810> starts<00:02:08.080> coming<00:02:08.410> back<00:02:08.590> on<00:02:08.830> then<00:02:09.490> i

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
once it starts coming back on then i

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.640 
once it starts coming back on then i
will<00:02:09.970> show<00:02:10.240> you<00:02:10.300> what<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.900> I'm<00:02:11.200> talking
