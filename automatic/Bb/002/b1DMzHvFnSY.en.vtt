00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
cool when it is actually functioning you

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.069 
cool when it is actually functioning you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
see the pillars are gray and then of

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.280 
see the pillars are gray and then of
course<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.240> outsole<00:01:51.570> itself<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
course the outsole itself is a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.230 
course the outsole itself is a
translucent<00:01:52.740> volt<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.790> nearly<00:01:54.090> as

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
translucent volt it's not nearly as

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.209 
translucent volt it's not nearly as
bright<00:01:54.659> as<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.079> solid<00:01:55.470> Volt<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> shoe

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
bright as the solid Volt on the shoe

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.340 
bright as the solid Volt on the shoe
itself<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.030> honestly<00:01:57.329> wouldn't<00:01:57.719> honestly

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
itself and I honestly wouldn't honestly

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.080 
itself and I honestly wouldn't honestly
think<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.649> solid<00:01:59.159> volt<00:01:59.460> outsole<00:01:59.880> would

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
think that a solid volt outsole would

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.179 
think that a solid volt outsole would
look<00:02:00.270> better<00:02:00.479> than<00:02:00.689> translucent<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:02.070> want

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
look better than translucent I just want

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.289 
look better than translucent I just want
to<00:02:02.280> match<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.640> shoe<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> little<00:02:02.969> bit<00:02:03.180> better

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
to match the shoe a little bit better

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.030 
to match the shoe a little bit better
it's<00:02:03.509> kind<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.869> an<00:02:03.990> off<00:02:04.200> coloring<00:02:04.799> if<00:02:04.950> you

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
it's kind of like an off coloring if you

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.859 
it's kind of like an off coloring if you
ask<00:02:05.219> me<00:02:05.430> going<00:02:06.000> from<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.299> upper<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
ask me going from the upper to the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.399 
ask me going from the upper to the
outsole

nine<00:03:59.450> and<00:03:59.630> a<00:03:59.660> half<00:03:59.690> they<00:04:00.380> do<00:04:00.440> have<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.680> slightly

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
nine and a half they do have a slightly

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.710 
nine and a half they do have a slightly
more<00:04:01.160> snug<00:04:01.580> fit<00:04:01.850> especially<00:04:02.000> in<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.510> length

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
more snug fit especially in the length

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.420 
more snug fit especially in the length
so<00:04:03.200> if<00:04:03.290> you<00:04:03.350> like<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.680> snug<00:04:03.920> feel<00:04:04.160> then<00:04:04.370> I

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
so if you like that snug feel then I

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.220 
so if you like that snug feel then I
would<00:04:04.550> recommend<00:04:04.940> staying<00:04:05.180> true<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:05.420> size<00:04:05.660> but

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
would recommend staying true to size but

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.510 
would recommend staying true to size but
if<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:06.410> want<00:04:06.590> something<00:04:06.830> with<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.160> little<00:04:07.400> bit

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
if you want something with a little bit

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.130 
if you want something with a little bit
more<00:04:07.670> room<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.420> I<00:04:08.480> would<00:04:08.630> definitely<00:04:08.780> go<00:04:09.110> a

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
more room and I would definitely go a

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.290
