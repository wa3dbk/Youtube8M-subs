00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.219
 hello how about friends and subscribers of 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.290
 youtube lasted well in this new 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.019
 good video course will study a 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.300
 issue that is for exit schering good 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.220
 let's go first to what would be 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.050
 serving Syria but before this I'm going to 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.990
 show on what the subject itself is let's 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.550
 to open the multiplier center to see 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.560
 with what is going to be added now what 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.600
 it says links as you can see know of 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.059
 this way the truth looks very good 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.100
 I found out - fourteen years I have the 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.530
 subject of sbsettings that exists that is 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.000
 down here here I have this theme of 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.399
 sms links that I already made a video 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.480
 previous in case they want to go to check 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.129
 good and here as you can see the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.829
 center notifier let's find what 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.979
 that had been in itself but he 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.170
 help the theme of ios 7 well we are going to 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.999
 go to what I always like to leave 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.659
 load syria we will load if 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:56.120
 we came back 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.170
 once left loaded and instead we 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.319
 some updates will appear 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.629
 self I like a good one to have this 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:04.159
 subject itself would basically be first 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.229
 they would have to be what is in itself 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.930
 schering way search and they will write 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.760
 itself schering here is free of the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.530
 network puts in maya and good mode 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.780
 finally after having installed in 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.250
 yes schering is going to add a 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.110
 configuration of letter settings let's 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.150
 see and to see how we activate that theme 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.660
 It could be if you are going to write this add 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.490
 ons 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.710
 it's a winterboard theme that's going to 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.350
 add also schering good itself 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.450
 we are here I got to manage good 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.390
 handle and packages to see my packages 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.070
 good not being here they are going to download 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.410
 it seems to modify me because I already 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.810
 I have art we can get out of what 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.790
 would be Syrian let's see some 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.979
 changes that are not added in winterboard 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.020
 let's open winterboard well do not you see 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.060
 being here what is winter we are going to 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.790
 see this some changes that we have 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.250
 added to this album good as can 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.530
 I already have it activated without the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.970
 active no no no difference what 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.130
 if they have it activated, let's open 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.660
 center notifier is going to see what's going 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.970
 to do is that they will see a little more 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.410
 small in the circles are called if 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.390
 activate the theme is going to see this 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.370
 way if you do not have it activated is going to 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.130
 see another and well I'll show you the 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.860
 example when I do not have it activated I'm going 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.690
 to leave and I'll give a break apart 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.739
 will erase what I have on screen 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.770
 I'm going to take a break and 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.300
 we came back 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.060
 once the esprimo already linked 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.860
 this well let's see what's working 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.260
 added already in what is the notified 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.270
 absent and good now we 're going to see 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.830
 well now deactivated talk about this 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.960
 way the truth has not seen much 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.140
 difference I think it's a little bit 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.210
 smaller the icons the sections is 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.400
 a little smaller I think but good 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.740
 another thing that's good now let's 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.390
 bring what would be adjustments to see how 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.100
 activate this topic because this is not them 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.140
 is activated by default or they are 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.020
 another thing that has been activated is another 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.180
 is of itself schering and let's go to what 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.840
 that we are in adjustments we are going to look for 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.180
 what to configure itself schering here 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.940
 is schering itself good once you do not 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.380
 you have and schering gives us these buttons 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.960
 well I already made a previous video 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.240
 you can go check it out on the channel like 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.680
 use itself schering good here is going to say 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.230
 theme in appearance 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.450
 let's go to him and I have a side that 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.850
 install apart to give it a different 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.350
 customization to colors good to 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.810
 be in this add ons is going to be added 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.070
 these two options well I will activate 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.190
 this is the one that I have now active 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.140
 then activate the one below 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.090
 well now how can you see this is the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.310
 great difference in the subject of 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.380
 winterboard is not going to deny anything good 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.360
 open notification center and now it's going 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.490
 see very very small I think the 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.440
 screen is on screen is not going to 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.090
 see how I'm seeing it right now but 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.520
 they look a little more small what are the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.800
 Icons looks great too but good 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.870
 friends this this would be basically what 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.330
 which is the subject of itself schering good 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.380
 friends this would be all basically 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.960
