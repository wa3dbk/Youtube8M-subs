00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.100
 the conclusion 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.010
 canon ixus 140 ties in with some 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.529
 score points to the predecessor models and 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.700
 partially achieved a solid and 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.040
 convincing performance 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.110
 the processing quality field accustomed 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.360
 high and thus moves on one 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.270
 for beginners cameras very good level 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.250
 the buttons are relatively large and let 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.600
 Therefore, despite their plan installations in the 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.730
 Serve housing well 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.500
 The service can be general with one 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.940
 convince good clarity 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.579
 Even beginners should be fast 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.140
 find their way 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.929
 less convincing are those 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.609
 picture quality in the photo and video mode of the 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.859
 change from a c mos sensor to the 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.620
 past models to a ccd sensor 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.690
 at the Canon ixus 140 already has at 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.820
 average iso values ​​and, of course, too 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.430
 About it a negative influence on the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.439
 picture quality becomes the video recording 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.549
 no longer in full hd resolution 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.270
 realized but only in hd 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.159
 resolution 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.320
 this is also the good 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.630
 video quality the predecessor no longer 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.720
 achieves the series images of the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.729
 Canon ixus 140 falls with 0 7 images per 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.429
 second and that only for six 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.929
 Pictures in sequence extremely slow from the 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.149
 autofocus and the triggering delay 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.179
 after all, they move just like that 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.530
 On-time at a good level 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.270
 the optical works just as well 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.009
 image stabilizer of the blur 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.470
 can balance efficiently 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.090
 the 8x zoom lens covers the am 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.890
 most used focal length range 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.140
 his picture performance is still 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.350
 acceptable the intensity of fire miserable 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.240
 with 11 69 but already very weak as 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.640
 model digital camera is it nowadays 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.149
 Send a wlan module on board 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.729
 to have 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.039
 This data can be wireless 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.739
 also replace the Canon ixus 140 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.110
 owns one really succeeded 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:00.269
 but only the function pictures 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.959
 a smartphone or a tablet pc too 

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:03.929
 transfer 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.580
 who the pictures eg wirelessly on one 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.580
 Computer wants to save this 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.330
 First of all configure predicate 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.489
 nothing for beginners with the ixus 140 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.200
 Canon presents one of his current 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.940
 newcomers to a few cameras and worries 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.010
 with us for a laugh and a 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.450
 crying eye 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.129
 In addition to the good workmanship convinced 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.560
 the camera with a simple operation 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.360
 and with the exception of the series frame rate with 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.480
 a relatively fast 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.970
 Working speed 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.590
 the picture quality of the photos is in 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.269
 compared to the predecessors especially 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.019
 but at higher iso-values ​​clearly 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.849
 subsided 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.900
 the video recording was also 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:42.120
 unnecessarily limited to HD resolution 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.069
 so that the Canon ixus 140 is one 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.900
 compact beautiful weather camera with the man 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.090
 better no videos for bigger ones 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.280
 Tv devices should record the viper 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.870
 function is quite nice but except for the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.780
 transfer to a mobile device 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.120
 who realized something more complex 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.140
 wants to save and on a larger as well 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.090
 higher resolution 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.120
 Monitor can also do for 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.920
 grab ixus 135 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.500
 this also has an eightfold 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.060
 Zoom lens a nearly 16 megapixel 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.970
 resolving image sensor and a 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:17.240
 Wlan-module the display is only 27 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.240
 inches tall and resolves 230,000 pixels 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.590
 the d camera punkt.de test verdict for 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.590
 camera
