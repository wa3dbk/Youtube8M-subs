well<00:01:16.979> reason<00:01:17.460> why<00:01:17.640> I'm<00:01:17.790> adding<00:01:18.150> little<00:01:18.330> sugar

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
well reason why I'm adding little sugar

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.929 
well reason why I'm adding little sugar
first<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.710> sweetness<00:01:19.979> depends<00:01:20.490> upon<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
first is the sweetness depends upon the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.300 
first is the sweetness depends upon the
sweetness<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.930> banana<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.530> well<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.159> if

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
sweetness of the banana as well so if

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
sweetness of the banana as well so if
the<00:01:23.490> banana<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.909> too<00:01:24.180> sweet<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.659> need<00:01:24.869> only

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
the banana is too sweet you need only

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.160 
the banana is too sweet you need only
less<00:01:25.680> sugar<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.759> banana<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.869> sweet

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
less sugar if the banana is not so sweet

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.170 
less sugar if the banana is not so sweet
you<00:01:28.380> need<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:28.860> sugar<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.670> depends<00:01:30.060> upon

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
you need more sugar so it depends upon

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.359 
you need more sugar so it depends upon
the<00:01:30.420> sweetness<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> banana<00:01:31.189> next<00:01:32.189> add

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
the sweetness of the banana next add

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.149 
the sweetness of the banana next add
about<00:01:32.939> quarter<00:01:33.240> cup<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.750> water<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.680> mix<00:01:34.890> the

about quarter cup of water and mix the
ingredients<00:01:35.400> well<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.689> prepare<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> batter<00:01:37.530> if

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
ingredients well to prepare a batter if

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.700 
ingredients well to prepare a batter if
the<00:01:38.400> water<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:39.079> enough<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.380> add<00:01:40.500> more

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the water is not enough you can add more

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.590 
the water is not enough you can add more
water<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.250> make<00:01:41.490> sure<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.820> add<00:01:42.030> little<00:01:42.329> by

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
water but make sure you add little by

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.840 
water but make sure you add little by
little<00:01:42.780> because<00:01:42.990> once<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.920> sugar<00:01:44.490> start

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
little because once this sugar start

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.819 
little because once this sugar start
dissolving<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.630> will<00:01:45.810> loosen<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.590> batter

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
dissolving it will loosen the batter

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.280 
dissolving it will loosen the batter
well<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.579> while<00:01:48.119> preparing<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.810> batter<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
well so while preparing the batter it

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.870 
well so while preparing the batter it
will<00:01:49.439> be<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> correct<00:01:49.829> consistency<00:01:50.280> but

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
will be in the correct consistency but

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.819 
will be in the correct consistency but
after<00:01:51.210> 5<00:01:51.509> minutes<00:01:51.720> when<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> sugar<00:01:52.380> dissolves

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
after 5 minutes when the sugar dissolves

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.859 
after 5 minutes when the sugar dissolves
it<00:01:52.950> will<00:01:53.159> loosen<00:01:53.460> that's<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.360> reason<00:01:54.659> add

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
it will loosen that's the reason add

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.109 
it will loosen that's the reason add
little<00:01:55.140> water<00:01:55.520> wait<00:01:56.520> till<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> sugar

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
little water wait till the sugar

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.209 
little water wait till the sugar
dissolves<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.840> even<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:58.500> if<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.829> batter<00:01:59.040> is

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
dissolves and even then if the batter is

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.399 
dissolves and even then if the batter is
thick<00:01:59.250> add<00:01:59.640> little<00:01:59.909> water<00:02:00.060> or<00:02:00.570> else<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.259> can

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
thick add little water or else you can

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.709 
thick add little water or else you can
see<00:02:01.619> now<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.040> can<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.759> battery<00:02:03.030> loosen

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
see now you can see the battery loosen

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.840 
see now you can see the battery loosen
well<00:02:03.930> initially<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.680> was<00:02:04.860> thick<00:02:05.100> after<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
well initially it was thick after the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.240 
well initially it was thick after the
sugar<00:02:06.210> dissolved<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.350> batter<00:02:07.710> has<00:02:07.950> loosened

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
sugar dissolved the batter has loosened

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.249 
sugar dissolved the batter has loosened
so<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.239> right<00:02:09.420> consistency<00:02:09.690> you

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
so this is the right consistency you

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.690 
so this is the right consistency you
should<00:02:10.410> prepare<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.709> thick<00:02:10.979> batter<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.550> keep

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
should prepare a thick batter and keep

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.030 
should prepare a thick batter and keep
it<00:02:11.849> inside<00:02:12.209> and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
it inside and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.850 
it inside and
next<00:02:13.280> when<00:02:13.939> the<00:02:14.090> oil<00:02:14.269> is<00:02:14.689> become<00:02:15.049> really<00:02:15.560> hot

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
next when the oil is become really hot

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.819 
next when the oil is become really hot
you<00:02:16.159> are<00:02:16.250> going<00:02:16.489> to<00:02:16.670> put<00:02:16.969> the<00:02:17.439> bananas<00:02:18.439> dipped

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
you are going to put the bananas dipped

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.770 
you are going to put the bananas dipped
in<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.129> prepare<00:02:19.519> batter<00:02:19.700> in<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.269> oil<00:02:20.299> make

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
in the prepare batter in the oil make

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.259 
in the prepare batter in the oil make
sure<00:02:21.019> your<00:02:21.290> oil<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:21.650> really<00:02:21.920> hot<00:02:22.340> if<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:23.000> not

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
sure your oil is really hot if it is not

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.690 
sure your oil is really hot if it is not
too<00:02:23.569> hot<00:02:23.840> your<00:02:24.260> polymer<00:02:24.590> e<00:02:24.769> will<00:02:24.950> not<00:02:25.189> puff<00:02:25.459> up

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
too hot your polymer e will not puff up

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.580 
too hot your polymer e will not puff up
it<00:02:25.909> will<00:02:26.090> flatten<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.780> that's<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.140> reason<00:02:27.469> to

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
it will flatten so that's the reason to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.520 
it will flatten so that's the reason to
use<00:02:27.769> hot<00:02:28.069> oil<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:29.060> dip<00:02:29.569> each<00:02:29.810> piece<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.439> the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
use hot oil so dip each piece in the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.770 
use hot oil so dip each piece in the
prepared<00:02:30.950> manner<00:02:31.159> and<00:02:31.519> drop<00:02:31.939> it<00:02:32.090> in<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.269> hot

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
prepared manner and drop it in the hot

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.140 
prepared manner and drop it in the hot
oil<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.439> I'm<00:02:33.709> going<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.159> fry<00:02:34.549> it<00:02:34.609> for<00:02:34.700> about

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
oil and I'm going to fry it for about

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.360 
oil and I'm going to fry it for about
two<00:02:35.569> minutes<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:36.109> one<00:02:36.319> side<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.829> when<00:02:37.250> it

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
two minutes on one side and when it

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.179 
two minutes on one side and when it
turns<00:02:37.609> golden<00:02:37.939> color<00:02:38.359> on<00:02:38.599> the<00:02:39.049> bottom<00:02:39.709> said<00:02:40.040> I

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
turns golden color on the bottom said I

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.250 
turns golden color on the bottom said I
am<00:02:40.250> going<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.549> turn<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.939> to<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.299> other<00:02:41.659> side<00:02:42.079> so

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
am going to turn it to the other side so

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.440 
am going to turn it to the other side so
that<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.530> gets<00:02:42.769> on<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.010> top<00:02:43.310> side<00:02:43.489> also<00:02:43.939> make

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
that it gets on the top side also make

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.929 
that it gets on the top side also make
sure<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:45.139> take<00:02:45.709> off<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.069> excess<00:02:46.370> batter<00:02:46.639> and

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
sure you take off the excess batter and

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:48.429 
sure you take off the excess batter and
then<00:02:47.090> put<00:02:47.269> it<00:02:47.389> in<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.599> oil<00:02:47.629> so<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:47.989> it<00:02:48.260> does

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
then put it in the oil so that it does

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.860 
then put it in the oil so that it does
not<00:02:48.590> become<00:02:48.769> very<00:02:49.159> bulky<00:02:49.609> and<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.569> will<00:02:50.720> not

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
not become very bulky and it will not

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.569 
not become very bulky and it will not
get<00:02:51.139> cooked<00:02:51.470> well<00:02:51.680> inside<00:02:52.099> and<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.459> will

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
get cooked well inside and it will

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.309 
get cooked well inside and it will
remind<00:02:53.060> Raw<00:02:53.450> on<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.780> middle

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
remind Raw on the middle

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.800 
remind Raw on the middle
so<00:02:54.769> now<00:02:55.010> it's<00:02:55.310> turned<00:02:55.700> golden<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.150> color<00:02:56.389> take

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
so now it's turned golden in color take

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.599 
so now it's turned golden in color take
it<00:02:56.959> out<00:02:57.109> and<00:02:57.349> drain<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:57.919> kitchen<00:02:58.430> towel

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
it out and drain it in a kitchen towel

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.610 
it out and drain it in a kitchen towel
try<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.329> and<00:02:59.569> you'll<00:02:59.750> really<00:02:59.989> like<00:03:00.230> it

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
try it and you'll really like it

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.269 
try it and you'll really like it
thank<00:03:00.889> you<00:03:01.040> for<00:03:01.220> watching<00:03:01.459> actual<00:03:02.030> kitchen
