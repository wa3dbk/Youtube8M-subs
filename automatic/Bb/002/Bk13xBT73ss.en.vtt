00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.130
 experiments this strange and I just got 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.540
 run over right now and good once 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.420
 That's why we put it on camera 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.990
 quick so you can see it well where 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.990

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.530
 and well let's get there 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.110
 Once we are here, we ask 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.140
 a mission to some of these people 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.670
 some some of these people and good 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.490
 we entered the mission and once we 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.930
 let's enter the mission, we give it to 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.850
 leave not just another circle to leave 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.910
 for outside and good here magically 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.920
 then we will be inside of here of the ship 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.870
 is and well let's go to examine the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.960
 ship there I will put the camera 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.210
 quick so that this is not external 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.090
 the laboratory of this is immense 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.240
 We can go through many places 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.219

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.780
 here you can use the weapons inside tened 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.149
 I did not kill the comrades because 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.530
 it may be that you kill them and then go 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.079
 of the trick because they are going to have to why 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.210
 do it and it bothers a little bit not enough 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.549
