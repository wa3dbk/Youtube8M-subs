00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
it was kind of nice like juxtaposition

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.389 
it was kind of nice like juxtaposition
against<00:01:51.540> each<00:01:51.659> other<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.770> started<00:01:53.070> making

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
against each other I just started making

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.580 
against each other I just started making
them<00:01:53.549> well<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.119> listen<00:01:54.270> we've<00:01:54.899> got<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.049> slightly

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
them well to listen we've got a slightly

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.219 
them well to listen we've got a slightly
bigger<00:01:55.770> picture<00:01:56.219> here<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:57.180> mean<00:01:57.960> what's<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
bigger picture here I mean what's the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.179 
bigger picture here I mean what's the
idea<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> picture<00:01:58.799> anyway<00:01:59.040> this

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
idea of the picture anyway this

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.520 
idea of the picture anyway this
obviously<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> tube<00:02:00.390> isn't<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.899> was

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
obviously this is on a tube isn't it was

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.780 
obviously this is on a tube isn't it was
part<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.860> body<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.189> work<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.640> was<00:02:02.670> doing

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.400 
in London and I had to do something on
the<00:02:08.160> underground<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.910> was<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.569> fitting

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.980 
the underground it was just so fitting
and<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.940> kind<00:02:12.180> of

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
and the kind of

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.080 
and the kind of
couch<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.890> kind<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.340> comical<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:14.820> it's<00:02:14.970> also

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
couch is kind of comical but it's also

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.240 
couch is kind of comical but it's also
like<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.510> impulse<00:02:15.840> in<00:02:16.290> personality<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.100> it

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
like the impulse in personality of it

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.700 
like the impulse in personality of it
because<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:17.940> are<00:02:18.360> using<00:02:18.660> denim<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.380> your

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
kind of layering it for example that the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.000 
kind of layering it for example that the
newspaper<00:02:22.020> here<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.410> don't<00:02:22.650> know<00:02:22.710> how<00:02:22.830> well
