 today we are going to draw doraemon then 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.870
 let's start by drawing your nose and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.120
 make a circle 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.850
 is to start making your nose because 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.530
 from there I'm going to start to draw their 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.760
 eyes 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.760
 then I will draw 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.980
 this eye 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:32.290
 a circle and this we will go through 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.290
 behind his nose ready 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.950
 We painted a circle 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.950

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.670
 On the other hand well 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.270

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:57.280
 and a hurt his mouth wants a 6 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.890
 I'm going to draw a straight line that passes 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.480
 by the line on this line 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.480

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.260

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.909
 to continue 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.320
 above the eyes very little 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.520
 here we will continue the line 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.770
 I'm going to do 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.980

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.230
 I'm going to draw a line leaving a 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.110
 space 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.710
 mixed here let's leave the space 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:25.420
 because we are going to draw 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:28.470
 like the necklace and the little circle that has 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.340
 and he has this character 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.340
