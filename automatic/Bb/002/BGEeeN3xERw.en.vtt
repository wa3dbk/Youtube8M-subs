it was part of the widening of the flow
pad<00:00:47.510> but<00:00:47.720> it<00:00:47.809> has<00:00:47.989> broken<00:00:48.860> somewhat<00:00:49.460> away<00:00:49.790> from

has that North breakout moved away from

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.170 
has that North breakout moved away from
the<00:02:33.030> slope<00:02:33.269> at<00:02:34.160> it's<00:02:35.160> been<00:02:35.400> averaging<00:02:35.610> about<00:02:36.000> a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
the slope at it's been averaging about a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.509 
the slope at it's been averaging about a
hundred<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.720> 150<00:02:37.319> yards<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.680> day<00:02:37.860> since<00:02:38.250> the

10th also to 18th it's moved about 300
yards<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.860> we're<00:02:44.010> looking<00:02:44.250> at<00:02:44.340> about<00:02:44.459> a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
yards so we're looking at about a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.449 
yards so we're looking at about a
hundred<00:02:45.090> hundred<00:02:45.180> fifty<00:02:45.599> yards<00:02:45.900> per<00:02:46.140> day

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
hundred hundred fifty yards per day

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.500 
hundred hundred fifty yards per day
initially<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.489> said<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.790> was<00:02:47.879> hugging<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.360> edge

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
initially I said it was hugging the edge

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.809 
initially I said it was hugging the edge
of<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.900> foot<00:02:49.079> bed<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:49.349> it's<00:02:49.650> pulled<00:02:49.920> away<00:02:50.069> you

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
of the foot bed and it's pulled away you

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.130 
of the foot bed and it's pulled away you
know<00:02:51.620> they're<00:02:52.620> more<00:02:53.599> dedicated<00:02:54.599> or<00:02:54.690> committed

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140
