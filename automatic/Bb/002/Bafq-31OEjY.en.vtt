00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
I can see you're here without it and

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.190 
I can see you're here without it and
today<00:00:03.959> we're<00:00:04.259> looking<00:00:04.440> at<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.799> new<00:00:05.670> software

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
today we're looking at a new software

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.080 
today we're looking at a new software
called<00:00:07.200> 2.0<00:00:07.680> which<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.580> built<00:00:09.510> today<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:11.090> some

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
called 2.0 which we built today and some

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.390 
called 2.0 which we built today and some
of<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.330> obvious<00:00:12.570> features<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.440> a4tech<00:00:14.160> mode

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
of the obvious features is a4tech mode

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.930 
of the obvious features is a4tech mode
and<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:14.940> can<00:00:15.000> see<00:00:15.150> i<00:00:16.100> have<00:00:17.100> my<00:00:17.130> two<00:00:17.340> tech<00:00:17.699> mode

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
and you can see i have my two tech mode

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.880 
and you can see i have my two tech mode
which<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> little<00:00:18.630> more<00:00:18.660> simplified<00:00:19.380> but

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
which is a little more simplified but

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.500 
which is a little more simplified but
you<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.130> also<00:00:20.279> flip<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:20.970> for<00:00:21.300> tech

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
you can also flip it to the for tech

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.939 
you can also flip it to the for tech
mode<00:00:22.189> one<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.430> biggest<00:00:24.109> features<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.350> 2.0

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
mode one of the biggest features of 2.0

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.700 
mode one of the biggest features of 2.0
is<00:00:26.189> primarily<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.180> open<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.349> run<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
is primarily that is open you can run a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.679 
is primarily that is open you can run a
standalone<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> computer<00:00:30.119> without<00:00:30.300> any

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
standalone on the computer without any

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.420 
standalone on the computer without any
controller<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:32.070> use<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.309> with

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
controller it's you can use it with

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.270 
controller it's you can use it with
internal<00:00:32.880> sound<00:00:33.090> card<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.980> here<00:00:34.980> I'm<00:00:35.100> using

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
internal sound card so here I'm using

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.459 
internal sound card so here I'm using
with<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> exponent<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.260> show<00:00:37.410> you

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
with the exponent for the to show you

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.670 
with the exponent for the to show you
some<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> features<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.079> important<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
some of the features it is important to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.090 
some of the features it is important to
know<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.550> toad<00:00:42.390> 2.0<00:00:43.050> get<00:00:43.320> rebuilt<00:00:43.890> from

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
know that the toad 2.0 get rebuilt from

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.670 
know that the toad 2.0 get rebuilt from
the<00:00:44.190> ground<00:00:44.280> up<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:45.090> got<00:00:45.780> redesigned<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the ground up like got redesigned the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.630 
the ground up like got redesigned the
browser<00:00:46.920> everything<00:00:48.590> we<00:00:49.590> added<00:00:50.010> more<00:00:50.039> effects

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
browser everything we added more effects

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.950 
browser everything we added more effects
here

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.470 

we<00:00:56.500> got<00:00:56.710> resonator<00:00:57.280> we<00:00:57.580> got<00:00:57.790> repeat<00:00:58.120> we<00:00:58.270> got<00:00:58.450> a

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
we got resonator we got repeat we got a

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.480 
we got resonator we got repeat we got a
bit<00:00:58.780> reverse<00:00:59.110> which<00:00:59.440> is<00:00:59.620> pretty<00:01:00.010> cool<00:01:00.280> and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
bit reverse which is pretty cool and

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.600 
bit reverse which is pretty cool and
I'll<00:01:00.880> show<00:01:01.030> you<00:01:01.090> in<00:01:01.240> a<00:01:01.300> second<00:01:02.310> we<00:01:03.310> have<00:01:03.490> the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.880 
to the other one you're mixing levels
you're<00:01:37.180> mixing<00:01:37.420> volumes<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.410> now<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:38.649> can

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
you're mixing volumes so now you can

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.800 
you're mixing volumes so now you can
actually<00:01:39.040> activate<00:01:39.670> choose<00:01:40.240> from<00:01:40.540> four

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
actually activate choose from four

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.469 
actually activate choose from four
different<00:01:40.960> effects<00:01:41.619> in<00:01:41.740> adam2<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.550> fader<00:01:43.180> so

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
different effects in adam2 the fader so

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.300 
different effects in adam2 the fader so
it<00:01:43.660> will<00:01:43.750> apply<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.020> effect<00:01:44.470> as<00:01:44.800> you<00:01:44.860> move<00:01:45.130> the

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
it will apply the effect as you move the

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.389 
it will apply the effect as you move the
cross<00:01:45.520> fader<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.149> here<00:01:46.690> let<00:01:46.899> me<00:01:46.990> load<00:01:47.140> up<00:01:47.399> it

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
cross fader so here let me load up it

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.160 
cross fader so here let me load up it
saw

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.360 

so<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.250> got<00:01:53.550> this<00:01:53.729> ongoing<00:01:55.100> I'm<00:01:56.100> gonna

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
so here I got this ongoing I'm gonna

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.109 
so here I got this ongoing I'm gonna
sink

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.099 

so<00:02:00.689> straightforward<00:02:00.960> one<00:02:01.560> side<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.549> side<00:02:03.109> I'm

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
so straightforward one side to side I'm

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:05.840 
so straightforward one side to side I'm
gonna<00:02:04.469> add<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:04.979> first<00:02:05.250> effect<00:02:05.640> which<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
gonna add the first effect which is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.210 
gonna add the first effect which is
filter<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.140> gonna<00:02:07.289> apply<00:02:07.590> an<00:02:07.649> effect<00:02:08.069> as

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
filter so it's gonna apply an effect as

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.410 
filter so it's gonna apply an effect as
I<00:02:08.340> crossfade

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.830 

you<00:02:15.420> get<00:02:15.600> that

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.990 

so<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.500> next<00:02:22.769> one<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.040> called<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> duck<00:02:23.700> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
so this next one is called the duck and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.149 
so this next one is called the duck and
this<00:02:24.840> one<00:02:25.049> is<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> little<00:02:25.379> bit<00:02:25.590> weird<00:02:25.769> cos<00:02:25.980> it

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
this one is a little bit weird cos it

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.390 
this one is a little bit weird cos it
the<00:02:26.610> concept<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.420> takes<00:02:27.890> sonic<00:02:28.890> elements

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
the concept is it takes sonic elements

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.729 
the concept is it takes sonic elements
of<00:02:29.519> one<00:02:29.790> side<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.689> case<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.230> got<00:02:31.439> I<00:02:31.470> got<00:02:31.709> a

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
of one side in this case I got I got a

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.839 
of one side in this case I got I got a
feeling<00:02:32.040> by<00:02:32.129> the<00:02:32.159> Black<00:02:32.280> Eyed<00:02:32.610> Peas

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
feeling by the Black Eyed Peas

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.110 
feeling by the Black Eyed Peas
and<00:02:33.299> it<00:02:33.959> still<00:02:34.170> takes<00:02:34.530> little<00:02:35.489> pieces<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.970> this

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
and it still takes little pieces of this

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.960 
and it still takes little pieces of this
song<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.629> Adam<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.319> mix<00:02:37.650> as<00:02:38.549> I<00:02:38.760> move<00:02:38.939> my

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
song and Adam to this mix as I move my

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.580 
song and Adam to this mix as I move my
cross<00:02:39.269> fader<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.629> it<00:02:39.720> almost<00:02:39.959> sounds<00:02:40.230> like<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
cross fader so it almost sounds like the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.530 
cross fader so it almost sounds like the
I<00:02:41.069> kind<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.430> feeling<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.819> part<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.269> song
