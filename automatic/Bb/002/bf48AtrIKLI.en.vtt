00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.979 
not too shabby
that's<00:03:34.379> a<00:03:34.500> check<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.769> think<00:03:34.799> this<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.159> like<00:03:35.280> a

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
that's a check I think this is like a

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.130 
that's a check I think this is like a
2.8<00:03:36.989> on<00:03:37.319> head<00:03:38.280> inside<00:03:38.700> it's<00:03:38.879> protein<00:03:39.209> -<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:39.780> at

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
2.8 on head inside it's protein - so at

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.020 
2.8 on head inside it's protein - so at
3.7<00:03:40.859> volts<00:03:40.890> it's<00:03:41.189> not<00:03:41.340> doing<00:03:41.579> nothing<00:03:41.670> crazy

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
3.7 volts it's not doing nothing crazy

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.789 
3.7 volts it's not doing nothing crazy
but<00:03:42.269> still<00:03:42.959> if<00:03:43.109> you<00:03:43.170> want<00:03:43.379> to<00:03:43.439> throw<00:03:43.560> some

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
but still if you want to throw some

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.410 
but still if you want to throw some
anything<00:03:44.250> below<00:03:44.489> 2<00:03:44.549> ohm<00:03:44.879> on<00:03:45.090> top<00:03:45.269> of<00:03:45.359> this

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
anything below 2 ohm on top of this

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.509 
anything below 2 ohm on top of this
thing<00:03:45.569> it'll<00:03:45.810> bake<00:03:46.079> like<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.319> charm<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.950> just

buddy's gonna be making some more of

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.140 
buddy's gonna be making some more of
these<00:04:45.860> once<00:04:46.100> he<00:04:46.160> gets<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.400> shop<00:04:46.610> setup<00:04:46.880> fully

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
these once he gets the shop setup fully

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.880 
these once he gets the shop setup fully
he's<00:04:47.600> probably<00:04:47.720> gonna<00:04:47.930> be<00:04:47.990> doing<00:04:48.170> some<00:04:48.320> DNA<00:04:48.590> 20
