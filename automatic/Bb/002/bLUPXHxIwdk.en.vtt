to talk about each one and in this video
of<00:00:30.300> course<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.779> be<00:00:30.840> talking<00:00:31.080> about

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
of course I'm going to be talking about

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.930 
of course I'm going to be talking about
the<00:00:31.289> surface<00:00:31.650> pro<00:00:31.890> 2<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.340> let's<00:00:32.520> get<00:00:32.610> started

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the surface pro 2 so let's get started

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.510 
the surface pro 2 so let's get started
and<00:00:33.120> talk<00:00:33.960> about<00:00:34.110> what<00:00:34.410> general<00:00:35.040> changes

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
and talk about what general changes

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.459 
and talk about what general changes
they've<00:00:35.670> made<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.690> screens<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.140> bit<00:00:37.290> better

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
they've made so the screens a bit better

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.049 
they've made so the screens a bit better
the<00:00:37.800> graphics<00:00:38.219> are<00:00:38.370> improvement<00:00:38.879> and

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the graphics are improvement and

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.860 
the graphics are improvement and
performance<00:00:40.070> marks<00:00:41.070> top<00:00:41.219> says<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:42.059> pretty

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
performance marks top says have pretty

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.200 
performance marks top says have pretty
much<00:00:42.960> gone<00:00:43.590> up<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:43.980> wall<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.550> terms<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
much gone up this wall in terms of the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.049 
much gone up this wall in terms of the
design<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.899> very<00:00:46.500> very<00:00:46.800> similar<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.520> last

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
design it's very very similar to last

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.860 
design it's very very similar to last
year's<00:00:48.390> surface<00:00:49.260> surface<00:00:50.190> pro<00:00:50.640> 1<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.629> let's

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
year's surface surface pro 1 so let's

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.450 
year's surface surface pro 1 so let's
get<00:00:51.960> started<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> forgot<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
get started if you forgot what the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.819 
get started if you forgot what the
surface<00:00:53.879> pro<00:00:54.120> actually<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.559> full

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
surface pro actually is it's a full

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.979 
surface pro actually is it's a full
fledged<00:00:56.190> counterpart<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.390> surface<00:00:57.780> RT

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
fledged counterpart to the surface RT

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.389 
fledged counterpart to the surface RT
it's<00:00:58.680> runs<00:00:59.430> the<00:01:00.059> full<00:01:00.239> fledged<00:01:00.899> x86<00:01:01.739> Windows<00:01:02.160> 8

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
it's runs the full fledged x86 Windows 8

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.320 
it's runs the full fledged x86 Windows 8
and<00:01:03.260> it's<00:01:04.260> pretty<00:01:04.710> much<00:01:04.799> full<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.060> laptop

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and it's pretty much full out a laptop

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.560 
and it's pretty much full out a laptop
and<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.770> course<00:01:07.799> use<00:01:08.250> as<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> tablet<00:01:08.820> so

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and you can of course use as a tablet so

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.270 
and you can of course use as a tablet so
let's<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.840> started<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.200> apparently<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.130> is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
let's get started so apparently this is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.690 
let's get started so apparently this is
gonna<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.610> 50%<00:01:12.000> more<00:01:12.659> color<00:01:13.080> accuracy<00:01:13.700> for

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
gonna have 50% more color accuracy for

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.280 
gonna have 50% more color accuracy for
the<00:01:14.850> display<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.509> better<00:01:15.810> graphics

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
the display and better graphics

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.530 
the display and better graphics
performance<00:01:16.549> ourself<00:01:17.549> also<00:01:17.909> improved<00:01:18.330> this

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
performance ourself also improved this

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.630 
performance ourself also improved this
speaker<00:01:18.990> setup<00:01:19.229> as<00:01:19.500> well<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.189> they're<00:01:20.490> saying

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
speaker setup as well and they're saying

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.940 
speaker setup as well and they're saying
that's<00:01:20.820> gonna<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.210> 20%<00:01:21.600> faster<00:01:22.140> than<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that's gonna be 20% faster than the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.999 
that's gonna be 20% faster than the
original<00:01:23.159> surface<00:01:23.850> pro<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.560> display<00:01:25.890> is

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
original surface pro the display is

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.649 
original surface pro the display is
actually<00:01:26.189> really<00:01:26.729> consistent<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.479> still

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
actually really consistent it's still

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.260 
actually really consistent it's still
giving<00:01:27.900> me<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> 10<00:01:28.229> point<00:01:28.470> 6<00:01:28.680> inch<00:01:28.979> 1080p<00:01:29.759> panel

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
giving me a 10 point 6 inch 1080p panel

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.319 
giving me a 10 point 6 inch 1080p panel
and<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.439> par<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.979> surface<00:01:32.340> 2<00:01:32.880> RT

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
and it's on par with the surface 2 RT

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.719 
and it's on par with the surface 2 RT
and<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.350> goddess<00:01:34.890> Signet<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
and it's the goddess Signet like the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.219 
and it's the goddess Signet like the
battery<00:01:36.030> life<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.390> has<00:01:36.479> got<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> significant

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
battery life that has got a significant

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.670 
battery life that has got a significant
boost<00:01:37.640> by<00:01:38.640> 75%<00:01:39.270> actually<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.170> that's<00:01:40.320> mostly

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
boost by 75% actually and that's mostly

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.100 
boost by 75% actually and that's mostly
due<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.310> new<00:01:41.579> Haswell<00:01:42.150> processor<00:01:42.750> inside

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
due to the new Haswell processor inside

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.679 
due to the new Haswell processor inside
and<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:44.009> entire<00:01:44.310> tablet<00:01:44.759> itself<00:01:44.970> runs<00:01:45.299> much

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and the entire tablet itself runs much

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.889 
and the entire tablet itself runs much
more<00:01:45.930> quieter<00:01:46.409> than<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> predecessor

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
more quieter than the predecessor

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.090 
more quieter than the predecessor
Microsoft<00:01:48.899> also<00:01:49.259> says<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.799> pair<00:01:50.070> it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
Microsoft also says that if you pair it

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.859 
Microsoft also says that if you pair it
up<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.460> new<00:01:50.729> power<00:01:51.030> cover<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.720> give

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
up with a new power cover you can give

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.440 
up with a new power cover you can give
the<00:01:52.020> tablet<00:01:52.409> 2.5<00:01:53.100> times<00:01:53.460> its<00:01:53.729> standalone

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
the tablet 2.5 times its standalone

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.770 
the tablet 2.5 times its standalone
battery<00:01:54.960> type<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.430> course<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.969> often

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
battery type or of course you can often

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.590

price<00:03:55.829> point<00:03:56.190> as<00:03:56.340> well<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:57.299> can<00:03:57.329> expect<00:03:57.750> a

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
price point as well and you can expect a

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.560 
price point as well and you can expect a
bit<00:03:58.019> more<00:03:58.230> because<00:03:58.440> it's<00:03:59.070> really<00:03:59.610> compact<00:04:00.120> and

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
bit more because it's really compact and

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.900 
bit more because it's really compact and
of<00:04:01.440> course<00:04:01.829> that's<00:04:02.070> a<00:04:02.220> touchscreen<00:04:02.549> and<00:04:02.820> all

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
of course that's a touchscreen and all

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.710 
of course that's a touchscreen and all
that<00:04:03.209> so<00:04:04.070> it<00:04:05.070> is<00:04:05.519> gonna<00:04:05.730> cost<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.239> bit<00:04:06.420> more<00:04:06.570> and

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
that so it is gonna cost a bit more and

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.340 
that so it is gonna cost a bit more and
that's<00:04:06.810> where<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.470> 899<00:04:08.400> dollars<00:04:08.820> come<00:04:09.030> from

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
that's where the 899 dollars come from

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.620 
that's where the 899 dollars come from
but<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:11.280> same<00:04:11.459> price<00:04:11.670> as<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:11.910> original

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
but it is the same price as the original

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.660 
but it is the same price as the original
per<00:04:12.780> also<00:04:13.110> no<00:04:13.260> increase<00:04:13.769> in<00:04:13.799> pricing<00:04:14.400> there

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
per also no increase in pricing there

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.120 
per also no increase in pricing there
but<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.360> can<00:04:15.540> also<00:04:15.720> upgrade<00:04:16.079> your<00:04:16.680> surface

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
but you can also upgrade your surface

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.150 
but you can also upgrade your surface
pro<00:04:17.340> 2<00:04:17.580> you<00:04:17.729> can<00:04:17.910> configure<00:04:18.330> it<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.810> up<00:04:19.080> to<00:04:19.160> 512

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
pro 2 you can configure it of up to 512

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.069 
pro 2 you can configure it of up to 512
gigabytes<00:04:20.609> of<00:04:20.729> store

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
Singh will vary accordingly to what you

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.670 
Singh will vary accordingly to what you
configure<00:04:26.449> anyways<00:04:27.139> that's<00:04:27.319> it<00:04:27.409> for<00:04:27.590> this

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
configure anyways that's it for this

video<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:28.520> surface<00:04:28.940> pro<00:04:29.150> 2<00:04:29.389> is<00:04:29.419> not<00:04:29.870> that<00:04:30.110> bad

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
video the surface pro 2 is not that bad

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.409 
video the surface pro 2 is not that bad
of<00:04:30.560> an<00:04:30.650> upgrade<00:04:30.800> however<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:31.729> still<00:04:32.030> think<00:04:32.300> the

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
of an upgrade however I still think the

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.430 
of an upgrade however I still think the
surface<00:04:32.780> RT<00:04:32.960> 2<00:04:33.770> is<00:04:34.009> much<00:04:34.370> more<00:04:34.870> per<00:04:35.870> revision

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
surface RT 2 is much more per revision

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.469 
surface RT 2 is much more per revision
than<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.919> surface<00:04:37.280> pro<00:04:37.490> 2<00:04:37.699> surface<00:04:38.120> pro<00:04:38.270> 2<00:04:38.449> is

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
than the surface pro 2 surface pro 2 is

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.379 
than the surface pro 2 surface pro 2 is
just<00:04:38.569> some<00:04:38.870> minor<00:04:39.169> changes<00:04:39.500> here<00:04:39.979> and<00:04:40.069> there

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
just some minor changes here and there

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.700 
just some minor changes here and there
and<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.629> design<00:04:41.930> really<00:04:42.199> hasn't<00:04:42.530> been

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
and the design really hasn't been

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.890 
and the design really hasn't been
tweaked<00:04:43.099> that<00:04:43.280> much<00:04:43.490> either<00:04:43.699> so<00:04:44.090> that's

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
tweaked that much either so that's

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.240 
tweaked that much either so that's
pretty<00:04:45.259> much<00:04:45.349> it<00:04:45.440> for<00:04:45.650> this<00:04:45.770> video<00:04:45.919> let<00:04:46.220> me

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080
