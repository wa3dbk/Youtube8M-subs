00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:27.150
 turned out to be tough and what am I doing 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:30.179
 I take it and cut it very finely about 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:36.540
 here and here I already cut all plums 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:41.910
 networks and spilling them out on the leaf sprinkle 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:46.230
 a little sugar about here two 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.059
 spoons 2 tablespoons of sugar and I will 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.690
 bake in the oven to 200 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:57.149
 degrees for ten minutes and here are ours already 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:01.739

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:05.010

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.630
 Stas already do not need to add if you have 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.670
 thoughts just cut them and they are more 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.640
 sweet sugar is also not necessary 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.610
 add and now I want to show you 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:24.210
 like the dough on the table i have an butter table 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:29.340

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.939
 I take the dough is asked many show 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:39.210

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:42.950
 look see how the dough fits well 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.880
 I have it all once 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:54.360
 hands a little bit took a second time 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:57.750

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.299
 just dough should not be tula and here 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.649
 it must see well in the hands so 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.899
 enter without effort if with the family it 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.750
 it means your dough is very tough and 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.990
 longer 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:18.450

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.739
 I chopped and picked up points and will 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.470
 lubricate the patties so that they are 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.269
 asked for a little 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.310
 although you can not lubricate the butter 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.660
 pies you can not lubricate them at all 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.660
