00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hello there I am for every month again

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.870
 jump straight into it are namely 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.580
 I do not want a few and there now 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.210
 long chat before 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.220
 I have this face wash gel bb 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.510

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.189
 at the same time an eye make up remover 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.300
 I never have that as an eye make up 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.570
 remover because I used that weird 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.179
 find with some foaming soapy 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.980
 to wipe my eyes there is something 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.980
 but otherwise I found it very good 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.680
 and I also bought it 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.989
 winter to coconut oil for make-up removal 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.640
 gripped and now where it is warmer again 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.020
 my skin will feel better again 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.360
 such more frequent things clear and me 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.010
 Just like the feeling of so 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.050
 wash face really clean because you two 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.170
 Hand creams made empty these two 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.059
 here 10 of the same size in the camera 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:04.260
 But they are not bigger here 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:06.689
 from almond blossoms house a hand cream there 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:13.100
 i love the scent over everything and have 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:16.860
 the bathroom of it and of that the oil 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.720
 the body of it I have and there 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.710
 I still needed the hand cream and this 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.860
 have become empty and I have them behind 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.360
 bought and I 'm totally great then by 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.470
 Florina here so a little try 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.259
 size I always had one 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.380
 handbag is the one with chamomile and 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.000
 I liked that and I just like it 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.119
 These small sizes for the handbag 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.520
 very much and I do not have that exactly 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.530
 I bought it because I think I got it 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.780
 any rebuilt i dont know 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.430
 which you will be then hopefully 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.750
 soon learn or not empty 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.680
 have done and I experience it 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.899
 Hopefully I will be in mine soon 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.479
 then I have a handbag here 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.610
 something empty made something of 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.229
 calcified on the edge is that I actually 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.010
 do not want to hold in the camera 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.620
 that is from l'oreal 1 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.870
 Parkour and I am really embarrassed 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.070
 how old is that 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.960
 I do not know exactly how many years 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.640
 but we can really years 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.740
 talk and I'm not talking about this 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:16.400
 two years more so 54 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.860
 so this in any case parents and the 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.660
 there was also there in there too 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.850
 Germany this is one now 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.220
 Arabic version of it and that is the 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.960
 anti break ours in his 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:33.110
 yellow packaging is here is just money 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:34.820
 with points and that is very very good 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.110
 been, and I need them now but 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.280
 not so I have the still empty 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.720
 still makes long as my hair were 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.070
 and I just do not need it 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.940
 more because my hair is not anymore 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.860
 Deep intensive cure then need 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.930
 I was still a rinse made blank the 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.120
 I have always had them often 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.310
 bought again and now knows 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.110
 not so if I would buy her 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.780
 my hair still need it from 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.150
 Alterra the moisture rinse and the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.900
 is very good this without silicones and 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.670
 I can highly recommend them just like 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.050
 I said I do not know must sometimes look 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.959
 how my hair will develop like that 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.540
 I still have one 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.360
 Moisture needs flushing or if I am 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.190
 Maybe I'll buy a rinse 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.510
 Culture is more because I mean mine 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.290
 hair dye or maybe more for 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.600
 look glamorous 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.320
 then the shampoo became your teacher 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.570
 of santi gloss shampoo in bio plums and 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.160
 cardamom and unfortunately that was a limited 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.720
 edition we really need to re-buy 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.900
 Let's see if it still exists 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.250
 was really good it was me what I did not 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.510
 was so great that it was not so great 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.769
 but has foamed that I believe that 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.360
 made me act very much in the long run 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.610
 disturbed because I somehow the feeling 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.840
 I needed a lot of product 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.610
 rubbish is you should properly only 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.080
 into the scalp but if you are long 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.410
 has hair gives her what likely 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.489
 I'm talking then you come somehow 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.930
 then it's bad I have mine 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.810
 Hair is always washed over your head 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.459
 the bathtub and then they are 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.450
 In the way and there I sometimes had that 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.950
 Feel I need a little bit 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.930
 much of it but otherwise I found 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.190
 really good 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.480
 The hair spray has become empty, I realize 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.639
 There are a lot of hair here , somehow 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.440
 products only have race become empty 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.140
 my favorite hairspray from 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.450
 power of the ultra hair lacquer in strength 4 of the 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.370
 it's really good I have with long ones 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.900
 Hair used in the past with short hair 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.430
 then again with long and now again 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.180
 with short hair and that's easy 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.770
 really good and I have him of course 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.840
 I bought later gave you a video 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.250
 By the way, just turned and me 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.370
 do not know exactly which ones first 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.010
 So maybe you already know what 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.270
 i bought after and what not yes 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.110
 I think I'll get the hang of it first 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.360
 stand online 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.920
 then I made this empty of 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:47.060
 l'oreal the txt express volume blablabla 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.860
 spray that was really well tolerated 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.510
 Volume brought that makes you 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.100
 I really like it, I think I have it too 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.380
 in the meantime in my favorites in it if 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.180
 I am not mistaken and you can feel it 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.330
 Just attach to the hairline when the hair 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.130
 are dry and then I have 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.800
 felt such a neck and then have 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.750
 copied and there are really volume and 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.790
 it is probably a text rising spray 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.770
 if you want to do it in the lengths then 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.250
 it also has some positive effect 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.740
 so I did not have it with me 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.840
 My dry hair has gotten worse 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.550
 then even more fluffed up what I 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.720
 with long hair at that time at all 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.760
 not good for the approach but for 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.190
 the volume is great and I have it 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.600
 I also do not know if I am 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.700
 Either I'm already in the bathroom 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.210
 or i would like to buy it myself 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.740
 yet let's see then is my 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.020
 favorite animal respectively one of the 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.000
 two favorite deos that the maximum 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.800
 protection i either buy that or 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.419
 the rexona at the moment I have again 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.919
 rexona since I always change so 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:50.900
 and that smells very subtle and is 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.610
 really effective I think so 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.530
 really very good you have to 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.830
 to be careful with white 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.760
 edges and it's natural 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.160
 aluminum salts and the whole stuff in it 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.419
 So who wants to take distance from it 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.580
 should not buy that 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.410
 You should know that in any case 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.180
 that's in there if that matters to you 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.080
 and then I have one more cream 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:15.080
 Made by Monterrey I hope you 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:20.780
 does it sound like the hydro cell and the 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:22.820
 I thought it was okay to have such a one 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.120
 smaller size and 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:28.520
 I would not buy it back 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.600
 I think he is a bit too 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.270
 a bit more expensive 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.040
 and I would not buy it 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.810
 if it was cheaper because I like it 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.180
 just just okay she found my skin 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.410
 moisturized but I had 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.440
 the feeling that was it already 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.630
 otherwise I always had to 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.130
 still in addition it was creamy 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.870
 from the humidity so not enough 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.960
 and i also felt that she was 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:54.740
 nothing else did good for me 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.880
 no luck no nothing nothing nothing 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.820
 somehow was particularly 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.470
 and hello phone I'll make you 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.820
 quietly and then I have more of essens 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.710
 here are the top players made empty 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.470
 that's the battle the channels the 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.450
 older version there is a newer one now 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.950
 version not I'm not sure whether 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.690
 it now also gives or 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.830
 others in addition if you know that 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.470
 write me that in the comments 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.280
 You are often really well informed 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.880
 I have to say 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.470
 and that was the madness I have the 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.320
 I have to change my beloved one 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.810
 watch if it is exactly that again or 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.670
 if that's out of the assortment if 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.020
 if he still exists, I'll open 

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.640
 any case and probably buy 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.830
 equal in three pack 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.880
 There is no three pack if I am 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.030
 buy three of them 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.610
 it protects the nail polish really well 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.680
 gives a really good gloss and the 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.230
 nada money really much longer 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.720
 I'm often just at the tips in front 

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:50.590
 los starts to fall over and so on 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.510
 and that is really very much with that 

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.890
 With a time delay this happens and mine 

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.810
 love that's it for today
