paper start out on the colored side fold
it<00:00:20.660> yeah<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.109> triangle<00:00:25.369> triangle<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:27.920> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
it yeah the triangle triangle and the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:42.139 
it yeah the triangle triangle and the
same<00:00:29.130> thing<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> direction<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:41.000> going<00:00:42.000> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
same thing on the direction and going to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.010 
same thing on the direction and going to
flip<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.450> over<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.399> you're<00:00:44.399> going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.760> fold<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
flip it over and you're going to fold it

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.500 
flip it over and you're going to fold it
in<00:00:46.200> half<00:00:47.450> suck<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.500> to<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> rectangle<00:00:50.510> and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
in half suck that to a rectangle and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.580 
in half suck that to a rectangle and
again<00:00:51.930> other<00:00:52.379> direction

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.520 

now<00:01:00.250> pull<00:01:00.820> into<00:01:00.940> dividing<00:01:01.720> two<00:01:01.900> eights<00:01:02.170> in

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
now pull into dividing two eights in

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
now pull into dividing two eights in
both<00:01:02.770> directions<00:01:02.950> and<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:04.360> do<00:01:04.480> that<00:01:04.660> it<00:01:04.839> just

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
both directions and to do that it just

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.910 
both directions and to do that it just
fold<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.420> edges<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:07.960> middle<00:01:13.800> just<00:01:14.800> like

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
fold the edges to the middle just like

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
fold the edges to the middle just like
that<00:01:15.780> unfold<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:18.420> fold<00:01:19.420> this<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:21.369> edge<00:01:21.610> all

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
that unfold it fold this this edge all

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:33.980 
that unfold it fold this this edge all
the<00:01:22.390> way<00:01:22.420> to<00:01:22.570> this<00:01:23.320> crease<00:01:30.600> unfold<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:32.560> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the way to this crease unfold it and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:42.060 
the way to this crease unfold it and
fold<00:01:34.990> this<00:01:35.440> well<00:01:36.899> thing<00:01:37.899> in<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.770> again<00:01:41.770> other

that little section in and when you're
done<00:05:14.560> squishing<00:05:15.130> that<00:05:15.460> section<00:05:15.910> in<00:05:16.060> you'll

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
done squishing that section in you'll

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.120 
done squishing that section in you'll
get<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.870> square<00:05:17.200> at<00:05:17.260> the<00:05:17.320> top<00:05:17.560> you're<00:05:17.920> just

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
get a square at the top you're just

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.110 
get a square at the top you're just
going<00:05:18.400> to<00:05:18.520> collapse<00:05:19.120> at<00:05:19.390> square<00:05:20.280> sort<00:05:21.280> of<00:05:21.400> like

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
going to collapse at square sort of like

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.860 
going to collapse at square sort of like
that<00:05:23.130> collapse<00:05:24.130> a<00:05:24.280> square<00:05:24.550> like<00:05:24.790> that<00:05:25.000> then

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
that collapse a square like that then
