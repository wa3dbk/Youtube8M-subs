00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
I'm going to show you how to make a

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.530 
I'm going to show you how to make a
labyrinth<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.650> labyrinth<00:00:05.370> is<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.730> sort<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.240> maze

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
labyrinth a labyrinth is a sort of maze

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.200 
labyrinth a labyrinth is a sort of maze
but<00:00:06.990> there's<00:00:07.259> no<00:00:07.470> choices<00:00:07.830> in<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.280> path<00:00:08.519> so

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
but there's no choices in the path so

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.749 
but there's no choices in the path so
really<00:00:09.540> it's<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:10.050> path<00:00:10.740> words<00:00:11.099> from<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
really it's a path words from the

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.910 
really it's a path words from the
outside<00:00:12.150> into<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.540> center<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.290> they<00:00:13.679> can<00:00:13.830> be

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
outside into the center and they can be

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.230 
outside into the center and they can be
used<00:00:14.070> as<00:00:14.630> meditations<00:00:15.650> mindfulness<00:00:17.240> anyway

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
used as meditations mindfulness anyway

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.810 
used as meditations mindfulness anyway
we<00:00:18.449> start<00:00:18.720> off<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.350> cross<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.670> center

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
we start off with a cross in the center

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.620 
we start off with a cross in the center
of<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.119> page<00:00:21.800> and<00:00:22.800> then<00:00:23.160> from<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.670> cross<00:00:23.910> we

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
of the page and then from the cross we

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.589 
of the page and then from the cross we
do<00:00:25.910> four<00:00:27.170> little<00:00:28.170> extra<00:00:28.560> bits<00:00:28.830> here<00:00:29.240> for<00:00:30.240> owls

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
do four little extra bits here for owls

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.040 
do four little extra bits here for owls
and<00:00:30.960> different<00:00:31.260> directions<00:00:32.000> okay<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.899> can

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and different directions okay you can

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.470 
and different directions okay you can
keep<00:00:34.230> all<00:00:34.410> those<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.829> same<00:00:35.070> length<00:00:35.480> it

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
keep all those the same length it

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
keep all those the same length it
doesn't<00:00:36.750> really<00:00:36.870> matter<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.710> then<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.010> you

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
doesn't really matter and then if you

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.709 
doesn't really matter and then if you
just<00:00:38.219> put<00:00:38.399> four<00:00:38.670> dots<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> corner<00:00:41.690> it<00:00:42.690> is

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
just put four dots in the corner it is

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.520 
just put four dots in the corner it is
going<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.200> help<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:44.539> draw<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.989> labyrinth

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
going to help you draw your labyrinth

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.639 
going to help you draw your labyrinth
and<00:00:47.180> then<00:00:48.180> all<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:48.899> you're<00:00:49.200> going<00:00:49.379> from

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
and then all you do is you're going from

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.020 
and then all you do is you're going from
one<00:00:51.170> end<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.920> one<00:00:53.160> piece<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.000> other

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
one end of one piece to the other

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.090 
one end of one piece to the other
there's<00:00:54.390> an<00:00:54.690> offset<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.590> start<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
there's an offset so if I start in the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.060 
there's an offset so if I start in the
middle<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.090> go<00:00:57.469> over<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
middle and I just go over one to the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.660 
middle and I just go over one to the
right<00:00:59.250> I'm<00:01:00.059> gonna<00:01:00.210> take<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> next<00:01:00.719> one<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.670> go

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
right I'm gonna take the next one I go

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.479 
right I'm gonna take the next one I go
over<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> right<00:01:04.320> hand<00:01:04.350> side<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.309> then

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
over on to the right hand side and then

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.740 
over on to the right hand side and then
on<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.090> dot<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.689> take<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.770> right<00:01:08.070> round<00:01:08.750> to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
on to the dot I take that right round to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780 
on to the dot I take that right round to
the<00:01:09.869> start<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.310> then<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> end<00:01:11.670> of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the start of that and then the end of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.660 
the start of that and then the end of
this<00:01:11.939> I'll<00:01:12.860> take<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.040> over<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:15.330> round<00:01:16.670> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
this I'll take it over and round and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.800 
this I'll take it over and round and
keep<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.479> doing<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.100> see<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.810> labyrinth

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
keep on doing it you can see a labyrinth

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.420 
keep on doing it you can see a labyrinth
starting<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.979> form

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
starting to form

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.560 
starting to form
I<00:01:24.259> find<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.380> creating<00:01:26.130> mazes<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:27.000> often<00:01:27.330> more

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
I find that creating mazes is often more

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.810 
I find that creating mazes is often more
fun<00:01:27.900> than<00:01:28.140> actually<00:01:29.130> solving<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> maze

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
fun than actually solving the maze

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.660 
fun than actually solving the maze
itself<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.200> keep<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:36.890> until<00:01:37.890> you've

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
itself so you keep going until you've

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:47.289 
itself so you keep going until you've
joined<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.299> all<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.220> empty<00:01:42.180> paths

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.020 

and<00:01:48.299> there<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:49.020> labyrinth<00:01:50.030> so

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and there you have it your labyrinth so

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.760 
and there you have it your labyrinth so
you<00:01:51.689> start<00:01:52.490> this<00:01:53.490> bit<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.259> follow<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
you start this bit and you follow the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.429 
you start this bit and you follow the
labyrinth<00:01:56.159> round<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:57.119> you'll<00:01:57.330> find<00:01:57.750> that

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
labyrinth round and you'll find that

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.090 
labyrinth round and you'll find that
it's<00:01:59.399> one<00:01:59.729> path<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.659> will<00:02:00.810> finally<00:02:01.200> take<00:02:01.920> you

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it's one path that will finally take you

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.570 
it's one path that will finally take you
into<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.520> center<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.590> in<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> UK<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.159> find<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
into the center and in the UK you find a

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.219 
into the center and in the UK you find a
lot<00:02:05.789> of<00:02:05.820> labyrinths<00:02:06.390> around<00:02:06.750> some<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.110> them

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
lot of labyrinths around some of them

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.160 
lot of labyrinths around some of them
have<00:02:07.350> even<00:02:07.530> been<00:02:08.039> cut<00:02:08.340> into<00:02:08.550> turf<00:02:08.989> into<00:02:09.989> my

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
have even been cut into turf into my

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.540 
have even been cut into turf into my
turf<00:02:10.890> mazes<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:12.569> they<00:02:12.690> used<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.319> believe<00:02:14.040> as<00:02:14.519> a

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
turf mazes and they used I believe as a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.080 
turf mazes and they used I believe as a
sort<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.390> meditation<00:02:16.099> so<00:02:17.099> it's<00:02:17.550> just<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.880> way<00:02:18.030> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
sort of meditation so it's just a way to

leave your worries behind as you enter

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.309 
leave your worries behind as you enter
the<00:02:20.040> labyrinth<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:21.480> mindfully<00:02:22.110> walk

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319
