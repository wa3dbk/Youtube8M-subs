it's<00:00:46.070> much<00:00:46.370> bigger<00:00:46.640> than<00:00:46.820> what<00:00:47.450> we<00:00:47.570> were

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
it's much bigger than what we were

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
fiscal cliff except this tax increase

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.380 
fiscal cliff except this tax increase
also<00:00:51.830> affects<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.340> US<00:00:52.610> government<00:00:53.150> which<00:00:53.270> is

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
also affects the US government which is

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.270 
also affects the US government which is
the<00:00:53.510> biggest<00:00:53.690> debtor<00:00:54.050> of<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.350> mall<00:00:54.560> I<00:00:54.830> think

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
the biggest debtor of the mall I think

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.220 
the biggest debtor of the mall I think
you<00:00:55.370> can<00:00:55.550> see<00:00:55.760> yields<00:00:56.030> up<00:00:56.270> at<00:00:56.420> four<00:00:56.660> percent<00:00:57.140> on

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
you can see yields up at four percent on

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.110 
you can see yields up at four percent on
the<00:00:57.320> 10-year<00:00:57.710> a<00:00:57.890> lot<00:00:58.310> quicker<00:00:58.610> than<00:00:58.880> anybody

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
the 10-year a lot quicker than anybody

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.390 
the 10-year a lot quicker than anybody
thinks<00:00:59.720> unless<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.530> Fed<00:01:00.740> comes<00:01:01.070> in<00:01:01.250> and

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
thinks unless the Fed comes in and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.430 
thinks unless the Fed comes in and
starts<00:01:01.550> buying<00:01:01.880> a<00:01:02.090> lot<00:01:02.270> more<00:01:02.510> than<00:01:02.720> 85<00:01:03.140> billion

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440

decline is the same as your analysis for
the<00:01:09.530> stock<00:01:09.860> decline<00:01:10.310> it's<00:01:10.670> all<00:01:11.030> about<00:01:11.060> rising

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
the stock decline it's all about rising

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.690 
the stock decline it's all about rising
interest<00:01:12.260> rates<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.010> bill<00:01:13.310> that<00:01:13.580> will

gold<00:01:21.080> is<00:01:21.260> not<00:01:21.440> going<00:01:21.710> off<00:01:21.950> down<00:01:22.250> because

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
gold is not going off down because

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.580 
gold is not going off down because
long-term<00:01:23.150> rates<00:01:23.390> are<00:01:23.600> rising<00:01:23.780> in<00:01:24.200> fact<00:01:24.470> I

long-term rates are rising in fact I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.650 
long-term rates are rising in fact I

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
think long-term rates are rising because

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.360 
think long-term rates are rising because
inflation<00:01:27.040> expectations<00:01:28.040> are<00:01:28.190> rising

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370

the ability to fed to dial back to QE

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.510 
the ability to fed to dial back to QE
they're<00:01:33.230> losing<00:01:33.440> confidence<00:01:33.860> in<00:01:34.280> the

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
despite what SP said yesterday so it's

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.270 
despite what SP said yesterday so it's
got<00:01:39.530> nothing<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:39.860> do<00:01:39.980> with<00:01:40.070> though<00:01:40.130> I<00:01:40.159> think
