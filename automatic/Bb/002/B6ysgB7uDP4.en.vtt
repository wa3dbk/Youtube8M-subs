00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
hey guys how's it going this is unique

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.190 
hey guys how's it going this is unique
prophecy<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.510> today<00:00:03.840> I'm<00:00:03.899> going<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.140> be

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
prophecy and today I'm going to be

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.050 
prophecy and today I'm going to be
showing<00:00:04.380> you<00:00:04.589> how<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.710> make<00:00:04.920> an<00:00:05.069> an<00:00:05.400> elevator

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
showing you how to make an an elevator

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.570 
showing you how to make an an elevator
out<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.270> Pistons<00:00:06.779> so<00:00:07.649> if<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.069> saw<00:00:08.220> my<00:00:08.400> first

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
out of Pistons so if you saw my first

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.200 
out of Pistons so if you saw my first
video<00:00:09.530> this<00:00:10.530> elevator<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.219> not<00:00:11.490> exactly<00:00:12.000> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
video this elevator is not exactly the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.150 
video this elevator is not exactly the
same<00:00:12.450> because<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.620> one<00:00:13.799> doesn't<00:00:14.009> work

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
same because that one doesn't work

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.129 
same because that one doesn't work
anymore<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.910> way<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.210> notches<00:00:15.719> Pistons

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
anymore the way that notches Pistons

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.359 
anymore the way that notches Pistons
that<00:00:17.270> the<00:00:18.270> physics<00:00:18.630> worked<00:00:18.900> for<00:00:19.140> them<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:19.650> but

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
that the physics worked for them so but

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.810 
that the physics worked for them so but
this<00:00:20.550> one<00:00:21.800> works<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.010> same<00:00:23.100> where<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.640> works

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
this one works the same where it works

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.859 
this one works the same where it works
just<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.359> same<00:00:24.420> pretty<00:00:24.990> much<00:00:25.279> so<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:27.210> didn't

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
just the same pretty much so I didn't

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.750 
just the same pretty much so I didn't
create<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.470> myself<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.099> saw<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.519> some

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
create this myself I saw it on some

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.990 
create this myself I saw it on some
video<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.300> forgot<00:00:30.689> whose<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:31.590> their's<00:00:32.520> was

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
video I forgot whose but their's was

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.690 
video I forgot whose but their's was
lacking<00:00:33.390> something<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> true<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.700> improved

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
lacking something so I true I improved

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.900 
lacking something so I true I improved
it<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.059> would<00:00:36.360> say<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.809> here<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.620> go<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.760> go

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
it I would say so here we go so you go

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.720 
it I would say so here we go so you go
up<00:00:39.120> obviously<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.140> you're<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> second

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
up obviously and you're on the second

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.990 
up obviously and you're on the second
floor<00:00:41.850> which<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> pirate<00:00:43.559> plank<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.579> me<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
floor which is a pirate plank for me and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.110

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
out a lot of animals around where I'm

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.959 
out a lot of animals around where I'm
going<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.530> doing<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.039> thanks<00:01:02.550> animals

but<00:01:03.629> I'm<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> put<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.949> two

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
but I'm going to put this up in two

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.600 
but I'm going to put this up in two
parts<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.630> second<00:01:07.020> part<00:01:07.229> will<00:01:07.500> consist<00:01:08.490> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
parts the second part will consist of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.300 
parts the second part will consist of
two<00:01:08.790> videos<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.350> simple<00:01:10.860> way<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
two videos like it's a simple way and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.719 
two videos like it's a simple way and
then<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:12.020> more<00:01:13.020> difficult<00:01:13.200> way<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.490> one

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
then a more difficult way but that one

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.640 
then a more difficult way but that one
it's<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.810> bit<00:01:15.900> more<00:01:16.080> difficult<00:01:16.229> than

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
it's a little bit more difficult than

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.649 
it's a little bit more difficult than
the<00:01:16.799> simple<00:01:16.979> ways<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.210> first<00:01:18.450> thing

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
the simple ways but the first thing

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.230 
the simple ways but the first thing
you're<00:01:18.810> going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.049> want<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.909> dig<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.180> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
you're going to want to do is dig just a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.570 
you're going to want to do is dig just a
to<00:01:21.420> buy<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.780> hole<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:23.310> put

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
to buy one hole like that and then put

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.570 
to buy one hole like that and then put
two<00:01:23.759> regular<00:01:24.270> Pistons<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.310> then<00:01:26.310> put

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
two regular Pistons in them and then put

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.830 
two regular Pistons in them and then put
a<00:01:26.790> regular<00:01:27.150> piston<00:01:27.890> looking<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.600> like<00:01:30.600> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
a regular piston looking up like that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.859 
a regular piston looking up like that
and<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.920> sticky<00:01:32.250> piston<00:01:32.430> going<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.689> way

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
and then a sticky piston going that way

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.149 
and then a sticky piston going that way
towards<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.590> root<00:01:34.770> regular<00:01:35.700> piston<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.890> what

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
towards the root regular piston so what

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.980 
towards the root regular piston so what
that<00:01:38.369> will<00:01:38.549> do<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.729> it'll<00:01:39.329> Press<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
that will do is it'll Press that and

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.340 
that will do is it'll Press that and
press<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.680> all<00:01:41.310> right<00:01:41.540> in<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.630> nutshell<00:01:42.840> go

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
press that all right in a nutshell go

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.649 
press that all right in a nutshell go
like<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.740> it'll<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.939> will<00:01:45.090> go<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
like this it'll go that will go up and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.389 
like this it'll go that will go up and
then<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:46.740> go<00:01:46.829> up<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.159> you'll<00:01:47.340> just

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
then that will go up and you'll just

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:56.240 
then that will go up and you'll just
keep<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:52.040> just<00:01:53.360> repeat<00:01:55.250> this

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
keep on going up so so just repeat this

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
and you can use any type of blocks I'm

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.630 
and you can use any type of blocks I'm
just<00:01:58.079> using<00:01:58.259> dirt<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.829> have<00:01:59.130> quite<00:01:59.579> a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
just using dirt because I have quite a

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.240 
just using dirt because I have quite a
bit<00:02:00.860> 111<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.869> just<00:02:03.869> repeat<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.380> how<00:02:04.740> high

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
bit 111 so just repeat this how high

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.190 
bit 111 so just repeat this how high
ever<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.700> want<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.939> go<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.509> i'm<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.020> going

ever you want to go and i'm just going
to<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.439> three<00:02:07.680> right<00:02:08.190> now<00:02:08.220> for<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:09.140> concern<00:02:10.140> of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
to do three right now for a concern of

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.170 
to do three right now for a concern of
time<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.920> next<00:02:11.430> what<00:02:11.670> you're<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.030> want

time so next what you're going to want
to<00:02:12.239> do<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.690> go<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
to do is go to the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.500 
to do is go to the
piston<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.250> closest<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.970> ground<00:02:16.210> on

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
piston that is closest to the ground on

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.400 
piston that is closest to the ground on
these<00:02:16.810> three<00:02:17.140> or<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:19.300> ones<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.780> are<00:02:19.990> on

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
these three or on the ones that are on

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.170 
these three or on the ones that are on
this<00:02:20.620> like<00:02:20.830> little<00:02:20.980> pillar<00:02:21.250> thing<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:21.850> mind

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
this like little pillar thing so mind

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
this like little pillar thing so mind
right<00:02:22.330> here<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.660> you're<00:02:22.750> just<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:22.990> to<00:02:23.050> want

right here and you're just going to want
to<00:02:23.230> put<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.470> repeater<00:02:23.950> next<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.460> it<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:24.730> then

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
to put a repeater next to it and then

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.030 
to put a repeater next to it and then
block<00:02:25.810> in<00:02:25.990> front<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.350> behind<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.740> repeater

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
block in front and behind the repeater

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.920 
block in front and behind the repeater
and<00:02:27.390> you're<00:02:28.390> going<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.600> want<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.780> put<00:02:28.900> a

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
and you're going to want to put a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.980 
and you're going to want to put a
repeater<00:02:29.290> right<00:02:29.970> behind<00:02:30.970> that<00:02:31.270> sticky<00:02:31.630> piston

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
repeater right behind that sticky piston

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.010 
repeater right behind that sticky piston
and<00:02:32.140> set<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.220> on<00:02:33.280> four<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.790> then<00:02:34.540> put<00:02:34.840> redstone

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
and set it on four and then put redstone

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.910 
and set it on four and then put redstone
like<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:36.570> then<00:02:37.570> get<00:02:38.050> redstone<00:02:38.410> just

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
like that and then get redstone just

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.330 
like that and then get redstone just
make<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.580> wire<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:40.180> goes<00:02:40.240> all<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.630> way<00:02:40.870> around

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
make a wire that goes all the way around

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.100 
make a wire that goes all the way around
like<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:45.300> then<00:02:46.300> over<00:02:46.570> here<00:02:46.600> where

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
like this and then over here where

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.300 
like this and then over here where
you're<00:02:47.200> going<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.440> your<00:02:47.590> want<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:47.830> do<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.100> same

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
you're going to your want to do the same

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.880 
you're going to your want to do the same
thing<00:02:48.610> except<00:02:49.090> make<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.020> entire<00:02:50.290> thing<00:02:50.350> one

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
thing except make the entire thing one

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.970 
thing except make the entire thing one
higher<00:02:51.900> because<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.350> Pistons<00:02:53.740> are<00:02:53.860> one

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
higher because the Pistons are one

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.150 
higher because the Pistons are one
higher<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:54.490> yeah<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:56.380> just<00:02:56.620> do<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.830> exact<00:02:57.130> same

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
higher so yeah so just do the exact same

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.740 
higher so yeah so just do the exact same
thing<00:02:57.580> remember<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.180> set<00:02:58.330> that<00:02:58.480> on<00:02:58.510> four<00:02:59.280> and

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
thing remember to set that on four and

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.650 
thing remember to set that on four and
then<00:03:02.790> you're<00:03:03.790> going<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:03.970> want<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.180> block<00:03:04.420> that

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
then you're going to want to block that

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.460 
then you're going to want to block that
off<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:06.370> those<00:03:06.580> don't<00:03:06.610> touch<00:03:07.230> then<00:03:08.230> just

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
off so those don't touch then just

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.290 
off so those don't touch then just
connect<00:03:08.770> this<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.340> also<00:03:09.490> you're<00:03:10.090> going<00:03:10.150> to

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
connect this and also you're going to

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.570 
connect this and also you're going to
want<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.630> add<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:11.140> repeater<00:03:11.980> in<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.220> middle<00:03:12.460> of

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
want to add a repeater in the middle of

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.310 
want to add a repeater in the middle of
this<00:03:12.790> that's<00:03:13.240> going<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.720> way<00:03:13.900> because<00:03:14.140> the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
this that's going that way because the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.780 
this that's going that way because the
power<00:03:14.500> will<00:03:14.710> be<00:03:14.740> coming<00:03:15.010> from<00:03:15.220> over<00:03:15.400> there<00:03:15.430> and

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
power will be coming from over there and

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.020 
power will be coming from over there and
set<00:03:16.570> that<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.900> two<00:03:17.080> so<00:03:17.620> net<00:03:18.490> now<00:03:18.820> you're<00:03:19.000> just

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
set that to two so net now you're just

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.250 
set that to two so net now you're just
going<00:03:19.240> to<00:03:19.300> want<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.510> do<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.720> other<00:03:19.840> side<00:03:20.050> and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
going to want to do the other side and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.520 
going to want to do the other side and
continue<00:03:20.709> doing<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.130> until<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.520> have<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:21.910> or

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
continue doing this until you have it or

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:33.149 
continue doing this until you have it or
till<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.620> have<00:03:23.740> it<00:03:23.830> done<00:03:24.209> but<00:03:28.770> set<00:03:29.770> it<00:03:29.890> to<00:03:30.010> four

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.899 

close<00:03:34.159> that<00:03:34.400> off<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:35.000> now<00:03:35.959> here's<00:03:36.379> where<00:03:36.909> you

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
close that off and now here's where you

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.100 
close that off and now here's where you
have<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.209> pay<00:03:38.659> attention<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:39.409> lot<00:03:40.220> more<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:41.110> you

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
have to pay attention a lot more and you

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.690 
have to pay attention a lot more and you
can't<00:03:42.319> just<00:03:42.470> connect<00:03:42.799> that<00:03:43.040> redstone<00:03:43.400> to

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
can't just connect that redstone to

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.220 
can't just connect that redstone to
there<00:03:43.879> because<00:03:44.239> then<00:03:44.450> there<00:03:44.599> won't<00:03:44.780> be<00:03:44.840> a

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
there because then there won't be a

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.750 
there because then there won't be a
difference<00:03:45.739> and<00:03:46.010> then<00:03:46.129> those<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:46.610> will

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
difference and then those that you will

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.160 
difference and then those that you will
push<00:03:46.970> out<00:03:47.120> at<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.390> same<00:03:47.540> time<00:03:47.750> in<00:03:47.930> yoder's

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
push out at the same time in yoder's

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.539 
push out at the same time in yoder's
fall<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:48.799> what<00:03:48.920> you're<00:03:49.040> going<00:03:49.129> to<00:03:49.220> want<00:03:49.340> to<00:03:49.430> do

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
fall so what you're going to want to do

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.789 
fall so what you're going to want to do
is<00:03:49.760> put<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.390> redstone<00:03:50.599> repeater<00:03:51.079> there<00:03:51.349> set<00:03:51.680> it

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
is put a redstone repeater there set it

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.240 
is put a redstone repeater there set it
on<00:03:51.890> for<00:03:52.450> put<00:03:53.450> a<00:03:53.480> block<00:03:53.780> there<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.829> connect

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
on for put a block there and connect

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.250 
on for put a block there and connect
that<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:56.299> then<00:03:56.510> just<00:03:56.540> put<00:03:56.840> redstone<00:03:57.049> and

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
that and then just put redstone and

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.170 
that and then just put redstone and
connect<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.799> that<00:03:58.220> way<00:03:58.370> that<00:03:58.760> writes<00:03:59.000> on<00:03:59.150> the

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
connect it that way that writes on the

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.789 
connect it that way that writes on the
repeater<00:03:59.540> willpower<00:04:00.049> that<00:04:00.260> block<00:04:00.470> which<00:04:00.650> will

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
repeater willpower that block which will

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.559 
repeater willpower that block which will
power<00:04:00.980> that<00:04:01.159> and<00:04:01.430> it'll<00:04:01.640> go<00:04:01.819> over<00:04:01.970> there<00:04:02.209> so

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
power that and it'll go over there so

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.369 
power that and it'll go over there so
there<00:04:03.319> you<00:04:03.409> go<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:04.040> have<00:04:04.610> that<00:04:04.819> done<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.420> just

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
there you go you have that done and just

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.250 
there you go you have that done and just
get<00:04:06.829> a<00:04:07.010> lever<00:04:07.370> or<00:04:08.299> where<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.900> could<00:04:09.079> get<00:04:09.200> a

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
get a lever or where you could get a

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.930 
get a lever or where you could get a
redstone<00:04:09.829> torch<00:04:09.980> if<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:10.459> want<00:04:10.640> but<00:04:10.790> I'm<00:04:10.879> just

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
redstone torch if you want but I'm just

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.150 
redstone torch if you want but I'm just
going<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.150> use<00:04:11.299> the<00:04:11.329> lever<00:04:11.629> I<00:04:12.459> also<00:04:13.459> connect

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
going to use the lever I also connect

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.650 
going to use the lever I also connect
connect<00:04:16.160> it<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.609> one<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:17.120> one<00:04:17.359> that's

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
connect it to that one the one that's

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.480 
connect it to that one the one that's
opposite<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.320> your<00:04:18.979> lowest<00:04:19.810> piston<00:04:20.810> so<00:04:21.769> and

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
opposite of your lowest piston so and

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.570 
opposite of your lowest piston so and
then<00:04:22.850> you<00:04:23.060> can<00:04:23.210> get<00:04:23.389> a<00:04:23.600> lever<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.580> sit

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
then you can get a lever and sit

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.350 
then you can get a lever and sit
somewhat<00:04:26.539> in<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.690> middle<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.850> see<00:04:28.850> if<00:04:29.000> mine

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
somewhat in the middle and see if mine

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.010 
somewhat in the middle and see if mine
didn't<00:04:29.630> work<00:04:29.840> so

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.520 

just<00:04:34.770> kind<00:04:35.069> of<00:04:35.129> trial<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.699> error<00:04:35.879> and<00:04:36.530> I'm

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
just kind of trial and error and I'm

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.969 
just kind of trial and error and I'm
gonna<00:04:37.740> go<00:04:37.830> see<00:04:38.039> why<00:04:38.250> it<00:04:38.310> didn't<00:04:38.639> work<00:04:38.669> and<00:04:39.979> it

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
gonna go see why it didn't work and it

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.460 
gonna go see why it didn't work and it
looks<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.789> be<00:04:41.970> sometimes<00:04:42.810> you'll<00:04:43.050> have<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.349> do

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
looks to be sometimes you'll have to do

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.140 
looks to be sometimes you'll have to do
this<00:04:43.620> extra<00:04:43.979> stuff<00:04:44.159> and<00:04:44.400> sometimes<00:04:44.610> you<00:04:44.909> want

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
this extra stuff and sometimes you want

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.939 
this extra stuff and sometimes you want
is<00:04:45.470> just<00:04:46.470> put<00:04:47.069> a<00:04:47.810> piston<00:04:48.810> right<00:04:49.020> there<00:04:49.229> alright

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
is just put a piston right there alright

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.499 
is just put a piston right there alright
not<00:04:50.069> a<00:04:50.099> piston<00:04:50.520> but<00:04:50.669> I<00:04:50.699> redstone<00:04:51.210> repeater

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
not a piston but I redstone repeater

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:52.999 
not a piston but I redstone repeater
right<00:04:51.690> there<00:04:51.900> then<00:04:52.110> set<00:04:52.319> that<00:04:52.500> one<00:04:52.620> two<00:04:52.770> three

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
right there then set that one two three

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.300 
right there then set that one two three
instead<00:04:53.310> of<00:04:53.370> two<00:04:53.460> and<00:04:54.169> it<00:04:55.169> should<00:04:55.409> work<00:04:55.560> for

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
instead of two and it should work for

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.180 
instead of two and it should work for
some<00:04:56.490> reason<00:04:56.819> sometimes<00:04:57.319> it<00:04:58.319> needs<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:59.069> little

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
some reason sometimes it needs a little

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.969 
some reason sometimes it needs a little
bit<00:04:59.430> more<00:04:59.580> offsetting<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:00.960> yeah<00:05:01.349> there<00:05:01.710> you<00:05:01.860> go

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
bit more offsetting so yeah there you go

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.300 
bit more offsetting so yeah there you go
that's<00:05:02.340> part<00:05:02.669> one<00:05:02.699> and<00:05:03.379> for<00:05:04.379> part<00:05:04.620> two<00:05:04.800> if<00:05:05.069> you

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
that's part one and for part two if you

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.550 
that's part one and for part two if you
want<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.639> simple<00:05:06.030> way<00:05:06.150> where<00:05:06.419> you<00:05:06.509> just<00:05:06.659> go<00:05:07.349> up

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
want the simple way where you just go up

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.600 
want the simple way where you just go up
and<00:05:07.830> then<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:09.060> jump<00:05:09.360> into<00:05:09.539> some<00:05:09.870> water<00:05:10.110> I<00:05:10.610> mean

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610
