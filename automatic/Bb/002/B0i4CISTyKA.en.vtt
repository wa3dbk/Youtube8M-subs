the rotten areas in the case so that it

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.250 
the rotten areas in the case so that it
not<00:01:25.980> continue<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.640> rot<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.450> definitely<00:01:27.870> cover

the actually covered a house with my

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.150 
the actually covered a house with my
back<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.570> then<00:01:30.900> creates<00:01:31.350> manifold<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
back and then creates manifold and

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.969 
back and then creates manifold and
siding<00:01:32.670> okay<00:01:33.090> now

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
siding okay now

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.130 
siding okay now
why'd<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:35.579> go<00:01:35.939> over<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> whips<00:01:36.539> and<00:01:36.719> whips<00:01:36.960> I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
why'd we go over a whips and whips I

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.490 
why'd we go over a whips and whips I
back<00:01:37.380> because<00:01:38.189> vinyl<00:01:38.700> siding<00:01:39.180> alone<00:01:39.479> will<00:01:40.289> not

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
back because vinyl siding alone will not

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.410 
back because vinyl siding alone will not
keep<00:01:40.890> water<00:01:41.340> from<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:43.110> shibi<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.829> your<00:01:44.039> home

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
if you hook them on a panel of siding

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.529 
if you hook them on a panel of siding
there's<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.640> weep<00:01:47.939> hole

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
there's a weep hole

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.230 
there's a weep hole
okay<00:01:48.990> why<00:01:49.560> because<00:01:49.979> siding<00:01:50.670> will<00:01:50.880> take<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
and the vinyl is a non-permeable product

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.279 
and the vinyl is a non-permeable product
and<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.450> moisture<00:02:03.810> needs<00:02:03.990> somewhere<00:02:04.229> to

over the years so I suggest to look at

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.970 
over the years so I suggest to look at
the<00:02:20.370> very<00:02:20.579> least<00:02:20.790> let's<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.510> tie<00:02:22.079> back<00:02:22.290> over

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
the very least let's the tie back over

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.160 
the very least let's the tie back over

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
the existing wood

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.870 
the existing wood

stuck<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.500> next<00:02:50.069> time<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.430> look<00:02:50.549> at<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.760> panel

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
stuck so next time you look at a panel

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.030 
stuck so next time you look at a panel
you'll<00:02:51.390> see<00:02:51.420> as<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:51.750> pose<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.409> underneath

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
you'll see as we pose it underneath

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.039 
you'll see as we pose it underneath
there<00:02:53.370> because<00:02:53.700> we<00:02:53.849> do<00:02:54.030> get<00:02:54.239> water<00:02:54.510> behind<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
there because we do get water behind the

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.619 
there because we do get water behind the
side<00:02:55.230> but<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.980> tie-back<00:02:56.430> eliminates<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
side but the tie-back eliminates the

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.390 
side but the tie-back eliminates the
chance<00:02:59.390> eliminates<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.959> chance<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.409> water

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
chance eliminates the chance of water

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.770 
chance eliminates the chance of water
getting<00:03:02.760> behind<00:03:03.379> the<00:03:04.379> siding<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.099> on
