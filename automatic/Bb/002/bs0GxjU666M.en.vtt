00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 speaks guys welcome to another 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.000
 precious written here on the channel 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.639
 show registration configuration rafael 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.550
 lamb to the number 181 only let's go 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.259
 take a look and spc here is very good 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.120
 the first image we have an overview 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.130
 of all internal components and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.170
 also the arrangement of carlos freitas and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.240
 his office that he has no room in 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.699
 pass through the cables at the back and 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.750
 this greatly damages what the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.449
 Your mother's milk is a gigabyte. 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.420
 970 to ds3 see the calm and bull's- eye 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.390
 by the line processors if it f 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.120
 is using the 8320 processor 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.530
 hollow processor that has performance 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.050
 very good and he is using a 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.809
 dissipation to spoon of the spoon more than 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.270
 the model 6 to 1 120 and see that in sharing 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.270
 of memories we have there the draw of 4 gb 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.219
 color model serve day 10 in your 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.960
 cabinet that has a general action in 10 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.180
 Drawer format that this is a thing 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.520
 good but no use of anything that people 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.149
 do not have the wiring to the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.489
 source 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.020
 in case it has a 500gb hd of 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:10.080
 following video card is a gtx 760 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.030
 bny model many people ask me if 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.220
 penicillin is a good brand and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.140
 answering to you, that 's it guys 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.229
 has this feature of placing and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.210
 constipation and reference video cards 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.490
 and is therefore a bit cheaper than 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.710
 too since it does not have a system here 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.659
 refrigeration technology, which makes it 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.579
 with which the video card that is priced 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.100
 higher but even so in comparison 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.720
 with models of other brands you do not 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.070
 you will notice a difference so great 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.759
 performance 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.490
 the source is a subject to take tr2 of 600 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.700
 lots it does not have 80 plus but it's a 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.040
 source of the program is that the cables are not 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.259
 ears of that protective mesh 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.340
 this makes the appearance of the tc not 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.500
 be so good 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.020
 in fact there are better models 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.140
 of thermaltake and what is worth more 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.479
 finally the cabinet is a theme take 19 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.399
 black edition cabinet that is well priced 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.950
 but for being a model a little old 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.619
 he ends up sinning in some part of the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.110
 time management was not the 12 photos and 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.090
 picking up cabinet everyone was putting 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.020
 some photos with china internet in that 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.970
 model he 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.580
 even a good cabinet has the airflow 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.290
 very good and supports and configurations as well 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.510
 but the fact that it has not 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.220
 support for choosing source cables 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.170
 makes him a not-so-large office 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.180
 recommended there are others in the same 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.850
 price range that has a cost 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.530
 benefit better then this is it guys 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.540
 I hope you have enjoyed it more 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.700
 a channel video whether you liked it or not 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.530
 forget to leave it there and down here to 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.260
 to be able to help spread a hug to 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.260
 all and until the next video was worth it and went
