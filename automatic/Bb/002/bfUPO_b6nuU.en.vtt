Mike I think a lot of people understand

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.209 
Mike I think a lot of people understand
that<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.670> can<00:00:11.820> mold<00:00:12.030> plastics<00:00:12.900> by<00:00:13.219> injecting

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
that you can mold plastics by injecting

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.700 
that you can mold plastics by injecting
them<00:00:14.429> into<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.730> mold<00:00:15.000> I'm<00:00:15.630> not<00:00:15.839> sure<00:00:16.109> as<00:00:16.410> many

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
them into a mold I'm not sure as many

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.019 
them into a mold I'm not sure as many
people<00:00:17.039> understand<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.550> can<00:00:17.670> do<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.910> with

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
people understand you can do that with

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.519 
people understand you can do that with
metals<00:00:18.420> can<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.840> tell<00:00:19.020> us<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.260> little<00:00:19.289> bit

basically<00:00:47.340> how<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> process<00:00:48.149> works<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.629> what

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
basically how the process works is what

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.420 
basically how the process works is what
we've<00:00:48.930> done<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.320> we've<00:00:49.800> taken<00:00:49.980> one<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.280> our

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
we've done is we've taken one of our

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.400 
we've done is we've taken one of our
stock<00:00:50.700> eights<00:00:50.969> dinah<00:00:51.360> cast<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.780> two<00:00:51.840> machines

run<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> tool<00:00:53.340> very<00:00:53.579> similar<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> one

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
run on a tool very similar to the one

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.410 
run on a tool very similar to the one
you<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.570> front<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:56.149> modified<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
you see in front of you and modified it

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.840 
you see in front of you and modified it
to<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:58.020> able<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.320> inject<00:00:59.100> those<00:00:59.399> different

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
to be able to inject those different

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.580 
to be able to inject those different
types<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.180> metals<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.050> how<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.350> process

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
types of metals so how that process

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.450 
types of metals so how that process
works<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.850> inject<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> metal<00:01:03.510> into<00:01:03.660> two

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
works is we inject the metal into two

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.190 
works is we inject the metal into two
into<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> tool<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.479> will<00:01:06.510> come<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
into the tool and it will come out and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.929 
into the tool and it will come out and
it<00:01:07.290> will<00:01:07.409> look<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it will look like this and this is a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.149 
it will look like this and this is a
very<00:01:09.180> brittle<00:01:09.570> part<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.080> what<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.860> this

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
very brittle part and what this is this

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.539 
very brittle part and what this is this
is<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.310> combination<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.150> stainless<00:01:12.510> steel<00:01:13.549> some

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
is a combination of stainless steel some

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.830 
is a combination of stainless steel some
different<00:01:14.880> waxes<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.450> some<00:01:15.570> different

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
different waxes and some different

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.510 
different waxes and some different
binders<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.290> hold<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.590> all<00:01:16.710> together<00:01:16.860> from

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
binders that hold it all together from

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.280 
binders that hold it all together from
there<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.820> goes<00:01:17.939> into<00:01:18.000> an<00:01:18.360> oven<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.780> it's

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
there it goes into an oven and it's

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.080 
there it goes into an oven and it's
cooked<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.830> what<00:01:20.250> that'll<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.060> will

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
cooked and what that'll do is that will

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.940 
cooked and what that'll do is that will
remove<00:01:21.420> all<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> binder<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.320> you'll<00:01:22.710> end<00:01:22.860> up

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
remove all the binder and you'll end up

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.310 
remove all the binder and you'll end up
with<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.159> finished<00:01:23.369> part<00:01:23.790> that's<00:01:24.119> about<00:01:24.479> 17%

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
with a finished part that's about 17%

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.520 
with a finished part that's about 17%
smaller<00:01:25.890> than<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.850> original<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> big

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
smaller than the original now the big

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.080 
smaller than the original now the big
advantage<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.579> what<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:30.000> do

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
advantage to this and what we can do

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.850 
advantage to this and what we can do
that<00:01:30.270> other<00:01:30.390> metal<00:01:30.689> injection<00:01:30.810> molds<00:01:31.380> cannot

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
that other metal injection molds cannot

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.310 
that other metal injection molds cannot
is<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.340> cast<00:01:32.670> much<00:01:33.210> more<00:01:33.479> complex<00:01:33.990> shapes

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
is we can cast much more complex shapes

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.530 
is we can cast much more complex shapes
by<00:01:34.770> utilizing<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> four<00:01:35.610> side<00:01:35.820> technology

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
by utilizing the four side technology

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.940 
by utilizing the four side technology
rather<00:01:36.750> than<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.140> having<00:01:37.439> an<00:01:37.500> open<00:01:37.740> closed

utilize our in-house tooling we're gonna

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.860 
utilize our in-house tooling we're gonna
be<00:03:00.980> able<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.220> keep<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.549> tool<00:03:01.730> costs<00:03:02.120> down<00:03:02.299> but

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
be able to keep the tool costs down but

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.300 
be able to keep the tool costs down but
the<00:03:02.989> part<00:03:03.170> price<00:03:03.349> is<00:03:03.500> gonna<00:03:03.680> be<00:03:03.799> a<00:03:03.830> little<00:03:04.099> bit

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
the part price is gonna be a little bit

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.740 
the part price is gonna be a little bit
higher<00:03:04.489> than<00:03:04.730> zinc<00:03:05.000> but<00:03:05.150> that's<00:03:05.299> kind<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.630> what

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
higher than zinc but that's kind of what

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.240 
higher than zinc but that's kind of what
goes<00:03:05.900> with<00:03:06.170> getting<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.650> better<00:03:06.890> strength

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
goes with getting that better strength

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.039
