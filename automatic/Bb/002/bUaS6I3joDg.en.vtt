00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
crew and as you can see no matter how

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.870 
crew and as you can see no matter how
hard<00:00:16.910> we<00:00:17.030> try<00:00:17.150> it<00:00:17.810> just<00:00:17.870> doesn't<00:00:18.740> work<00:00:18.860> so<00:00:19.700> what

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
hard we try it just doesn't work so what

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.760 
hard we try it just doesn't work so what
we<00:00:20.000> have<00:00:20.150> to<00:00:20.180> do<00:00:20.390> is<00:00:20.420> flick<00:00:20.960> this<00:00:21.140> lever<00:00:21.500> and

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
we have to do is flick this lever and

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.580 
we have to do is flick this lever and
now<00:00:22.610> the<00:00:22.670> door<00:00:22.910> opens<00:00:23.300> and<00:00:23.570> you<00:00:24.260> can<00:00:24.380> walk

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
now the door opens and you can walk

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.090 
now the door opens and you can walk
through<00:00:25.420> so<00:00:26.420> how<00:00:26.690> does<00:00:26.750> this<00:00:26.930> work<00:00:27.320> what<00:00:28.010> you

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
through so how does this work what you

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.939 
through so how does this work what you
have<00:00:28.310> here<00:00:28.340> is<00:00:28.880> a<00:00:29.060> carpet<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:29.960> under<00:00:30.800> the

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
have here is a carpet and under the

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.350 
have here is a carpet and under the
carpet<00:00:31.220> if<00:00:31.340> you<00:00:31.400> have<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:31.880> fence<00:00:33.970> so<00:00:34.970> if<00:00:35.239> you

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
carpet if you have a fence so if you

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.450 
carpet if you have a fence so if you
actually<00:00:35.510> remove<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.200> carpet<00:00:36.590> as<00:00:36.829> you<00:00:37.340> can

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
actually remove the carpet as you can

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.430 
actually remove the carpet as you can
see<00:00:37.610> right<00:00:37.640> now<00:00:37.820> under<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.329> book<00:00:38.720> and<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.290> can

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
see right now under the book and you can

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.100 
see right now under the book and you can
walk<00:00:39.649> through<00:00:40.000> but<00:00:41.000> if<00:00:41.239> you<00:00:41.300> flick<00:00:41.720> the<00:00:41.750> lever

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
walk through but if you flick the lever

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:51.040 
walk through but if you flick the lever
it<00:00:42.890> switches<00:00:43.430> viva<00:00:43.880> offense<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:49.450> as<00:00:50.450> you<00:00:50.899> can

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
it switches viva offense and as you can

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.260 
it switches viva offense and as you can
see<00:00:51.079> from<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:51.860> top<00:00:52.100> there<00:00:52.460> is<00:00:52.579> no<00:00:52.760> difference

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
see from the top there is no difference

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.190 
see from the top there is no difference
but<00:00:54.140> if<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:54.860> walk<00:00:55.070> over<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:56.000> fence<00:00:56.270> we

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
but if you walk over the fence we

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.740 
but if you walk over the fence we
actually<00:00:57.500> step<00:00:58.130> zero<00:00:58.610> point<00:00:58.910> five<00:00:59.120> blocks<00:00:59.450> up

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
actually step zero point five blocks up

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.160 
actually step zero point five blocks up
I<00:01:02.739> also<00:01:03.739> have<00:01:04.100> this<00:01:04.339> design<00:01:04.670> here<00:01:05.149> and<00:01:05.389> the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
I also have this design here and the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.830 
I also have this design here and the
difference<00:01:06.619> between<00:01:06.799> those<00:01:07.189> designs<00:01:07.729> is<00:01:08.119> the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
difference between those designs is the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.410 
difference between those designs is the
red<00:01:09.020> stone<00:01:09.289> for<00:01:09.740> this<00:01:09.889> design<00:01:10.249> is<00:01:10.549> right<00:01:10.999> here

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
red stone for this design is right here

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.539 
red stone for this design is right here
while<00:01:12.139> the<00:01:12.409> red<00:01:12.560> stone<00:01:12.770> for<00:01:13.009> this<00:01:13.189> design<00:01:13.490> is

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
while the red stone for this design is

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.469 
while the red stone for this design is
hidden<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.950> this<00:01:15.950> design<00:01:16.069> also<00:01:16.459> works<00:01:17.029> as<00:01:17.420> you

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
hidden and this design also works as you

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.999 
hidden and this design also works as you
can<00:01:17.869> see<00:01:22.240> I'm<00:01:23.240> before<00:01:23.630> I<00:01:23.659> move<00:01:23.840> on<00:01:23.899> Cicero<00:01:24.499> I'd

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
can see I'm before I move on Cicero I'd

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.739 
can see I'm before I move on Cicero I'd

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
online point sink in suits ooh

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.900 
online point sink in suits ooh
directions<00:02:11.240> in<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.110> here<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.680> here

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
directions in so here and here

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.010 
directions in so here and here
and<00:02:15.160> as<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.640> can<00:02:16.820> see<00:02:16.850> this<00:02:17.390> piston<00:02:17.870> is

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
and as you can see this piston is

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.660 
and as you can see this piston is
powered<00:02:18.410> twice<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:20.600> why<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:25.160> if<00:02:25.400> we

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
powered twice so why is that so if we

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.750 
powered twice so why is that so if we
activate<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.360> as<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:27.440> can<00:02:27.620> see<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:28.310> piston

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
activate it as you can see this piston

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.850 
activate it as you can see this piston
is<00:02:28.940> powered<00:02:29.390> but<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.960> is<00:02:30.080> not<00:02:30.290> pushing<00:02:30.590> the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
is powered but it is not pushing the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.680 
is powered but it is not pushing the
block<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:32.030> reason<00:02:32.240> for<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.540> because

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
block and the reason for that is because

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.590 
block and the reason for that is because
this<00:02:33.410> piston<00:02:33.920> was<00:02:34.130> extended<00:02:35.000> while<00:02:35.390> this

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
this piston was extended while this

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.380 
this piston was extended while this
piston<00:02:35.990> was<00:02:36.110> actuated<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.550> now<00:02:37.760> it's<00:02:38.000> update

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
piston was actuated so now it's update

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.680 
piston was actuated so now it's update
the<00:02:38.510> piston<00:02:38.900> for<00:02:39.140> it<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.380> extend<00:02:40.330> so<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.660> is

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
the piston for it to extend so this is

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.220 
the piston for it to extend so this is
why<00:02:41.990> I<00:02:42.020> actually<00:02:42.320> have<00:02:42.890> two<00:02:43.460> redstone<00:02:43.820> buyers

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.450 

headin<00:02:48.230> right<00:02:48.320> right<00:02:48.650> now<00:02:48.860> as<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.130> can<00:02:49.250> see

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
headin right right now as you can see

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.240 
headin right right now as you can see
this<00:02:49.670> power<00:02:49.970> button<00:02:50.870> it's<00:02:50.990> updated<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.860> this

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
this power button it's updated and this

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.580 
this power button it's updated and this
is<00:02:52.400> what<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.760> wires<00:02:53.060> for<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:54.140> rationale

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
is what this wires for this rationale

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.980 
is what this wires for this rationale
here<00:02:54.620> when<00:02:55.100> actuated<00:02:55.550> updates<00:02:56.330> this<00:02:56.510> piston

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
here when actuated updates this piston

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.080 
here when actuated updates this piston
and<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.470> extends<00:03:00.010> right<00:03:01.010> so<00:03:01.280> now<00:03:01.460> you<00:03:01.520> can<00:03:01.760> do

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
and it extends right so now you can do

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.770 
and it extends right so now you can do
this<00:03:02.330> from<00:03:03.260> here<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:03.830> is<00:03:04.010> pretty<00:03:04.250> simple<00:03:04.780> so

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
this from here it is pretty simple so

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.520 
this from here it is pretty simple so
just<00:03:06.200> copy<00:03:06.410> this<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:10.930> after<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.050> copy<00:03:12.290> it

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
just copy this and after you copy it

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.150 
just copy this and after you copy it
this<00:03:13.190> just<00:03:13.970> cover<00:03:14.300> this<00:03:15.110> redstone<00:03:15.500> here<00:03:15.920> and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
this just cover this redstone here and

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.750 
this just cover this redstone here and
this<00:03:16.280> torch<00:03:16.610> and<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.840> should<00:03:18.020> be<00:03:18.140> done

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.670 

alright<00:03:21.760> so<00:03:22.150> now<00:03:22.329> let's<00:03:22.510> move<00:03:22.599> on<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.840> this

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
alright so now let's move on to this

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.300 
alright so now let's move on to this
design<00:03:25.230> well<00:03:26.230> there's<00:03:26.560> not<00:03:26.829> really<00:03:27.040> much<00:03:27.250> to

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
design well there's not really much to

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.470 
design well there's not really much to
say<00:03:27.579> about<00:03:27.909> it<00:03:31.049> this<00:03:32.049> is<00:03:32.200> just<00:03:32.489> our<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:34.060> redstone

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
say about it this is just our a redstone

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.440 
say about it this is just our a redstone
torch<00:03:34.719> on<00:03:35.170> one<00:03:35.349> side<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:37.000> sticky<00:03:37.299> piston

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
torch on one side and a sticky piston

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.959 
torch on one side and a sticky piston
before<00:03:37.719> essenbach<00:03:38.319> on<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.620> other<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:39.099> that's

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:39.969 
before essenbach on the other and that's

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.349 
before essenbach on the other and that's
how<00:03:40.239> it<00:03:40.359> works<00:03:41.159> so<00:03:42.159> you<00:03:42.609> can<00:03:42.790> copy<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.120> right

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
how it works so you can copy it right

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.140 
how it works so you can copy it right
now<00:03:43.599> and<00:03:43.840> since<00:03:44.379> it's<00:03:44.650> one<00:03:45.099> white<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:45.700> don't<00:03:46.060> do

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
now and since it's one white I don't do

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.580 
now and since it's one white I don't do
you<00:03:46.239> need<00:03:46.389> to<00:03:46.540> bed<00:03:46.689> store<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.049> can<00:03:47.319> just<00:03:47.469> copy

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
you need to bed store you can just copy

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.100 
you need to bed store you can just copy
it<00:03:47.680> from<00:03:47.829> this

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.230 

alright<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:53.070> now<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:53.580> you've<00:03:53.760> copied<00:03:53.970> this

alright so now that you've copied this

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.530 
alright so now that you've copied this
design<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:55.070> think<00:03:56.070> it's<00:03:56.340> yeah<00:03:57.000> i<00:03:57.030> think<00:03:57.270> it's
