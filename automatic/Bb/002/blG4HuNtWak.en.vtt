 hi to all and clean nice judo on 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.599
 a terroir so I will explain 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.049
 how to use and download likes 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.389
 waiters so I 'm doing my next game 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.940
 everything about plugin jack must that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.000
 I also learn because I know 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.650
 discovered last night 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.130
 it allows to create a server like you 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.949
 leaves but lighter for pc in 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.689
 foam at least used that because I 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.110
 I'm pretty impressed because I like 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.960
 the c ++ wii mc soap is written in c ++ 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.050
 so we wonder why it's light 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.000
 so to download a little knowledge 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.129
 you go on clues to 11 points 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.969

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:45.700
 so after you have the pipe line 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.950
 here the mind over the proto poxy I said 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.390
 all this but I know nothing I do not know 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.740
 I still have not searched everywhere 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:00.670
 what I intend to do right after this 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:02.500
 video so yeah new records so 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.030
 you can read in the description if 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.030
 you want me to do rather on the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.970
 creating safe zones creating a 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.569
 manager on creating a site on the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.390
 creation 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.159
 I know later because it is necessary that 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.379
 I learn a little more the garden 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:25.189
 and the c ++ because I risk doing 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:28.189
 one of two on plugin creation in 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.930
 hi law i'm going to take it soon 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:34.670
 because I discovered even that's it 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:40.430
 go so I have not seen at all 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.840
 sure that's why I say all this 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.709
 are some plugins that are charles 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.709
 interior magic carpet it marks chic 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.069
 I will take everything he put in a 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.340
 10 years have created a record is then 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.870
 you extract everything in the folder 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.870
 then you open soul his servers 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.729
 done execute 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:19.909
 it's not ready no virus here it is 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:23.900
 already open it's over never seen something 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.850
 as fast as that after I remember 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.950
 than 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.540
 mc know it's more for a server 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:36.640
 test for the time out test 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:38.410

 here we do not care we connect after 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:11.140
 at the beginning the server connection you 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:14.050

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:19.580
