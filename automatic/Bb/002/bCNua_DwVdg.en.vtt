00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.550
 and whoever has a drinking fountain, the water filter in 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.500
 house you have to clean the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.400
 filter holds all bacteria and 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.809
 dirt 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.120
 that is all that is unfit for the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.310
 consumer see then as reporter eduardo 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.490
 even though you can do this yourself 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.789
 cleaning at home you trust the quality 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.039
 the water it consumes every day even 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.840
 that the water seems clean, it must 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.449
 each part of the filters and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.550
 purifiers are cleaned properly 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.719
 to kill microorganisms and 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.090
 bacteria 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.829
 looks at the importance being made that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.930
 we buy a filter a purifier 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.640
 for the improvement of water 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.730
 so this way we 're worrying 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.050
 with hygiene because it is proliferation 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.390
 of bacteria 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.860
 besides the water cooler itself, too, 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.570
 uses a water cooler this summer to 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.160
 have cold water, right? 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.890
 think it was made without hygiene 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.840
 as in summer the thirst is greater than 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.730
 number of times the filter is 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.859
 Handling is also greater 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.769
 ideally, your drinking fountain filter 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.820
 be cleaned every two months as you use it 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.210
 greater not 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.360
 so it happens is the dirt comes with 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.950
 sure and not only in the summer of course 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.210
 increases a little but this is important 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 do even in winter and sometimes people 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.290
 forget about it 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.270
 It was in winter autumn - water but the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.490
 dirt she will continue on the team to 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.350
 that the water coming out of your filter is 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.509
 always of quality is important 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.439
 clean each of the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.540
 parts 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.030
 the manager gives us some tips for 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.979
 correct maintenance of filters 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.200
 first with the empty filter 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.329
 disassemble each part 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.720
 the refills should be cleaned only with 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.610
 water here does not need soap then 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.860
 for the internal parts you can 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.680
 use neutral detergent to sponge 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.110
 softly to clean the mixer in 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.509
 2 liters of water and neutral detergent with 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.310
 a few drops of bleach to 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.310
 mixture can be made with warm water 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.229
 which will speed up the cleaning process 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.600
 pour this mixture into the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.000
 then open all filter taps 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.799
 to drain the water with the soap of 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.090
 can also be cleaned with 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.640
 soft sponge 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.080
 after running water with soap repeat 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.090
 the process with water 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.520
 so that inside your drinking fountain 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.800
 stay just water, these steps will go 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.310
 water of the highest quality in the 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.310
 your summer
