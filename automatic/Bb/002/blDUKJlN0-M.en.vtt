with<00:01:59.020> started<00:02:00.020> goofing<00:02:00.140> around<00:02:00.319> with<00:02:00.590> the

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
with started goofing around with the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.249 
with started goofing around with the
front<00:02:00.920> here<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.780> foremostly<00:02:02.780> all<00:02:02.959> that<00:02:03.110> do

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
front here and foremostly all that do

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.749 
front here and foremostly all that do
build<00:02:03.500> these<00:02:03.679> you<00:02:03.890> kind<00:02:04.069> of<00:02:04.220> noticed<00:02:04.520> this

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
build these you kind of noticed this

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.320 
build these you kind of noticed this
isn't<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.479> way<00:02:05.630> they<00:02:05.840> come<00:02:06.520> what<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.550> did<00:02:07.819> was<00:02:08.030> I

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
isn't the way they come what I did was I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.419 
isn't the way they come what I did was I
just<00:02:08.390> took<00:02:08.599> off<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.530> motor<00:02:09.770> plate<00:02:09.979> for<00:02:10.280> right

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
just took off the motor plate for right

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.270 
just took off the motor plate for right
now<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:11.500> was<00:02:12.500> working<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.010> front

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
now and was working on this front

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.220 
now and was working on this front
suspension<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.910> know<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.090> can<00:02:14.360> find<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.750> 5/8

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
suspension I know I can find the 5/8

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.309 
suspension I know I can find the 5/8
inch<00:02:15.849> hub<00:02:16.849> bearings<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.450> go<00:02:17.569> on<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.810> front<00:02:18.020> of

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
inch hub bearings to go on the front of

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.910 
inch hub bearings to go on the front of
the<00:02:18.470> stock<00:02:18.739> spindles<00:02:19.280> but<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:21.200> this<00:02:21.650> front

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
the stock spindles but the this front

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.680 
the stock spindles but the this front
end<00:02:22.040> kind<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.310> sat<00:02:22.580> way<00:02:22.790> too<00:02:22.849> high<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.540> the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
end kind of sat way too high and the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.300 
end kind of sat way too high and the
reason<00:02:24.050> was<00:02:24.459> this<00:02:25.459> plate<00:02:25.760> right<00:02:25.940> here<00:02:26.300> I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
reason was this plate right here I

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.940 
reason was this plate right here I
trimmed<00:02:28.310> this<00:02:28.430> plate<00:02:28.870> because<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:30.650> plate

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
trimmed this plate because this plate

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.640 
trimmed this plate because this plate
you<00:02:31.100> got<00:02:31.690> this<00:02:32.690> piece<00:02:32.960> and<00:02:33.200> there's<00:02:33.350> another

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
you got this piece and there's another

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.130 
you got this piece and there's another
piece<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.160> goes<00:02:34.340> up<00:02:34.580> here<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:35.450> what<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.840> is

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
piece that goes up here and what that is

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.030 
piece that goes up here and what that is
is<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:37.450> right<00:02:38.450> there<00:02:38.750> NASA<00:02:39.290> actually<00:02:39.530> holds

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
is that right there NASA actually holds

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.700 
is that right there NASA actually holds
the<00:02:40.130> front<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.550> frame<00:02:40.790> together<00:02:41.710> then

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
the front of the frame together then

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.000 
the front of the frame together then
this<00:02:43.010> front<00:02:43.400> end<00:02:44.350> has<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.440> little<00:02:45.830> hole<00:02:45.980> right

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
this front end has a little hole right

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.630 
this front end has a little hole right
here<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:47.210> kind<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.510> centered<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:47.960> up<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.710> I

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
here that kind of centered it up and I

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.280 
here that kind of centered it up and I
just<00:02:49.850> didn't<00:02:50.090> like<00:02:50.150> how<00:02:50.540> far<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:50.990> sat

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
just didn't like how far this sat

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.840 
just didn't like how far this sat
towards<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.740> ground<00:02:51.920> they<00:02:52.190> get<00:02:52.400> almost<00:02:52.700> sat

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
towards the ground they get almost sat

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.160 
towards the ground they get almost sat
on<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.210> ground<00:02:53.450> especially<00:02:53.720> where<00:02:54.050> they're

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
on the ground especially where they're

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.480 
on the ground especially where they're
gonna<00:02:54.260> be<00:02:54.440> with<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.590> little<00:02:54.650> racing<00:02:55.100> wheels<00:02:55.280> I'm

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
gonna be with a little racing wheels I'm

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.460 
gonna be with a little racing wheels I'm
putting<00:02:55.730> on<00:02:55.820> this<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.870> what<00:02:56.990> I<00:02:57.050> did<00:02:57.110> was<00:02:57.320> I<00:02:57.410> took

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
putting on this so what I did was I took

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.110 
putting on this so what I did was I took
this<00:02:57.770> plate<00:02:58.040> off<00:02:58.250> I'm<00:02:58.550> bolt<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.850> from<00:02:59.030> the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
this plate off I'm bolt it from the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.650 
this plate off I'm bolt it from the
frame<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.630> trimmed<00:03:00.020> it<00:03:00.970> then<00:03:01.970> if<00:03:02.300> you<00:03:02.390> notice

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
frame and trimmed it then if you notice

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.100 
frame and trimmed it then if you notice
the<00:03:02.810> little<00:03:03.020> hole<00:03:03.170> here<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:04.540> can<00:03:05.540> kind<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.900> show

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
the little hole here I can kind of show

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.690 
the little hole here I can kind of show
you<00:03:06.910> right<00:03:07.910> there<00:03:09.040> there's<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.160> little<00:03:10.250> nub

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
you right there there's a little nub

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.070 
you right there there's a little nub
that<00:03:10.910> sticks<00:03:11.180> out<00:03:11.300> on<00:03:11.420> both<00:03:11.600> sides<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.050> I

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
that sticks out on both sides and I

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.760 
that sticks out on both sides and I
guess<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:13.610> helps<00:03:13.910> Center<00:03:14.270> this<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.440> plate

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
guess it helps Center this to the plate

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.500 
guess it helps Center this to the plate
right<00:03:16.040> here<00:03:16.100> that<00:03:16.670> bolts<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.060> frame<00:03:17.330> together

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
right here that bolts the frame together

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.410 
right here that bolts the frame together
and<00:03:18.080> it<00:03:18.980> centers<00:03:19.370> it<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.880> that<00:03:20.090> piece<00:03:20.390> that

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
and it centers it to that piece that

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.550 
and it centers it to that piece that
holds<00:03:20.900> your<00:03:21.590> hood<00:03:22.310> on<00:03:22.780> well<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:24.050> just<00:03:24.140> took<00:03:24.500> a

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
holds your hood on well I just took a

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.860 
holds your hood on well I just took a
bunch<00:03:24.770> of<00:03:24.920> bolts<00:03:25.190> out<00:03:25.340> took<00:03:26.210> this<00:03:26.450> off<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.840> the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
bunch of bolts out took this off to the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.300 
bunch of bolts out took this off to the
side<00:03:26.960> for<00:03:27.350> right<00:03:27.440> now<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.920> what<00:03:28.130> I'm<00:03:28.280> doing

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
side for right now and what I'm doing

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.040 
side for right now and what I'm doing
right<00:03:28.760> now<00:03:28.820> on<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.330> is<00:03:29.540> going<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.810> be<00:03:29.870> working

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
right now on this is going to be working

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.100 
right now on this is going to be working
on<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.320> front<00:03:30.530> end<00:03:30.770> I<00:03:31.010> took<00:03:31.970> put<00:03:32.570> this<00:03:32.690> on<00:03:32.930> my

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
on the front end I took put this on my

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.790 
on the front end I took put this on my
vise<00:03:33.350> on<00:03:33.710> the<00:03:34.220> other<00:03:34.400> end<00:03:34.640> over<00:03:35.150> here<00:03:35.620> took<00:03:36.620> my

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
vise on the other end over here took my

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.280 
vise on the other end over here took my
flat<00:03:37.100> wheel<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.670> took<00:03:37.820> this<00:03:37.940> lip<00:03:38.270> off<00:03:38.480> by

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
flat wheel and took this lip off by

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.320 
flat wheel and took this lip off by
doing<00:03:39.650> that<00:03:39.740> it<00:03:39.980> enabled<00:03:40.340> me<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:43.030> basically<00:03:44.030> I

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
doing that it enabled me to basically I

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.350 
doing that it enabled me to basically I
can<00:03:44.600> take<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.500> weld<00:03:45.819> right<00:03:46.819> here<00:03:47.000> right<00:03:47.210> along

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
can take and weld right here right along

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.740 
can take and weld right here right along
this<00:03:47.660> seam<00:03:48.069> all<00:03:49.069> the<00:03:49.400> way<00:03:49.520> across<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.270> I<00:03:50.480> can

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
this seam all the way across and I can

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.290 
this seam all the way across and I can
weld<00:03:50.960> here<00:03:51.430> over<00:03:52.430> here<00:03:52.610> as<00:03:52.700> well<00:03:52.880> and<00:03:53.120> maybe

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
weld here over here as well and maybe

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.059 
weld here over here as well and maybe
from<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.660> back<00:03:53.870> side<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:54.440> basically<00:03:54.620> make

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
from the back side and basically make

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.910 
from the back side and basically make
this<00:03:55.600> this<00:03:56.600> will<00:03:56.810> become<00:03:57.140> a<00:03:57.170> rigid<00:03:57.560> part<00:03:57.830> of

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
this this will become a rigid part of

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.800 
this this will become a rigid part of
the<00:03:58.010> frame<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.580> this<00:03:58.940> it'll<00:03:59.150> be<00:03:59.240> will<00:03:59.660> be

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
the frame and this it'll be will be

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.920 
the frame and this it'll be will be
unbolted<00:04:00.200> from<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:02.120> three<00:04:02.360> bolts<00:04:02.690> here<00:04:02.840> on

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
unbolted from the three bolts here on

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.480 
unbolted from the three bolts here on
the<00:04:03.020> side<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:03.530> will<00:04:03.650> kind<00:04:03.830> of<00:04:04.010> keep<00:04:04.370> my

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
the side so it will kind of keep my

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.580 
the side so it will kind of keep my
front<00:04:04.790> end<00:04:04.940> together<00:04:05.060> not<00:04:05.990> really<00:04:06.230> building

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
front end together not really building

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.680 
front end together not really building
like<00:04:06.800> a<00:04:06.830> hot<00:04:07.069> dog<00:04:07.100> racer<00:04:07.700> just<00:04:08.030> basically<00:04:08.600> a

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
like a hot dog racer just basically a

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.180 
like a hot dog racer just basically a
yard<00:04:08.930> cart<00:04:10.000> you<00:04:11.000> know<00:04:11.030> whatnot<00:04:11.450> type<00:04:11.690> mower

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
yard cart you know whatnot type mower

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.590 
yard cart you know whatnot type mower
this<00:04:13.190> is<00:04:13.370> just<00:04:13.550> kind<00:04:13.819> of<00:04:13.850> an<00:04:13.970> intro<00:04:14.300> into<00:04:14.480> this

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
this is just kind of an intro into this

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.279 
this is just kind of an intro into this
project<00:04:14.950> kind<00:04:15.950> of<00:04:16.150> I<00:04:17.150> guess<00:04:17.569> keeping<00:04:17.989> a<00:04:18.079> video

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
project kind of I guess keeping a video

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.170 
project kind of I guess keeping a video
log<00:04:18.709> of<00:04:18.949> what<00:04:19.100> I'm<00:04:19.220> doing<00:04:19.549> or<00:04:19.699> how<00:04:19.850> I'm<00:04:20.000> gonna

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
log of what I'm doing or how I'm gonna

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.980 
log of what I'm doing or how I'm gonna
go<00:04:20.750> about<00:04:20.780> this<00:04:21.610> at<00:04:22.610> least<00:04:23.060> by<00:04:23.330> raising<00:04:23.630> this

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
go about this at least by raising this

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.559 
go about this at least by raising this
up<00:04:24.229> about<00:04:24.410> 3/4<00:04:24.949> inches<00:04:25.310> you<00:04:25.970> can<00:04:26.090> kind<00:04:26.330> of<00:04:26.389> see

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:26.569 
up about 3/4 inches you can kind of see

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.870 
up about 3/4 inches you can kind of see
it<00:04:26.690> gave<00:04:26.870> me<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.289> good<00:04:28.100> amount<00:04:28.310> of<00:04:28.460> clearance

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
it gave me a good amount of clearance

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.390 
it gave me a good amount of clearance
that's<00:04:29.389> just<00:04:29.630> a<00:04:29.720> tie<00:04:29.900> rod<00:04:30.139> give<00:04:31.009> me<00:04:31.130> a<00:04:31.190> little

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
that's just a tie rod give me a little

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.209 
that's just a tie rod give me a little
bit<00:04:31.550> of<00:04:31.639> clearance<00:04:31.970> up<00:04:32.150> here<00:04:32.620> raise<00:04:33.620> this<00:04:33.919> up

00:04:34.209 --> 00:04:34.219 
bit of clearance up here raise this up

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:36.659 
bit of clearance up here raise this up
so<00:04:34.490> it<00:04:34.610> kind<00:04:34.819> of<00:04:34.879> lowered<00:04:35.150> your<00:04:35.330> frame<00:04:35.599> down

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
so it kind of lowered your frame down

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.790 
so it kind of lowered your frame down
like<00:04:37.669> I<00:04:37.699> said<00:04:37.939> about<00:04:38.150> three<00:04:39.139> inches<00:04:39.529> is

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
like I said about three inches is

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.190 
like I said about three inches is
roughly<00:04:40.159> what<00:04:40.400> I<00:04:40.430> got<00:04:40.669> out<00:04:40.699> of<00:04:40.909> it<00:04:41.210> and

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
roughly what I got out of it and

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.050 
roughly what I got out of it and
instead<00:04:43.500> of<00:04:43.620> using<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.220> spindles<00:04:44.700> off<00:04:44.850> the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
instead of using the spindles off the

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.750 
instead of using the spindles off the
cart<00:04:45.360> off<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.990> go-kart<00:04:46.470> as<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.400> originally

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
cart off the go-kart as I originally

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.090 
cart off the go-kart as I originally
planned<00:04:47.910> on<00:04:48.180> trying<00:04:48.540> to<00:04:48.740> reconfigure<00:04:49.740> this

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
planned on trying to reconfigure this

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.970 
planned on trying to reconfigure this
and<00:04:50.370> just<00:04:50.520> put<00:04:50.730> them<00:04:50.820> straight<00:04:51.030> out<00:04:51.530> but<00:04:52.530> I

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
and just put them straight out but I

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.700 
and just put them straight out but I
just<00:04:53.580> said<00:04:53.970> hey<00:04:54.150> sometimes<00:04:54.480> as<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:54.840> factory<00:04:55.470> you

just said hey sometimes as a factory you
know<00:04:56.460> they're<00:04:56.760> not<00:04:56.880> that<00:04:56.940> bad<00:04:57.300> especially<00:04:57.690> not

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080

and figure out how I can run chain drive
all<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.940> way<00:05:26.970> back<00:05:27.170> to<00:05:28.170> my<00:05:28.350> axle<00:05:28.770> just<00:05:29.040> keep<00:05:29.190> it

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
all the way back to my axle just keep it

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.960 
all the way back to my axle just keep it
a<00:05:29.370> solid<00:05:29.580> live<00:05:29.880> axle<00:05:30.360> as<00:05:30.630> you<00:05:31.470> can<00:05:31.620> see<00:05:31.970> every

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
a solid live axle as you can see every

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.000 
a solid live axle as you can see every
time<00:05:33.000> I<00:05:33.210> keep<00:05:33.510> touching<00:05:33.690> this<00:05:34.050> I<00:05:34.290> keep<00:05:34.800> pulling

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
time I keep touching this I keep pulling

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.560 
time I keep touching this I keep pulling
one<00:05:35.250> more<00:05:35.430> dirt<00:05:35.670> off<00:05:35.880> so<00:05:36.090> I'm<00:05:36.180> just<00:05:36.210> trying<00:05:36.420> to

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
one more dirt off so I'm just trying to

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.570 
one more dirt off so I'm just trying to
get<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.750> to<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.960> point<00:05:37.110> where<00:05:37.320> I<00:05:37.830> can<00:05:38.430> actually

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
get it to the point where I can actually

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.070 
get it to the point where I can actually
take<00:05:38.820> this<00:05:38.940> out<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.150> pressure<00:05:39.450> wash<00:05:39.690> it<00:05:39.900> just

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
take this out and pressure wash it just

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.950 
take this out and pressure wash it just
roll<00:05:40.290> it<00:05:40.500> out<00:05:40.730> it's<00:05:41.730> kind<00:05:41.970> of<00:05:42.090> the<00:05:42.330> beginning

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
roll it out it's kind of the beginning

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.120 
roll it out it's kind of the beginning
stages<00:05:43.230> I'm<00:05:43.470> gonna<00:05:43.590> try<00:05:43.740> to<00:05:43.800> keep<00:05:43.890> this<00:05:43.980> video

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
stages I'm gonna try to keep this video

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.820 
stages I'm gonna try to keep this video
