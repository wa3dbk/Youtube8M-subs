up<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.460> volunteers<00:01:45.150> but<00:01:46.050> they're<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.350> just

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
up of volunteers but they're not just

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.380 
up of volunteers but they're not just
homegrown<00:01:47.160> civvies<00:01:47.670> who've<00:01:47.850> been<00:01:48.000> handed

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
guns and told to fight it looks like

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.170 
guns and told to fight it looks like
there's<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.060> locally<00:01:51.600> based<00:01:51.840> PMC<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:53.070> small<00:01:53.940> one

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180

but it's there

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.380 
but it's there
so<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> militiamen<00:01:56.370> you're<00:01:56.550> seeing<00:01:56.850> are<00:01:57.120> most

so the militiamen you're seeing are most

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.040 
so the militiamen you're seeing are most
likely<00:01:57.630> mercenaries<00:01:58.410> hired<00:01:58.770> by<00:01:59.190> that<00:01:59.400> PMC<00:02:00.090> hmm

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
likely mercenaries hired by that PMC hmm

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.510 
likely mercenaries hired by that PMC hmm
so<00:02:01.800> you've<00:02:01.950> got<00:02:02.130> PMC's<00:02:02.970> led<00:02:03.510> by<00:02:03.750> PMC's

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520
