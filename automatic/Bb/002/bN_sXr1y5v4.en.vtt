00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.549
 hello everyone hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.369
 Well, cabbage, although not what 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:18.099
 look like this I have to say that 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.630
 is planted does not sow from 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.099
 seeds but planted from 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.039
 plant that man buys in the 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.770
 local greenhouse 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.210
 Y 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.800
 is planted last year said about not 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.880
 I picked it up all the others yes but this one 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.830
 i left him 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.990
 and now for the purpose of taking 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.510
 seeds and now that it's almost to 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.650
 almost point to point I say because out there 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.160
 we can see where the pods are 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.440
 seed carriers 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.059
 those little vainitas 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.260
 and the little balls that are the 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.629
 seeds 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.370
 They are still green but they have already thrown 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.370
 the flower on that part 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.530
 around here still does not have the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.930
 flower 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.930
 it's a little bit soon 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.580
 but we will monitor the plant and the holes 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.580
 of air but good 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.979
 he said he still has 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.979
 little flowers 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.290
 we'll be waiting for them to go 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.300
 pulling and they are taking out the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.720
 Seed carrier pods for 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.720
 collect 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.630
 the cabbage that I have not said but what 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.579
 I say now 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.590
 better late than never is a 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:41.539
 fundamental ingredient in not always 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.310
 in kitchen in all kitchens and in 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.289
 all the dishes but if in the stew 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.240
 mountaineer characteristic of this earth 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.820
 for example, part of the chorizo 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.200
 black pudding the beans of course or 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.500
 one that I forget and so on 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.940
 etcetera therefore the cabbage that you know that 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.670
 It's like a cabbage but 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.040
 or similar to cabbage but unlike 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.270
 they the cabbage closes closes the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.270
 leaves like a ball 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.509
 And it is 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.970
 basic 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.610
 well with the boiled mountain stew 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.680
 mountaineer who boasts carries cabbage 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.400
 it is a vegetable it is a vegetable that contributes 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.490
 much water 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.210
 and it is very rich 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.970
 little looks like little resembles this 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.700
 cabbage to what it should be for what 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.680
 it was last year before I left him now 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.730
 has spilled much has regrown 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.900
 and well, on the one hand it seems true 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.900
 as we can check over there 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.190
 that the truth unlike cabbage 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.970
 it opens in 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.970
 in leaves 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.970
 and the cabbage 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.890
 the cabbage is closed praying I know 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.340
 and it's like it becomes like a kind 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.980
 of value as if we were saying 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.500
 This would be in little one but let's go 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.110
 much more than this closes and quite 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.670
 bitter 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.430
 I think we all know what a 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.430
 cabbage 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.909
 Well, we're not going to wait for them to go 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.769
 drying the seeds to collect them without 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.180
 that the pod opens if the pod is opened 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.420
 and it dries on the ground because we are left without 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.470
 Not clear 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.200
 Well, the pods are already dry 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:39.990
 seed carriers 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:45.150
 so it's time to collect them 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:47.810
 before we will do there are already 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.920
 dry 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.900
 there was a lot if you remember 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.460
 good if you will remember them because this 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.260
 video as it was 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.910
 edited and connected in the sequences 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.910
 with others for you not past the 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.650
 time but for me 15 days have passed 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.010
 and there were some pretty beautiful flowers 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.080
 Over there 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.420
 and a few have already been installed here 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.420
 caterpillars we can see them out there 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.230
 we can see there truth 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.650
 it comes beautiful 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.650
 they have installed themselves there 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.420
 and I was brushing all flowers and 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.420
 seeds included 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.759
 so I'll take what I can 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.720
 before they eat it all because what 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.250
 devouring 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.250
 come on, let's go with them 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.680
 these that are dry we take them like this 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.630
 I could cut the entire branch but there 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.350
 some that are not yet dry 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.350
 completely 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.230
 so I do not cut the entire branch I'm going to 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.400
 take those that are 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.259
 those that are dry only 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.620
 to see if you can see if I walk away a 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.620
 bit 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.860
 picking up from these like this 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.990
 that are already well dried 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.220
 we see how it goes from here 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.220
 Let's see if I can do it 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.090
 without falling to the ground 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.090
 we see how the little ball comes out of there 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.280
 we see how that little black ball comes out 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.280
 Well, that little black ball 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.100
 now we can see that little black ball 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.100
 that comes out there is the seed 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.139
 in this case it has two well looks 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:54.879
 few 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.879
 but good, we keep on doing well 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.510
 Well, I've taken four or five 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:04.440
 pods and few seeds have come out 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:08.009
 the penalty porca misÃ¨ria 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.669
 but good is what there is 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:10.669
 if they leave me 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.920
 well, a few dozen will have little 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:21.040
 more or less if they let me 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.940
 the caterpillars something I'll catch later 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.340
 some more but very little 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.110
 the pests in what has to be or 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.870
 they devour everything 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.840
 Well, I've taken that dozen and you've 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:37.600
 made on land and they leave 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.660
 78 cabbages for me, I already have enough 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.430
 so nothing to see if I can catch some 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.430
 more and that you see 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.190
 nothing more than that I hope that someone 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.449
 serve 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:56.249
 of help or entertainment 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.249
 come on then
