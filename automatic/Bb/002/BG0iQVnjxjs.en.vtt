00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it be the opposite side or the center

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.770 
it be the opposite side or the center
now<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.650> rotate<00:01:17.100> an<00:01:17.220> image<00:01:17.460> simply<00:01:18.030> hold<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
now to rotate an image simply hold the

you<00:03:15.000> want<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.239> crop<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.810> image<00:03:15.840> well<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.920> do

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
you want to crop the image well you do

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.180 
you want to crop the image well you do
that<00:03:17.220> by<00:03:17.340> applying<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.790> mask<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.660> go<00:03:19.109> to<00:03:19.590> format

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
that by applying a mask so go to format

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.220 
that by applying a mask so go to format
and<00:03:20.459> mask<00:03:20.880> with<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.209> image<00:03:21.390> selected<00:03:21.900> and

and mask with the image selected and

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.479 
and mask with the image selected and
it'll<00:03:22.799> happen<00:03:22.950> here<00:03:23.190> as<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.340> get<00:03:23.459> a

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
it'll happen here as you get a

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.849 
it'll happen here as you get a
rectangular<00:03:23.700> area<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:24.900> change<00:03:25.530> to

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
rectangular area that you can change to

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.090 
rectangular area that you can change to
only<00:03:26.160> show<00:03:26.609> a<00:03:26.640> portion<00:03:27.359> of<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.660> image<00:03:27.950> so<00:03:28.950> we

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
only show a portion of the image so we

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.550 
only show a portion of the image so we
can<00:03:29.280> just<00:03:29.640> Center<00:03:29.910> in<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:31.019> face<00:03:31.290> here<00:03:31.530> I

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
can just Center in on the face here I

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.310 
can just Center in on the face here I
can<00:03:31.769> move<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.310> image<00:03:32.489> around<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:33.209> I<00:03:34.170> could

mask<00:03:47.910> of<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.209> image<00:03:48.390> now<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.200> can<00:03:49.380> also<00:03:49.590> mask

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
mask of the image now you can also mask

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.970 
mask of the image now you can also mask
with<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.519> shape<00:03:50.790> go<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.440> format<00:03:52.440> masculine

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
with the shape go to format masculine

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.210 
with the shape go to format masculine
shape<00:03:53.010> choose<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:54.030> shape<00:03:54.660> say<00:03:54.989> an<00:03:55.260> oval<00:03:55.950> here

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
shape choose a shape say an oval here

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.210 
shape choose a shape say an oval here
and<00:03:56.400> now<00:03:57.239> we<00:03:57.299> get<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.930> same<00:03:58.170> basic<00:03:58.739> options

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
and now we get the same basic options

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.849 
and now we get the same basic options
except<00:03:59.579> instead<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.329> rectangle<00:04:00.959> we've<00:04:01.350> got<00:04:01.620> an

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
except instead of rectangle we've got an

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.309 
except instead of rectangle we've got an
oval<00:04:02.370> now<00:04:03.180> another<00:04:03.420> way<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.600> do<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:04.140> is

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
oval now another way to do that is

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.349 
oval now another way to do that is
simply<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.590> create<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:04.950> shape<00:04:05.160> first<00:04:05.609> using

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
simply to create the shape first using

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.530 
simply to create the shape first using
the<00:04:06.590> shape<00:04:07.590> command<00:04:07.980> here<00:04:08.400> from<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.670> top<00:04:08.910> once

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
the shape command here from the top once

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.030 
the shape command here from the top once
you<00:04:09.660> create<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.049> shape<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.410> can<00:04:10.530> drag<00:04:10.889> an

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
you create the shape you can drag an

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.789 
you create the shape you can drag an
image<00:04:11.130> into<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.380> now<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:13.470> see<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.680> get

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
image into it and now you see you get

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.379 
image into it and now you see you get
that<00:04:13.889> same<00:04:14.160> edit<00:04:14.639> mask<00:04:16.400> you<00:04:17.400> know<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.729> box<00:04:18.120> right

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
that same edit mask you know a box right

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.860 
that same edit mask you know a box right
here<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.260> can<00:04:19.440> move<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.070> around<00:04:20.130> and

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
here and you can move it around and

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.270 
here and you can move it around and
basically<00:04:21.870> end<00:04:22.200> up<00:04:22.349> with<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.590> same<00:04:22.800> thing<00:04:22.860> you

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
basically end up with the same thing you

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.760 
basically end up with the same thing you
had<00:04:23.460> doing<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.599> other<00:04:24.810> way<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.530> can<00:04:25.620> also

happen now is only the portion that you

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.840 
happen now is only the portion that you
see<00:05:07.410> is<00:05:07.680> saved<00:05:08.090> so<00:05:09.090> if<00:05:09.720> I<00:05:09.840> were<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.050> shrink<00:05:10.410> down

here<00:05:11.850> you<00:05:12.690> can<00:05:12.840> see<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:12.990> can't<00:05:13.380> really<00:05:13.590> see<00:05:13.770> as

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
here you can see I can't really see as

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.830 
here you can see I can't really see as
much<00:05:14.070> of<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.310> image<00:05:14.460> as<00:05:14.699> I<00:05:14.820> could<00:05:15.600> get<00:05:15.780> to

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
much of the image as I could get to

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.450 
much of the image as I could get to
before<00:05:16.530> so<00:05:17.490> I<00:05:17.820> don't<00:05:18.150> have<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:19.800> option<00:05:20.039> to<00:05:20.340> go

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
before so I don't have the option to go

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.580 
before so I don't have the option to go
back<00:05:20.490> and<00:05:20.940> see<00:05:21.389> the<00:05:21.539> surrounding<00:05:22.139> area<00:05:22.380> around

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.680 
back and see the surrounding area around
the<00:05:22.770> lion<00:05:22.979> so<00:05:23.789> you<00:05:23.880> want<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.210> be<00:05:24.270> careful<00:05:24.599> when
