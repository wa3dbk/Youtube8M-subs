my iphone 5s as you can see here so the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.610 
my iphone 5s as you can see here so the
first<00:00:35.820> week<00:00:36.090> we<00:00:36.270> take<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> look<00:00:36.780> at<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.170> called

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
first week we take a look at one called

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.130 
first week we take a look at one called
status<00:00:38.220> modifier<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.480> may<00:00:39.600> notice<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
status modifier you may notice in the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.200 
status modifier you may notice in the
top<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.470> the<00:00:41.190> status<00:00:41.489> bar<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:41.820> I've<00:00:41.940> got<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
top of the status bar here I've got the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.939 
top of the status bar here I've got the
seconds<00:00:42.600> playing<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.199> other<00:00:43.230> time<00:00:43.739> there

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
seconds playing on the other time there

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.490 
seconds playing on the other time there
and<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.660> kind<00:00:45.900> of<00:00:45.989> addition<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and I just like that kind of addition it

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.110 
and I just like that kind of addition it
makes<00:00:46.830> it<00:00:46.949> look<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> little<00:00:47.250> bit<00:00:47.430> cooked<00:00:47.699> up<00:00:47.820> but

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
makes it look a little bit cooked up but

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.240 
makes it look a little bit cooked up but
I<00:00:48.149> think<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.540> still<00:00:48.690> looks<00:00:48.840> pretty<00:00:48.870> nice<00:00:49.250> if

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
I think it still looks pretty nice if

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.350 
I think it still looks pretty nice if
we're<00:00:50.399> going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.610> stay<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.880> some<00:00:51.059> other<00:00:51.149> fire

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
we're going to stay to some other fire

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.670 
we're going to stay to some other fire
in<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> settings<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.079> actually<00:00:52.440> put<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
in the settings you can actually put the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.620 
in the settings you can actually put the
free<00:00:52.860> memory<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.280> there<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.579> well<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.390> as<00:00:54.510> you

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
free memory on there as well so as you

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.660 
free memory on there as well so as you
can<00:00:54.750> see<00:00:54.960> here<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> goes<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.070> changing<00:00:56.430> sort

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
can see here it goes and changing sort

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.880 
can see here it goes and changing sort
of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.790> available<00:00:57.090> RAM<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.510> stuff<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:57.809> that

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
of the available RAM and stuff like that

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.350 
of the available RAM and stuff like that
so<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.040> pretty<00:00:59.219> cool<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.579> that's<00:00:59.790> a<00:00:59.910> nice

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
you have a particle enabled because it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.150

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.449 
before we would actually launch up the
app<00:01:30.869> itself<00:01:31.050> so<00:01:31.560> that's<00:01:32.009> kind<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> nice

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
app itself so that's kind of a nice

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.630 
app itself so that's kind of a nice
little<00:01:32.640> security<00:01:33.119> feature<00:01:33.679> but<00:01:34.679> you<00:01:35.490> know

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
little security feature but you know

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.120 
little security feature but you know
definitely<00:01:35.880> sort<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.840> trying<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.619> use<00:01:37.979> this

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
definitely sort of trying that use this

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.410 
definitely sort of trying that use this
without<00:01:38.399> a<00:01:38.459> passcode<00:01:38.910> I<00:01:38.940> think<00:01:39.240> if<00:01:39.330> you're

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
without a passcode I think if you're

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.760 
without a passcode I think if you're
going<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.569> be<00:01:39.660> using<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.959> tweak<00:01:40.229> just

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
going to be using this tweak just

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.020 
going to be using this tweak just
because<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.099> just<00:01:41.459> makes<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.819> little<00:01:41.849> bit

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
because it just makes it a little bit

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.639 
because it just makes it a little bit
more<00:01:42.149> seamless<00:01:42.599> but<00:01:43.050> you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.410> as<00:01:43.530> many

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
more seamless but you can have as many

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.320 
more seamless but you can have as many
actors<00:01:44.069> in<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.429> as<00:01:44.550> you<00:01:44.640> want<00:01:44.819> well<00:01:45.000> up<00:01:45.179> to

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
actors in here as you want well up to

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.600 
actors in here as you want well up to
six<00:01:45.599> i<00:01:45.750> think<00:01:45.959> is<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:47.069> you<00:01:47.160> can<00:01:47.280> completely

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
six i think is but you can completely

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.580 
six i think is but you can completely
customize<00:01:47.849> it<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.410> whatever

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
customize it to you know have whatever

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.650 
customize it to you know have whatever
apps<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.130> there<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.459> you<00:01:50.550> want<00:01:50.789> I<00:01:50.940> think<00:01:51.479> it's

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
apps in there that you want I think it's

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.210 
apps in there that you want I think it's
just<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.899> really<00:01:52.110> nice<00:01:52.319> cydia<00:01:52.679> tweak<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.039> works

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
just a really nice cydia tweak it works

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.570 
just a really nice cydia tweak it works
seamlessly<00:01:53.490> with<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.750> ios7<00:01:55.259> if<00:01:56.220> i<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.520> come

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
seamlessly with with ios7 if i just come

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.980 
seamlessly with with ios7 if i just come

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
here and we'll just jump into the

here and we'll just jump into the
settings<00:02:00.929> here<00:02:01.050> just<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.319> you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.679> a

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
look at you know how you actually work

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.779 
look at you know how you actually work
so<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.039> settings<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.520> swipe

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.550 
so you just have the settings to swipe
you<00:02:05.940> here<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.209> can<00:02:06.390> set<00:02:06.929> this<00:02:07.170> over<00:02:07.319> the<00:02:07.470> edge

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
you here you can set this over the edge

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.650 
you here you can set this over the edge
the<00:02:07.709> second<00:02:08.069> app<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:09.000> all<00:02:09.179> your<00:02:09.300> system

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
the second app you have all your system

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.690 
the second app you have all your system
applications<00:02:10.289> at<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> top<00:02:10.800> we<00:02:11.580> actually

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
applications at the top we actually

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.059 
applications at the top we actually
scroll<00:02:12.060> down<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.540> also<00:02:13.349> add<00:02:13.620> user

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
scroll down you can also add user

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.610 
scroll down you can also add user
applications<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:14.910> well<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.390> really<00:02:16.170> some<00:02:16.440> nice

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
applications as well so really some nice

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.260 
applications as well so really some nice
little<00:02:16.920> customization<00:02:17.310> tools<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.209> can

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
little customization tools that you can

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.589 
little customization tools that you can
use<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:19.790> definitely<00:02:20.790> check<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.030> out<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.270> think

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
use and definitely check it out I think

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.709 
use and definitely check it out I think
it's<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:22.200> really<00:02:22.530> works<00:02:22.770> well<00:02:22.890> with<00:02:23.160> our<00:02:23.599> 7<00:02:24.599> and

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
it's a really works well with our 7 and

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.600 
it's a really works well with our 7 and
the<00:02:24.810> integration<00:02:25.049> is<00:02:25.469> really<00:02:25.739> good<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.340> I'm

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
the integration is really good and I'm

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.459 
the integration is really good and I'm
still<00:02:26.849> struggling<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.659> touch<00:02:27.930> ID<00:02:28.290> home

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
still struggling with this touch ID home

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.020 
still struggling with this touch ID home

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
button

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.670 
button
so<00:02:29.209> it's<00:02:29.750> proving<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.140> be<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.290> little<00:02:30.500> bit<00:02:30.650> of

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
so it's proving to be a little bit of

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.740 
so it's proving to be a little bit of
trouble<00:02:30.800> but<00:02:31.240> definitely<00:02:32.240> check<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.510> one

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
trouble but definitely check that one

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.210 
trouble but definitely check that one
out<00:02:32.840> it's<00:02:33.050> called<00:02:33.260> swype<00:02:33.470> he<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:33.830> not<00:02:34.010> free

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
out it's called swype he is not free

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.500 
out it's called swype he is not free
unfortunately<00:02:34.760> but<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:34.970> think<00:02:35.209> it's<00:02:35.330> well

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
unfortunately but I think it's well

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.650 
unfortunately but I think it's well

unrestrictor<00:02:40.459> this<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.569> cydia<00:02:42.140> app<00:02:42.350> that

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.520 
i have a really high data around so it
doesn't<00:03:01.910> really<00:03:02.030> bother<00:03:02.120> me<00:03:02.390> but<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.350> can

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
doesn't really bother me but you can

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.949 
doesn't really bother me but you can
take<00:03:03.739> off<00:03:03.950> things<00:03:04.190> like<00:03:04.430> I<00:03:04.670> player<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.030> other

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
take off things like I player and other

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.630 
take off things like I player and other
apps<00:03:06.200> that's<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.680> restrict<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.190> quality<00:03:07.610> on

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
apps that's of restrict the quality on

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.900 
apps that's of restrict the quality on
3g<00:03:08.239> and<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:09.290> be<00:03:09.680> really<00:03:09.950> bad<00:03:10.070> just<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.700> uses

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
3g and to be really bad just it uses

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.000 
3g and to be really bad just it uses
Wi-Fi<00:03:11.030> quality<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.080> just<00:03:12.350> tricked<00:03:12.739> all<00:03:12.860> these

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
Wi-Fi quality so just tricked all these

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.040 
Wi-Fi quality so just tricked all these
apps<00:03:13.220> into<00:03:13.480> thinking<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.510> you're<00:03:14.900> actually

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
apps into thinking that you're actually

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.440 
apps into thinking that you're actually
on<00:03:15.230> Wi-Fi<00:03:16.130> which<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.400> pretty<00:03:16.519> cool<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.420> it's

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
on Wi-Fi which is pretty cool so it's

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.600 
on Wi-Fi which is pretty cool so it's
quite<00:03:17.989> expensive<00:03:18.350> little<00:03:18.830> cydia<00:03:19.100> tweak<00:03:19.370> but

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
quite expensive little cydia tweak but

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.610 
quite expensive little cydia tweak but
definitely<00:03:20.060> check<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.360> out<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:20.780> if<00:03:21.319> you<00:03:21.440> get

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
definitely check it out and if you get

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.559 
definitely check it out and if you get
kind<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.010> frustrated<00:03:22.489> like<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.790> do<00:03:22.850> with<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.300> sort

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569
