 and are then withdrawn and they have it 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.790
 left intact like a synagogue 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.980

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.519
 He always with taste between 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.519

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.370

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.410

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.910
 do in that it is potatoes we do 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.060
 let 's see how humid it is 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.500
 What remains is this drama know together 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.790
 massive which means can be massive 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.200
 which means more literally hot 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.299
 were massive list 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.510
 spices that we are ready we have it 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.160
 Pakistani anouk dish well made 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.019
 that way goes and the tasters pull it 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.500
 smells good looks good 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.500
 then we don't know 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.970
 the style of the pan all the time but me 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.100
 am naturally very curious what the 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.720
 Best will say only bed 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.760
 our salad is added to this 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.340
 meal he can serve as 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.480
 main meal for 4 people 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.580
 moreover, you will also see this dish with plates 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.900
 full of spices which certainly spoils the taste 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.220
 good comes 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.020
 So you also see that there is not that much salt 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.700
 needed to make the dish tasty a lot 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.050
 to give taste 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.390
 this makes the dish suitable 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.860
 for people with a disability it would be 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.200
 then important that the bread 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.520
 is replaced by rice and of course 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.020
 wouldn't have started too much for that 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.080
 use 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.300
 bed covered in my can attack 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.860
 heel may be able to decide immediately 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.460
 whether it is tasty or not tasty so me 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.020
 M curious
