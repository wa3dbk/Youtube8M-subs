hi<00:00:05.330> in<00:00:05.660> this<00:00:05.720> video<00:00:06.230> I'm<00:00:07.010> going<00:00:07.279> to<00:00:07.370> be<00:00:07.460> talking

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
hi in this video I'm going to be talking

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.880 
hi in this video I'm going to be talking
about<00:00:08.260> functional<00:00:09.260> cortical<00:00:10.070> Anatomy<00:00:11.890> we're

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:12.890 
about functional cortical Anatomy we're

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:13.930 
about functional cortical Anatomy we're
going<00:00:13.010> to<00:00:13.070> be<00:00:13.160> having<00:00:13.340> look

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
going to be having look

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.999 
going to be having look
the<00:00:14.030> brain<00:00:14.330> from<00:00:15.259> the<00:00:15.410> lateral<00:00:15.950> surface<00:00:21.009> so

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.009 
the brain from the lateral surface so

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.359 
the brain from the lateral surface so
first<00:00:22.250> of<00:00:22.400> all<00:00:22.490> I'll<00:00:22.759> draw<00:00:23.300> up<00:00:23.329> the<00:00:23.570> brain<00:00:24.369> so

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
first of all I'll draw up the brain so

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.300 
first of all I'll draw up the brain so
I'm<00:00:25.550> going<00:00:25.759> to<00:00:25.789> use<00:00:26.210> Broadman<00:00:26.750> areas<00:00:27.380> to

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
I'm going to use Broadman areas to

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.150 
I'm going to use Broadman areas to
describe<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:29.329> functional<00:00:30.050> anatomy<00:00:30.829> of<00:00:30.860> the

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
describe the functional anatomy of the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.930 
describe the functional anatomy of the
brain<00:00:31.540> now<00:00:32.540> Brodmann<00:00:32.930> was<00:00:33.350> a<00:00:33.379> neuro<00:00:34.040> anatomist

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
brain now Brodmann was a neuro anatomist

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.600 
brain now Brodmann was a neuro anatomist
and<00:00:35.270> he<00:00:36.050> split<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.440> brain<00:00:36.649> up<00:00:36.860> into<00:00:37.129> various

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
and he split the brain up into various

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.860 
and he split the brain up into various
functional<00:00:38.329> parts<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.670> he<00:00:40.670> gave<00:00:40.910> each<00:00:41.149> part<00:00:41.629> a

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
functional parts and he gave each part a

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.920 
functional parts and he gave each part a
number<00:00:42.289> and<00:00:43.280> we<00:00:43.430> still<00:00:43.789> sometimes<00:00:44.149> use<00:00:44.719> these

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
number and we still sometimes use these

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.110 
number and we still sometimes use these
numbers<00:00:45.110> to<00:00:45.350> refer<00:00:45.920> to<00:00:45.949> certain<00:00:46.609> parts<00:00:46.909> of<00:00:46.999> the

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
numbers to refer to certain parts of the

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.459 
numbers to refer to certain parts of the
brain<00:00:47.239> today<00:00:49.149> so<00:00:50.149> old<00:00:50.390> number<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:50.989> Broadman

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
brain today so old number the Broadman

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.180 
brain today so old number the Broadman
areas<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.159> I'll<00:00:53.030> also<00:00:53.539> give<00:00:54.079> their<00:00:54.589> function

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
areas and I'll also give their function

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.889 
areas and I'll also give their function
now<00:00:58.190> I<00:00:58.219> won't<00:00:58.519> give<00:00:58.729> all<00:00:58.999> the<00:00:59.210> Brodmann<00:00:59.420> areas

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
now I won't give all the Brodmann areas

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.410 
now I won't give all the Brodmann areas
but<00:01:00.469> I'll<00:01:00.649> give<00:01:00.859> the<00:01:00.979> ones<00:01:01.190> that<00:01:01.550> I<00:01:01.699> think<00:01:01.850> are

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
but I'll give the ones that I think are

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.530 
but I'll give the ones that I think are
important<00:01:03.229> to<00:01:03.289> note<00:01:06.700> so<00:01:07.700> first<00:01:08.000> of<00:01:08.180> all<00:01:08.300> a

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
important to note so first of all a

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.080 
important to note so first of all a
label<00:01:09.170> Brodmann<00:01:09.440> areas<00:01:09.979> one<00:01:10.460> two<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.060> three

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
label Brodmann areas one two and three

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.529 
label Brodmann areas one two and three
and<00:01:13.859> this<00:01:14.859> is<00:01:15.070> in<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.810> postcentral<00:01:16.810> gyrus<00:01:17.229> and

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
and this is in the postcentral gyrus and

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.969 
and this is in the postcentral gyrus and
this<00:01:19.539> is<00:01:19.719> a<00:01:19.750> primary<00:01:20.530> somatosensory<00:01:21.929> cortex

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
this is a primary somatosensory cortex

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.249 
this is a primary somatosensory cortex
so<00:01:23.979> this<00:01:24.280> is<00:01:24.460> where<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.969> inputs<00:01:25.569> of<00:01:25.810> all<00:01:26.049> your

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
so this is where the inputs of all your

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:35.149 
so this is where the inputs of all your
touch<00:01:26.560> from<00:01:27.429> your<00:01:27.670> body<00:01:27.850> come<00:01:28.750> into<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.079> brain

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.639 

they're<00:01:36.159> labeled<00:01:36.670> in<00:01:36.880> this<00:01:37.299> order<00:01:37.689> three<00:01:38.170> one

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
they're labeled in this order three one

and these are in the occipital lobe 17

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.460 
and these are in the occipital lobe 17
is<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.510> primary<00:03:26.140> visual<00:03:26.590> cortex<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:29.140> this<00:03:29.319> is

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
is the primary visual cortex so this is

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.970 
is the primary visual cortex so this is
where<00:03:29.650> we<00:03:30.010> get<00:03:30.160> input<00:03:30.489> from<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.330> eyes<00:03:31.980> we

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
where we get input from the eyes we
