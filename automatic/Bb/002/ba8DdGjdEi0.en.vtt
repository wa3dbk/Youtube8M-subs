old computer I'm getting a steady frame
rate<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.890> impressive<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.329> itself

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390

would<00:00:54.899> already<00:00:55.170> merit<00:00:55.559> me<00:00:55.680> saying<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.219> game

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
would already merit me saying this game

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.819 
would already merit me saying this game
is<00:00:56.760> worth<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.410> look<00:00:58.590> at<00:00:58.710> how

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
is worth it but if you look at how

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
is worth it but if you look at how
little<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.579> used<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.210> understand<00:01:00.629> why

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
little is used you can understand why

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900 
little is used you can understand why
not<00:01:01.559> much<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.890> implemented<00:01:02.430> which<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
not much is implemented which is a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.369 
not much is implemented which is a
little<00:01:03.210> disappointing<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.199> graphics

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
little disappointing but the graphics

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.399 
little disappointing but the graphics
used<00:01:04.860> are<00:01:05.220> very<00:01:05.700> well<00:01:05.880> used<00:01:06.180> especially<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
used are very well used especially the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.440 
used are very well used especially the
backgrounds<00:01:07.920> their<00:01:08.250> cosmic<00:01:08.820> could<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.240> used

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
backgrounds their cosmic could be used

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.450 
backgrounds their cosmic could be used
as<00:01:09.720> desktop<00:01:10.110> wallpapers<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.010> accompany

more<00:01:14.850> than<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> moving<00:01:15.240> picture<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.900> few

more than a moving picture and a few
options<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:19.710> puzzle<00:01:20.189> platformer<00:01:20.729> precision

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
options as a puzzle platformer precision

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.940 
options as a puzzle platformer precision
and<00:01:21.509> thought<00:01:21.720> are<00:01:21.900> needed<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.259> play<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.740> game

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and thought are needed to play this game

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.760 
and thought are needed to play this game
more<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.119> precision<00:01:24.689> rather<00:01:24.900> than<00:01:25.110> thought<00:01:25.500> as

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
more so precision rather than thought as

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.230 
more so precision rather than thought as
even<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> fifth<00:01:26.580> level<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> goal<00:01:27.119> is

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
even on the fifth level the goal is

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.789 
even on the fifth level the goal is
pretty<00:01:27.450> easy<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.780> figure<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.200> regardless

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
pretty easy to figure out but regardless

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.130 
pretty easy to figure out but regardless
the<00:01:29.369> platforming<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.299> game<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.720> rather

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the platforming in this game is rather

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.319 
the platforming in this game is rather
difficult<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:32.040> found<00:01:32.640> myself<00:01:32.759> falling<00:01:33.090> off

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
difficult I found myself falling off

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.090 
difficult I found myself falling off
platforms<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.020> thought<00:01:34.259> I'd<00:01:34.409> landed<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.920> or

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
platforms I thought I'd landed on or

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.710 
platforms I thought I'd landed on or
couldn't<00:01:35.369> jump<00:01:35.700> quick<00:01:35.939> enough<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.329> move<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
couldn't jump quick enough to move on to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.660 
couldn't jump quick enough to move on to
the<00:01:36.810> next<00:01:36.960> platform<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:38.070> standard<00:01:38.490> need

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the next platform this standard need

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.399 
the next platform this standard need
quite<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> bit<00:01:39.060> as<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.570> had<00:01:39.720> no<00:01:39.900> options<00:01:40.320> to

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
quite a bit as I had no options to

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.870 
quite a bit as I had no options to
change<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.799> settings<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.340> view<00:01:41.670> or

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
change the settings like view or

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.899 
change the settings like view or
sensitivity<00:01:42.479> which<00:01:42.659> are<00:01:42.840> very<00:01:43.200> much<00:01:43.470> needed

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
sensitivity which are very much needed

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.160 
sensitivity which are very much needed
overall<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.180> still<00:01:45.420> fun<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.630> challenging

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
overall it's still fun and challenging

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.090 
overall it's still fun and challenging
but<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> bit<00:01:46.950> hard<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.220> get<00:01:47.399> used<00:01:47.579> to

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
but can be a bit hard to get used to
