body<00:01:21.600> faint<00:01:21.869> i<00:01:22.020> think<00:01:22.259> i<00:01:22.380> might<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.830> bump

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
body faint i think i might just bump

body faint i think i might just bump
into<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.700> opponent<00:01:24.180> there<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> burbs

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
into that opponent there so the burbs

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.560 
into that opponent there so the burbs
pin<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> great<00:01:25.860> option<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.570> suspect

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
pin is a great option if you suspect

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.890 
pin is a great option if you suspect
that<00:01:27.630> might<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.229> happen<00:01:29.329> we<00:01:30.329> were<00:01:30.479> true<00:01:30.720> here

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
that might just happen we were true here

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.719 
that might just happen we were true here
again<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.740> side<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.250> plates<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.640> we

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
again on the side of the plates and we

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.580 
again on the side of the plates and we
want<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.970> cut<00:01:33.150> inside<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.170> cannot<00:01:34.439> use

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
want to cut inside but we cannot use

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.050 
want to cut inside but we cannot use
your<00:01:34.799> body<00:01:35.009> fit<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.670> might<00:01:35.880> just

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
your body fit because you might just

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.210 
your body fit because you might just
bump<00:01:36.270> into<00:01:36.540> our<00:01:36.780> phone<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.320> therefore<00:01:37.560> we

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
bump into our phone and so therefore we

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.130 
bump into our phone and so therefore we
use<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.700> purpose<00:01:39.479> pain<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:39.930> through

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
use the purpose pain to get through

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.319 
use the purpose pain to get through
there<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.619> we<00:01:41.220> avoid<00:01:41.520> bumping<00:01:41.790> into<00:01:42.090> our

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
and the ball and that's actually the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
and the ball and that's actually the
best<00:01:56.189> thing<00:01:56.430> about<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.850> scale<00:01:57.060> movies<00:01:57.329> that

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
best thing about the scale movies that

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.240 
best thing about the scale movies that
you<00:01:57.540> protective<00:01:58.079> ball<00:01:58.320> with<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.619> you're<00:01:59.040> very

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
you protective ball with it you're very

close<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> opponent<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.570> youtubers

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
close to the opponent but we youtubers

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.319 
close to the opponent but we youtubers
pin<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.649> therefore<00:02:02.280> our<00:02:02.430> back<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:02.969> between

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
pin and therefore our back is in between

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.819 
pin and therefore our back is in between
your<00:02:03.509> opponent<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> ball<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.530> therefore

opponent<00:02:10.860> ND<00:02:11.099> ball<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.400> therefore<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
opponent ND ball and therefore the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.059 
opponent ND ball and therefore the
opponent<00:02:12.360> no<00:02:13.140> way<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.470> opponent

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
opponent no way the opponent

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.920 
opponent no way the opponent
tebow<00:02:14.400> there<00:02:14.670> we<00:02:14.790> get<00:02:14.939> the<00:02:15.060> easy<00:02:15.180> penalty<00:02:15.749> kick

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
tebow there we get the easy penalty kick

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.660 
tebow there we get the easy penalty kick
and<00:02:16.140> we're<00:02:16.530> here<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.859> wing<00:02:17.040> again<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.609> we

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
and we're here on the wing again and we

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.699 
and we're here on the wing again and we
just<00:02:17.939> use<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.329> burbs<00:02:18.780> pin<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.109> cut<00:02:19.349> inside

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
just use the burbs pin to cut inside

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.739 
just use the burbs pin to cut inside
then<00:02:20.280> we<00:02:20.310> do<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.609> reverse<00:02:20.879> step<00:02:21.239> over<00:02:21.540> just

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:21.749 
then we do the reverse step over just

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:23.509 
then we do the reverse step over just
like<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:22.049> last<00:02:22.290> tutorial<00:02:22.469> and<00:02:23.069> we<00:02:23.159> get<00:02:23.340> the

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
like in last tutorial and we get the

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.699 
like in last tutorial and we get the
goal<00:02:23.760> in<00:02:23.939> there<00:02:24.180> now<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.900> first<00:02:25.139> touch<00:02:25.439> babe

spain<00:02:26.040> i<00:02:26.069> said<00:02:26.340> i<00:02:26.370> think<00:02:26.549> this<00:02:26.969> is<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.239> most

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
spain i said i think this is the most

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.119 
spain i said i think this is the most
amazing<00:02:27.749> thing<00:02:28.109> about<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.499> skill<00:02:28.739> move<00:02:28.950> if

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
amazing thing about the skill move if

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.160 
amazing thing about the skill move if
you<00:02:29.430> give<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> low<00:02:30.030> true<00:02:30.329> ball<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.659> is<00:02:30.689> very<00:02:31.049> easy

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
you give a low true ball it is very easy

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.589 
you give a low true ball it is very easy
to<00:02:31.590> do<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.769> first<00:02:32.189> edge<00:02:32.400> burb<00:02:32.700> burb<00:02:32.939> pain<00:02:33.450> we're

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
to do a first edge burb burb pain we're

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.449 
to do a first edge burb burb pain we're
going<00:02:33.719> to<00:02:33.810> see<00:02:34.019> in<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.650> couple<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:34.950> seconds<00:02:35.340> how

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
going to see in a couple of seconds how

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.280 
going to see in a couple of seconds how
you<00:02:35.519> exactly<00:02:36.120> do<00:02:36.389> that<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.689> Duke<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.079> messy

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
you exactly do that the Duke it messy

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.410 
you exactly do that the Duke it messy
air<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:38.010> does<00:02:38.219> a<00:02:38.250> first<00:02:38.609> touch<00:02:38.819> kill<00:02:39.090> move<00:02:39.269> he

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
air it does a first touch kill move he

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.030 
air it does a first touch kill move he
doesn't<00:02:39.750> control<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.079> ball<00:02:40.379> first<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.859> does<00:02:41.010> a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
doesn't control the ball first it does a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.159 
doesn't control the ball first it does a
skill<00:02:41.370> move<00:02:41.549> even<00:02:42.180> before<00:02:42.299> controlling<00:02:43.079> the

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:43.169 
skill move even before controlling the

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.569 
skill move even before controlling the
ball<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.499> therefore<00:02:43.889> you're<00:02:44.310> going<00:02:44.519> to

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
ball and therefore you're going to

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.399 
ball and therefore you're going to
surprise<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.969> lot<00:02:45.329> of<00:02:45.389> opponents<00:02:45.959> if<00:02:46.049> you<00:02:46.200> do

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
surprise a lot of opponents if you do

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.500 
surprise a lot of opponents if you do
that<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:46.769> how<00:02:46.919> do<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.219> do<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.430> at<00:02:47.849> this<00:02:48.239> point

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
that so how do you do that at this point

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.539 
that so how do you do that at this point
you<00:02:48.810> have<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.019> perform<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.739> Berber<00:02:50.099> spin<00:02:50.400> so

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
you have to perform the Berber spin so

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.429 
you have to perform the Berber spin so
before<00:02:50.909> you<00:02:51.060> control<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.540> ball<00:02:51.719> you<00:02:52.169> have<00:02:52.379> to

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
before you control the ball you have to

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.319 
before you control the ball you have to
perform<00:02:52.859> the<00:02:53.069> burbs<00:02:53.280> pin<00:02:53.609> and<00:02:53.909> this<00:02:54.150> was

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
perform the burbs pin and this was

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.629 
perform the burbs pin and this was
actually<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.930> McGee<00:02:55.889> disappearance<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.430> five

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
actually the McGee disappearance of five

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.209 
actually the McGee disappearance of five
so<00:02:56.819> skill<00:02:57.060> move<00:02:57.239> it's<00:02:57.389> the<00:02:57.510> same<00:02:57.780> combination

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.219 
so skill move it's the same combination

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.229 
so skill move it's the same combination
five-shot<00:02:59.219> killers<00:02:59.549> will<00:02:59.699> do<00:02:59.879> that<00:03:00.090> if

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
five-shot killers will do that if

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.869 
five-shot killers will do that if
they're<00:03:00.389> walking<00:03:00.900> slowly<00:03:01.439> but<00:03:02.129> Aries<00:03:02.730> you're

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
they're walking slowly but Aries you're

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.309 
they're walking slowly but Aries you're
going<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.120> want<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.329> do<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.780> first<00:03:04.049> touch

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
going to want to do the first touch

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
to the next section our diagonally you

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.080 
to the next section our diagonally you
see<00:03:52.739> with<00:03:52.919> that<00:03:52.949> we're<00:03:53.159> gonna<00:03:53.310> dare<00:03:53.669> going

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
see with that we're gonna dare going

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.999 
see with that we're gonna dare going
diagonally<00:03:54.599> backwards<00:03:54.810> but<00:03:55.560> that's<00:03:55.799> actually

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:56.009 
diagonally backwards but that's actually

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:58.610 
diagonally backwards but that's actually
one<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.519> best<00:03:57.259> situations<00:03:58.259> in<00:03:58.379> which<00:03:58.409> you

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
one of the best situations in which you

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.140 
one of the best situations in which you
can<00:03:58.650> use<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.099> burbs<00:03:59.489> pin<00:03:59.669> because<00:03:59.849> your

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
can use the burbs pin because your

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.119 
can use the burbs pin because your
opponent<00:04:00.540> things<00:04:00.780> isn't<00:04:01.349> a<00:04:01.530> little<00:04:01.829> bit<00:04:01.919> of<00:04:02.040> a

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
opponent things isn't a little bit of a

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.740 
opponent things isn't a little bit of a
safe<00:04:02.340> position<00:04:02.549> when<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.060> walk<00:04:03.329> in<00:04:03.479> diagonal

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
safe position when you walk in diagonal

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.509 
safe position when you walk in diagonal
a<00:04:03.959> backwards<00:04:04.439> and<00:04:04.799> then<00:04:04.979> you<00:04:05.069> can<00:04:05.219> surprise

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
a backwards and then you can surprise

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.249 
a backwards and then you can surprise
him<00:04:05.819> with<00:04:05.969> the<00:04:06.120> papers<00:04:06.479> being<00:04:06.659> cut<00:04:06.989> inside

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:07.259 
him with the papers being cut inside

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:09.379 
him with the papers being cut inside
this<00:04:07.409> box<00:04:07.680> because<00:04:08.340> he<00:04:08.459> never<00:04:08.609> expects<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.239> to

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
this box because he never expects you to

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.939 
this box because he never expects you to
do<00:04:09.569> that<00:04:09.780> we're<00:04:09.930> walking<00:04:10.109> backwards<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:10.889> then

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
do that we're walking backwards and then

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.069 
do that we're walking backwards and then
suddenly<00:04:11.189> you<00:04:11.879> do<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.239> burbs<00:04:12.599> pin<00:04:12.780> we<00:04:12.930> cut

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
suddenly you do the burbs pin we cut

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.409 
suddenly you do the burbs pin we cut
inside<00:04:13.469> and<00:04:13.769> now<00:04:14.189> it's<00:04:14.459> dangerous<00:04:14.909> opponent

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
inside and now it's dangerous opponent

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.149 
inside and now it's dangerous opponent
cannot<00:04:15.599> stop<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.049> anymore<00:04:16.469> he<00:04:16.590> was<00:04:16.709> caught<00:04:16.949> and

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159 
cannot stop it anymore he was caught and

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.370 
cannot stop it anymore he was caught and
surprise<00:04:17.489> there<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.269> if<00:04:18.359> walking<00:04:18.690> diagonally

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
surprise there so if walking diagonally

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.110 
surprise there so if walking diagonally
we're<00:04:19.560> walking<00:04:19.949> to<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.219> sideline<00:04:20.430> he<00:04:20.849> thinks

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
we're walking to the sideline he thinks

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.640 
we're walking to the sideline he thinks
these<00:04:21.209> things<00:04:21.509> is<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.719> little<00:04:22.109> bit<00:04:22.229> in<00:04:22.349> a<00:04:22.440> safe

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
these things is a little bit in a safe

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.860 
these things is a little bit in a safe
position<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.430> then<00:04:23.880> we<00:04:24.029> do<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.240> pelvic<00:04:24.510> pain

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
position and then we do the pelvic pain

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.020 
position and then we do the pelvic pain
so<00:04:25.020> if<00:04:25.139> you're<00:04:25.289> going<00:04:25.469> diag

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
so if you're going diag

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.150 
so if you're going diag
it's<00:04:26.690> a<00:04:26.810> great<00:04:26.990> way<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:27.770> you<00:04:27.860> can<00:04:27.980> surprise

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
it's a great way that you can surprise

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
we do a ball row 28 a foodie goalkeeper

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.570 
we do a ball row 28 a foodie goalkeeper
and<00:04:32.180> we<00:04:32.540> get<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:32.870> for<00:04:33.110> 23<00:04:33.560> in<00:04:33.590> there<00:04:33.889> indeed<00:04:34.310> and

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
we are on gearbox now and we usually

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.570 
we are on gearbox now and we usually
fish<00:04:39.350> that<00:04:39.530> fake<00:04:39.770> shot<00:04:39.980> it's<00:04:40.160> actually<00:04:40.520> a

goalkeepers if they're on the box you

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.900 
goalkeepers if they're on the box you
might<00:04:48.230> do<00:04:48.380> a<00:04:48.410> fake<00:04:48.740> shot<00:04:48.980> and<00:04:49.190> then<00:04:49.490> there<00:04:49.730> to

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
might do a fake shot and then there to

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.460 
might do a fake shot and then there to
set<00:04:50.120> up<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.419> burbs<00:04:50.780> pain<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.110> then<00:04:51.230> do<00:04:51.350> the

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
birth then after that you can actually

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.330 
birth then after that you can actually
go<00:04:53.330> one-on-one<00:04:53.960> with<00:04:54.260> the<00:04:54.470> goalkeeper<00:04:54.950> off<00:04:55.160> in

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
go one-on-one with the goalkeeper off in

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.040 
go one-on-one with the goalkeeper off in
this<00:04:55.430> kill<00:04:55.700> move<00:04:55.880> you<00:04:56.000> can<00:04:56.150> see<00:04:56.330> why<00:04:56.840> we<00:04:57.020> need

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
this kill move you can see why we need

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.870 
this kill move you can see why we need
to<00:04:57.290> be<00:04:57.470> a<00:04:57.500> first<00:04:57.860> half<00:04:57.980> a<00:04:58.160> cup<00:04:58.370> right<00:04:58.520> here<00:04:58.580> we

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
to be a first half a cup right here we

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.430 
to be a first half a cup right here we
just<00:04:59.090> hit<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.270> first<00:04:59.570> arts<00:04:59.810> group<00:05:00.020> there<00:05:00.260> and

just hit the first arts group there and

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.200 
just hit the first arts group there and
now<00:05:00.710> we<00:05:00.770> can<00:05:00.980> see<00:05:01.100> that<00:05:01.250> Ramos<00:05:01.640> is<00:05:01.790> running<00:05:02.090> up

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.270 
now we can see that Ramos is running up
to<00:05:02.240> keep<00:05:02.540> cracker<00:05:02.810> pie<00:05:03.020> of<00:05:03.350> us<00:05:03.590> and<00:05:03.830> because

it's<00:05:04.490> running<00:05:04.700> up<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:05.000> means<00:05:05.240> that<00:05:05.390> we<00:05:05.480> can

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
it's running up that means that we can

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.990 
it's running up that means that we can
abuse<00:05:06.500> this<00:05:06.710> momentum<00:05:07.250> with<00:05:07.400> to<00:05:07.490> build<00:05:07.700> up<00:05:07.850> in
