00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.200
 again with you I am the doctor 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.190
 Nestor Pitana we will talk today about the 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.500
 female poetry 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.150
 welcome is also another day in 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.480
 this space of disclosure about 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.550
 hair medicine 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.500
 today the hair loss stopped 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.960
 be a male problem exclusively 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.480
 to affect well also the woman 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.560
 the female species currently affects 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.809
 a small percentage of women 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.750
 between 20 and 30 years 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.579
 and approximately 30% between those 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.040
 who are between 40 and 60 years old 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.110
 eye pressure drone gene family 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.570
 has clear characteristics or 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.970
 and there is specific hair loss 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.180
 does not mean that we have a problem of 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.729
 speed the main causes are the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.530
 genetic predisposition variations in 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.350
 hormone levels like for example 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.790
 occurs without further menopause or by 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.859
 example when there is a deficit 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.880
 vitamins or taking contraceptives 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.860
 oral 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.170
 and the passage of sounds 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.330
 female alopecia differs a lot from 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.250
 male and for his evaluation we 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.190
 we rule by the otter scale and by the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.140
 diffuse or crown pattern in this pattern 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.510
 the hair of the frontal area is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.700
 they keep normal by getting or 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.010
 weakening in the central zone there 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.200
 different degrees from one from a 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.950
 type of speed that is very incipient 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.090
 until the important absence of hair 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.240
 in that affected area 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.549
 we will talk about some hormonal changes 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.960
 Estrogens are made by women and 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.509
 They stimulate the growth of 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.729
 follicle in some periods such as 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.859
 adolescence or in menopause and 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.409
 blood levels are low causing 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:50.920
 well the fall being recoverable in a 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.090
 great percentage stress expressions of 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.340
 depression or emotional disturbances 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.770
 indirectly cause the increase in 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.179
 male hormone and cortisol that are 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.149
 causing the fall also of 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.399
 hair is this subject is a pretty subject 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.810
 complex like cortisol is a subject 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.869
 quite complex that we will talk about it in 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.979
 some other time about pregnancy 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.069
 there is an excess of hormones in this 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.410
 period that prevents normal fall to 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.230
 starting from childbirth can cause 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.900
 very abrupt fall of hair of type 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.380
 generalized and recover in a 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.790
 progressive 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.800
 some medications like 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.000
 anti-inflammatory anti-coagulants 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.310
 antidepressants and some 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.950
 hypervitaminosis as the type and are 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.860
 factors to take into account also the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.380
 contraceptives with oral levels 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.150
 elevated progestin progestogens 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.070
 They can also cause an increase in 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.010
 loss of hair recommending a 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.260
 kind of with higher estrogen levels 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.150
 losses have also been observed after 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.860
 leave the others 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.569
 approximately three months later it is a 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.560
 fact similar to what happens in the 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.590
 labor on menopause the decline of 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.390
 estrogen can be accentuated and can 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.610
 stop hair at this time in the area 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.459
 frontal unlike men do not 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.110
 hair loss is usually noticed but 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.849
 offering genetics your girl has several 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.970
 solutions is a precious essential 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.709
 previous diagnosis minoxidil and 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.709
 finasteride are the treatments 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.890
 recommended for this type of alopecia 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.650
 and they have been scientifically proven 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.900
 although finasteride is not quite 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.849
 accepted in the scientific fields but 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.160
 it is perfectly known that they have a 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.500
 favorable result 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.870
 there is a belief that 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.600
 aesthetic treatments such as plates 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.910
 dyes lotions etc of very frequent use 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.800
 like a hairdresser are the causes of 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.190
 the fall or androgenetic alopecia 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.800
 female but it's not like that they can aggravate 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.390
 the or contribute to doing it but even 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.860
 in the absence of these factors the loss 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.500
 of hair can produce is equal 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.540
 due to genetic factors in the case 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.800
 that the weakening of the hair is 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.620
 accompanied by percent more like 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.390
 infertility cystic acne periods 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.520
 irregular menstrual or ballack torrea 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.800
 we will have to do some hormonal study 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.810
 later to detect which one is 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.610
 exactly the other type of failure 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.280
 alopecia is alopecia areata the 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.800
 football not gel or study the og no and the 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.450
 drug or drug abuse for more 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.739
 information about it I advise that 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.739
 see my video about what being 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.970
 male generic in this same channel 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.520
 Finally, remind him that 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.560
 Self-medication is not a practice 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.840
 advisable and from here I warn you what 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.570
 dangerous that it can be when doing for your 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.430
 well consult a specialist many 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.180
 thank you for your attention and see you in 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.180
 the next video
