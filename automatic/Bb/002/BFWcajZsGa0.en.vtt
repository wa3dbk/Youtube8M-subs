00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
dampening they also had a change to one

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.960 
dampening they also had a change to one
of<00:01:45.390> their<00:01:45.540> glyphs<00:01:46.040> it<00:01:47.040> was<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> glyph<00:01:47.729> of

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
of their glyphs it was the glyph of

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.990 
of their glyphs it was the glyph of
remove<00:01:48.420> curse<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.470> now<00:01:49.680> increases<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
remove curse and it now increases the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.149

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
curse and that was down from fifteen

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.660 
curse and that was down from fifteen
percent<00:01:59.570> increase<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.780> damage<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.460> a

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
percent increase the damage so that's a

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.120 
percent increase the damage so that's a
ten<00:02:02.880> percent<00:02:03.090> decrease<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.500> one<00:02:04.740> glyph

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
ten percent decrease to that one glyph

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.930 
ten percent decrease to that one glyph
