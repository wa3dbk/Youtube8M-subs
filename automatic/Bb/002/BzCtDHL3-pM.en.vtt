00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.390
 hello guys how were you good the day of 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.970
 today I 'm going to leave you a video with the 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.360
 solution of the problem that just if a 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.429
 that video on Windows 10 that I 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.000
 I had officially downloaded it 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.830
 it did not start well and it blinked many 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.750
 users told me to send a 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.750
 solution then here pretty much the 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.240
 that the yolk feasible and is very simple 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.869
 to do the first thing they're going to do 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.380
 It is as a main requirement to have a USB 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.080
 of 4GB of minimum storage and that 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.970
 is formatted this is super simple 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.970
 to do since nothing else have to 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.519
 enter the file browser is nice 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.000
 this team and here you are going to be given 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.739
 right click and format lean accept and 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.440
 automatically land has been formed without 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.610
 no problem after that 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.129
 obviously we need windows 10 and 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.530
 for that there is a program that allows you 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.570
 install it for free which is the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.020
 same from microsoft in my case my system 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.210
 operational 64 bits so the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.030
 application is called measure and review 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.920
 tool that what you are going to do is download 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.619
 of the operating system in your sb in my 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.869
 case and poll tel or another computer 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.000
 or on your computer the application 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.670
 It is this one that will give you two 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.140
 options update your pc or create a 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.150
 installation medium 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.490
 I told him in the second option because 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.869
 in my computer they did not react 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.320
 but nothing then I had to do it 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.760
 by another method 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.140
 and this all these procedures the 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.510
 facts on other computers if you have 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.630
 If I have to compute do it, I give it 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.610
 a second option and then he will ask you 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.180
 that you select the ideam architecture and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.490
 edition 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.310
 in my case going up to home and I think 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.830
 that is for all of us since we have 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.990
 good 8.1 but for those who have 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.560
 other versions just in case I leave them 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.840
 here and other options are other 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.440
 versions of windows 10 in my case like 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.250
 I told them it was from windows 10 home they give to 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.710
 give the next and then they go to 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.780
 select that united you see here is going to 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.520
 leave the name of your unit and already 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.950
 selected will simply give you the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:19.610
 next and already after one hour and 40 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.900
 is about to be installed 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.850
 depending on the internet it may delay 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.340
 more can about two hours three hours not 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.670
 worry that it 's normal then it's going 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.920
 to come out in happens these folders 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.110
 there are two options as chosen and their 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.819
 system starts with some errors but 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.489
 start you can click on that touch 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.310
 but if there is no other option that is the one 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.459
 I know it was this that is to turn off the 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.930
 computer and at the time of starting the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.660
 cne or leave the mark of your computer 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.880
 So there we have two options there 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.069
 my case was f 2 which is to accept or 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.319
 f adjustment system 12 is for 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.209
 start administration there you are going to 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.370
 come out three options and in which 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.040
 We lived from came to click with the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.510
 arrows on usb and lower with arrows 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.190
 to usb and they put inter after that they're going 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.830
 to leave this they are going to load ready 1 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.170
 seconds this is going to come out here and 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.170
 they will come out what is the language of 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.239
 operating system and language nothing more 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.459
 if they want English they can change it but 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.110
 By default they will leave Spanish 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.200
 defect so nothing else they put in 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.420
 next then you will get two options 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.239
 do not give them in install now just give 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.010
 in repairing your computer after that 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.420
 we are going to leave you 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.129
 these options are you in my case I did 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.310
 click on solve problems since the 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.489
 mini operating system had errors and 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.489
 then 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.939
 they give in to reset your fish do not give 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.030
 to restore reset options 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:54.159
 tired I was going to enter first 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.480
 alternative this option but I thought 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.599
 more convenient to use these since 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.939
 reinstall everything needed to subtract is 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.159
 of butt I do not have more images but 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.049
 I have not go out two options or keep 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.629
 your personal files or true form 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.790
 as I wanted to keep them I decided 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.019
 to do so is to click on the first option and 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.060
 I keep my personal files 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.129
 although I deleted my applications but 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.900
 that surprising to install so do not 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.269
 in the problem after that 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.840
 approximately it will take two hours 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.729
 in installing the operating system and of 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.860
 there is going to start normally I hope 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.650
 is a few minutes to start it goes to 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.630
 start is no longer going to have any problem 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.199
 nor will they be able to compute this normal 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.759
 I'll leave the links of these 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:41.050
 these pages that I thought were super 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:42.250
 useful to be able to start being able to install 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.720
 the operating system without having to 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.849
 format since that's the least 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.760
 I wanted good I hope that this video will 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:50.950
 has served and if you want more videos 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.140
 put in the comments those are the 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.000
 first first thing I do so I hope 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.170
 like it 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.170
 chau guys take care
