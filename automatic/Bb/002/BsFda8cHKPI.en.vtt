00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello friends look today I'm going to 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.520
 make vanilla ice cream and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.090
 ingredients are sugar-whipped cream 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.519
 eggs and vanilla essence and apart 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.960
 you have to have a bowl and you have to 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.120
 have a mold and a manual beater and a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.550
 palette 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:28.350
 let's start the first thing you have 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.370
 what to do is stop the clear 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.370
 again 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.010
 and what are you putting in 1 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.760
 well we already have the eggs separated and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.790
 now let's throw the sugar then 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.390
 Whisk sugar with this manual will 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:05.960
 you have that is mixing like this non-stop 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.960
 for 5 minutes 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.390
 the five minutes have already passed and I 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.390
 You see how it has to be have seen how it 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.740
 mix that pasta is good because now 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.740
 we already have this 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.040
 the former we take good care of 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.210
 and now we take the cream 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.840
 and we're going to put it in 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.780
 well now what you have to do is 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.780
 go mixing the bottom up 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:52.200
 to leave when you have it like that already a little 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.580
 mixed you take and put the 10 drops 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.580
 of the essence of vanilla 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:07.210
 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 and 10 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.210
 and now you catch and do not keep mixing 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.790
 we do not have you see all mixed already 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.280
 you will see that cream sometimes remain 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.160
 these these little balls but do not do 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.410
 no case and do not want to undo what 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.890
 you leave because then this in the mold 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.490
 undoes now we're going to put it here 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.490
 in the mold 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.330
 Well now you take it with care 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:37.599
 thread so that it feels good and now not 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.599
 we will take and we will put it to 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.599
 freezer 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.900
 Look, I've already taken it out of the freezer 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.930
 to be that when you put your finger there 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.239
 sink to freezing half time 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.760
 I can tell you what you have to 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.409
 put if you do it in the morning then 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.849
 calculate is that it has to be a whole 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.439
 day and if you do it at night 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.819
 a whole night but when you put 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:04.330
 the finger does not sink and now we're going to 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.180
 unmold 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.610
 we have already taken it apart look how it is 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.870
 it is has a divine presentation is 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.590
 great to do it I hope you like it and 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.590
 until next time
