turtles and it comes down to really cool
moment<00:01:55.470> between<00:01:55.860> Leonardo<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> him<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.180> uh

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
moment between Leonardo and him and uh

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.230 
moment between Leonardo and him and uh
basically<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.670> auto<00:02:00.350> accidentally<00:02:01.350> stabs<00:02:01.710> him

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
basically in auto accidentally stabs him

basically in auto accidentally stabs him
through<00:02:03.240> here<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:05.340> looks<00:02:05.579> like<00:02:05.700> he

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
through here and it looks like he

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.490 
through here and it looks like he
probably<00:02:06.210> killed<00:02:06.540> him<00:02:06.659> because<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.350> was<00:02:07.469> a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
probably killed him because there was a

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.070 
probably killed him because there was a
heck<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.890> style<00:02:08.390> anyway<00:02:09.390> he<00:02:09.599> falls<00:02:09.869> into

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
falls and he pulls

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.089 
falls and he pulls
sort<00:02:12.000> out<00:02:12.090> Falls<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.200> water<00:02:13.409> his<00:02:13.590> black<00:02:13.860> mass

sort out Falls to water his black mass

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.890 
sort out Falls to water his black mass
falls<00:02:14.459> off<00:02:14.670> which<00:02:14.909> kind<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.269> like<00:02:15.420> ah<00:02:15.540> come<00:02:15.840> on

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
falls off which kind of like ah come on

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.630 
falls off which kind of like ah come on
keep<00:02:16.110> some<00:02:16.230> attitude<00:02:16.620> hope<00:02:17.129> it<00:02:17.250> gets<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.459> mask

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
keep some attitude hope it gets a mask

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.190 
keep some attitude hope it gets a mask
in<00:02:17.939> there<00:02:18.799> he<00:02:19.799> falls<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.250> now<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.030> kind<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.019> I

in there he falls in now I kind of I
kind<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.530> hope<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.860> he<00:02:22.950> does<00:02:23.189> get<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.430> shredder

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
kind of hope that he does get a shredder

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.780 
kind of hope that he does get a shredder
claw<00:02:24.980> that's<00:02:25.980> one<00:02:26.280> thing<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.489> want<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.730> mention

got his mask I was like oh koolz you go
get<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> shredder<00:02:31.590> call<00:02:31.829> somehow<00:02:32.480> he<00:02:33.480> doesn't

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
get a shredder call somehow he doesn't

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.039 
get a shredder call somehow he doesn't
but<00:02:34.739> but<00:02:35.099> luckily<00:02:35.370> thank<00:02:36.120> goodness<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.840> does

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
but but luckily thank goodness it does

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.470 
but but luckily thank goodness it does
tell<00:02:37.319> us<00:02:37.349> for<00:02:37.620> sure<00:02:37.650> he's<00:02:38.010> not<00:02:38.250> dead<00:02:38.549> he<00:02:39.090> washes

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480

up<00:02:39.599> on<00:02:39.750> shore<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.409> who's<00:02:41.069> their<00:02:41.280> old<00:02:41.609> home<00:02:42.230> now

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
up on shore and who's their old home now

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.229 
up on shore and who's their old home now
now<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:45.629> this<00:02:46.099> apparently<00:02:47.099> is<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:47.579> I<00:02:47.909> guess

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
now this this apparently is like I guess

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.330 
now this this apparently is like I guess
more<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.569> team-up<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.260> he<00:02:49.379> maybe<00:02:49.920> he's<00:02:50.159> put

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
more of a team-up is he maybe he's put

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.069 
more of a team-up is he maybe he's put
up<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:50.670> put<00:02:51.000> together<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.299> team<00:02:51.510> possibly

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
up to you put together a team possibly

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.899 
up to you put together a team possibly
that'd<00:02:52.680> be<00:02:52.829> cool<00:02:52.950> he<00:02:53.129> could<00:02:53.280> go<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.489> team<00:02:53.790> has

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
that'd be cool he could go to team has

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.729 
that'd be cool he could go to team has
some<00:02:54.090> mutants<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.599> then<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.440> had<00:02:55.590> him<00:02:56.569> the

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
some mutants and then you had him the

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.180 
some mutants and then you had him the
cranes<00:02:58.739> people<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.970> shredder<00:03:00.420> all<00:03:00.629> out<00:03:00.810> there

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
cranes people and shredder all out there

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.319 
cranes people and shredder all out there
you<00:03:02.190> know<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.609> throws<00:03:02.819> up<00:03:02.970> tilt<00:03:03.150> all

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
you know and the throws up tilt all

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.000 
you know and the throws up tilt all
through<00:03:03.510> those<00:03:03.659> groups<00:03:03.959> I'll<00:03:04.500> really<00:03:04.920> like

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.699 
through those groups I'll really like
that<00:03:05.340> idea<00:03:05.489> because<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> cartoon<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.840> lot

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
that idea because in the cartoon a lot

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.050 
that idea because in the cartoon a lot
of<00:03:07.829> woods<00:03:08.010> pretty<00:03:08.129> much<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.459> shredders<00:03:08.819> group

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
of woods pretty much of shredders group

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.879 
of woods pretty much of shredders group
but<00:03:09.599> I'll<00:03:09.690> lock<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.930> door<00:03:10.409> seal<00:03:10.620> but<00:03:10.829> it

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
but I'll lock the door seal but it
