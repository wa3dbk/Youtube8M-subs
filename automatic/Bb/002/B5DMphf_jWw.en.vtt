00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hi today transfer repair with you 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.389
 hyundai now i'll show you nothing 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.360
 In no case can you do it during installation 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:18.000
 we build a kitchen 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.590
 here we are now here it is here a fee 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.420
 which is installed on all these 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.160
 devices let's say here on the fridge 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.170
 some other things here will be mine 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:36.829
 when here it was this whole 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:42.559
 the board on was sawed up this sink on 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:46.789
 Well, also under the stove 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.920
 At first I tried to make a drill here . 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:53.160
 hand hacksaw see what 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.170
 It turned out, that is, this is not at all 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.329
 remove yes that is to say it will be seen 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.039
 in general it is regrettable all this is ugly 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.589
 it all looks well, thank God it all 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.950
 then it just closes our 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.500
 here here's how with the plate admission it all 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.720
 then it closes to me yes because 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.700
 here everything has a place for it on this here 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.229
 not close from you that's worth about 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:29.490
 sticking out by no means doing so 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:32.340
 how then I shorter than wiser I went bought 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.170
 jigsaws are what we see 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.650
 but again like a grandson the first time here 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.700
 jigsaw work on well waves all as 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.390
 as usual shorter to over me but 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.850
 all clearly nothing crumbled 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.590
 nothing all one length drill since 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.590
 I had to start here here too 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.440
 and so how would these go? 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.130
 never never never without a jigsaw with 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.580
 these these work in short to i 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.959
 compare yes what is here and what's here 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.910
 that's how ugliness at all 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.820
 the sink itself collect all this very easily 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.130
 here is sure to stick this garbage 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.250
 there seems to be a toughness that was something that i didn't 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.080
 understand the exchange in the corners necessarily 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.600
 I am stuck here with such a thing. 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.630
 you will be special later 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.600
 that's it a sealant here all this 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.420
 glue and tidy at the corners 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.270
 sure started and started where it flows here 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.239
 water and all this chipboard we just sweat everything 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.350
 It will be how long you throw a shorter fee 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.410
 fasteners for example here it is not only 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:53.000
 complete them too from the beginning can be 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:54.680
 corners of admissible here so first so 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.299
 insert then insert football 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.690
 reach out again four 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:03.190
 places if you have 8 of that in the middle of something 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.190
 eat under roughly the perimeter 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:13.630
 everything should meet in the next video 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.280
 no right after all 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.880
 so here because later in bolt 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.980
 the very same thing may drag on 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.600
 fee already dresses tighten then 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:30.160
 these here they are then 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.190
 crash into this board from that side and 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:39.500
 your wash is not going anywhere 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:41.930
 everything seems to be this channel for those who 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.650
 at least something wants to do 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.090
 do it yourself 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.090
 thanks for watching bye
