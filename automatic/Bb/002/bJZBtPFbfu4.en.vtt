00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
this is plastic for another option for

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.399 
this is plastic for another option for
your<00:01:54.030> laces<00:01:54.360> once<00:01:54.540> again<00:01:54.810> which<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.320> not

comfortable these are actually pretty

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.760 
comfortable these are actually pretty
crusty

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.370 

I<00:02:10.970> don't<00:02:11.970> know<00:02:12.120> how<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.270> fix<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:13.110> if

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
I don't know how to fix that but if

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.300 
I don't know how to fix that but if
thurs<00:02:13.620> away<00:02:13.860> I'll<00:02:14.490> find<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.800> from<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.950> bottom

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
thurs away I'll find it from the bottom

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.070 
thurs away I'll find it from the bottom
I<00:02:17.460> actually<00:02:17.700> like<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.090> it's<00:02:18.570> not<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.900> bad

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080
