00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.030 
to the edge I'm gonna be safe but it is
not<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.959> case<00:03:13.110> every<00:03:13.470> time<00:03:13.620> because<00:03:13.800> some

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
not the case every time because some

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.040 
not the case every time because some
players<00:03:14.250> who<00:03:14.760> are<00:03:14.820> really<00:03:15.239> on<00:03:15.420> point<00:03:15.690> they<00:03:15.900> can

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
players who are really on point they can

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.600 
players who are really on point they can
actually<00:03:16.230> punish<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.739> one<00:03:16.920> frame<00:03:17.130> reliably

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
actually punish that one frame reliably

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.759 
actually punish that one frame reliably
and<00:03:17.850> that's<00:03:18.420> gonna<00:03:18.540> be<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> huge<00:03:19.050> thing<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.650> the

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
and that's gonna be a huge thing in the

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.210 
and that's gonna be a huge thing in the
evolution<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.459> metagame<00:03:20.700> coming<00:03:21.180> up<00:03:22.220> we

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
too predictable completely shields that

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.629

like<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:03.260> Owen<00:05:04.260> Gohan<00:05:04.620> with<00:05:05.160> a<00:05:05.280> very<00:05:05.580> very

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
like that Owen Gohan with a very very

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.029 
like that Owen Gohan with a very very
high<00:05:06.240> risk<00:05:06.479> forward<00:05:06.900> smash<00:05:07.110> there<00:05:07.410> well<00:05:07.949> I

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
high risk forward smash there well I

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.439 
high risk forward smash there well I
guess<00:05:08.280> not<00:05:08.430> high<00:05:08.610> risk<00:05:08.820> is<00:05:08.970> he<00:05:09.090> was<00:05:09.210> at<00:05:09.300> such

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
guess not high risk is he was at such

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.540 
guess not high risk is he was at such
low<00:05:09.630> percent<00:05:09.990> he<00:05:10.169> had<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.680> opportunity<00:05:11.520> to

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
low percent he had the opportunity to

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.330 
low percent he had the opportunity to
bet<00:05:11.820> it<00:05:11.940> all<00:05:12.000> on<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.330> but<00:05:12.840> now<00:05:13.100> watch<00:05:14.100> that

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
bet it all on that but now watch that

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.730 
bet it all on that but now watch that
damage<00:05:14.639> me<00:05:14.760> to<00:05:14.850> climb<00:05:15.120> he's<00:05:15.930> not<00:05:16.199> looking<00:05:16.590> good

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
damage me to climb he's not looking good

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.290 
damage me to climb he's not looking good
