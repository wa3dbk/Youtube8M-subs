00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
as the front side would be and so I tend

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.150 
as the front side would be and so I tend
to<00:02:58.280> get<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.489> little<00:02:58.640> texture<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.599> wood<00:03:00.160> now

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
to get a little texture of the wood now

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.539 
to get a little texture of the wood now
here<00:03:01.579> you<00:03:01.790> see<00:03:01.819> those<00:03:02.650> holes<00:03:03.650> are<00:03:03.980> cut<00:03:04.340> out<00:03:04.370> of

here you see those holes are cut out of

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.800 
here you see those holes are cut out of
the<00:03:04.790> block<00:03:04.970> underneath<00:03:05.389> and<00:03:07.569> since<00:03:08.569> there's

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
the block underneath and since there's

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.740 
the block underneath and since there's
no<00:03:08.870> resistance<00:03:09.349> there<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.849> the<00:03:11.030> roller<00:03:11.299> why

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
no resistance there to the roller why

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:23.409 
no resistance there to the roller why
the<00:03:11.810> ink<00:03:12.139> doesn't<00:03:12.560> take<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:21.310> could<00:03:22.310> print<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.209> as

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
the ink doesn't take I could print it as

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.750 
the ink doesn't take I could print it as
I<00:03:23.450> have<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.230> keep<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.590> moon<00:03:24.769> perfectly<00:03:25.340> clear

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
I have and keep the moon perfectly clear

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.020 
I have and keep the moon perfectly clear
but<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.030> want<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.599> kind<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:27.019> a<00:03:27.430> halftone<00:03:28.430> over<00:03:28.910> it

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
but I want a kind of a halftone over it

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.050 
but I want a kind of a halftone over it
so<00:03:29.329> to<00:03:29.840> do<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.019> I<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.739> roll<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.400> little<00:03:31.579> more<00:03:31.849> ink

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
so to do that I I roll a little more ink

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.289 
so to do that I I roll a little more ink
on<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.359> on<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:33.169> roller<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.739> then<00:03:34.549> lightly

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
on the on the roller and then lightly

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.240 
on the on the roller and then lightly
roll<00:03:35.660> over<00:03:35.989> it<00:03:36.109> like<00:03:36.349> that<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:36.739> it's<00:03:36.919> this

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
roll over it like that and it's this

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.370 
roll over it like that and it's this
what's<00:03:37.549> called<00:03:37.609> blue<00:03:38.030> fox<00:03:38.660> printing<00:03:39.169> it's

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
what's called blue fox printing it's

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.710 
what's called blue fox printing it's
false<00:03:40.340> in<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.700> sense<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.060> there<00:03:41.359> isn't<00:03:41.540> a

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
false in the sense that there isn't a

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.110 
false in the sense that there isn't a
block<00:03:41.930> underneath<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.760> make<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:43.910> happen

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
block underneath it to make it happen

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.940 
block underneath it to make it happen
but<00:03:44.829> I've<00:03:45.829> induced<00:03:46.310> it<00:03:46.549> by<00:03:47.680> adjusting<00:03:48.680> the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
but I've induced it by adjusting the

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.009 
but I've induced it by adjusting the
amount<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.849> ink<00:03:50.090> on<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.359> roller<00:03:50.569> to<00:03:50.989> the

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
amount of ink on the roller to the

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.190 
amount of ink on the roller to the
stiffness<00:03:51.799> of<00:03:51.889> the<00:03:51.950> paper<00:03:52.870> picking<00:03:53.870> up<00:03:54.019> over

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
stiffness of the paper picking up over

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.500 
stiffness of the paper picking up over
that<00:03:54.560> couldn't<00:03:54.980> do<00:03:55.190> it<00:03:55.310> over<00:03:55.489> from<00:03:55.669> stars<00:03:56.209> to

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
that couldn't do it over from stars to

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.020 
that couldn't do it over from stars to
get<00:03:57.379> its<00:03:57.530> flight<00:03:57.829> test<00:04:00.489> now<00:04:01.489> I'm<00:04:01.669> going<00:04:01.879> to

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
get its flight test now I'm going to

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.750 
get its flight test now I'm going to
spray<00:04:02.359> us<00:04:02.510> moon<00:04:02.840> prints<00:04:03.829> with<00:04:04.129> mineral

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
spray us moon prints with mineral

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.550 
spray us moon prints with mineral
spirits<00:04:05.230> paint<00:04:06.230> thinner<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:07.239> that<00:04:08.239> will

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
spirits paint thinner and that will

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.230 
spirits paint thinner and that will
dissolve<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.949> inks<00:04:10.250> and

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
dissolve the inks and

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.480 
dissolve the inks and
essentially<00:04:12.900> change<00:04:13.290> them<00:04:13.470> into<00:04:13.620> dyes<00:04:13.920> so

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
essentially change them into dyes so

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.090 
essentially change them into dyes so
instead<00:04:14.850> of<00:04:14.910> being<00:04:15.150> ink<00:04:15.420> this<00:04:15.770> sitting<00:04:16.770> on<00:04:16.890> top

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
instead of being ink this sitting on top

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.390 
instead of being ink this sitting on top
of<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.280> paper<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:17.700> becomes<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.270> dyed<00:04:19.200> fibers<00:04:19.980> of

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
of the paper it becomes a dyed fibers of

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:36.140 
of the paper it becomes a dyed fibers of
paper<00:04:33.470> so<00:04:34.470> I'm<00:04:34.590> turning<00:04:34.890> it<00:04:34.980> over<00:04:35.010> because<00:04:35.460> the

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
paper so I'm turning it over because the

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.450 
paper so I'm turning it over because the
front<00:04:36.390> of<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.570> paper<00:04:36.780> will<00:04:37.530> print<00:04:37.980> from<00:04:38.280> these

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
front of the paper will print from these

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:46.130 
front of the paper will print from these
blocks<00:04:38.820> here<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:42.960> can<00:04:44.840> pull<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.930> paper

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
blocks here and I can pull the paper

00:04:46.140 --> 00:05:10.910 
blocks here and I can pull the paper
back<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:49.370> now<00:04:51.770> ink<00:04:52.770> all<00:04:53.010> these<00:04:53.220> pieces<00:05:09.920> I'm

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
back and now ink all these pieces I'm

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.990 
back and now ink all these pieces I'm
scraping<00:05:11.660> scraping<00:05:12.660> ink<00:05:12.960> off<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.320> block<00:05:14.000> so

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
scraping scraping ink off the block so

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.510 
scraping scraping ink off the block so
that<00:05:15.110> it<00:05:16.110> won't<00:05:16.290> print<00:05:16.590> so<00:05:17.070> that<00:05:17.250> there'll<00:05:17.460> be

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
that it won't print so that there'll be

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.340 
that it won't print so that there'll be
a<00:05:17.610> white<00:05:17.940> line<00:05:18.240> in<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.660> middle<00:05:18.900> of<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.140> green

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
a white line in the middle of the green

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:47.909 
a white line in the middle of the green
when<00:05:20.070> it<00:05:20.220> print

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:54.610 

I'd<00:05:48.919> like<00:05:49.310> to<00:05:52.389> eat<00:05:53.389> the<00:05:53.720> back<00:05:54.080> of<00:05:54.380> the

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
I'd like to eat the back of the

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.529 
I'd like to eat the back of the
tombstone<00:05:55.340> there<00:05:55.639> and<00:05:56.440> I<00:05:57.819> have<00:05:58.819> no<00:05:59.000> block<00:05:59.240> for

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
tombstone there and I have no block for

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.290 
tombstone there and I have no block for
it<00:05:59.690> but<00:06:00.470> the<00:06:00.680> back<00:06:01.069> of<00:06:01.099> the<00:06:01.550> block<00:06:01.819> that<00:06:02.060> the

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
it but the back of the block that the

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.230 
it but the back of the block that the
this<00:06:02.870> image<00:06:03.199> was<00:06:03.380> pretty<00:06:03.650> from<00:06:03.919> his

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
this image was pretty from his

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.040 
this image was pretty from his
underneath<00:06:05.240> so<00:06:05.599> I'm<00:06:06.080> just<00:06:06.800> going<00:06:07.069> to<00:06:07.630> roll

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
underneath so I'm just going to roll

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.110 
underneath so I'm just going to roll
sepia<00:06:09.500> colored<00:06:09.949> ink<00:06:10.130> over<00:06:10.370> the<00:06:10.639> whole<00:06:10.820> area

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
sepia colored ink over the whole area

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.490 
sepia colored ink over the whole area
and<00:06:11.539> run<00:06:12.289> over<00:06:12.440> the<00:06:12.650> edges<00:06:13.099> just<00:06:13.419> trifle<00:06:14.500> so

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
and run over the edges just trifle so

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.740 
and run over the edges just trifle so
that<00:06:15.830> when<00:06:16.550> it's<00:06:16.849> viewed<00:06:17.180> from<00:06:17.449> the<00:06:17.599> other

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
that when it's viewed from the other

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:41.279 
that when it's viewed from the other
side<00:06:18.050> there'll<00:06:18.349> be<00:06:18.380> a<00:06:18.500> kind<00:06:18.800> of<00:06:18.919> a<00:06:19.039> an<00:06:19.190> outline

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:07:13.210 

we'll<00:06:42.289> pull<00:06:42.560> it<00:06:42.650> off<00:06:42.800> this<00:06:42.949> way<00:07:11.979> that's<00:07:12.979> all

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:13.220 
we'll pull it off this way that's all

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:25.510 
we'll pull it off this way that's all
folks
