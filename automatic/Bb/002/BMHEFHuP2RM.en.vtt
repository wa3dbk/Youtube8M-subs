environment

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
environment

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.009 
environment
was<00:02:21.049> terrible<00:02:21.590> um<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.819> hated<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.480> fact<00:02:23.629> I<00:02:23.840> all

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
was terrible um I hated the fact I all

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.630 
was terrible um I hated the fact I all
the<00:02:24.170> enemies<00:02:24.290> was<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:24.860> much<00:02:25.010> bigger<00:02:25.190> than<00:02:25.370> your

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
the enemies was so much bigger than your

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.699 
the enemies was so much bigger than your
character<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:26.239> it<00:02:26.299> was<00:02:26.390> really<00:02:26.480> hard<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.900> to

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
character so it was really hard to to

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.110 
character so it was really hard to to
fight<00:02:28.069> them<00:02:28.340> because<00:02:28.549> you<00:02:28.640> couldn't<00:02:28.940> see

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
fight them because you couldn't see

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.640 
fight them because you couldn't see
where<00:02:29.420> you're<00:02:29.569> pointing<00:02:29.599> you<00:02:30.319> couldn't<00:02:30.560> see

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
where you're pointing you couldn't see

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.199 
where you're pointing you couldn't see
what<00:02:30.769> you're<00:02:30.890> doing<00:02:31.129> just<00:02:31.940> because<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
what you're doing just because the

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.300 
what you're doing just because the
monsters<00:02:32.540> were<00:02:32.659> so<00:02:32.840> big<00:02:33.049> the<00:02:33.590> stupid<00:02:33.650> hearts

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
monsters were so big the stupid hearts

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.920

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.320 
I'm I think it's a game that you really
have<00:05:45.560> to<00:05:45.770> give<00:05:45.949> yourself<00:05:46.550> some<00:05:46.729> time<00:05:46.760> with<00:05:47.120> and
