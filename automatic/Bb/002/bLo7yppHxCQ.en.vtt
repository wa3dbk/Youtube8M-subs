00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
all different shapes too there's a lot

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.800 
all different shapes too there's a lot
of<00:01:08.850> potential<00:01:09.240> for<00:01:10.729> kind<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> cool<00:01:12.240> lettering

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
of potential for kind of cool lettering

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.520 
of potential for kind of cool lettering
styles<00:01:13.610> I<00:01:14.610> haven't<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.450> tried<00:01:16.140> these<00:01:16.350> out

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
styles I haven't really tried these out

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.850 
styles I haven't really tried these out
too<00:01:16.710> much<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.360> I<00:01:18.360> don't<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.110> any<00:01:19.320> really<00:01:19.830> cool

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
too much so I don't have any really cool

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.050 
too much so I don't have any really cool
lettering<00:01:20.700> styles<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.330> show<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.909> if<00:01:23.909> you

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
lettering styles to show you but if you

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.429 
lettering styles to show you but if you
turn<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> half<00:01:24.570> way<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.320> do

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
turn it half way you see you can do

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.090 
turn it half way you see you can do
different<00:01:25.979> things<00:01:27.680> these<00:01:28.680> markers<00:01:29.009> are

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
different things these markers are

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.190 
different things these markers are
really<00:01:29.579> quite<00:01:30.119> good<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.590> them<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> lot

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
really quite good I do like them a lot

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.679 
really quite good I do like them a lot
but<00:01:34.340> one<00:01:35.340> thing<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.700> say<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
but one thing I have to say is if you

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.719 
but one thing I have to say is if you
rush<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> line<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.070> did<00:01:38.220> there<00:01:38.400> at<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> end

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
rush a line like I did there at the end

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.420 
rush a line like I did there at the end
you<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.150> kind<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> streaks<00:01:40.070> if<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.189> were<00:01:41.310> to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you see it kind of streaks if I were to

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.609 
you see it kind of streaks if I were to
rush<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> line<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> back<00:01:42.780> you

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
rush it a line like this on the back you

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.620 
rush it a line like this on the back you
see<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.890> streaks<00:01:44.280> right<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.670> unless<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
see it streaks right there unless you

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.200 
see it streaks right there unless you
apply<00:01:46.259> pretty<00:01:46.829> even<00:01:47.220> pressure<00:01:47.520> which<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.000> not

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
apply pretty even pressure which is not

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.420 
apply pretty even pressure which is not
easy<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.509> do<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.229> even<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.860> bad<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.250> so

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
easy to do and even it bad it's so

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.730 
easy to do and even it bad it's so
streaks<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.820> little<00:01:51.000> bit<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:52.619> these

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
streaks a little bit so with these

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.139 
streaks a little bit so with these
markers<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.250> take<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> little<00:01:53.610> bit<00:01:53.729> more<00:01:53.880> time

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
markers you take a little bit more time

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.389 
markers you take a little bit more time
but<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.860> worth<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.310> end

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
but it and it's worth it in the end

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.310 
but it and it's worth it in the end
because<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.939> lines<00:01:57.149> are<00:01:57.329> super<00:01:57.990> clean<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
because the lines are super clean and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.840 
because the lines are super clean and
crisp<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.340> would<00:01:59.520> definitely<00:01:59.790> suggest

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
crisp so I would definitely suggest

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.139 
crisp so I would definitely suggest
these<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.600> you're<00:02:01.189> looking<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.399> some<00:02:02.579> stuff

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
these if you're looking for some stuff

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.530 
these if you're looking for some stuff
to<00:02:03.540> do<00:02:03.659> interesting<00:02:03.960> letters<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> bigger

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
to do interesting letters on a bigger

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.469 
to do interesting letters on a bigger
surface<00:02:07.250> for<00:02:08.250> smaller<00:02:08.700> stickers<00:02:09.179> which

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
surface for smaller stickers which

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.510 
surface for smaller stickers which
I'm<00:02:10.929> guessing<00:02:11.230> most<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.530> be<00:02:11.740> using<00:02:12.430> these

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520
