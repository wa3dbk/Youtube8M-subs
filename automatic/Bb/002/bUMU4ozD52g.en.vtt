00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.310
 they are deceased warriors of the country 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.640
 because it was really easy 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.519
 out of the capital with a horse 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.999
 okay you can go two sides on the fiesta so it should not be this way 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:16.529
 to the north I assume 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.999
 pia we are going to the ordinary 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.890
 we're just going to take a look or find something 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.779
 well it just goes well now i just got a few i am not 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:27.539
 caught 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.910
 and I always thought there were silent suppliers that there were many people 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.690
 but if there is no one in sight 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.760
 it was actually for the mac 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.280
 not that I will do it often, well 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.100
 if necessary, of course, simply because 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.260
 i am not a sissy if it is necessary yes why not 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.240
 maybe it is something a tief 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.220
 no i just have to put it out of my mind i just have to focus on 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.480
 this on try I just have to go to the cooling water 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.930
 yes how far can it be i think i'm a chopin the two hours bam hoppa 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.290
 then we are just in that tunnel and then we are just wow it just goes 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.640
 yummy 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.190
 unless it is indeed very far but that is 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.020
 I actually don't think so 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.960
 god urcun here on my horse just end through the same landscape 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.400
 does not end 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.800
 how far it is this gig 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.450
 every time it is just the grassland no other species or so what me 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.110
 maybe a bit crazy idea 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.950
 I don't think I was looking forward to a tent or maybe two hours like that 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.310
 we are in the tunnel 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.450
 it went nice and fast now 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.890
 I have been on the road for five hours now 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.720
 and the leading group no change 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.380
 I would be so happy if I just couldn't see any grass but just too 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.720
 snow or do I know what they think about it right the labels 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.450
 but I always drive you so crazy 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.230
 this is just real 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.330
 they just play a game with stay 9 what's this 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.360
 we finally go to another I go 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.800
 its the end then over 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.069
 ao high 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.969
 the mole was and yes 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:11.709
 I could not have done it 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.749
 it's even harder to continue racing 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.129
 palms 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.129
 already it was a country that I have to go through 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.279
 really no sense 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.929
 in the beginning also to become day 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.929
 what a hell what a hell 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.650
 it has now become the power and I do not want to leave 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.169
 i will make it orange to the core council man man man 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:45.599
 is this again 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.049
 wait a second 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.339
 high trees 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.109
 vegetation 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.179
 will this be it 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.179
 is this actually the jungle 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:58.789
 we are just there 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:01.059
 what do i need now i need now 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:04.059
 tree 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.349
 on the one hand I am so happy we are just buying a while I have junk 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.649
 found it 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:13.069
 and now I just know something that I must do away 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.149
 you know what 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:17.669
 I first go to sleep nice and quiet and then yes 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:22.239
 then we'll see again I'm going to spindle parzival 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.759
 then i just go 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.219
 just into the jungle 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:29.939
 looking after sleeping place
