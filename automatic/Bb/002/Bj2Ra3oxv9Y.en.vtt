00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.490 
going to be better for this game so
anyone<00:02:13.209> that<00:02:13.269> wants<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.870> download<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:14.440> game

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
anyone that wants to download this game

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.180 
anyone that wants to download this game
version<00:02:15.220> 1.8<00:02:15.790> one<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:17.500> suggested<00:02:17.709> that<00:02:18.069> you

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
version 1.8 one it is suggested that you

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.300 
version 1.8 one it is suggested that you
use<00:02:18.430> Jen's<00:02:18.760> for<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.590> some<00:02:20.590> form<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:21.010> Jen's

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
use Jen's for this some form of Jen's

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.759 
use Jen's for this some form of Jen's
would<00:02:21.519> work<00:02:21.700> on<00:02:21.879> this<00:02:22.090> but<00:02:22.930> fusion<00:02:23.379> apparently

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
would work on this but fusion apparently

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.690 
would work on this but fusion apparently
does<00:02:23.890> not<00:02:23.920> comply<00:02:24.459> with<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:24.879> game<00:02:25.540> very<00:02:25.569> well

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
does not comply with this game very well

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.759 
does not comply with this game very well
that's<00:02:27.700> just<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.940> way<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.269> I<00:02:28.590> had<00:02:29.590> this

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
that's just the way it is I had this

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.910 
that's just the way it is I had this
version<00:02:30.220> from<00:02:30.370> like<00:02:30.549> 2008<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.780> yeah<00:02:32.079> that's

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
version from like 2008 so yeah that's

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.850 
version from like 2008 so yeah that's
probably<00:02:33.190> why<00:02:33.690> maybe<00:02:34.690> with<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.019> later<00:02:35.290> fusion

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
probably why maybe with the later fusion

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.960 
probably why maybe with the later fusion
version<00:02:36.160> i<00:02:36.220> probably<00:02:36.400> wouldn't<00:02:36.670> having<00:02:36.910> to

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
version i probably wouldn't having to

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.180 
version i probably wouldn't having to
work<00:02:37.090> but<00:02:37.360> yeah<00:02:37.959> i'll<00:02:38.200> just<00:02:38.410> deal<00:02:38.560> with<00:02:38.709> 1.8

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
work but yeah i'll just deal with 1.8

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.569 
work but yeah i'll just deal with 1.8
i'll<00:02:40.120> just<00:02:40.420> deal<00:02:40.569> with<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.129> glitch<00:02:42.129> that<00:02:42.370> it

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
i'll just deal with the glitch that it

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.089 
i'll just deal with the glitch that it
habits<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.030> i<00:02:43.090> think<00:02:43.299> four<00:02:43.629> zones<00:02:43.950> three<00:02:44.950> or

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
habits and i think four zones three or

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.039 
habits and i think four zones three or
four<00:02:45.430> it's<00:02:46.329> not<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.569> big<00:02:46.989> deal<00:02:47.019> but<00:02:48.900> i'm<00:02:49.900> gonna

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
four it's not a big deal but i'm gonna

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:57.890 
four it's not a big deal but i'm gonna
have<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.230> deal<00:02:50.440> with<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:53.819> do<00:02:54.819> to<00:02:55.629> you<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:56.709> do<00:02:56.920> 250

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
have to deal with it do to you to do 250

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.580 
have to deal with it do to you to do 250
okay<00:02:58.900> here's<00:02:59.049> the<00:02:59.139> way<00:02:59.230> we're<00:02:59.349> going<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.530> do

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
okay here's the way we're going to do

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.050 
okay here's the way we're going to do
this<00:02:59.680> we<00:02:59.829> get<00:02:59.889> this<00:03:00.040> seven<00:03:00.340> Chaos<00:03:00.489> Emeralds

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
this we get this seven Chaos Emeralds

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.849 
this we get this seven Chaos Emeralds
preferably<00:03:01.660> in<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.780> first<00:03:02.019> zone<00:03:02.230> if<00:03:02.530> not<00:03:02.709> the

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
preferably in the first zone if not the

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.270 
preferably in the first zone if not the
second<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:04.349> zoomed<00:03:05.349> to<00:03:05.500> rip<00:03:05.680> through<00:03:05.980> every

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
second it zoomed to rip through every

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.830 
second it zoomed to rip through every
zone<00:03:06.459> is<00:03:06.609> supersonic<00:03:07.060> will<00:03:07.359> go<00:03:07.480> through<00:03:07.690> the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
zone is supersonic will go through the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.039 
zone is supersonic will go through the
extras<00:03:08.650> owns<00:03:08.859> a<00:03:09.190> little<00:03:09.489> slower<00:03:09.870> just<00:03:10.870> for<00:03:10.959> the

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
extras owns a little slower just for the

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.460 
extras owns a little slower just for the
purposes<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:12.150> because<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:13.480> is<00:03:13.630> long<00:03:13.930> version

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
purposes of because this is long version

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.909 
purposes of because this is long version
you<00:03:14.650> know<00:03:14.769> there<00:03:15.130> are<00:03:15.160> extra<00:03:15.609> zones<00:03:15.880> involved

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
you know there are extra zones involved

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.379 
you know there are extra zones involved
these<00:03:17.919> are<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.160> zones<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.730> were<00:03:18.910> taken<00:03:19.299> out

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
these are the zones that were taken out

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.020 
these are the zones that were taken out
of<00:03:19.419> the<00:03:19.599> beta<00:03:19.810> from<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.500> beta<00:03:20.680> from<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.639> final

of the beta from the beta from the final

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.780 
of the beta from the beta from the final
they<00:03:22.959> were<00:03:23.019> taken<00:03:23.410> out<00:03:23.500> from<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.859> final<00:03:24.280> they

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
they were taken out from the final they

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.250 
they were taken out from the final they
were<00:03:24.849> from<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.239> beta<00:03:25.450> like<00:03:25.750> hidden<00:03:26.049> Palace

actually<00:03:29.019> never<00:03:29.290> was<00:03:29.470> made<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:29.829> is<00:03:29.980> just<00:03:30.130> a

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
actually never was made this is just a

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.400 
actually never was made this is just a
version<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.880> genocide<00:03:31.569> city's<00:03:31.900> own<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.260> was

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
version of genocide city's own that was

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.729 
version of genocide city's own that was
made<00:03:32.709> by<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:34.299> hacker<00:03:34.480> himself<00:03:35.019> i<00:03:35.109> guess<00:03:35.290> i'm

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
made by the hacker himself i guess i'm

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.440 
made by the hacker himself i guess i'm
just<00:03:35.799> i'm<00:03:36.190> assuming<00:03:36.549> it<00:03:36.880> was<00:03:37.030> made<00:03:37.209> by<00:03:37.389> the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
just i'm assuming it was made by the

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.949 
just i'm assuming it was made by the
hacker<00:03:37.630> I<00:03:39.209> don't<00:03:40.209> I<00:03:40.359> don't<00:03:40.389> need<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.780> see

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
hacker I don't I don't need to see

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.830 
hacker I don't I don't need to see
hacker<00:03:41.230> in<00:03:41.440> a<00:03:41.530> bad<00:03:41.739> thing<00:03:42.130> though<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:43.690> know

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
hacker in a bad thing though you know

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.120 
hacker in a bad thing though you know
when<00:03:44.019> you<00:03:44.109> trying<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.440> hack<00:03:44.590> a<00:03:44.620> game<00:03:44.889> it's

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
when you trying to hack a game it's

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
when you trying to hack a game it's
differently<00:03:45.489> trying<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.819> hack<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:45.940> computer

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
differently trying to hack a computer

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.720 
differently trying to hack a computer
it's<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.840> little<00:03:47.019> bit<00:03:47.109> different<00:03:47.639> when<00:03:48.639> you

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
it's a little bit different when you

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.190 
it's a little bit different when you
have<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:49.000> game<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.389> could<00:03:49.480> be<00:03:49.630> for<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.840> very<00:03:50.079> good

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
have to game it could be for a very good

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.690 
have to game it could be for a very good
reason<00:03:50.349> when<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.739> hack<00:03:50.889> a<00:03:50.919> computer<00:03:51.129> could<00:03:51.579> be

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
reason when you hack a computer could be

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.879 
reason when you hack a computer could be
a<00:03:51.730> very<00:03:51.910> for<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.239> very<00:03:52.480> bad<00:03:52.720> reason<00:03:53.079> I<00:03:53.290> just

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
a very for a very bad reason I just

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.309 
a very for a very bad reason I just
missed<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.129> check<00:03:54.340> why<00:03:54.489> didn't<00:03:54.760> I

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
missed the check why didn't I

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.500 
missed the check why didn't I
I<00:03:55.549> haven't<00:03:56.549> missed<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.819> checkpoint<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.359> right

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
I haven't missed a checkpoint in right

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.259 
I haven't missed a checkpoint in right
hand<00:03:57.719> and<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:57.930> forgot<00:03:58.200> about<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.469> I<00:03:59.209> think<00:04:00.209> I

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
hand and I forgot about it I think I

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.059 
hand and I forgot about it I think I
missed<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.659> so<00:04:01.319> yeah<00:04:01.760> exactly<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:03.829> could<00:04:04.829> find

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
missed it so yeah exactly I could find
