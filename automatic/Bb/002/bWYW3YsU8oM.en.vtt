00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
did if you remember we had that strip of

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.470 
did if you remember we had that strip of
wood<00:00:15.330> along<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.870> bottom<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:17.119> bottom<00:00:18.119> right

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
wood along the bottom and bottom right

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.019 
wood along the bottom and bottom right
here<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.680> was<00:00:19.770> holding<00:00:20.189> up<00:00:20.369> all<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.820> tile

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
here and it was holding up all the tile

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.000 
here and it was holding up all the tile
here<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.480> mean<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.720> didn't<00:00:22.199> need<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.769> anymore

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
here I mean it didn't need to anymore

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.759 
here I mean it didn't need to anymore
the<00:00:23.340> tile<00:00:23.609> was<00:00:23.850> set<00:00:24.090> after<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:25.289> know<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> day

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the tile was set after you know a day

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.109 
the tile was set after you know a day
but<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> left<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.699> there

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
but I left it there

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.769 
but I left it there
so<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.630> took<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.109> wood<00:00:28.320> out<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.390> you<00:00:30.390> know<00:00:30.510> cut

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
so I took the wood out and you know cut

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.250 
so I took the wood out and you know cut
all<00:00:30.929> these<00:00:31.140> all<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.160> bottom<00:00:32.489> layer<00:00:32.669> tiled

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
all these all the the bottom layer tiled

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.500 
all these all the the bottom layer tiled
but<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.380> kind<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.270> you<00:00:36.270> got<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
but you kind of have to do you got to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.110 
but you kind of have to do you got to
measure<00:00:36.660> each<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.200> because<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.430> bathtub

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
measure each one because the the bathtub

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.619 
measure each one because the the bathtub
isn't<00:00:39.420> perfectly<00:00:39.809> level<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:41.270> made<00:00:42.270> all<00:00:42.450> those

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
isn't perfectly level so made all those

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.440 
isn't perfectly level so made all those
cuts<00:00:42.989> first<00:00:43.320> which<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.399> good<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.969> then<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.210> use

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
cuts first which is good and then we use

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.930 
cuts first which is good and then we use
this<00:00:47.420> this<00:00:48.440> pre-mixed<00:00:49.440> thin<00:00:49.770> set<00:00:50.100> stuff<00:00:50.460> from

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
this this pre-mixed thin set stuff from

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.240 
this this pre-mixed thin set stuff from
Home<00:00:51.149> Depot<00:00:51.379> rather<00:00:52.379> than<00:00:52.710> buying<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
Home Depot rather than buying the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.240 
Home Depot rather than buying the
50-pound<00:00:53.879> bag<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.739> thin<00:00:55.739> said<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.160> have

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
50-pound bag of thin said that you have

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.670 
50-pound bag of thin said that you have
to<00:00:56.399> mix<00:00:56.610> manually<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.379> would<00:00:58.530> been

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
to mix manually because that would been

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.380 
to mix manually because that would been
too<00:00:58.920> much<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.870> put<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.739> over<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:03.030> put

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
too much so so put that over here put

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.359 
too much so so put that over here put
the<00:01:03.510> tile<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.350> worked<00:01:04.559> well<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.189> then<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the tile up that worked well and then I

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.670 
the tile up that worked well and then I
cut<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> wood<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.400> melted<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.680> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
cut the wood and melted it here and and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.760 
cut the wood and melted it here and and
over<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:12.119> support<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.290> bullnose

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
over here to support the the bullnose

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.609 
over here to support the the bullnose
tile<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.900> you

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
tile which all that is is just a you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.920 
tile which all that is is just a you
know<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:17.009> sliver<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> main<00:01:18.030> tile<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
know a sliver of the main tile with a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.660 
know a sliver of the main tile with a
decorative<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:20.130> rounded<00:01:20.909> edge<00:01:21.200> so<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.920> put<00:01:23.189> all

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
decorative or rounded edge so so put all

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.539 
decorative or rounded edge so so put all
that<00:01:24.000> tile<00:01:24.479> up<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:25.439> there's<00:01:26.159> nothing

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
that tile up and then there's nothing

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.850 
that tile up and then there's nothing
supporting<00:01:26.729> these<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.439> used<00:01:28.680> some

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
supporting these so we just used some

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.910 
supporting these so we just used some
painters<00:01:29.280> tape<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:30.020> sit<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.259> get<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.799> it

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
painters tape to sit to get it so it

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.520 
painters tape to sit to get it so it
wouldn't<00:01:32.189> fall<00:01:32.460> down<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.140> worked<00:01:34.320> out

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
wouldn't fall down and that worked out

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.600 
wouldn't fall down and that worked out
really<00:01:34.710> well<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.299> only<00:01:36.960> areum<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:38.250> know<00:01:38.369> we'll

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
really well so only areum you know we'll

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.510 
really well so only areum you know we'll
have<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> see<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.329> here<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.829> know<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.159> angle

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
have to see is here you know the angle

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.069 
have to see is here you know the angle
didn't<00:01:41.939> quite<00:01:42.180> work<00:01:42.360> right<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> think

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
didn't quite work right but I think

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.469 
didn't quite work right but I think
maybe<00:01:43.439> after<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> fill<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:45.149> ground

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
maybe after I fill it with with ground

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.219 
maybe after I fill it with with ground
it<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.720> little<00:01:46.020> turn<00:01:46.259> out<00:01:46.470> okay<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:49.110> know

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
it a little turn out okay so you know

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.310 
it a little turn out okay so you know
it's<00:01:49.350> been<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.530> day<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.759> thinset<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
it's been a day and the thinset is a you

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.200 
it's been a day and the thinset is a you
know<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.590> certainly<00:01:53.189> getting<00:01:53.369> harder<00:01:53.909> but

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
know it's certainly getting harder but

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.020 
know it's certainly getting harder but
you<00:01:54.630> know<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.710> pre-mixed<00:01:56.460> stuff<00:01:56.700> takes

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
you know this pre-mixed stuff takes

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.510 
you know this pre-mixed stuff takes
takes<00:01:57.689> longer<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> set<00:01:58.469> than<00:01:58.770> than<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.369> other

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
takes longer to set than than the other

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.550 
takes longer to set than than the other
like<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> 50-pound<00:02:00.570> bag<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.140> I'm<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.439> to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
like the 50-pound bag so I'm going to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.410 
like the 50-pound bag so I'm going to
need<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.250> give<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.520> probably<00:02:02.820> another<00:02:03.000> day

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
need to give it probably another day

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.469 
need to give it probably another day
maybe<00:02:03.689> two<00:02:04.049> before<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:04.770> set<00:02:05.670> enough<00:02:06.090> where

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
maybe two before it's set enough where
