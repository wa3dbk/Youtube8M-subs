can<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.360> guess<00:02:22.870> we<00:02:23.560> can<00:02:23.709> go<00:02:23.859> take<00:02:24.040> off<00:02:24.160> that

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
can I guess we can go take off that

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.270 
can I guess we can go take off that
front<00:02:24.579> fan<00:02:24.880> there<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.720> then<00:02:26.680> we<00:02:26.769> can<00:02:26.920> take<00:02:27.100> out

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
front fan there and then we can take out

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.620 
front fan there and then we can take out
the<00:02:27.340> hard<00:02:27.489> drives<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:27.940> actually<00:02:28.390> we<00:02:28.450> get<00:02:28.540> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
the hard drives so actually we get the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.599 
the hard drives so actually we get the
hard<00:02:28.780> drives<00:02:28.989> right<00:02:29.140> now<00:02:29.320> let's<00:02:30.280> go<00:02:30.370> ahead<00:02:30.519> and

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
hard drives right now let's go ahead and

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:35.840 
hard drives right now let's go ahead and
do<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:32.549> okay<00:02:33.549> well<00:02:33.880> we<00:02:34.000> got<00:02:34.150> one<00:02:34.510> out<00:02:34.840> here

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
do that okay well we got one out here

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.990 
do that okay well we got one out here
it's<00:02:36.850> loose<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.420> it's<00:02:37.600> getting<00:02:38.730> all<00:02:39.730> right<00:02:39.910> we

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
it's loose and it's getting all right we

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.020 
it's loose and it's getting all right we
got<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.859> now<00:02:41.859> this<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.400> one<00:02:42.700> terabyte

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
got that now this is the one terabyte

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.009 
got that now this is the one terabyte
that<00:02:43.180> was<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.720> top<00:02:44.370> Western<00:02:45.370> Digital

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
that was on the top Western Digital

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.670 
that was on the top Western Digital
black<00:02:47.019> I<00:02:48.480> can't<00:02:49.480> remember<00:02:49.630> what<00:02:49.840> yep<00:02:50.109> caviar

black I can't remember what yep caviar
black<00:02:51.040> down<00:02:51.340> there<00:02:51.660> one<00:02:52.660> terabyte<00:02:53.819> let's<00:02:54.819> go

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
black down there one terabyte let's go

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.430 
black down there one terabyte let's go
ahead<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.239> move<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.750> off<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.170> side<00:02:56.230> and

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
ahead and move that off to the side and

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.539 
ahead and move that off to the side and
get<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:56.620> other<00:02:56.769> one<00:02:56.980> out<00:02:59.160> okay<00:03:00.160> something's

sorry guys I kind of knew that but I
guess<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.489> was<00:03:21.609> just<00:03:21.639> thinking<00:03:22.030> like<00:03:22.150> standard

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
guess I was just thinking like standard

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.930 
guess I was just thinking like standard
sizes<00:03:23.049> yep

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
sizes yep

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.490 
sizes yep
640<00:03:24.940> gigabytes<00:03:25.329> so

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
640 gigabytes so

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.000 
640 gigabytes so
I<00:03:26.640> don't<00:03:27.640> know<00:03:27.700> that<00:03:27.970> wasn't<00:03:28.210> enough<00:03:28.390> for<00:03:28.540> me

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
I don't know that wasn't enough for me

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.180 
I don't know that wasn't enough for me
and<00:03:30.330> now<00:03:31.330> we<00:03:31.390> can<00:03:31.720> actually<00:03:31.930> make<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.920> the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
and now we can actually make it to the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.650 
and now we can actually make it to the
motherboard<00:03:33.550> or<00:03:33.970> we<00:03:34.180> can<00:03:34.270> take<00:03:34.390> out<00:03:34.540> these

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
motherboard or we can take out these

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.660 
motherboard or we can take out these
front<00:03:34.900> header<00:03:35.080> cables<00:03:35.470> here<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.400> they<00:03:36.460> just

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
front header cables here and they just

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.890 
front header cables here and they just
come<00:03:36.880> out<00:03:37.000> they<00:03:37.120> don't<00:03:37.240> have<00:03:37.360> any<00:03:37.480> clips<00:03:37.720> or

stuff I showed you in the other video
which<00:03:55.270> this<00:03:55.420> motherboard<00:03:55.780> does<00:03:56.110> not<00:03:56.320> support

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
which this motherboard does not support

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.920 
which this motherboard does not support
so<00:03:56.980> we're<00:03:57.160> gonna<00:03:57.250> have<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.610> you<00:03:58.570> know<00:03:58.600> wait

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
till that new motherboard comes in so I

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.479 
till that new motherboard comes in so I
can<00:04:00.880> use<00:04:01.030> all<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.330> functions<00:04:02.050> on<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:02.739> new

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
can use all the functions on this new

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.100 
can use all the functions on this new
case<00:04:03.700> that<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:03.940> have<00:04:04.120> but<00:04:04.660> anyway<00:04:04.870> let's<00:04:05.020> go

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
go ahead and get to those ok so now that

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.130 
go ahead and get to those ok so now that
we've<00:04:27.580> got<00:04:27.730> all<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.000> screws<00:04:28.210> taken<00:04:28.720> out<00:04:28.900> of

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
we've got all the screws taken out of

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.860 
we've got all the screws taken out of
that<00:04:29.530> we<00:04:29.800> can<00:04:29.980> pick<00:04:30.729> up<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:31.300> motherboard

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
that we can pick up the motherboard

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.890 
that we can pick up the motherboard
hopefully<00:04:32.590> unless<00:04:32.890> I<00:04:33.040> missed<00:04:33.310> one<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.900> yep

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
hopefully unless I missed one and yep

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.020 
hopefully unless I missed one and yep
actually<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.500> did<00:04:35.830> let's<00:04:36.520> go<00:04:36.669> ahead<00:04:36.729> and<00:04:36.940> get

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
actually I did let's go ahead and get

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.960 
actually I did let's go ahead and get
that<00:04:37.090> last<00:04:37.540> one<00:04:37.930> here<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:41.490> then<00:04:42.490> we<00:04:42.669> can<00:04:42.820> pick

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
that last one here and then we can pick

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.300 
that last one here and then we can pick
up<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.210> motherboard<00:04:43.740> all<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.830> screws<00:04:45.100> on

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
up the motherboard all the screws on

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.130 
up the motherboard all the screws on
here<00:04:45.550> are<00:04:45.729> still<00:04:46.030> left<00:04:46.210> in<00:04:46.390> because<00:04:46.660> this<00:04:46.840> rear

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
here are still left in because this rear

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.140 
here are still left in because this rear
driver<00:04:47.350> is<00:04:47.560> not<00:04:47.770> magnetized<00:04:48.400> a<00:04:48.580> lot<00:04:48.880> of<00:04:48.940> screws

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
driver is not magnetized a lot of screws

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.300 
driver is not magnetized a lot of screws
going<00:04:49.360> everywhere<00:04:49.780> and<00:04:50.710> I'm<00:04:50.950> touching<00:04:51.250> the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
going everywhere and I'm touching the

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.890 
going everywhere and I'm touching the
case<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:52.600> no<00:04:53.320> static<00:04:53.800> all<00:04:53.950> that<00:04:54.130> stuff<00:04:54.900> and

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
case to no static all that stuff and

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.180 
case to no static all that stuff and
lift<00:04:56.830> up<00:04:57.040> my<00:04:57.190> motherboard<00:04:58.860> ok<00:04:59.860> let's<00:05:00.010> go<00:05:00.100> ahead

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
lift up my motherboard ok let's go ahead

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.180 
lift up my motherboard ok let's go ahead
and<00:05:00.340> set<00:05:00.520> this<00:05:00.669> on<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:00.910> case<00:05:01.770> you<00:05:02.770> know<00:05:02.919> one

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
and set this on the case you know one

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.409 
and set this on the case you know one
thing<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.400> didn't<00:05:03.669> think<00:05:03.729> about<00:05:03.970> is<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.270> case

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
thing I didn't think about is the case

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.030 
thing I didn't think about is the case
actually<00:05:04.690> I<00:05:04.930> guess<00:05:05.200> wouldn't<00:05:05.500> take<00:05:05.710> away<00:05:05.919> any

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
actually I guess wouldn't take away any

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.060 
actually I guess wouldn't take away any
static<00:05:06.490> because<00:05:07.080> it's<00:05:08.080> not<00:05:08.410> plugged<00:05:08.680> in<00:05:08.890> so

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
static because it's not plugged in so

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.580 
static because it's not plugged in so
it's<00:05:09.190> not<00:05:09.340> grounded<00:05:09.820> so<00:05:10.660> hopefully<00:05:11.200> I<00:05:11.229> haven't

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
it's not grounded so hopefully I haven't

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.920 
it's not grounded so hopefully I haven't
messed<00:05:11.830> up<00:05:12.010> anything<00:05:12.340> here<00:05:12.960> oh<00:05:14.610> well<00:05:15.930> cheap

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
messed up anything here oh well cheap

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.320 
messed up anything here oh well cheap
motherboard<00:05:17.380> anyway<00:05:17.729> there<00:05:18.729> you<00:05:18.790> go<00:05:18.910> you<00:05:19.180> got

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
motherboard anyway there you go you got

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.250 
motherboard anyway there you go you got
it<00:05:19.360> out<00:05:19.740> ASIS<00:05:20.740> like<00:05:20.979> I<00:05:21.100> said<00:05:21.900> made<00:05:22.900> everything

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
it out ASIS like I said made everything

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.500 
it out ASIS like I said made everything
on<00:05:23.410> here<00:05:23.560> stump<00:05:24.070> all<00:05:24.220> screws

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.440 

all<00:05:29.510> right<00:05:29.690> get<00:05:29.960> them<00:05:30.170> off<00:05:30.320> so<00:05:30.500> now<00:05:31.180> we'll<00:05:32.180> go

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
all right get them off so now we'll go

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:52.119 
all right get them off so now we'll go
ahead<00:05:32.480> and<00:05:32.720> move<00:05:33.200> this<00:05:33.440> on<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.890> the<00:05:34.040> other<00:05:34.160> case

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:52.129
