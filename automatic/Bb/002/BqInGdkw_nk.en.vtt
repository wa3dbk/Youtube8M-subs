this only works in for v4s and basically

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.820 
this only works in for v4s and basically
things<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.699> just<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> time<00:00:27.210> limit

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
things that just have a time limit

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.820 
things that just have a time limit
alright<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.630> first<00:00:31.080> thing<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.410> must<00:00:31.560> do

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.869 
was just fooling around and then I just
found<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.980> yeah<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.860> don't<00:00:52.860> use<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.370> unless<00:00:53.520> I

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
found it so yeah I don't use it unless I

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.720 
found it so yeah I don't use it unless I
get<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.390> really<00:00:55.289> frustrated<00:00:56.190> which
