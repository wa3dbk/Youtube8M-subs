a<00:00:39.720> bit<00:00:40.080> of<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.260> surprise<00:00:40.380> to<00:00:40.680> me<00:00:41.870> that<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.170> it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
a bit of a surprise to me that you it

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.590 
a bit of a surprise to me that you it
was<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.980> was<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.130> rasmussen<00:00:44.490> poll<00:00:44.700> congressman

was it was a rasmussen poll congressman
yeah<00:00:45.960> oh<00:00:45.990> yeah<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.590> was<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> surprise<00:00:46.920> evening

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
yeah oh yeah it was a surprise evening

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.270 
yeah oh yeah it was a surprise evening
that<00:00:47.550> they<00:00:47.670> ran<00:00:47.880> the<00:00:48.000> pole<00:00:48.210> no<00:00:48.720> I<00:00:49.040> guess<00:00:50.040> it's<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
that they ran the pole no I guess it's a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.790 
that they ran the pole no I guess it's a
pleasant<00:00:50.490> surprise<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.990> don't<00:00:52.530> know<00:00:52.620> what

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
pleasant surprise but I don't know what

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.310 
pleasant surprise but I don't know what
that<00:00:52.950> means<00:00:53.330> since<00:00:54.330> I'm<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.720> a<00:00:54.750> candidate<00:00:55.260> for

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
that means since I'm not a candidate for

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.230 
that means since I'm not a candidate for
anything<00:00:55.710> except<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.520> get<00:00:56.670> reelected<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
anything except to get reelected to

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.720 
anything except to get reelected to
Congress<00:00:57.720> so<00:00:57.900> I<00:00:58.410> guess<00:00:58.920> I'll<00:00:59.100> work<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.670> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
Congress so I guess I'll work on that

before<00:04:27.199> our<00:04:27.469> history<00:04:28.039> and<00:04:28.189> it<00:04:28.580> said<00:04:28.729> it's<00:04:28.939> a

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
before our history and it said it's a

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.209 
before our history and it said it's a
national<00:04:29.330> socialist<00:04:30.199> system<00:04:30.379> that<00:04:30.770> they<00:04:30.949> have

national socialist system that they have
then<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:31.879> it<00:04:32.509> comes<00:04:32.810> closer<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.289> sort<00:04:33.800> of

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
then and it comes closer to sort of

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.700 
then and it comes closer to sort of
economic<00:04:34.340> fascism<00:04:35.120> rather<00:04:35.360> than<00:04:35.599> the<00:04:36.560> old

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
economic fascism rather than the old

economic fascism rather than the old
line<00:04:38.139> socialism<00:04:39.139> but<00:04:39.560> either<00:04:39.860> way<00:04:40.249> it's<00:04:40.550> very

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
line socialism but either way it's very

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:42.730 
line socialism but either way it's very
dangerous<00:04:41.389> because<00:04:41.419> it<00:04:41.870> undermines<00:04:42.110> liberty

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
dangerous because it undermines liberty

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.439 
dangerous because it undermines liberty
and<00:04:42.919> it<00:04:43.310> destroys<00:04:43.699> the<00:04:43.909> productive<00:04:44.419> capacity

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
and it destroys the productive capacity

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.869 
and it destroys the productive capacity

starting all over again but the young
people<00:05:28.729> of<00:05:28.789> this<00:05:28.939> country<00:05:29.180> are<00:05:29.629> very<00:05:30.080> much

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
people of this country are very much

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.320 
people of this country are very much
attuned<00:05:30.830> to<00:05:31.009> what<00:05:31.129> I'm<00:05:31.250> talking<00:05:31.610> about<00:05:31.729> they

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
attuned to what I'm talking about they

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.059 
attuned to what I'm talking about they
know<00:05:32.509> the<00:05:32.750> seriousness<00:05:32.990> of<00:05:33.319> the<00:05:33.439> problem<00:05:33.469> and

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:34.069

they're<00:05:34.430> getting<00:05:34.669> involved<00:05:35.300> and<00:05:35.810> I<00:05:36.199> think<00:05:36.710> our

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
they're getting involved and I think our

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.100 
they're getting involved and I think our
fight<00:05:37.039> is<00:05:37.069> intellectual<00:05:37.939> and<00:05:38.149> it<00:05:38.599> has<00:05:38.779> to<00:05:38.960> do

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
fight is intellectual and it has to do

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.719 
fight is intellectual and it has to do
with<00:05:39.289> whether<00:05:39.529> you<00:05:39.770> accept<00:05:40.039> free<00:05:40.399> market

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
with whether you accept free market

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.939 
with whether you accept free market
economics<00:05:41.240> and<00:05:41.449> reject<00:05:41.899> what<00:05:42.289> we've<00:05:42.469> all<00:05:42.680> been

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
economics and reject what we've all been

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.469 
economics and reject what we've all been
taught<00:05:43.159> for<00:05:43.399> so<00:05:43.520> long<00:05:43.729> the<00:05:43.939> Keynesian

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
taught for so long the Keynesian

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.749 
taught for so long the Keynesian
approach<00:05:44.539> to<00:05:44.930> economics<00:05:45.439> and<00:05:45.589> socialism<00:05:45.979> and

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
approach to economics and socialism and

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.010 
approach to economics and socialism and
when<00:05:46.939> they<00:05:47.060> reject<00:05:47.449> that<00:05:47.599> and<00:05:47.750> I<00:05:47.779> think<00:05:47.960> the

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
when they reject that and I think the

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.869 
when they reject that and I think the
young<00:05:48.199> people<00:05:48.560> will<00:05:48.740> so<00:05:48.979> I'm<00:05:49.159> optimistic<00:05:49.339> on
