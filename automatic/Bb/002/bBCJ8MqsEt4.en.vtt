00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.910
 Hello everyone, p is the eighth 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.850
 review mods to today's TB game 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.189
 new dimension and allow you to create 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.840
 teleportation points where when you click 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.760
 on the right mouse button you will 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.890
 teleport but more on that later 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.960
 for a start, let's take a look at what's in 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.869
 This mod has a new block 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.070
 there is a new lighter 2 magic wands 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.290
 teleported teleporter and 2 new ore 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.960
 Well, let's get started for a start, I think 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.969
 everyone would like to see a new dimension 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.760
 edges more precisely done but not crafted 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.850
 done well as the gates to hell only from 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.570
 this unit do it by the way from here 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.899
 this ore 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.969
 they are a little higher later and it lights up 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.109
 pass only this lighter to open 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.430
 we opened the portal of course not very 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:07.880
 textured mts or less 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:11.420
 enter it here we load the world goes 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.040
 that's how we see some pale 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.650
 addict just a dimension where 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.689
 share on trees grow obsidian 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.290
 more precisely obsidian and that is foliage 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.369
 of trees 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.920
 the earth is kind of green and plaguey just 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.080
 somehow not at all clear to me why 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.960
 so made nevertheless this looks 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.150
 will still be beautiful and obsidian we are here 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.240
 we can get too much is cool 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.970
 so obsidian is the most problematic blog 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.590
 in my opinion, not counting the diamond 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.630
 let's look at all that this 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.180
 Is it possible from this that to craft 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.700
 Immediately I will say nothing of this 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.030
 it is impossible but just textures to the ground and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.070
 pretty pretty and even in the hands and 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.549
 you can make a house out of it 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.280
 it will be a shame to add it to your home design 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.730
 there on the floor or somewhere else 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.220
 Further 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.710
 well, obsidian is understandable and camille 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.770
 Actually, too, he is more I think here 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.930
 nothing new and no okay back in 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.350
 our ordinary world and continue to explore 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:18.600
 this mod so here in the ordinary world here 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.490
 so on there is still this 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.710
 lighter which is painted from one 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.260
 silicon and one diamond in principle not 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.200
 very expensive kravets but all the same and 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.780
 the easiest further on we have two 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.110
 teleport parent parasitic shelves 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.860
 what do they do first stick 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.560
 this one will be like a gate 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.020
 you only mini it actually serves 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.260
 to teleport to hell and click back 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.360
 on the right mouse button and as you can see 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.110
 on fat is porting another world such in from 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.360
 press it again and it will port it 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.010
 back is very good for those who 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.400
 lost in hell 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.110
 he dofiga things are well, that further 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.080
 further we have another stick she 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.630
 more interesting teleportator our what is he 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.380
 being done for starters let's take us 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.330
 workbench and see by the way that's how not 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.160
 crafted first crafted from this ore 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.120
 and which also will tell later 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.180
 remelted and people ore and this 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.040
 teleportator kraft behind and 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.790
 next let's take us now 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.470
 items needed for this 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:37.050
 I think enough so that there still had to 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:40.560
 and ore teleports 4 enough so 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.620
 put the workbench here right here and 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.100
 so here we turn off the creative q and 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.640
 now see what we have for example 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.970
 we want to make a teleport point to our 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.710
 house 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.380
 to make it kraft 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.950
 our magic stick here this us 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.960
 principle is not necessary here kraftym and by the way 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.010
 this is no ordinary package obsidian well and shelves 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.260
 they kravets of two obsidian ups and 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.070
 like this and now see what will happen to 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.260
 painted 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.910
 took it back so here's how you see 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.310
 after first pressing the right button 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.810
 mice 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.700
 we will be teleported to where we are 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.710
 they clicked on it now 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:31.900
 one time scrafty so here and here 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:35.920
 so we take a breakaway save. 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.890
 still germ sophia workbenches it get and 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.050
 right click all item 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.120
 ready such sticks can be made 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.830
 somewhat so the main thing is not 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.530
 to confuse 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.320
 he makes another stick here we put it 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.650
 here and put a teleport point 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.860
 for example, right over here 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.560
 and now look at this stick 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.430
 here this here is just very cool 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.710
 because you can do points in the mines 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.110
 plowed how can you make a point in 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.570
 mines at home and anywhere just 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.070
 and you just have to go kilometers 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.380
 or drive on a trolley to 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.030
 get somewhere 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.950
 so we still have it in this mod and also 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.970
 we have in the museum sphere you as I said 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:24.640
 and where to find them and how to use them 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.650
 so these two happy I see more precisely I 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.840
 I think you already know him because I 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.190
 showed craft and with them where to find them 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.320
 here is this labor trailer chance she already 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.680
 pereplavlen I give them show her out 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.710
 remelted in the form here it is not 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:47.740
 submitted form you can find it in 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:51.430
 mines uhty how lucky I am for so I am so 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.410
 I understand this is some kind of cache 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.290
 Of course I will not look but nevertheless 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.150
 just try we just walk by 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.430
 to mines and we can find such a block 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.480
 on motives can be as I remember 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.280
 iron pick 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.849
 let's try stone in order 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.059
 to find out whether 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:15.679
 we are on the pick of these mods 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:16.219
 of no, I was wrong, you can even stone 

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:18.409
 pickax 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.550
 as you saw she falls not one by one 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:22.999
 piece a few 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.580
 this is good further on we still have 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:30.919
 one ore I think you are already in her mind field 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:34.099
 for what it is necessary to look for in hell yes her 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:36.050
 we break so accidentally not so broke 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.729
 remove the team q it is also possible 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.029
 principle to break a pick 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:42.919
 there are a few of them too 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:44.749
 it is necessary to craft here 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.800
 such blocks of which were made and 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:50.209
 portal is being made 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.669
 so night it is not necessary here as you see it 

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:54.589
 just very cool that craft is not at all 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:57.619
 very expensive but still very 

00:06:54.589 --> 00:07:00.259
 significant ten blocks for some 

00:06:57.619 --> 00:07:02.869
 gate watt more accurately in this new dimension 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:04.849
 well on this mod ends with 

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:07.809
 you were an aster subscribe to the channel 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:07.809
 put your likes for now
