00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.720
 everyone is welcome on the youtube channel of, among other things, discussed about pigs I can do that 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.530
 not and why would I help you not to deal with 4 2 there 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.510
 get videos for you every day about smartphones, tablet accessories and 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.490
 basically everything that has to do with it shares around three every day of the week 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.040
 a video in the afternoon and nine in the morning and I have 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.090
 that is shown on Saturday against those who go through the week and then take a look 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.390
 tell you something about a new survey in the telecom industry 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.610
 in this video we will tell something more than for ourselves and also 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.690
 let's see where we actually already that was shooting video and how that one 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.840
 little bacon goes 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.250
 I have been interested in all platforms at draco for over a year now 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.319
 how it all started 

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:49.909
 yes hm i am happy with a cell almost five years that i have been active here dani l something 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.829
 longer being imposed there I might not be there 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.789
 that is not so very much anyway at least he has imposed it and 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.489
 then I came fairly quickly and in principle just as simply to this 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.320
 business and types of a satisfied that already exists no longer and there 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.200
 More and more songs and other things have been added since a year or so 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.869
 three also have this youtube channel after a year here you can of course 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.340
 daily videos of us as you are used abuja everyone is always 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.159
 wondering how make-up reviews work a bit on the job site 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.170
 easier phone in and then depending on whether you are important or 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.060
 not a flagship is easy review but give us first impression and 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.710
 then one of our editor ps anthony roux fictional on the phone 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.429
 to work 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.360
 stopping was the use of alcohol as if it is our landline 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.110
 and actually during everyday use for years we actually go 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.390
 weird yes look what our findings are and must find phone built is one 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.810
 works a bit pleasant or holds it a bit pleasant actually use it 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.120
 just like you do and we just make our own yes impression there 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.540
 then we write of it 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.140
 and of course write a written review of it and make it in the movies 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.710
 In addition, always try to make a few comparison with the telephone 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.320
 and how can one be old phones and that is actually very simple guess one 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.770
 manufacturer who prefers devices available for wessels neighborhood that 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.709
 get up to date and that will be right year after year from which sometimes less 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.910
 long and then finally keep it up we are going to send them back the fight is over 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.300
 unfortunately not either and those raffles that question we get missed it does not work 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.839
 to become 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.680
 heumen and yes it works a bit it is now high time for the 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:26.149
 tours and that is not going to do and I go behind the camera to dominik 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:28.219
 prince to follow therein 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.219
 and quickly address the camera of the certificate when this is not feasible 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.230
 to hang a sandwich ball 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.430
 Amsterdam are both easy to understand than the videos one gets with 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.289
 handsome I thought they are alone 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.969
 that backlog of our devices in a decor and everyone also wonders 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.499
 whether that really will be no these are not real devices 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.939
 just this not to real device had first only there goes the screen 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.489
 just way too fast so it didn't work out according to ours here 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.039
 her second room 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.079
 with a screen so that we can see everything in a good view 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:02:59.609
 is 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.760
 here our tests are out for camera phones with which to that 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.420
 song device to take a photo 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.680
 to see how the quality of the camera is that can be done with kohl those lines 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.419
 and patterns and things 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.550
 in the meantime there is a platform club here 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.690
 which I can now turn on 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.710
 and this can not turn off we always have the device in the beginning 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.489
 of our review 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.639
 behind mission the lamps full of good lighting of course 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.839
 voc to ensure that the window is all a bit good in terms of sound and 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.290
 above and the open day 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.819
 the in scream and thereby scream 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.039
 which was able to turn down if needed but most of the time it is 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.849
 not necessary 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.849
 and then go for a moment still marred by the rest of the property 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:41.959
 witsel will say so 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.299
 here is 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.299
 the conference room that is just located 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.229
 and you down of course 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.250
 on the one hand 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.790
 our own workplace 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.989
 m on the other hand not unimportant of course 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.329
 our TV with on couches 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.260
 you do not know much place a nice speech that is next to and on and we do it a long way 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.649
 no they tell you 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:06.749
 but well that is not very interesting 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:07.909
 Yes 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.209
 I hope he continued to like to see how we work 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.259
 and work there 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:16.340
 inquire about the latter and openly until next time 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.269
