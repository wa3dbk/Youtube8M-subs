00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.880
 the excess of cars buildings asphalt and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.670
 concrete transformation of metropolises into 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.520
 true pollution pressure cookers 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.010
 dry air and the effect known as Island 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.260
 heat but you can use plants 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.180
 to improve the situation while living 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.760
 in a house in an apartment 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.760
 the solution comes from japan the green roof 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.750
 this lawns a technology created 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.149
 by the Japanese for 20 years and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.539
 to grow plants of various types in 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.449
 unimaginable spaces the secret here is 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.420
 that it is a blanket covered with a 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.329
 substrate in this case with 10 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.000
 centimeters but may have up to 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.979
 The secret of this Japanese miracle is how 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.080
 Coca-Cola formula company that 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.049
 factory does not reveal for anything else we 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.140
 knows that the substrate contains the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.950
 organisms and microorganisms that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.950
 high fertility 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:24.950
 a research from university unesp 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.140
 state of São Paulo shows the difference 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.330
 green makes in the life of the city a neighborhood 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.450
 wooded as pines has a 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.970
 temperature up to 12 degrees lower than 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.689
 which regions as brás where there are few 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.880
 trees 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.490
 although it is at most 10 centimeters 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.130
 thickness the green roof reduces 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.009
 temperature in the room below the slab 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.140
 retains dust from the air and still 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.450
 rainwater making the environment more 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.580
 and even contributing to the reduction of 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.640
 of floods in countries like germany 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.009
 canada japan the law that encourages 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.860
 implantation of green roofs in 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.200
 Paulo is also a similar project in 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.789
 this discussion would perhaps be a way of 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.000
 transform pressure cookers 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.239
 in an oasis of shade and water 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.239
 fresh
