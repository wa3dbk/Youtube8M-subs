 Buch 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:44.199
 This time Yokohama Rubber Bus is named after the theme of tire design that is friendly to the environment and people 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.199
 I tried to express a space where I could feel nature 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:54.430
 It is an aquatic plant and a circle that falls when the image is only 4 times higher than the waterside with a high mike from the waterside 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.320
 Landscape with lotus leaves on 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:05.160
 And it is kind to the environment and the person whom the child thinks in this 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.160
 Introducing present and future forms of tire design 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.159
 Blue rubber is sent to the world by Yokohama Rubber 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.260
 It is a concept of making new tires 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.620
 Of course, kindness to the environment 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.210
 Jin 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.560
 As tire making that is kind to society 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.290
 Activity students aiming to create new and advanced tires 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.380
 In 2011 and hard 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.050
 There are also three types of Blue Earth products . 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.880
 In Blue Earth concept 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.880
 It is an entry for Pup summer heat 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:50.930
 Yokohama Rubber has been a winning entry in a number of jerk design ever 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.060
 Tire Shisuke that in 2002 say dena 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.420
 Winner of Ecology Design Award 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.310
 Tire pressure monitoring system in 2004 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.620
 Air here 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:08.260
 Advan db in 2009 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.619
 In 2010, there is a product called Blue Earth a ae 01 in the hood hood everyday 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.650
 Award winning 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.129
 2011 Oh this boots 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.670
 Glue tomorrow fan blue earth rv 21 added 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.360
 Imagine 3 types of blue a c 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.240
 Blue Tomorrow concept 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.240
 It is to the Good Design lunch in 2010 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.000
 Nature design is a design that learns naturally when it is explained in a word 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.780
 I will 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.740
 For example, the shape of a fish that swims in water at high speed 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.790
 Shape of the wing of a bird that flies freely over the sky 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:49.540
 I have a shape that exists in nature is functional and very beautiful 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.210
 Improve various performances by applying to left and right designs 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.830
 We have found that such Fu that he intended to refer to hidden that kind of possibility 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:01.450
 Therefore, we have four approaches in the nature design approach we learn from nature. 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.450
 We have created a concept tire 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:18.780
 We designed with the focus on fluctuation 3 in the natural world 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:22.069
 There is a phenomenon that had a comfortable feeling and healing effect on the people in the natural world 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.129
 One of them is fluctuation 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:32.780
 It will not put candle flame Boga 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:34.540
 Irregular and random rhythm is a well-balanced and such light spot of sunlight filtering through foliage firefly is stepping on some regularity 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.840
 In harmony 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.730
 Very small for people's sense of heart rate 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.040
 It is said to produce a healing effect 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:50.550
 This lily pattern is 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:54.660
 By crossing two straight lines with different amplitudes and periods 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.660
 Disturb well with unpleasant noise and vibration 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.350
 To be 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.350
 Succeeded 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:13.450
 Shy putter was designed to do so hint of the natural world of 8 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:19.269
 In other who Kakke and garden can not be it is not a well-balanced as hexagon 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:21.380
 By arranging hexagons in a balanced manner, high efficiency and optimum pattern rigidity are possible. 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:26.330
 The 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:30.430
 Reduced rolling resistance rather than wet and dry performance pathology 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.430
 Enables fuel efficiency improvement 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:47.100
 This time I focused on Simon, which is on the fingers of humans and other primates . 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:52.880
 We can grasp firmly without reducing things by this fingerprint is do 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.880
 And I tried to do the effect shape of this question on the tire 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:05:05.099
 By placing a new pattern designed by Simon 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:10.429
 Demonstrates the power of friction in all directions 360 degrees , and on slippery surfaces such as rainy days and snowy roads 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:10.429
 Have also been charged with putting things that can be run stably 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:27.800
 This tire was designed with a model of a leaf vein trunk or muscle of a plant 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:30.560
 Plants spread larger external force is applied from the upper, lower, left and right variety of high school in order to perform photosynthesis efficiently 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.889
 To prevent the broken ends 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:39.139
 It is equipped with a final structural support 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:42.500
 As a reference for the shape that we achieve a flexible and strong structure 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:45.800
 We focused on the shape of the veins 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.009
 Tire support for juice and front to back 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.200
 How to stand 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:58.340
 We have air to control the lateral flexibility 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:06:00.289
 But there is a worry of punk or more that depend on air to the hassle of managing the air pressure to normal 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:06.889
 You caught 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:12.180
 Therefore, we are trying to solve this problem as a form of safe, maintenance-free tire. 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:17.639
 A tire that does not use the public morals we design the veins to hint 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:25.160
 Until now it is possible to provide a hole through the trend by not using air 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:25.160
 It has become possible to improve drainage performance that was dependent on groove area 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.139
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.340
 def 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.699
 th 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.699
 I 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.009
