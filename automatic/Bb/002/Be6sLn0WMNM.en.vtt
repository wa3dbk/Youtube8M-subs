00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:06.113
 BMW cool, right? But this one is even more pleasant. 

00:00:06.217 --> 00:00:09.276
 Our president has been a cock and ordered a Mercedes ... 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.075
 ... and instantly he has been expelled. 

00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:16.018
 That could be a coincidence, but we think not. 

00:00:29.627 --> 00:00:33.932
 The afficionado has already recognized him; this is the long version of the series 7. 

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.942
 The ideal car to sit there. 

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:40.110
 This is also the ideal Series 7 ... 

00:00:40.117 --> 00:00:44.295
 ... this is not any 7, but a 760Li. 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.508
 Long, V12 engine, two turbos, a lot of power and more comfortable than nothing. 

00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:52.980
 It is an ideal car to sit there ... 

00:00:53.013 --> 00:00:55.791
 ... or there, or here is great too. 

00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:16.800
 It's not that special in this class, but it always amazes me how comfortable a car like this is. 

00:01:16.895 --> 00:01:21.040
 Also in the back you have electrically adjustable seats ... 

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:24.582
 ... completely separate air conditioning. 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.124
 20 degrees Celsius at the front and 38 degrees behind, is possible. 

00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:30.238
 There is an additional compressor for the air in the trunk. 

00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:35.546
 There is an A / V entertainment system and complete tranquility, excellent. 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.043
 I understand why a head of state buys in this class, I really understand it. 

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:58.819
 Another thing is that your reputation improves ... 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.873
 ... driving a car that takes up more space on the road ... 

00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:04.327
 ... and that appears more impressive. 

00:02:05.087 --> 00:02:08.684
 That's a good thing in politics, but in certain other professions it's also a plus. 

00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:20.689
 BMW produces V12 engines 20 years ago already. 

00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:26.290
 That surprised Mercedes, who only had V8 engines, when suddenly the 750i was introduced. 

00:02:26.937 --> 00:02:30.784
 There have been some advances in the last 20 years. 

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:34.174
 The 750i had a 5-liter V12 engine ... 

00:02:34.207 --> 00:02:36.492
 ... this has a 6-liter V12 engine. 

00:02:36.683 --> 00:02:39.371
 And about 6 liters were not enough ... 

00:02:39.422 --> 00:02:43.305
 ... they have put two turbos and therefore 544 horses. 

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:45.659
 A ridiculous amount. 

00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:54.691
 It also has 750 Nm of torque ... 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.938
 ... It starts at 1500 rpm and lasts up to 5000 rpm. 

00:02:58.807 --> 00:03:01.078
 That way you would not need a gearbox ... 

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:04.089
 ... but as it is the high range of BMW ... 

00:03:04.131 --> 00:03:06.634
 ... they have put an automatic gearbox ... 

00:03:07.384 --> 00:03:12.535
 ... with no less than 8 speeds, eight! 

00:03:19.223 --> 00:03:22.421
 Only one small thing; the fuel consumption. 

00:03:22.581 --> 00:03:25.273
 Of course it's cheaper than before ... 

00:03:25.295 --> 00:03:30.900
 ... even with so many horses they say it has 22% more power ... 

00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:32.380
 ... and it's also 4% cheaper. 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.287
 I think we have done 6 km per liter on average ... 

00:03:37.392 --> 00:03:39.437
 ... and that's driving very calmly. 

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:44.504
 This car is really suitable for crossing ... 

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:47.558
 ... and enjoying said you have a lot of space ... 

00:03:47.642 --> 00:03:49.282
 ... a great suspension ... 

00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:52.430
 ... and when someone tries to overtake ... 

00:03:52.468 --> 00:03:56.771
 ... you just put your foot to the bottom and suddenly you put them at a distance. 

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:09.998
 We know it from other BMWs this one also has Dynamic Drive Control ... 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.245
 ... so you can change all kinds of things. In Comfort and Normal it is soft and comfortable ... 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.969
 ... but if I put it in Sport or Sport + ... 

00:04:17.151 --> 00:04:23.199
 ... it seems that it shrinks and becomes a small sporty BMW that you can throw and throw. 

00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:27.393
 Well, relatively small compared to its size. 

00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:29.813
 A great sports car. 

00:04:30.142 --> 00:04:35.229
 In Munich they are masters in the first place to make the car drive well ... 

00:04:35.336 --> 00:04:36.951
 ... and then bother with the rest. 

00:04:42.038 --> 00:04:45.630
 Start at € 208,000 for the 760Li ... 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.993
 ... that's for the long version. 

00:04:47.126 --> 00:04:49.642
 For that price it is already very well equipped ... 

00:04:49.676 --> 00:04:52.783
 ... but you can always get more things. 

00:04:53.008 --> 00:04:57.503
 It comes with navigation, rear air suspension ... 

00:04:57.523 --> 00:05:02.990
 ... and standard leather upholstery. But this demo car still has € 28,000 in extras. 

00:05:03.045 --> 00:05:05.789
 Things like individual tires ... 

00:05:05.961 --> 00:05:10.657
 ... individual painting, a nice dark blue / black color. 

00:05:11.702 --> 00:05:14.374
 You can also get night vision ... 

00:05:14.454 --> 00:05:19.516
 ... gives you an infrared camera so you can see pedestrians. 

00:05:19.896 --> 00:05:23.950
 I like to see where the cars emit their heat. 

00:05:24.455 --> 00:05:26.496
 Night vision really is something for gangsters ... 

00:05:26.518 --> 00:05:29.551
 ... you can park your car with the lights off ... 

00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:32.890
 ... and still see if your opponents are walking towards you ... 

00:05:32.905 --> 00:05:35.591
 ... and then you can act. 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:47.100
 The entire Series 7 range is available in a long version. 

00:05:47.195 --> 00:05:51.163
 The distance between the axles increases about 14 cm that is especially for the rear passengers ... 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.202
 ... which makes this car ideal to be driven. 

00:05:54.247 --> 00:05:56.373
 But when you unload the passengers ... 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.153
 ... you have a lot of power to play. 

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:02.544
 For example, it puts you from 0-100 km / h in 4.6 seconds ... 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.240
 ... touching the ground, it's a really fast car. 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.825
 The only bad thing is that you will find speed bumps ... 

00:06:15.997 --> 00:06:18.769
 ... speed controls, the police. 

00:06:18.854 --> 00:06:21.360
 That is a good explanation for the behavior of the president ... 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:26.432
 ... this frustrated because he can not put his own foot on the floor from time to time.
