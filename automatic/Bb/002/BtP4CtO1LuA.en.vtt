one pretty shma and then i sent him this
one<00:00:27.930> pretty<00:00:28.650> tiny<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.779> did<00:00:30.779> mess<00:00:31.140> around<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
one pretty tiny I did mess around a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.110 
one pretty tiny I did mess around a
little<00:00:31.800> bit<00:00:31.949> after<00:00:32.099> i<00:00:32.279> sent<00:00:32.550> him<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:32.969> and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
little bit after i sent him this one and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.459 
little bit after i sent him this one and
I<00:00:33.210> came<00:00:33.870> up<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.940> more<00:00:35.940> design<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.930> that's<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
I came up with more design so that's the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.139 
I came up with more design so that's the
one<00:00:37.710> you're<00:00:37.829> going<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.040> learn<00:00:38.190> how<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> make

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
one you're going to learn how to make

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.319 
one you're going to learn how to make
tatay<00:00:39.800> this<00:00:40.800> setup<00:00:41.100> actually<00:00:41.610> places<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
tatay this setup actually places the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.470 
tatay this setup actually places the
dispensers<00:00:42.780> right<00:00:43.079> behind<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.280> furnaces<00:00:44.940> or

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
dispensers right behind the furnaces or

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.360 
dispensers right behind the furnaces or
the<00:00:46.140> fern<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.010> will<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:49.440> fern<00:00:49.710> anyway

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the fern I if you will the fern anyway

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.029 
the fern I if you will the fern anyway
uh<00:00:50.399> place<00:00:51.300> blocks<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.110> top<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> dispensers

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
uh place blocks on top of the dispensers

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.150 
uh place blocks on top of the dispensers
like<00:00:53.309> sew<00:00:53.610> buttons<00:00:54.570> from<00:00:55.559> around<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> back

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
like sew buttons from around the back

torch<00:00:56.969> dust<00:00:58.010> block<00:00:59.390> torch<00:01:00.390> repeater<00:01:01.109> you're

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
torch dust block torch repeater you're

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.390 
torch dust block torch repeater you're
done<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.520> that's<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.899> there<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.650> pros<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
done and that's it so there are pros and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.990 
done and that's it so there are pros and
cons<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.450> setup<00:01:06.750> actually<00:01:07.110> one<00:01:07.320> con<00:01:08.000> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
cons to the setup actually one con the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.570 
cons to the setup actually one con the
one<00:01:09.180> con<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.590> because<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.100> dispensers

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
one con is that because the dispensers

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.990 
one con is that because the dispensers
sit<00:01:12.030> behind<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.420> furnaces<00:01:13.159> it<00:01:14.159> does<00:01:14.460> move<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
sit behind the furnaces it does move the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.719 
sit behind the furnaces it does move the
setup<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.990> back<00:01:16.320> compared<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.340> one<00:01:17.400> as

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
setup one back compared to this one as

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.810 
setup one back compared to this one as
you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.970> see<00:01:18.650> ya<00:01:20.270> however<00:01:22.070> this<00:01:23.070> does<00:01:23.460> bring

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
you can see ya however this does bring

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.200 
you can see ya however this does bring
the<00:01:24.540> whole<00:01:24.689> thing<00:01:24.960> down<00:01:25.200> significantly<00:01:26.210> as

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the whole thing down significantly as

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.050 
the whole thing down significantly as
you<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:30.680> another<00:01:31.700> benefit<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.729> this

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
you can see and another benefit to this

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.819 
you can see and another benefit to this
design<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:35.369> way<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:37.790> dispensers

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
design is the way that the dispensers

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.639 
design is the way that the dispensers
distribute<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.250> cold<00:01:42.079> with<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.170> other<00:01:43.290> setup

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
distribute the cold with the other setup

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.920 
distribute the cold with the other setup
you<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.100> when<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> press<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.360> button<00:01:45.390> 48

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
you have when you press the button 48

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.139 
you have when you press the button 48
you<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.619> dispenser<00:01:47.340> spitting<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:47.790> six

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
you have one dispenser spitting out six

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.580 
you have one dispenser spitting out six
and<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:49.350> second<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.860> spitting<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.280> too

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
and the second one is spitting out too

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.179 
and the second one is spitting out too
okay<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.399> needless<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.880> say<00:01:54.860> this<00:01:55.860> one's<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
okay so needless to say this one's the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.770 
okay so needless to say this one's the
one<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.399> spits<00:01:56.640> out<00:01:56.729> six<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.390> needless

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
one that spits out six and it needless

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
to say you're going to end up refilling

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.310 
to say you're going to end up refilling
this<00:01:59.250> one<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.700> hell<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.630> lot<00:02:00.750> more<00:02:00.780> than<00:02:01.110> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
this one a hell of a lot more than you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.959 
this one a hell of a lot more than you
you<00:02:01.829> know<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> need<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.640> refill<00:02:02.850> this

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
you know going to need to refill this

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.679 
you know going to need to refill this
one<00:02:03.469> with<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.680> setup<00:02:05.149> when<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.270> press<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689

there<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.340> know<00:02:23.430> they<00:02:23.550> stay<00:02:23.760> relatively<00:02:24.210> even

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
there you know they stay relatively even

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.040 
there you know they stay relatively even
you<00:02:25.920> know<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.340> when<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.580> just<00:02:26.760> kind<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.540> when

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
you know and when you just kind of when

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.600 
you know and when you just kind of when
you<00:02:28.170> do<00:02:28.380> too<00:02:28.620> but<00:02:28.950> whatever<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:30.150> point<00:02:30.600> is

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
you're not gonna have to fuss over

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.870 
you're not gonna have to fuss over
refilling<00:02:36.540> one<00:02:36.720> more<00:02:36.930> than<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.110> other<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.880> I
