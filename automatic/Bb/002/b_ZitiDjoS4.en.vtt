to<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:16.290> ahead<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.979> lock<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.880> into<00:01:18.030> place<00:01:18.330> you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
to go ahead and lock it into place you

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.140 
to go ahead and lock it into place you
would<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.080> twist<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:20.009> way<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.580> that's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
would just twist it this way and that's

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.880 
would just twist it this way and that's
going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> make<00:01:21.570> sure<00:01:21.840> your<00:01:22.200> barrel<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.650> nice

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and secure and keep in mind it's not

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.859 
and secure and keep in mind it's not
going<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.530> heat<00:01:25.740> up<00:01:25.770> unless<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:27.270> locked

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
going to heat up unless it's locked

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.050 
going to heat up unless it's locked
properly<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:29.310> you're<00:01:29.430> having<00:01:29.640> trouble

properly so if you're having trouble
with<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.540> probably<00:01:30.960> because<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.500> not

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
with that is probably because it's not

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.920 
with that is probably because it's not
locked<00:01:31.979> properly<00:01:32.220> once<00:01:32.909> your<00:01:33.090> barrel<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.659> lots

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
locked properly once your barrel is lots

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.660 
locked properly once your barrel is lots

you're<00:01:40.049> going<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> go<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.470> your<00:01:40.710> desired<00:01:41.189> heat

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
you're going to go to your desired heat

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.690 
you're going to go to your desired heat
by<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:42.210> up<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.899> does<00:01:43.200> go<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.439> 450<00:01:44.250> degrees

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
by going up this does go to 450 degrees

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.630 
by going up this does go to 450 degrees
in<00:01:44.939> under<00:01:45.240> 60<00:01:45.689> seconds<00:01:46.170> which<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.710> amazing<00:01:47.490> but

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
in under 60 seconds which is amazing but

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.069 
in under 60 seconds which is amazing but
I<00:01:47.700> always<00:01:47.880> tell<00:01:48.119> people<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.689> play<00:01:48.840> around

I always tell people just play around
with<00:01:49.259> different<00:01:49.320> heat<00:01:49.799> settings<00:01:49.829> everybody's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
with different heat settings everybody's

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.760 
with different heat settings everybody's
hair<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.000> different<00:01:51.509> if<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.350> finer<00:01:52.619> hair

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
hair is different if you have finer hair

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.920 
hair is different if you have finer hair
you<00:01:53.399> want<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.670> stick<00:01:53.820> something<00:01:54.240> lower<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.810> if

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
you want to stick something lower and if

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.420 
you want to stick something lower and if
you<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.200> thicker<00:01:55.470> hair<00:01:55.590> go<00:01:55.979> ahead<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.310> move

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
you have thicker hair go ahead and move

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.319 
you have thicker hair go ahead and move
up<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.759> heat<00:01:57.320> okay<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> pro<00:02:00.000> wand

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
up the heat okay so this is the pro wand

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.120 
up the heat okay so this is the pro wand
this<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> be<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> first<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:02.009> that

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
this is going to be the first one that

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
going to take a small section so you

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.970 
going to take a small section so you
guys<00:02:24.400> can<00:02:24.640> see<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.540> define<00:02:26.260> curl<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.770> this

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
guys can see the define curl that this

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.980 
guys can see the define curl that this
leaves<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.880> what<00:02:28.030> we're<00:02:28.180> going<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.390> do<00:02:28.660> is

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
leaves so what we're going to do is

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.890 
leaves so what we're going to do is
start<00:02:29.440> at<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.620> bottom<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.310> then<00:02:31.300> just<00:02:31.330> wrap

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
start at the bottom and then just wrap

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.100 
start at the bottom and then just wrap
it<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.910> then<00:02:37.120> we're<00:02:37.270> just<00:02:37.450> going<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.660> hold<00:02:37.930> it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
it and then we're just going to hold it

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:51.690 
it and then we're just going to hold it
just<00:02:39.180> for<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.209> few<00:02:40.390> seconds<00:02:49.620> okay<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:51.070> this<00:02:51.459> is

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
just for a few seconds okay so this is

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.170 
just for a few seconds okay so this is
the<00:02:51.880> 18<00:02:52.360> millimeter<00:02:53.160> all<00:02:54.160> right<00:02:54.400> taking<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.030> up

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
the 18 millimeter all right taking it up

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.090 
the 18 millimeter all right taking it up
to<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.450> base<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.020> keep<00:02:56.200> in<00:02:56.350> mind<00:02:56.560> like<00:02:56.800> if<00:02:56.830> you

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
to the base and keep in mind like if you

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.800 
to the base and keep in mind like if you
just<00:02:57.310> want<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.640> curl<00:02:57.910> more<00:02:58.120> towards<00:02:58.450> tabata

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
just want the curl more towards tabata

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.170 
just want the curl more towards tabata
just<00:02:59.620> go<00:02:59.800> ahead<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.280> just<00:03:00.459> lower<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.090> if

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
just go ahead and just lower it and if

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.460 
just go ahead and just lower it and if
you<00:03:01.300> want<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.600> more<00:03:01.630> higher<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.170> your<00:03:02.290> base

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
you want it more higher to your base

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.080 
you want it more higher to your base
bring<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:02.980> up<00:03:03.070> higher<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.840> then<00:03:05.080> we<00:03:05.260> release

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
bring it up higher and then we release

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.040 
bring it up higher and then we release
with<00:03:07.090> help<00:03:07.300> cute<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.720> is

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
with help cute that is

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.479 
with help cute that is
super<00:03:08.620> bouncy<00:03:09.190> super<00:03:09.940> shiny<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.870> love<00:03:11.769> it<00:03:11.950> so

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.699 

this<00:03:15.489> is<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.730> next<00:03:16.090> size<00:03:16.330> up<00:03:16.600> this<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.290> 19

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
this is the next size up this is the 19

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:32.910 
this is the next size up this is the 19
millimeter<00:03:30.120> okay<00:03:31.120> guys<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:31.540> this<00:03:31.810> is<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.989> 25<00:03:32.620> by

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
millimeter okay guys so this is a 25 by

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.390 
millimeter okay guys so this is a 25 by
18<00:03:33.549> wand<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.750> reason<00:03:35.019> I<00:03:35.080> say<00:03:35.230> 25<00:03:35.650> by<00:03:35.830> 18<00:03:36.220> is

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
18 wand and the reason I say 25 by 18 is

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.400 
18 wand and the reason I say 25 by 18 is
because<00:03:36.730> it's<00:03:36.910> 25<00:03:37.450> millimeters<00:03:37.930> here<00:03:38.200> and

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
because it's 25 millimeters here and

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.560 
because it's 25 millimeters here and
then<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.920> gets<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.700> 18<00:03:40.060> towards<00:03:40.390> the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
then it gets to the 18 towards the

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.900 
then it gets to the 18 towards the
bottom<00:03:40.810> ones<00:03:41.530> are<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:41.890> easy<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.370> use<00:03:42.640> and

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
bottom ones are so easy to use and

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.690 
bottom ones are so easy to use and
they're<00:03:43.209> super<00:03:43.570> fast<00:03:44.019> too<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.769> love<00:03:45.400> them<00:03:45.519> way

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
they're super fast too I love them way

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.870 
they're super fast too I love them way
