basically<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:30.810> takes<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> numbers<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
basically just takes the numbers and of

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.440 
basically just takes the numbers and of
course<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.669> guys<00:00:32.820> know<00:00:32.850> numbers<00:00:33.300> never

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
course as you guys know numbers never

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.120 
course as you guys know numbers never
lie<00:00:33.540> but<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.320> takes<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.620> numbers<00:00:34.920> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
lie but it takes the numbers and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.520 
lie but it takes the numbers and
calculates<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.899> rate<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.200> which

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
calculates it and at the rate of which

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.560 
calculates it and at the rate of which
company<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.149> chance<00:00:39.420> that

company is going this is the chance that
they<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:39.989> go<00:00:40.110> bankrupt<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> tool<00:00:41.160> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
they can go bankrupt it as a tool that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.180

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
something can improve with time now this

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.250 
something can improve with time now this
is<00:00:59.699> something<00:00:59.850> where<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.930> taking<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
is something where it's like taking the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.869 
is something where it's like taking the
numbers<00:01:01.530> now<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.039> then<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.190> breaking<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
numbers now and then just breaking it

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.429 
numbers now and then just breaking it
down<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.359> saying<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.660> two<00:01:03.809> years<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.110> he<00:01:04.260> can

go out of business in two years no this
is<00:01:21.360> merely<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.830> program<00:01:23.520> that's<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.270> you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
is merely just a program that's like you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.210 
is merely just a program that's like you
know<00:01:24.689> calculating<00:01:25.409> numbers<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
know calculating numbers is the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.249 
know calculating numbers is the
possibility<00:01:26.670> there<00:01:27.180> yes<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.869> course<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
possibility there yes of course the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.440 
possibility there yes of course the
possibility<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.340> any<00:01:29.460> company<00:01:29.729> but

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
possibility is there for any company but

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.390 
possibility is there for any company but
again<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.470> those<00:01:31.619> things<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:32.100> i

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
again it's one of those things that i

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.800 
again it's one of those things that i
would<00:01:32.640> take<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> grain<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.270> salt<00:01:33.390> because

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
would take with a grain of salt because
