00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.929
 lark and sause group heartily 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.130
 Welcome to this mouse show 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.590
 from a grubber of a corner i guess 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.320
 We have a working width of 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:17.039
 seven meters it is too much 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.150
 3 meters with six to seven times here 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.029
 estimate 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.670
 here is the 10 m that is determined 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.670
 not in itself in the Russian troops 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.410
 I already believe my job that says 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.320
 not much except that tyler pnd is called 7 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.640
 from the company bms or mobbing the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.270
 bms who knows that 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.710
 does not cost much 4580 eur 78 euro 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.070
 running costs we have a picture 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.320
 converted from the ls 13 how to am 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.550
 background picture can easily recognize 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.379
 yes, we have a lot and me 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.140
 think with the test or that too 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.140
 whether the crate or the group 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.640
 It really holds its promise 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.899
 I definitely like it 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.220
 great textures resp 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.510
 actually photos of this by 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.040
 that is what they all seem to see 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.869
 really good , I really have to 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.220
 say and they have that really good 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.689
 that's the real thing 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.979
 look dirty is nothing in itself 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.979
 other than a picture because that will get 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.140
 You think me back and forth in the frame 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.330
 pulls out again something pixelated 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.280
 otherwise model, but I'm fine there 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.200
 you can not complain we are behind 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.700
 The roller also fits her well if 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.960
 schavan panels are already here and here 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.420
 then the hydraulic cylinders will go too 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.090
 together and then unfold the angels 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.189
 Road transport width together here 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.020
 The three-point at three-point fits too 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.799
 everything we can test it for a short time 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.189
 fold 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.500
 you see that works pretty well 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.799
 and as I said, you have to be real 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.869
 Get it when the roads are still there 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.000
 the conditions are all right 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.229
 with turns then we can talk about good ones here 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.070
 speak four stars, I'd like 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.050
 my now while driving 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.440
 I love you very much 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:11.920
 okay we have particles we have 20 km 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.150
 h or goes off how schmidts cat would 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:21.270
 say that depends a bit back 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:24.940
 Of course, now we drive exactly where 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.310
 The state is because we wanted 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.530
 actually like to look like here 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.870
 turn in the ground and turn super 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.330
 Inhabitants I have to turn super thing 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.620
 everything is great with we have particles 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.640
 we have dust that draws nicely here 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.470
 that I have to be really beautiful 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.700
 Although we say back once the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.900
 working width is only interesting so 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.880
 I can hardly imagine it 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.770
 seven meters are maybe four 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.660
 meter left right still meters to it so 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.550
 not more than six feet maybe 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.830
 also five meters five feet fifty 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.390
 at most five to six meters are 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.890
 not seven meters but that seven can 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.209
 you point to seven meters 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.700
 but it does not do that are not 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.090
 seven meter should maybe 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.160
 his 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.070
 As I said we have great particles here 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.709
 is is all about with all there dust 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.530
 we can think 20 years six times 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.269
 Years is not overstraining and so 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.660
 Therefore, a word from me gets great 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.400
 four stars russian tries me 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.260
 actually convinced here you could 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.019
 synonymous times on the server use because 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.050
 Do not travel well the brand you do not 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.519
 he is such a thing but still fits 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.410
 I think and the mother in any case 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.780
 his authority is given to me by four 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.410
 stars for the mosque again 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.650
 look up 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:44.700
 apn did you think I have en de 7 corner 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.950
 and so I say it was mine 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.150
 hear and see each other again tomorrow 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.150
 it is short servus
