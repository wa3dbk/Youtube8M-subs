00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.630

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.420
 you like 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.029
 very quickly earn money for water 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.550
 lazy very fast earnings 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.279
 what do we need for that 1 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.939
 sobeit second 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:37.210
 character proper to arranged there on 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:40.399
 arranged work and the third is the phone 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.470
 what now I will explain for what to us 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:51.079
 need sabit sobit there is such a function 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:54.649
 pressing pressing f11 next here 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.370
 here is such a menu here we are 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.629
 we flip the arrow to the right and 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.000
 find here the speed of the game that is 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.650
 we shake down down down there game speed 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.480
 we direct her to the white strip was 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.500
 on it is sulfur and 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:19.430
 us plus that's where i have a keyboard right us 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:23.149
 + we press we clamp more precisely you see everything 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.159
 and swam I advise you to do it without admins 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.380
 that is, when there are no admins on the server 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.020
 how one is all fuse well understandable 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.140
 the case is shown to all players 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.810
 555 let's deliver will inform as well 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.740
 now I am a character it is clear now 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.600
 I will explain why we see the phone 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.070
 when we come here 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.500
 the server does not have time to process the information 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.130
 that we took a weapon from there and brought 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.399
 here therefore we have to become here 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.640
 example here and wait further we take 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.579
 your phone if you have a timer we 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.710
 set for one minute 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.829
 one minute press start 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.840
 and wait one minute why do you need to wait 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.510
 because if you don't wait but immediately 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.220
 cast you die down 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.020
 own money you won't get you 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.570
 nod for suspicion of cheating better 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.430
 of course wait a minute 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.670
 a moment or two 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.730
 and actually everything will be fine I think 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.489
 it's better than swimming 10 minutes and back 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.799
 10 minutes while still there pick up and 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.730
 Oxygen for a lot less guys for a lot 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.099
 just less 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.760
 ends simply unrealistic much 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:39.340
 less rain can poprisedat 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.980
 do sports for now and all that 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.500
 on the accelerated game that is it 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.219
 accelerated such a thing is also possible 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.299
 since at night there are few amides too though 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:55.930
 at night it can be more than in the morning 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:58.419
 it is better to work in the morning and at night but 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:07.060
 if mid a day guys so another 5 seconds 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:09.280
 and it will take a minute so 321 all run I'm not 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.639
 I know if 8 nikks are working right now 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.680
 hit wait two three 4 5 all 2 370 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.879
 I need to wait for about a minute I will give 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.650
 maybe already more 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.139
 That's because no, well, it's clear 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.940
 much better right than there 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:30.370
 300 degrees three hundred years to sail the same way we 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.409
 can not to spend more oxygen 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.979
 Here we can see here on the top of 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:38.040
 on top there is a picture here is here 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:45.010
 but give for them 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:49.000
 1050 seems to be somehow shorter in 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.680
 two times less than for a weapon 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.949
 so I'm swimming for weapons to 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.780
 make more money here and in general 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:59.109
 this is just an accelerated game that is 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.419
 here is nothing here but for it 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:05.470
 anyway bath 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:09.340
 in stocks that's why here now 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.060
 one more time we will sail here and there 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:17.889
 on this on this raft 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.389
 I say goodbye to you and now I will say everything 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.710
 your frazochki 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:26.830
 as usual you can also 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.889
 run and jump fast so all of you 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:34.060
 you can do this 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:36.610
 different cleo max writes to me 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:42.070
 I will not stand not to not drag 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:46.510
 done in general what i wanted to say i 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:52.870
 I do not remember okay so we turn on a note 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:54.789
 tet and tet and tet so the minute start what 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.529
 thanks guys for watching if you 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:03.490
 I liked this idea, I just looked 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:06.490
 cool it's cool pale and well there of course 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:10.419
 everything is faster but still it is much 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.820
 better and proven thanks for watching 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.969
 friends put likes subscribe if 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.360
 you liked it and your was alex not 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:21.190
 forget my channel bye bye guys 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.219
 I want to go admins see this john 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:28.459
 blake i.e. came in brought out buncha melts 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:33.689
 latitude over tanaka means minutes shorter 

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:38.819
 I advise you to watch for chat rooms 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:41.099
 I play it there 1 2 I think in the council 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.919
 you seem admins sit on my left 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:47.719
 No, because these nicks in the database 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:51.509
 there is no site here I think it will seem to you 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:56.819
 I probably do not know watched obliquely bit 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:57.899
 download here and as if here so in short 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:02.539
 do not burn 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:02.539
 Again, I say good luck and all the while
