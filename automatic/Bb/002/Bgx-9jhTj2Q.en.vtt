aesthetic differences between these two

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.689 
aesthetic differences between these two
devices<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.769> fact<00:00:29.039> from<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> front<00:00:29.550> they're

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
devices in fact from the front they're

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.510 
devices in fact from the front they're
pretty<00:00:29.849> much<00:00:29.939> identical<00:00:30.800> some<00:00:31.800> slight

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
pretty much identical some slight

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.729 
pretty much identical some slight
differences<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> logo<00:00:34.559> right

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
differences in the in the logo right

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.100 
differences in the in the logo right
there<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:36.000> new<00:00:36.149> one<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> little<00:00:36.840> bit<00:00:36.930> bolder

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
there the new one is a little bit bolder

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.810 
there the new one is a little bit bolder
the<00:00:37.440> kerning<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.920> little<00:00:38.129> bit<00:00:38.280> tighter<00:00:38.520> but

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the kerning is a little bit tighter but

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.040 
the kerning is a little bit tighter but
otherwise<00:00:39.300> these<00:00:39.570> are<00:00:39.690> pretty<00:00:39.870> much

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
otherwise these are pretty much

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.590 
otherwise these are pretty much
indistinguishable<00:00:40.850> until<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.180> course<00:00:42.239> you

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
indistinguishable until of course you

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.500 
indistinguishable until of course you
flip<00:00:42.809> them<00:00:42.930> over<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.700> guy<00:00:44.850> right<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:45.239> is

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
flip them over so this guy right here is

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.750 
flip them over so this guy right here is
