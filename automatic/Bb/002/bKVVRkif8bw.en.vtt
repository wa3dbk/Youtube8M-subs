00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.130
 i 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:24.760
 and in this video many friends 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.590
 at least it's like interesting and 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.590
 wants more 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.480
 to know 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.210
 and good to start we teach my 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.010
 bag is this is a digital community 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.989
 very beautiful is one of my verses 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.210
 favorites because it's very comfortable and it 's 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.910
 big then all my 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.570
 good stuff and has this little thing 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.980
 pretty as adornito and I like it a lot in 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.250
 these bag will teach you what 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.140
 there is inside and good to start as 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.710
 important is that I have in my bag is 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.840
 my phone because if my phone is not 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.970
 nothing and this as the most important thing that 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.700
 I have not even yours and even though 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.340
 You see a little ugly because the cover has me 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.380
 I bought this case because it fell 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.759
 many times and I have broken a lot 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.450
 times then to fix one already 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.399
 We are buying a case that will last you and 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.160
 that if it breaks you good so you're not going to 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.710
 break then I decided to buy myself and good 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:43.229
 It looks ugly but it's okay 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.180
 and well the following is my little box 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.590
 makeup bag is the following and 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.690
 this way one of the most things 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.060
 important because if I bring everything 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.490
 the essential in case something is missing me 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.610
 I put on powder, I see the right powder 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.920
 as brightness if it is if my face is 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.070
 I should use here is everything that I 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.080
 I have to put and the first thing I have 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.649
 it's like a mirror can not miss a 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.649
 esthetic 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.000
 this offers shadows but is very father 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.370
 because it assumes that on this side it's like 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.410
 a shadow color as you see that you the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.420
 you put like in this part of the eye and 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.400
 then the other side is like one more 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.530
 dark you put it up and more like 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.140
 afuerita and so you see what many 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.420
 they call the smoky there effect and you do not see 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.840
 very well because I do not have much left but 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.730
 good and is and is covergirl for 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.030
 those who want to buy and I love 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.850
 but I'm running out and well 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.660
 I always carry my powder because it can be 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.120
 make my face look very shiny when 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.070
 I know at a party and this helps me 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.569
 I already eat it in the bathroom and coming 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.329
 also sanz 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.579
 another important thing that I bring is my 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.290
 labial is the one that continues using room 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.370
 or very beautiful red is called roger see and 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.120
 Well I'm going to leave the names of 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.340
 everything down and well this one I like a lot and 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.829
 it is always I wear one of a different color 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.270
 It depends on the occasion and this time together 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.030
 in red because I like it a lot 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.120
 and then on top you put on a lipstick that 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.190
 of victoria secret and it's a little 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.630
 it has like brillitos and you put it 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.930
 above nothing else so that you shine 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.930
 lips 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.190
 as beauty but I always have it 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.900
 apart is this is called rose south is 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.240
 as for the lips 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.100
 I like it a lot because you 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.280
 moisturizes a lot is much better than 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.800
 other brands 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.100
 And look, it's like rosita, it has no color 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.110
 but they smell like rich and it's the best 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.700
 I have put on my lips the truth what 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.959
 I recommend a good one is they sell advise 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.810
 I love is what fascinates me most is 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.890
 my obsession right now this and I have it 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.840
 apart because I'm always getting 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.400
 and that's why I do not have out of the bag 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.280
 of makeup 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.470
 another thing apart is a cream always 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.209
 take a hand cream because you can 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.970
 be that I am in a place and I do not know if I 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.790
 they see their hands are dry and this helps 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.220
 and apart smells very rich left an alonso 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.739
 very beautiful to advance are your friends 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.400
 or with your boyfriend or whoever this is 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.770
 there is also a lot that always 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.199
 I carry is an antibacterial this one is called 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.520
 avenue peris corvette I do not know if what 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:35.330
 You can see but well this I bought it 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.680
 pass body works and they get very rich and that 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.560
 you can also hang them in your bag in 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.870
 the outside part this can be taken out 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:46.790
 it is allowed again 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.620
 and the portfolio is very important and 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.770
 Well, I always carry my wallet with me 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.970
 I have a few cards and it's good 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.240
 something that I always carry with me 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.940
 portfolio something very important and sacred in 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.290
 equality if I lose another number 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.140
 thing that you always carry in 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:06.050
 hearing aids because whenever I'm in the 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.290
 car or bored you crave 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.969
 music and this saves me from hearing 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:14.249
 then I always carry is not with me 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.529
 something that I also carry is that always 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:18.149
 the shoes hurt my feet 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.519
 so I always wear band- aids and 

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:23.369

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:26.189

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:27.959
 well he says like parent things even though he's 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:29.399

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:33.599

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:47.009
 little things that are as decorated are you 

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:48.629
 Tooth brushes base account that 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.549
 have a little ball of the break and know your 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.159
 brushing teeth serves a goal for 

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:55.409
 when you go to meals or something and you have 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:58.409
 to overcome the teeth and this already 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:01.319
 I talked about the dates and then the 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:05.219
 time that I carry in my bag is this 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:07.110

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.080
 it is told that you put it in your perfume and 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.520

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.200
 perfume that you want and here you have it 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.040
