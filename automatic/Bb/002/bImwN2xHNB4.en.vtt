treated the symptoms now we could be

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.340 
treated the symptoms now we could be
more<00:01:36.490> proactive<00:01:36.820> with<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.509> genetic<00:01:37.899> testing

metabolic markers we could look at now

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.399 
metabolic markers we could look at now
and<00:01:42.430> actually<00:01:43.149> treat<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.570> illness<00:01:43.750> in<00:01:44.079> it<00:01:44.229> and
