00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
actually works just fine it works just

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.160 
actually works just fine it works just
fine<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.000> that's<00:01:21.450> what<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:21.780> used<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.020> do

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
fine and that's what they used to do

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.480 
fine and that's what they used to do
with<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> old<00:01:22.500> Fords<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.040> why<00:01:23.189> they<00:01:23.340> just

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
with the old Fords that's why they just

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280 
with the old Fords that's why they just
run<00:01:23.729> forever<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.509> use<00:01:24.689> anything<00:01:24.960> that's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
run forever you can use anything that's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.350 
run forever you can use anything that's
laying<00:01:25.500> around<00:01:25.650> I've<00:01:26.520> found<00:01:26.820> things<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.270> the
