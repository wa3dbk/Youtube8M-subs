00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
switching to 20k so as you watch you'll

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.930 
switching to 20k so as you watch you'll
see<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.980> colors<00:00:41.250> are<00:00:41.399> starting<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.670> get<00:00:41.760> more

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
nudged apart to create some space but

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.140 
nudged apart to create some space but
for<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.530> most<00:03:38.710> part<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.190> really<00:03:39.520> do<00:03:39.880> try<00:03:40.120> to

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
for the most part I really do try to

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.320

keep my hands out of the water I want to
make<00:03:43.420> sure<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.660> calcium<00:03:43.990> reactor<00:03:44.320> is

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
make sure the calcium reactor is

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.470 
make sure the calcium reactor is
trickling<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.220> skimmer<00:03:45.580> is<00:03:45.880> skimming

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
trickling and that skimmer is skimming

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.410 
trickling and that skimmer is skimming
but<00:03:47.440> that's<00:03:47.710> pretty<00:03:47.890> much<00:03:48.070> it<00:03:48.250> that's<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.240> blue

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
but that's pretty much it that's a blue

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.850

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
me for several years and other things

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.760 
me for several years and other things
come<00:04:06.400> in<00:04:06.550> as<00:04:06.790> they<00:04:07.510> grow<00:04:08.020> near<00:04:08.470> each<00:04:08.590> other

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.170 
come in as they grow near each other
when<00:04:08.950> I<00:04:08.980> move<00:04:09.250> them<00:04:09.400> apart<00:04:09.490> all<00:04:09.850> of<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:09.940> sudden<00:04:10.150> I

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
when I move them apart all of a sudden I

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.680 
when I move them apart all of a sudden I
have<00:04:10.300> a<00:04:10.330> new<00:04:10.480> frag<00:04:12.150> there's<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.240> number<00:04:13.420> of<00:04:13.570> a

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
have a new frag there's a number of a

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.150 
have a new frag there's a number of a
cans<00:04:13.960> tucked<00:04:14.350> away<00:04:14.500> in<00:04:14.710> the<00:04:14.800> back<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:15.100> the

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.380 
cans tucked away in the back of the
wreath<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:15.610> think<00:04:15.760> it'd<00:04:15.850> be<00:04:15.910> really<00:04:16.090> cool

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
wreath and I think it'd be really cool

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.120 
wreath and I think it'd be really cool
to<00:04:16.450> glue<00:04:16.780> them<00:04:16.989> on<00:04:17.080> to<00:04:17.200> a<00:04:17.230> long<00:04:17.500> piece<00:04:17.709> of<00:04:17.830> tonga

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
to glue them on to a long piece of tonga

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.710 
to glue them on to a long piece of tonga
branch<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.580> let<00:04:18.700> them<00:04:18.820> just<00:04:18.970> in<00:04:19.060> crust<00:04:19.390> on<00:04:19.570> it

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
branch and let them just in crust on it

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.290 
branch and let them just in crust on it
and<00:04:19.900> make<00:04:20.140> a<00:04:20.170> blanket<00:04:20.709> of<00:04:20.860> polyps<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.489> just<00:04:22.210> need

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.540 
a big piece of Tonga branch even if you
let<00:04:28.390> their<00:04:28.540> corals<00:04:28.870> in<00:04:28.990> here<00:04:29.200> of<00:04:30.010> course<00:04:30.400> look
