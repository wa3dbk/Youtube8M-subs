00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
guys I am gonna duct tape the daylights

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.810 
guys I am gonna duct tape the daylights
out<00:00:24.140> of<00:00:24.169> this<00:00:24.349> thing<00:00:24.560> so<00:00:24.860> I<00:00:24.890> don't<00:00:25.189> get<00:00:25.610> any<00:00:25.730> of

out of this thing so I don't get any of

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.240 
out of this thing so I don't get any of
my<00:00:25.910> electronics<00:00:26.539> wet<00:00:26.750> so<00:00:27.110> you<00:00:27.950> know<00:00:28.070> don't

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
my electronics wet so you know don't

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.679 
my electronics wet so you know don't
worry<00:00:28.579> about<00:00:28.790> the<00:00:28.939> tape<00:00:29.119> but<00:00:29.300> at<00:00:29.390> least<00:00:29.509> this

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
worry about the tape but at least this

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:41.799 
worry about the tape but at least this
cool<00:00:29.989> tape<00:00:39.670> you<00:00:40.670> just<00:00:40.910> ear<00:00:41.090> really<00:00:41.420> well<00:00:41.570> so

far

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:44.669 

I'll<00:01:03.200> stay<00:01:03.680> here<00:01:03.829> to<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.040> back<00:01:04.220> here<00:01:12.159> already

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.590 

ain't<00:01:45.679> gonna<00:01:45.800> handle<00:01:46.160> that<00:01:46.570> eat<00:01:47.570> more<00:01:47.780> week

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
ain't gonna handle that eat more week

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:58.590 
ain't gonna handle that eat more week
 this<00:01:51.200> up<00:01:51.410> pretty<00:01:51.590> good<00:01:56.860> kind<00:01:57.860> of<00:01:57.979> thought

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
 this up pretty good kind of thought

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.800 
 this up pretty good kind of thought
if<00:01:59.600> this<00:01:59.780> is<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.020> low<00:02:00.289> lunge<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.950> Kiki<00:02:01.429> guys

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
if this is a low lunge a Kiki guys

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.830 
if this is a low lunge a Kiki guys
I<00:02:02.899> think<00:02:03.409> I<00:02:03.500> might<00:02:03.680> have<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.890> do<00:02:04.040> this<00:02:04.840> much

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
I think I might have to do this much

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.770 
I think I might have to do this much
taller<00:02:06.140> vehicle<00:02:06.740> but<00:02:07.300> this<00:02:08.300> kind<00:02:08.569> of<00:02:08.630> snow

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
taller vehicle but this kind of snow

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.199 
taller vehicle but this kind of snow
right<00:02:09.050> here<00:02:09.289> in<00:02:09.349> the<00:02:09.440> driveway<00:02:09.970> this<00:02:10.970> works

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
right here in the driveway this works

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:36.380 
right here in the driveway this works
pretty<00:02:11.360> awesome

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:03:07.780 

you<00:02:37.140> gotta<00:02:37.290> build<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.770> speed<00:02:38.040> up<00:02:38.190> by<00:02:38.340> fine

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:18.260 

we<00:03:08.790> need<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:16.340> night<00:03:17.340> maybe<00:03:17.550> I<00:03:17.700> locked<00:03:18.150> the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
we need a night maybe I locked the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.680 
we need a night maybe I locked the
differential<00:03:18.990> at<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.320> help<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.710> lot<00:03:20.420> maybe<00:03:21.420> go

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
differential at the help a lot maybe go

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.510 
differential at the help a lot maybe go
into<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.959> brushless<00:03:22.320> setup<00:03:22.770> with<00:03:23.130> this<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:25.520> get

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
into a brushless setup with this and get

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.710 
into a brushless setup with this and get
some<00:03:26.700> more<00:03:26.820> weight<00:03:27.030> on<00:03:27.090> there<00:03:27.420> with<00:03:27.570> me

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
some more weight on there with me

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.199 
some more weight on there with me
keeping<00:03:28.140> up<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.950> shock<00:03:30.140> otherwise<00:03:31.140> would<00:03:31.500> be

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
keeping up the shock otherwise would be

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.430 
keeping up the shock otherwise would be
even<00:03:33.209> really<00:03:33.540> well<00:03:33.720> I'm<00:03:33.900> actually<00:03:34.080> impressed

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
even really well I'm actually impressed

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:46.699 
even really well I'm actually impressed
myself<00:03:34.950> with<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.490> thing<00:03:35.760> Oh<00:03:37.940> snowbank<00:03:45.470> is<00:03:46.470> it

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
myself with this thing Oh snowbank is it

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.380 
myself with this thing Oh snowbank is it
a<00:03:46.860> flip<00:03:47.160> no<00:03:48.000> big<00:03:48.239> deal<00:03:48.450> I<00:03:49.970> am<00:03:50.970> running<00:03:51.209> a

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
a flip no big deal I am running a

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.780 
a flip no big deal I am running a
fifteen<00:03:51.810> hundred<00:03:52.140> milliamps<00:03:52.470> stock<00:03:52.950> battery

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
fifteen hundred milliamps stock battery

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:11.050 
fifteen hundred milliamps stock battery
no<00:03:55.120> little<00:03:55.360> power

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.370 

yeah<00:04:12.060> definitely<00:04:12.300> got<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.660> half<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.900> lots<00:04:13.200> of

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
yeah definitely got a half a lots of

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.050 
yeah definitely got a half a lots of
dips<00:04:13.590> on<00:04:13.770> that<00:04:13.950> that'll<00:04:14.280> stop<00:04:14.700> fooling

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
dips on that that'll stop fooling

00:04:15.060 --> 00:05:16.790 
dips on that that'll stop fooling
spinning<00:04:26.870> nice

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:34.800 

whoo<00:05:17.800> onto<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.670> drive<00:05:19.770> all<00:05:20.770> right<00:05:21.360> oh<00:05:33.810> nice

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
whoo onto the drive all right oh nice

00:05:34.810 --> 00:06:01.100 
whoo onto the drive all right oh nice
nice<00:05:35.140> place<00:05:35.500> I<00:05:36.010> do<00:05:36.940> that<00:05:37.120> one<00:05:37.300> again

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:14.600 

a<00:06:12.260> lot<00:06:13.260> of<00:06:13.290> ice<00:06:13.530> on<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:13.830> driveway<00:06:14.070> to<00:06:14.310> that

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
a lot of ice on the driveway to that

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:37.439 
a lot of ice on the driveway to that
doesn't<00:06:14.910> help<00:06:15.000> much

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:37.449 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:51.809 

I<00:06:49.559> guess<00:06:50.559> that's<00:06:50.710> it<00:06:50.889> for<00:06:50.949> this<00:06:51.189> test<00:06:51.520> let<00:06:51.759> me

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
I guess that's it for this test let me

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:54.119 
I guess that's it for this test let me
know<00:06:51.879> what<00:06:51.999> you<00:06:52.120> guys<00:06:52.240> think<00:06:52.569> but<00:06:52.900> I<00:06:53.139> mean<00:06:53.740> it's

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:54.129 
know what you guys think but I mean it's

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:56.189 
know what you guys think but I mean it's
doing<00:06:54.580> actually<00:06:54.969> really<00:06:55.330> well<00:06:55.539> a<00:06:55.809> lot<00:06:56.020> better

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199 
doing actually really well a lot better

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:01.559 
doing actually really well a lot better
than<00:06:56.469> I<00:06:56.499> thought<00:06:56.529> it<00:06:56.800> would<00:06:56.979> you<00:06:57.370> know<00:06:58.589> so<00:07:00.569> I'm
