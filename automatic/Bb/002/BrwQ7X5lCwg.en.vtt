00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.720 
I explained a little bit more about the
werewolves<00:03:22.140> in<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.350> packs<00:03:22.590> maybe<00:03:23.220> giving<00:03:23.610> up

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
werewolves in the packs maybe giving up

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.630 
werewolves in the packs maybe giving up
some<00:03:23.940> flashbacks<00:03:24.240> of<00:03:24.720> Elena<00:03:25.430> turning<00:03:26.430> for<00:03:26.610> the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
some flashbacks of Elena turning for the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.640 
some flashbacks of Elena turning for the
first<00:03:26.910> time<00:03:27.210> I<00:03:27.630> think<00:03:28.020> that<00:03:28.260> could<00:03:28.440> have<00:03:28.530> been

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
first time I think that could have been

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.400 
first time I think that could have been
a<00:03:28.710> better<00:03:28.980> power<00:03:29.370> L<00:03:29.640> for<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.000> episode<00:03:30.510> because

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
a better power L for the episode because

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.560 
a better power L for the episode because
yeah<00:03:31.620> we<00:03:31.800> knew<00:03:32.010> about<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.430> pack<00:03:32.700> but<00:03:33.270> we<00:03:33.390> don't

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
yeah we knew about the pack but we don't

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.240 
yeah we knew about the pack but we don't
know<00:03:33.780> what<00:03:33.960> makes<00:03:34.290> these<00:03:34.620> werewolves

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
know what makes these werewolves

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.950 
know what makes these werewolves
different<00:03:35.670> from<00:03:35.880> all<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.180> other<00:03:36.300> werewolves

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960

so<00:04:00.750> that's<00:04:00.810> really<00:04:01.110> my<00:04:01.320> only<00:04:01.350> complaint<00:04:01.830> about

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
so that's really my only complaint about

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.100 
so that's really my only complaint about
it<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.880> didn't<00:04:03.090> get<00:04:03.210> me<00:04:03.270> totally<00:04:03.780> into<00:04:03.990> the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
it that didn't get me totally into the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.550 
it that didn't get me totally into the
episode<00:04:04.700> but<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:05.760> think<00:04:06.150> after<00:04:06.990> a<00:04:07.020> couple<00:04:07.320> more

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
episode but I think after a couple more

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.680 
episode but I think after a couple more
episodes<00:04:07.710> I<00:04:08.460> think<00:04:08.790> this<00:04:09.150> could<00:04:09.270> be<00:04:09.330> a<00:04:09.420> really

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
episodes I think this could be a really

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.230 
episodes I think this could be a really
good<00:04:09.810> show<00:04:09.870> I'm<00:04:10.350> looking<00:04:10.740> forward<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.340> and

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
again bouncing the regular world with

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.519 
again bouncing the regular world with
her<00:04:35.860> pack<00:04:36.069> world<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.699> my<00:04:37.360> guests<00:04:37.870> one<00:04:38.229> thing<00:04:38.409> I

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:38.529 
her pack world and my guests one thing I

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:40.860 
her pack world and my guests one thing I
think<00:04:38.770> they<00:04:38.860> should<00:04:39.159> do<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:40.300> definitely<00:04:40.689> tell

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
think they should do is definitely tell

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.749 
think they should do is definitely tell
fill<00:04:41.050> up<00:04:41.229> or<00:04:41.439> not<00:04:41.650> tell<00:04:41.919> Phillip<00:04:42.340> but<00:04:42.490> Phillip

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
fill up or not tell Phillip but Phillip

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.550 
fill up or not tell Phillip but Phillip
finds<00:04:43.120> out<00:04:43.300> that<00:04:43.330> she's<00:04:43.749> a<00:04:43.840> werewolf<00:04:44.199> I<00:04:44.349> think

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
finds out that she's a werewolf I think

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.749 
finds out that she's a werewolf I think
that<00:04:44.680> would<00:04:44.770> make<00:04:44.889> things<00:04:45.039> interesting<00:04:45.460> in

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
that would make things interesting in

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.170 
that would make things interesting in
season<00:04:46.120> 1<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:47.199> hope<00:04:47.349> to<00:04:47.379> see<00:04:47.529> that<00:04:47.949> and<00:04:48.789> again
