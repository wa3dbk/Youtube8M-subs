00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.880 

it's<00:00:35.190> got<00:00:35.550> cutouts<00:00:36.480> all<00:00:37.020> separate<00:00:37.620> for<00:00:37.829> all

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890

it's got cutouts all separate for all
these<00:00:38.629> it<00:00:39.629> still<00:00:39.899> fits<00:00:40.140> everything<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.980> that's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
these it still fits everything so that's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.529 
these it still fits everything so that's
great<00:00:42.379> um<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:44.219> complaint<00:00:44.850> though<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
great um one complaint though that I

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.110 
great um one complaint though that I
have<00:00:45.809> about<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.260> case<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.760> not

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
have about this case is that it's not

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.310 
have about this case is that it's not
rounded<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.050> sides<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:50.160> actually<00:00:50.700> um

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
rounded at the sides it's actually um

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.580 
rounded at the sides it's actually um
it's<00:00:52.320> got<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.770> square<00:00:53.309> cuts<00:00:54.230> for<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> sides

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
it's got like square cuts for the sides

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.950 
it's got like square cuts for the sides
so<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.550> kind<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.910> makes<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.390> little<00:00:57.510> harder

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
so that kind of makes it a little harder

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.040 
so that kind of makes it a little harder
to<00:00:58.109> hold<00:00:58.320> I'd<00:00:59.100> rather<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> rounded<00:01:00.270> edge

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
to hold I'd rather have a rounded edge

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.240 
to hold I'd rather have a rounded edge
case<00:01:01.550> that<00:01:02.550> would<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.730> much<00:01:02.910> nicer<00:01:04.100> but<00:01:05.100> it's

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
case that would be much nicer but it's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.539 
case that would be much nicer but it's
clear<00:01:05.659> keeps<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.900> originality<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> phone

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
clear keeps the originality of the phone

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.090 
clear keeps the originality of the phone
it's<00:01:09.030> got<00:01:09.270> max<00:01:09.990> boost<00:01:10.380> written<00:01:10.830> at<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> bottom

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
it's got max boost written at the bottom

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
to be too bulky I haven't tried out the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.120 
to be too bulky I haven't tried out the
spigen<00:01:28.140> case<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> six<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:31.200> don't<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
spigen case for the six I don't the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
spigen case for the six I don't the
thing<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.600> about<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.930> big<00:01:34.140> case<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
thing that I like about this big case is

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.390 
thing that I like about this big case is
the<00:01:34.680> rounded<00:01:35.070> edges<00:01:35.460> um<00:01:36.140> but<00:01:37.400> Andy<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.610> oh

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
the rounded edges um but Andy like oh

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.630 
the rounded edges um but Andy like oh
yeah

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
yeah

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.429 
yeah
so<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.060> case<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.570> also<00:01:42.720> has<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.259> UH<00:01:44.360> little

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
so this case it also has the UH little

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.620 
so this case it also has the UH little
edges<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.799> end<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.759> when<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.360> put<00:01:48.540> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
edges on the end so that when you put it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.630 
edges on the end so that when you put it
down<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> back<00:01:49.140> doesn't<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:49.680> scratched<00:01:49.920> just

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
