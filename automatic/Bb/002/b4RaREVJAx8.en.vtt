00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.659
 the first game in the U23 competition was played by young pec 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.659
 zwolle against young almere city fc 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.159
 and Almere city started strong 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.429
 but the first shot from the right goes wide 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.749
 attracted a lot of audiences to this competition every other and Jody Lukoki 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.920
 Almere city again 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.710
 turns away with the ball 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.710
 but an easy-to-catch ball for boy de jong 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.300
 then pec zwolle 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.670
 the long ball on tv with a degree he does not get the ball under control 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.880
 pec zwolle plays the tricky first half 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.440
 with almere city on the right again 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 and that ravelli shot by junte 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.730
 hot wine 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.460
 chew mouth chose 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.470
 puts the ball back on eight 4 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.470
 but he shoots into the hands of boy de jong 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.510
 hats mennega way back looking for moreau only he shoot the ball at this 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.240
 test 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.659
 the film about all that made a great goal against FC last Friday 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:24.790
 utrecht 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.250
 Almere City was quite offensive in the first half 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.660
 with the ball enzio boldewijn and he is the Almere city on a 2 0 lead 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.980
 pec zwolle tries to reach the same level 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.430
 so not dior 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.590
 moreau 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.440
 the poor defending of almere city ends the shot of rick deckard 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.610
 just beside 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.280
 after more than half an hour playing salasiwa 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.770
 in Kardan's pocket 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.770
 he is a man from it was the ball neatly rested 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.380
 2 0 for almere city 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.650
 the end of the first half the cross from black sun and the header from pioneers 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.830
 goes over the globe 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.830
 and so time goes without rest with a 2 0 backlog 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:14.689
 the second half it is almer city again in the attack the shot from ajar 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.739
 rescue from becoming young and in the rebound from the rescue of boy de jong 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:21.399
 the newcomer was excellent the keeper this evening 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.049
 at the end of the race the cross from the left campos racing bike 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.049
 and he already places the final score on the board 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.539
 so dirty pec zwolle his first competition in this blog competition 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:47.009
 I think I have to say there is not such a very dissatisfied name for the first one 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:52.609
 goal fell why there I think the better and several times nice and bah opportunities 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.669
 after make them into ulm 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.479
 we finally get a good chance again and everyone is in the counterattack 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:04.049
 and there after that you saw sinking further and further into a second as the third and 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.649
 it just went on 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:08.519
 I started to play further and further apart 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.979
 if it just had to get another chance 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:11.930
 that to 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.769
 That Almere is much better at stimulating us 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.089
 because of the plans and 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:20.089
 the agents we did not perform well 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.889
 also a lot were unrest oh well I think we had pointed out more calmly 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.899
 had lifted over the horse 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:31.659
 improved our game would come all in all i think we have enough chances 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.479
 had to score a goal 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.639
 and all the ways that one has 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.639
 with a little more return from a chance one 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.889
 Feyenoord's goal was to finish as high as possible 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.739
 then you should win this type of competition 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.279
 and unfortunately that did not work out 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:54.200
 We have to take Heerenveen against Groningen Meccano but still a tap 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:58.519
 came in well catch the hijacker yes this name is dragged in total 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:03.269
 the atmosphere is more fun when you win is that it is fun and natural 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.169
 I am not going to come home here 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.029
 such a great price 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.069
 for example so far very good 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.669
 up to now
