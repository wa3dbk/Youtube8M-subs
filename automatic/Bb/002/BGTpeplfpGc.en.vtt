intersection<00:00:11.370> vortex<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.240> u-turn<00:00:13.110> okay<00:00:13.860> so

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
intersection vortex and u-turn okay so

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.650 
intersection vortex and u-turn okay so
the<00:00:14.219> first<00:00:14.370> infected<00:00:14.820> spot<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.299> I'm<00:00:15.389> going

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
to show you is on the map intersection

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.179 
to show you is on the map intersection
so<00:00:18.270> basically<00:00:18.630> all<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.960> need<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.289> do<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.830> jump

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
so basically all you need to do is jump

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the side of the building and then you

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.370 
the side of the building and then you
can<00:00:24.000> get<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.210> top<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.600> open<00:00:24.930> window<00:00:25.260> and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
can get on top of this open window and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.230 
can get on top of this open window and
when<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.070> top<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.400> open<00:00:26.699> window<00:00:26.849> they

obviously<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.250> good<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:32.489> online

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
obviously it's not so good for online

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.490 
obviously it's not so good for online
infected<00:00:33.630> because<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> throwing<00:00:34.469> knife

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
but it is very good for other game types

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.690 
but it is very good for other game types
such<00:00:36.750> as<00:00:36.780> Kill<00:00:37.110> Confirmed<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.770> domination<00:00:38.370> as

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
the map you turn which will hopefully

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.180 
the map you turn which will hopefully
allow<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.929> get<00:02:10.020> loads<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.349> kills<00:02:10.590> so
