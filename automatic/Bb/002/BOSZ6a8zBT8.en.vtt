00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.589
 of beautiful makeup inspired by mila 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.780

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.090
 intense eyes a smoky eyes in 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.040

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.990
 for occasions of night or for occasions 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.550
 very elegant for this occasion is going to 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.050
 put the voice on top of the video because I 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.480
 it was much easier to record from that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.369
 way then this is the only part in 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.840
 the one that I'm going to talk like that directly and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.340
 and those are going to listen only to me 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.260
 voice and the image I hope you do not 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.060
 bother that is very easy makeup 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.320
 do as always and I hope that you 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.530
 like it very much then if you want it 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.270
 learn to do continue with the tutorial 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.640
 I'm going to start delineating the line of 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.620
 water from my eyes very very well we want 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.149
 that the whole eye is very dark 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.770
 then I will apply this color on 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.510
 the entire water line and on the line 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.000
 higher than the water below the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.900
 eyelashes and by the way this pencil is of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.880
 champagne 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.350
 before recording the video I applied a 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.180
 little bit of proof of shade is for 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.370
 what I have there something on top of 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.410
 eyelid and if you can tell I'm 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.410
 super sick then excuse my voice 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.690
 once you've delineated very well 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.820
 inside and above all you are going to take a 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.500
 Very small brush and you will blur 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.500
 that line to give a smoky touch 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.360
 also diffuses this color a little 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.190
 under the eyes to give that touch 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.259
 super intense that has that look of 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.330
 mila kunis and if you have small eyes 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:36.780
 how are you going to stretch that little tail towards 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:38.759
 outside to lengthen your eyes I will take 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.920
 a matte coffee that's called brynner and it's 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.509
 of the palette of palin abc sigman soil 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.200
 apply over the entire base that we have 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.210
 previously done 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.950
 or the crust of color well attached to my 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.149
 eyelashes and I'm going to apply it in 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.149
 diagonal outward 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.409
 now I will take smoke that is a brown color 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.540
 as with a few kisses is a color 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.190
 difficult to describe and I will apply in 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:15.640
 the remaining space in the inner part 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:17.380
 of the eye can try to blur it with 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.390
 the other coffee and it will look lovely 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.150
 because they are different shades of coffee in 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.130
 a single canvas takes neuro brochita 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.959
 clean and blur the edges of 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.400
 the colors to make it look even more 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.400
 smoked and clean makeup 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.099
 and with the same coffee and a small brush 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.420
 can seal the base that we put in the 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:43.459
 lower part of the eye can take a 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.019
 very dark coffee and with the little bank 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:50.840
 blur it applies to me in the part 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.459
 external of the eye as forming a bird and 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.900
 we blur it over the basin to 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.900
 integrate it with the other colors 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.510
 I will take a black matte and with a very 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.849
 thin moved delineate for the last time 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.620
 the line below I'm going to take a color 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.849
 matte cream and very will apply it below 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.849
 of the eyebrow to illuminate 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.890
 we take the black pencil and we turn to 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.840
 make a very thin line attached to 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.430
 the line of the tabs to return 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.350
 a little bit of intensity but the 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.660
 brochita I will blur to make it a 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:39.520
 little bit more smoking or smoking and it's going to 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:41.050
 take out a small tail at the end you can 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.880
 take a maybelline gel eyeliner 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.470
 and how to make a well-thin line 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.330
 attached to the eyelashes that will give 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.680
 definition to my eye and it will be even 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.680
 more more intense 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.800
 I would also apply a little bit about 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:01.650
 water line to make it more intense 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:03.330
 to one now I will be very very well 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.240
 eyelashes because I'm going to apply eyelashes 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.340
 false and that is the first step 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.650
 today I will use these whiskeys of the 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.040
 brand par fly and they are super beautiful and 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.040
 long 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.600
 lately I'm using the glue 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.430
 black and I love then that's the 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.440
 that I am using today and with the help of 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:29.930
 my tweezers, I'm applying them to 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:32.180
 that I like how it is can apply 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.490
 a lot of mask to integrate my 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.360
 false eyelashes with the real ones and give it 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.520
 even more intensity to my eyes 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.409
 this tab is the mega beach and 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.729
 Maybelline if they wanted to know and not 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.150
 forget to apply on the tabs 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.150
 lower 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.410
 and this would be all for the make-up os 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.390
 now let's move to the face to 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.400
 try to use the referred fort base of 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.500
 meeting in beige golden color and I'm going to 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.150
 apply thus note haditas on all the 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.010
 face be very careful with the 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.600
 makeup of the eyes and tries to 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.820
 clean in the area of ​​dark circles to 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:20.080
 that everything looks much tidier and 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:22.060
 perfect to use the concealer 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.890
 study to finish take and I will apply it 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.480
 over the whole area of ​​dark circles for 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.480
 illuminate and highlight my cheekbones 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.839
 I'm going to take the small skewer again 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.819
 without applying more shade and I will return 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:44.639
 to blur to give back a little 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.559
 of tuxedo to this part take all my 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:51.929

 open maybelline and with one more powder 

00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:56.069
 dark of that but I'm going to mark everything 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:06:15.719
 the outline of the face to refine it and 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:17.669
 make it a little more dramatic this 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:19.499
 The trip is very natural and the brand is the 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.050
 color if you apply it only in 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:23.999
 manzanitas of the face for the lip 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.099
 shire with the terrible terrible and I 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:28.519
 so apply a thin layer especially the 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.519
 lips 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.490
 and to give it a touch of peach color 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.850
