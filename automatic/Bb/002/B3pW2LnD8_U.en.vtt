00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.570
 around here it seems that we have to 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.910
 regroup as in the style of the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.130
 classic games go by random levels and 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.050
 without any history we will go to see 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.150

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.570

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.090

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.430
 it's familiar right there I can not 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.770
 remember my past I can not even remember 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.180
 because I'm here I can not even remember 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.640
 if you with the shopping list one or 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.310
 It seems without problems if you have problems 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.619
 of memory you need the brain is not 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.500
 true what I wanted and look a man of 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.360
 metal I'm really worried good 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.030
 that is cooked here full I'm 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.030
 knowing nothing but I like the heart 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.000
 as an organ since manolo added during 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.850
 the great construction we can go that 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.040
 has resorted courage running the 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.350
 Sunday I can not find the room of the 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.100
 computer boss that's not up to the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.189
 next game does not matter 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.990
 we go there because we are the people not 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.990
 we are pretend a team you want 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.580
 and we are here flight and I see that 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.670
 you are all here therefore not even 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:29.430
 I knew that even I was an edmond blogger 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.430
 I'm not jackman, I'm 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:40.340
 hello metal sonic did a little bit that did not 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:44.160
 we saw each other I am the powerful of both 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.310
 because it was not long ago 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.550
 as we can in your blush already have as 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:56.160
 of water 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:56.160
 because of course it could work not seen 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:05.020
 chicken world and the sant and the sonic metal 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.020
 has been defeated that's because you know 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.540
 and we do not know but where is the man 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.310
 that made a scare of pieces port 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.190
 he paid attention to the man behind the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.980
 closed port there is that clan you have 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.980
 something we need and we want but 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.800
 we were then governed by a 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.630
 pose is my heart you do not have or froggie and 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.930
 well I can not give you anything that you do not have 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:36.150
 already in your shadow possession you already 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.150
 you have a brain that I already know 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.360
 if you had a heart I did not have that 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.270
 inferior to worrying about your 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.480
 objectives destroyed acceptable and logical 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.130
 as paradoxically and logically I think that 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.380
 you also knew that frankie was 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.230
 with you all the time that I refer is a 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.250
 spiritual sense I do not mean that 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.580
 I was in your queue all the time 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.810
 and I do not think you can offer us a 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.720
 game that brings us back to our roots 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.780
 of classic games true new default 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.000
 or if you noticed , you already took part of 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.060
 one 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.580
 yes but it's bad that the fans do not 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.580
 like a lot one per side
