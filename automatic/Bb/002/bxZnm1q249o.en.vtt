 many more doors to this fill with a 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.680
 excellent dry oregano 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.590

 and if you dare with the flavors with a 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.290
 little bit of cinnamon would also be 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.730
 air with me so that it feels good there 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.730
 the cumin a spoonful we have mixed 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.790
 a little bit of fine salt we did not get 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.400
 the room was a little fine salt and 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.530
 we have the meat filling ready to 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.530
 this preparation is complementary 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.450
 but and this one that is getting there is 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.980
 to move it slowly and slowly 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.500
 we remember in a little oil of 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.019
 olive with onion with red pepper 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.849

 your choice exactly when you go 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.609
 changing the color of the meat 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.799
 the cooking pie because this is going 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.079
 to have a second bake in the oven 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.109
 rossi do not stop ready let's go with the 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.659
 chorizo and juanito where is the corn here 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.819
 is the corn where is enough with the 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.349
 corn that lime soaked sometimes and all the 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.180
 viewers who are watching us in 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.900
 this time is cool this time 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:16.010
 I'm fine for this recipe but as 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.010
 shit 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.680
 urged he says never I will say 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.600
 money that returns it and down the wig 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.600
 of game but I will not answer anything 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.189
 because it's going to have an impressive 68 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.150
 flors of those six raw cores you're going 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.430
 to raze 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.110
 half in this narrow case but the 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.939
 stripes good still you look good as 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.340
 kind of right but they only process 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:45.550
 the corn kernels and 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.710
 let's leave it so that it feels good 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:53.400
 the texture of the corn then the 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.400
 boy who feels good 89 million 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.330
 I came with dreaming about santi cook 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.229
 so 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:14.789
 half rejected it processes it and the other 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.789
 half leave the beans 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.069
 66 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:45.789
 the last opportunity in the life of 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:48.669
 any of the three treat is 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:52.830
 really easy preparations to make 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.830
 Vicente to the Spanish 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:03.550
 back a loaded number 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.050
 to be able to take advantage of this is also 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.540
 to win 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.810
 good 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:13.880
 if I 'm liking but I'll continue 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.880
 in the last days 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.500
 with the corn we then have to do 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.300
 all that very very easy in an egg 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.760
 we are going to add to this preparation a 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.740
 egg and one tablespoon flour 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.500
 calabrese nothing but a spoonful 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.370
 of flour we mix well a little bit 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.370
 of salt 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.320
 It is a method 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.970
 Ivan rejection that he has in his body 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.990
 about the cost made 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.129
 listening I have problem with the 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.810
 hear 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:52.810
 let's go to the card 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:14.890
 and a teaspoon a little bit with this 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:17.110
 we do not have to see how much time now what 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.210
 will do the rest we will put together 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.350
 this race as the weapon can not be 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.350
 almost individual 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.310
 what we are going to put a little bit of 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.910
 oil in the base 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.910
 analyzing the pots
