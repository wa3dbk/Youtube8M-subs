opponents<00:02:58.110> in<00:02:58.170> our<00:02:58.260> pool<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.680> also<00:02:59.069> think<00:02:59.430> SD<00:03:00.300> if

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
opponents in our pool I also think SD if

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.750 
opponents in our pool I also think SD if
he's<00:03:00.660> not<00:03:00.750> bad<00:03:00.990> either<00:03:01.140> but<00:03:01.530> I'm<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.610> house

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
he's not bad either but I'm the house

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.970 
he's not bad either but I'm the house
song<00:03:02.970> oh<00:03:03.120> ok<00:03:03.510> FB<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.050> actually<00:03:04.470> think<00:03:04.709> this<00:03:04.860> is

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
song oh ok FB I actually think this is

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.290 
song oh ok FB I actually think this is
one<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.280> worst<00:03:05.400> ages<00:03:05.820> in<00:03:05.940> this<00:03:06.090> matchup

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
one of the worst ages in this matchup

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.540 
one of the worst ages in this matchup
for<00:03:06.720> Falcon<00:03:07.110> really<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.680> believe<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.160> she

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
for Falcon really I believe that she

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.130 
for Falcon really I believe that she
absolutely<00:03:08.760> dominates<00:03:09.480> Falcon<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.900> stage

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
absolutely dominates Falcon on the stage

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.199 
absolutely dominates Falcon on the stage
just<00:03:10.709> because<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.340> his<00:03:11.580> linear<00:03:11.910> attack

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
just because of his linear attack

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.820 
just because of his linear attack
patterns<00:03:12.630> if<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.230> do<00:03:13.350> what<00:03:13.470> Michigan<00:03:13.650> is

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
patterns if you do what Michigan is

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.870 
patterns if you do what Michigan is
doing<00:03:13.980> right<00:03:14.070> now<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.280> just<00:03:14.489> stay<00:03:14.640> on<00:03:14.730> one

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
doing right now and just stay on one

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.880 
doing right now and just stay on one
side<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> stage<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.660> Falcon<00:03:16.260> runs<00:03:16.440> at<00:03:16.650> you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
side of the stage and Falcon runs at you

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.890 
side of the stage and Falcon runs at you
you<00:03:17.250> can<00:03:17.370> do<00:03:17.430> exactly<00:03:17.730> what<00:03:17.850> he<00:03:17.940> just<00:03:18.150> did<00:03:18.180> call

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
you can do exactly what he just did call

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.770 
you can do exactly what he just did call
his<00:03:19.170> jump<00:03:19.470> with<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.680> forward<00:03:20.040> tilt<00:03:20.250> or<00:03:20.780> just

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
his jump with a forward tilt or just

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.300 
his jump with a forward tilt or just
dash<00:03:21.959> under<00:03:22.260> him<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.440> reset<00:03:22.830> things<00:03:23.010> back<00:03:23.190> to

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
dash under him and reset things back to

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.560 
dash under him and reset things back to
neutral<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.790> you're<00:03:24.030> saying<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.300> mew2king

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
neutral and you're saying that mew2king

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.810 
neutral and you're saying that mew2king
kayla<00:03:25.110> just<00:03:25.620> by<00:03:25.860> staying<00:03:26.070> on<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.310> ledge<00:03:26.459> can't

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
kayla just by staying on the ledge can't

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.400 
kayla just by staying on the ledge can't
cover<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.330> many<00:03:27.510> options<00:03:27.690> just<00:03:28.080> by<00:03:28.260> that

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
cover so many options just by that

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.570 
cover so many options just by that
exactly<00:03:30.140> great<00:03:31.140> crouch<00:03:31.530> cancel<00:03:32.040> like<00:03:32.190> yeah<00:03:32.400> I

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
exactly great crouch cancel like yeah I

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.670 
exactly great crouch cancel like yeah I
just<00:03:32.760> think<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.000> your<00:03:33.810> attack<00:03:34.230> patterns<00:03:34.590> are

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
just think that your attack patterns are

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.890 
just think that your attack patterns are
too<00:03:34.860> obvious<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.550> on<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:35.910> stage<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.660> don't

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
too obvious and on this stage you don't

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.960 
too obvious and on this stage you don't
have<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.260> platforms<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.130> really<00:03:38.370> help<00:03:38.730> you

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
have the platforms to really help you

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.520 
have the platforms to really help you
and<00:03:39.260> oh<00:03:43.400> moreover<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.610> just<00:03:45.000> feel<00:03:45.180> like<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.630> lot

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
and oh moreover I just feel like a lot

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.780
