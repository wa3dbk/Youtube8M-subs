00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.970
 hello if trini from the craft blog 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.609
 euroresidents and in this tutorial we are going 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.070
 to see how they make these decorated cups 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.470
 with Christmas motives to put chuches 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.860
 and give to friends 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.140
 we're going to need a paper cup of 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.330
 these that give us sometimes in the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.860
 coffee shops to take them you can 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.370
 get in some stores of these 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.600
 multiply 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:30.970
 there are usually these types of cups 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.570
 permanent markers in black and 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.910
 Red 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.700
 if you have if you find some orange 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.100
 then also a piece of cardboard or 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.760
 eva brown gum scissors 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.750
 a pencil 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.000
 and hot or cold silicone me in this 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.760
 case I will use hot silicone 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.570
 this is the silicone gun but 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.420
 You can also use cold silicone 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.520
 The first thing we're going to do is I'm going to 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.370
 do daddy then we're going to 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.540
 paint the top of the glass you see 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.820
 that there is a flange as it is the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.200
 flange if your cup does not have 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.290
 flange then approximately it is a 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.540
 we will mark it and then 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.610
 we're going to fill it with the color black and 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.530
 we're going to paint it black I'm going to 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.650
 do with a paper cup but 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.420
 You can also decorate a pot that is 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.040
 You can paint a container of pot 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.140
 of white first and then you give 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.590
 What do you do with dad's shape like that? 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.020
 Noel 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.030
 so then we have the part 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.409
 I'm going to do what I painted 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.870
 are the eyes the nose and mouth 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.670
 first I will mark him with the pencil 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.360
 in case I'm wrong in case I do not like it 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.090
 how is it I am looking for the form of the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.620
 you can do it like this or you can 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.850
 do as you like 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.850
 that we mark it first 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.600
 by the mouth you can also put 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.680
 objects of these that there are plastic that 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.180
 they are also super funny 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.030
 for once I'm happy with the 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.840
 drawing what I'm going to do is already 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.930
 fill in then for the nose I'm going to 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.569
 use the marker in red I do 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.200
 First 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.170
 the drawing and then we'll fill if 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.219
 I'm wrong nothing happens stuffed a little 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.219
 wider and you're 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.570
 carefully 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.580
 then with the black marker I'm going to 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.350
 make the eyes 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.350
 and what is the part of the mouth 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.019
 we put them marked first and then 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.469
 press a little more and I do the little circle 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.469
 mortal 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.569
 and we have finished our 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.540
 basic 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.310
 is that good 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.579
 we can fill it in later 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.579
 we want 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.310
 but I have here a bag of jelly beans 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.700
 I've put them in a torn film 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.209
 a lacito 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.209
 Y 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.610
 you already have a very cute little detail for 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.350
 give to friends or take to china 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.350
 for coworkers 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.659
 Now what I'm going to do is the kingdom 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.090
 It is very simple to do much more than 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.879
 in santa claus 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.030
 We are going to need good first thing 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.560
 let's do is paste the pompom these 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.849
 they already sell them in the stores of 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.260
 crafts on the big 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:49.280
 surfaces you can already find this 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.840
 kind of I'm going to draw the eyes and what 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.519
 same as with Santa Claus if you do not want 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.290
 draw the little eyes you can also put 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.879
 the little eyes of these plastic that 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.160
 they come as they are sold in the 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.640
 stationers now we mark with the 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.640
 marker pen 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.650
 and with the silicone gun I'm going to 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.650
 stick your nose 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.810
 is we press a little 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.240
 Now I'm going to draw what are the 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.350
 reindeer bunnies as the drawing 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.760
 first with the pencil in 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.550
 on the cardboard 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.540
 I think you can use cardboard or rubber 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.540
 eva in brown 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.060
 I frame the form and I will report it to the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.810
 time to cut or make the horns 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.810
 consider 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.919
 they are you have to go one for one side and 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:57.300
 the other for the other side 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.300
 when drawing it 9 the turn 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.440
 no longer draw the horns in it 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.440
 sense 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.600
 because not to be interested in having 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.890
 in mind that has a horn to the 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.890
 right and a course to the left 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.949
 we draw the following one helping us the 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:26.469
 first that we have trimmed so that 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:26.469
 be the two equal bunnies 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.090
 marc ice 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.090
 you remember 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.770
 we already have two horns and what I'm going 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.470
 to do is with a brown marker I will 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:52.930
 mark what is the external part 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.930
 to give them a little bit of good food 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.260
 and now I'll stick by stick 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.440
 the inner part of the glass so that it does not 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.730
 see 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.730
 a little silicone 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:19.550
 we stick the little bodies 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.620
 and it is already 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.790
 As you can see we have a very 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.790
 friendly very easy to make 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.280
 and super economic that comes great 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.050
 to give as a gift so if you want to have a 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.009
 nice little detail with people to the 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.580
 what do you want 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.259
 sure this they love 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.740
 we just see each other next video 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.740
 goodbye
