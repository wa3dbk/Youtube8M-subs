00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
too much because it will start going

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.930 
too much because it will start going

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
flowing along the side and then we'll

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.240 
flowing along the side and then we'll
make<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> huge<00:02:36.360> mess<00:02:36.629> in<00:02:36.870> your<00:02:36.900> grill<00:02:37.230> pan<00:02:37.470> which

make a huge mess in your grill pan which

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.850 
make a huge mess in your grill pan which
is<00:02:38.430> not<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.269> good<00:02:39.360> idea<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.620> want<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.830> just

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
is not a good idea so you want to just

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.290 
is not a good idea so you want to just
put<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.129> little<00:02:41.190> bit<00:02:41.489> just<00:02:41.670> make<00:02:42.000> sure<00:02:42.150> you

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
put a little bit just make sure you

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.020 
put a little bit just make sure you
distribute<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.959> evenly<00:02:43.640> so<00:02:44.640> then<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.879> get

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
distribute it evenly so then you get

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.490 
distribute it evenly so then you get
bites<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.420> cheese<00:02:45.629> and<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.989> bedrooms<00:02:46.379> and

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
every bite and then top it with the

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.229 
every bite and then top it with the
other<00:02:49.440> slice<00:02:49.830> now<00:02:50.310> what<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.550> like<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:51.060> do

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
other slice now what I like to do

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.780 
other slice now what I like to do
actually<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.810> add<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.230> little<00:02:52.560> bit<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.040> butter

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
actually is add a little bit of butter

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.030 
actually is add a little bit of butter
onto<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.300> bread<00:02:54.569> directly<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.410> don't<00:02:55.860> like<00:02:55.950> to

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
onto the bread directly I don't like to

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.649 
onto the bread directly I don't like to
do<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.190> on<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.430> pan<00:02:56.610> itself<00:02:56.819> because<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.390> feel

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
do it on the pan itself because I feel

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.449 
do it on the pan itself because I feel
like<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:58.500> way<00:02:58.739> when<00:02:59.069> I'm<00:02:59.190> making<00:02:59.400> the

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
like that way when I'm making the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.820 
like that way when I'm making the
sandwiches<00:02:59.670> it<00:03:00.239> starts<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.629> burn<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.170> that's

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
sandwiches it starts to burn and that's

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.649 
sandwiches it starts to burn and that's
not<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.980> good<00:03:02.129> idea<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:02.760> I'm<00:03:03.269> going<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.480> go<00:03:03.629> ahead

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
not a good idea so I'm going to go ahead

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.000

here and then I'm going to flip this

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.320 
here and then I'm going to flip this
side<00:03:07.440> down<00:03:07.709> when<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.069> put<00:03:08.280> on<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.519> pan<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.209> then
