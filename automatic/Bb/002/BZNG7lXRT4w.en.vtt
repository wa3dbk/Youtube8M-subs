00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:23.860

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.750
 the package and we have not bad that are 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.580
 minors 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.140
 corn and outside the workshop 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.140
 because we have a good eye 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.360
 it's good we can see it's clear 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.290
 perfect what are you beating on what 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.820
 I come I count on the cross 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.820
 who will take place after on the network 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.590
 14h04 33,4 m 2 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.590
 nick with two big arches 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.550
 You start by drawing because 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:59.250
 behind we decided to christian 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.200
 jaffe the boards she is today 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.559
 past the first cut two 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.559
 first pieces 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:13.720
 so that's the structure of the 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:15.960
 German mw city center massaged to 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.960
 upside 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.310
 ar so gilles was completely 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.900
 buried by the by the day to success 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.220
 hand but you are she cruel fate in 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.910
 more at home at night it's over 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:40.800
 she stays there all the time yes but 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.270
 this is it's shameful balance and 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.140
 we croutons bread croutons noon or 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.690
 How's it going 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:51.300
 shit good I'll tell them it takes 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.290
 that they think that one but it is necessary 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.720
 even though I think about your conditions 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.720
 work is not to mess with what 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.550
 so he tells me what do you do there you are in 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.539
 struggling with the relief that's it 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.539
 you are fighting with the relief 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.209
 serve yesterday the new of onlookers 7 of this 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.330
 little piece of town is for now 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:26.519
 the mouths of the judges of the place du 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.530
 market which is in truth it cut 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.900
 playing time will be an evocation of a 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.700
 marketplace that normally 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:38.390
 should arrive so far okay 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:42.420
 but there the public that betrayed 6 ok so 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.030
 I cut and yes as if really 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.280
 had sliced ​​the world 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.900
 ok so that's an evocation for 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.130
 the moment I have not you have not 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.870
 completely because friends all 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.940
 characters from all the stands I have not 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.570
 do it again there terraces it will be 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.440
 coffee terraces if not so there 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.760
 will have plenty of people sitting in buying there 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.200
 there will be market aisles so I 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.720
 know yet exactly my has 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.220
 willing i do not know i'll maybe 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.560
 put small street lamps to make 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.560
 a reading n 1 of the plants like that 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.600
 and watch that there's even sorting 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:33.220
 waste because we are developing 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:34.690
 durable flyby way it misses 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.120
 yet city to you there's no rotten 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.870
 of course that's the beginning actually 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.260
 but it's pretty good 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.209
 listen I like this species of one 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.459
 feel all the potential of the thing in fact 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.140
 for precisely not to make a thing a 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.790
 little monotonous is a little rectangle 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.150
 Caussade King and me there is a little 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.530
 dirty densely finally feint montano 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.430
 so that's it's a word game a 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.660
 knee it's a play on words we put what 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.620
 we leave the panel the magnifying glass van la 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.500
 parra 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.870
 that's what happens to me it's not time 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:17.229
 that I'm going out it's rotten it was for 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:22.419
 laugh it's going to come its way almost 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:24.870
 continue then explain tells us that you 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.020
 are doing 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.500
 the resins best formula for the 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.910
 boat dike so here we have three 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.700
 competing residents that's it all to 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.940
 we are at 3 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.110
 very funny but not very good and how much 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.450
 of time it takes pretty much for that to 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:52.720
 dry then we'll see that tomorrow 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:59.260
 no you stay there all night good then 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:01.380
 here is the violent environment and very very 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.380
 long time 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:10.109
 Julian is six months this is over 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.109
 here is courage 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:19.880
 so I think bruno he had a 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.880
 little desire for strawberries is its genesis 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.500
 wonderful happened 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.120
 so there always the new module of the 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:35.680
 downtown with a few few 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:46.620
 plants were that were affixed 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:46.620
 over here not over soon that noise 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.590
 Brüno takes off 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.520
 so here we are in the second 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.770
 part of the workshop and look at that's it 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.849
 which is nice with the beautiful days 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.860
 pass and that is completely bathed 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:23.240
 light is not bad for 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:25.440
 work then here we have the three 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.100
 the next e3 module 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:32.780
 in any case it will constitute the 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.780
 center here 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.560
 it's the priest who will really have the most 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.560
 of most coaches system building 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.120
 so here we are on the left side 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.490
 of the network so the three new ones the 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.520
 three new modules will serve you 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.639
 make 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.840
 leave 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:56.070
 in the city center knowing that this here 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.810
 hop 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.040
 and already built very weird pass 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.960
 the hand like this so before a 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.270
 camcorder it gives a little impression 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.460
 to be 13 liters of helium and then if 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.350
 sun here sun here it's nice weather 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:11.940
