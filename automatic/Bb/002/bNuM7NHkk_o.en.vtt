probably the most popular because it's a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.510

abyss very worth it and the reason that

abyss very worth it and the reason that
crafting<00:04:22.310> laws<00:04:22.460> through<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:22.789> abyss<00:04:23.000> is<00:04:23.210> worth

crafting laws through the abyss is worth

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.990 
crafting laws through the abyss is worth
it<00:04:23.539> in<00:04:23.659> the<00:04:23.750> first<00:04:23.960> place<00:04:24.200> is<00:04:24.409> because

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
it in the first place is because

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.880 
it in the first place is because
it's<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.150> bit<00:04:26.300> faster<00:04:26.660> experience<00:04:26.810> per<00:04:27.140> our<00:04:27.290> two

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
it's a bit faster experience per our two

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.020 
it's a bit faster experience per our two
to<00:04:28.010> three<00:04:28.160> thousand<00:04:28.460> experience<00:04:28.820> per<00:04:28.910> hour

to three thousand experience per hour

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.150 
to three thousand experience per hour
faster<00:04:29.510> than<00:04:29.690> crafting<00:04:29.930> laws<00:04:30.290> through<00:04:30.680> the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
faster than crafting laws through the

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.440 
faster than crafting laws through the
balloon<00:04:31.340> method<00:04:31.700> which<00:04:31.850> does<00:04:32.000> make<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.330> worth

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
balloon method which does make it worth

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.940 
balloon method which does make it worth
it<00:04:32.600> in<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.720> long<00:04:32.780> run<00:04:33.110> but<00:04:33.320> only<00:04:33.500> if<00:04:33.770> you're

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
it in the long run but only if you're

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.290 
it in the long run but only if you're
willing<00:04:33.980> to<00:04:34.280> spend<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.640> time<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.850> get<00:04:35.180> the

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
pickaxes so of course we're best runs

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.290 
pickaxes so of course we're best runs
are<00:04:37.010> going<00:04:37.070> to<00:04:37.190> be<00:04:37.280> baking<00:04:37.580> at<00:04:37.700> Edgeville<00:04:38.120> and

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
are going to be baking at Edgeville and

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.460 
are going to be baking at Edgeville and
this<00:04:38.390> is<00:04:38.480> what<00:04:38.630> your<00:04:38.780> setup<00:04:38.990> is<00:04:39.140> probably

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
this is what your setup is probably

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.930 
this is what your setup is probably
going<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.710> look<00:04:39.800> like<00:04:40.070> you<00:04:40.550> will<00:04:40.700> have<00:04:40.730> the

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
going to look like you will have the

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.460 
going to look like you will have the
bronze<00:04:41.150> pickaxe<00:04:41.510> in<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.690> inventory<00:04:41.930> because

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
bronze pickaxe in the inventory because

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.020 
bronze pickaxe in the inventory because
there's<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:43.040> can't<00:04:43.520> have<00:04:43.640> it<00:04:43.730> equipped

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
there's you can't have it equipped

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.580 
there's you can't have it equipped
because<00:04:44.450> it'll<00:04:44.660> just<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:45.170> won't<00:04:45.350> really<00:04:45.530> work

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
because it'll just it won't really work

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.740 
because it'll just it won't really work
out<00:04:45.890> so<00:04:46.520> just<00:04:46.760> keeping<00:04:46.970> your<00:04:47.090> inventory<00:04:47.510> and

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
out so just keeping your inventory and

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.060 
out so just keeping your inventory and
then<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:48.080> would<00:04:48.380> recommend<00:04:48.470> wearing<00:04:48.770> full

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
then I would recommend wearing full

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.530 
then I would recommend wearing full
graceful<00:04:49.550> because<00:04:49.940> it's<00:04:50.180> one<00:04:50.300> of<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.450> only

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
graceful because it's one of the only

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.850 
graceful because it's one of the only
things<00:04:50.720> you<00:04:50.840> can<00:04:50.990> take<00:04:51.110> onto<00:04:51.380> in<00:04:51.470> Toronto<00:04:51.740> and

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
things you can take onto in Toronto and

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.480 
things you can take onto in Toronto and
the<00:04:51.920> full<00:04:52.130> effect<00:04:52.460> will<00:04:53.680> reduce<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.890> drain

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
the full effect will reduce the drain

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.010 
the full effect will reduce the drain
rate<00:04:55.640> of<00:04:55.760> your<00:04:55.850> run<00:04:55.970> energy<00:04:56.300> by<00:04:56.450> 30<00:04:56.690> percent

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
rate of your run energy by 30 percent

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.659 
rate of your run energy by 30 percent
when<00:04:57.110> you're<00:04:57.230> standing<00:04:57.410> still<00:04:57.740> or<00:04:57.950> walking

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
when you're standing still or walking

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.220 
when you're standing still or walking
and<00:04:59.680> it<00:05:00.680> also<00:05:00.919> reduces<00:05:01.130> your<00:05:01.840> weight<00:05:02.840> by<00:05:03.020> quite

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
and it also reduces your weight by quite

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.440 
and it also reduces your weight by quite
a<00:05:03.260> bit<00:05:03.350> so<00:05:03.620> you'll<00:05:03.800> be<00:05:03.890> below<00:05:04.130> zero<00:05:04.430> so<00:05:04.700> pretty

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
a bit so you'll be below zero so pretty

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.760 
a bit so you'll be below zero so pretty
much<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:05.720> best<00:05:05.810> way<00:05:05.960> you<00:05:06.020> can<00:05:06.200> go<00:05:06.320> if<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:06.620> do

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
much the best way you can go if you do

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.440 
much the best way you can go if you do
have<00:05:06.980> a<00:05:07.010> saradomin<00:05:07.520> god<00:05:07.880> book<00:05:08.120> then<00:05:08.360> you

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
have a saradomin god book then you

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.970 
have a saradomin god book then you
actually<00:05:08.600> can<00:05:08.780> take<00:05:08.960> God<00:05:09.290> books<00:05:09.530> on<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:09.860> in

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
actually can take God books on to in

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.770 
actually can take God books on to in
Toronto<00:05:10.280> so<00:05:10.520> if<00:05:10.970> you<00:05:11.060> have<00:05:11.150> a<00:05:11.210> saradomin<00:05:11.510> god

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
Toronto so if you have a saradomin god

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.060 
Toronto so if you have a saradomin god
book<00:05:11.960> that<00:05:12.080> will<00:05:12.169> give<00:05:12.290> a<00:05:12.320> bit<00:05:12.530> of<00:05:12.620> Defense

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
book that will give a bit of Defense

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.190 
book that will give a bit of Defense
bonuses<00:05:13.550> and<00:05:13.760> the<00:05:14.450> one<00:05:14.870> of<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:14.990> biggest

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
bonuses and the one of the biggest

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.260 
bonuses and the one of the biggest
drawbacks<00:05:15.710> to<00:05:15.919> crafting<00:05:16.310> Lords<00:05:16.970> through<00:05:17.180> the

drawbacks to crafting Lords through the

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.480 
drawbacks to crafting Lords through the
abyss<00:05:17.510> is<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:18.560> fact<00:05:18.770> that<00:05:18.919> you<00:05:19.280> will<00:05:19.430> be

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
abyss is the fact that you will be

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.400 
abyss is the fact that you will be
taking<00:05:19.850> a<00:05:19.910> lot<00:05:20.030> more<00:05:20.090> damage<00:05:20.390> and<00:05:20.810> if<00:05:21.140> you<00:05:21.260> have

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
taking a lot more damage and if you have

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.920 
taking a lot more damage and if you have
high<00:05:21.650> combat<00:05:22.280> level<00:05:22.520> 119<00:05:23.390> or<00:05:23.510> higher<00:05:23.660> than<00:05:23.810> you

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
high combat level 119 or higher than you

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.450 
high combat level 119 or higher than you
won't<00:05:24.080> actually<00:05:24.169> be<00:05:24.350> attacked<00:05:24.980> by<00:05:25.130> anything

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
won't actually be attacked by anything

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.280 
won't actually be attacked by anything
but<00:05:25.610> the<00:05:25.700> walkers<00:05:26.120> which<00:05:26.330> are<00:05:26.480> not<00:05:26.720> extremely

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
but the walkers which are not extremely

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.960 
but the walkers which are not extremely
high<00:05:27.470> hitting<00:05:27.770> but<00:05:27.980> you<00:05:28.669> will<00:05:28.790> still<00:05:28.940> be

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
high hitting but you will still be

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.730 
high hitting but you will still be
taking<00:05:29.300> a<00:05:29.360> lot<00:05:29.480> more<00:05:29.540> damage<00:05:29.990> since<00:05:30.200> with<00:05:30.560> a

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
taking a lot more damage since with a

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.620 
taking a lot more damage since with a
setup<00:05:30.979> like<00:05:31.070> this<00:05:31.190> you<00:05:31.970> have<00:05:32.120> hardly<00:05:32.390> any

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
setup like this you have hardly any

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.330 
setup like this you have hardly any
defensive<00:05:33.080> bonuses<00:05:33.440> at<00:05:33.560> all<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:33.950> the<00:05:34.100> reason

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
defensive bonuses at all and the reason

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.380 
defensive bonuses at all and the reason
is<00:05:34.400> because<00:05:34.430> you<00:05:34.700> simply<00:05:34.850> can't<00:05:35.030> take

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
is because you simply can't take

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.330 
is because you simply can't take
anything<00:05:35.660> on<00:05:35.870> to<00:05:35.990> in<00:05:36.110> Toronto<00:05:36.410> that<00:05:37.070> gives

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
anything on to in Toronto that gives

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.370 
anything on to in Toronto that gives
defensive<00:05:37.790> bonuses<00:05:38.150> really<00:05:38.390> so<00:05:38.600> that's

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
defensive bonuses really so that's

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.530 
defensive bonuses really so that's
that's<00:05:40.010> one<00:05:40.220> of<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.400> problems<00:05:40.820> and<00:05:41.030> you<00:05:41.120> will

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
that's one of the problems and you will

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.700 
that's one of the problems and you will
definitely<00:05:41.990> want<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.200> have<00:05:42.290> food<00:05:42.470> in<00:05:42.680> your

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
definitely want to have food in your

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.280 
definitely want to have food in your
bank<00:05:43.010> and<00:05:43.750> potatoes<00:05:44.750> with<00:05:44.840> cheese<00:05:45.020> are<00:05:45.169> a<00:05:45.200> good

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
bank and potatoes with cheese are a good

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.600 
bank and potatoes with cheese are a good
option<00:05:45.470> anything<00:05:46.010> really<00:05:46.160> that<00:05:46.280> you<00:05:46.400> feel

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
option anything really that you feel

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.950 
option anything really that you feel
like<00:05:46.729> using<00:05:46.880> it's<00:05:47.180> good<00:05:47.360> to<00:05:47.450> have<00:05:47.570> food<00:05:47.780> in

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
like using it's good to have food in

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.570 
like using it's good to have food in
your<00:05:48.050> bank<00:05:48.260> and<00:05:48.470> the<00:05:48.950> setup<00:05:49.130> is<00:05:49.280> pretty<00:05:49.490> much

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
your bank and the setup is pretty much

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.409 
your bank and the setup is pretty much
the<00:05:49.700> same<00:05:49.820> you<00:05:49.910> just<00:05:49.940> wanna<00:05:50.150> make<00:05:50.210> sure<00:05:50.360> you

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
the same you just wanna make sure you

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:51.610 
the same you just wanna make sure you
have<00:05:50.510> your<00:05:50.600> pickaxes<00:05:51.110> right<00:05:51.320> near<00:05:51.500> your

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
have your pickaxes right near your

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.810 
have your pickaxes right near your
essence<00:05:51.919> since<00:05:52.010> you<00:05:52.160> will<00:05:52.280> be<00:05:52.400> taking<00:05:52.669> one<00:05:52.700> out

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
essence since you will be taking one out

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.640 
essence since you will be taking one out
every<00:05:53.060> run<00:05:53.210> similar<00:05:53.600> to<00:05:53.810> how<00:05:54.350> you<00:05:54.410> take

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
every run similar to how you take

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.050 
every run similar to how you take
outlaws<00:05:54.950> every<00:05:55.220> run<00:05:55.370> for<00:05:55.550> crafting<00:05:55.880> with<00:05:56.030> a

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
outlaws every run for crafting with a

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.420 
outlaws every run for crafting with a
balloon<00:05:56.300> method<00:05:56.690> so<00:05:57.410> going<00:05:58.160> through<00:05:58.250> the

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
balloon method so going through the

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.250 
balloon method so going through the
abyss<00:05:58.610> is<00:05:58.729> pretty<00:05:58.970> simple<00:05:59.300> I'm<00:05:59.390> sure<00:05:59.570> most<00:06:00.110> of

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
abyss is pretty simple I'm sure most of

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.210 
abyss is pretty simple I'm sure most of
you<00:06:00.380> guys<00:06:00.440> have<00:06:00.620> gone<00:06:00.740> through<00:06:00.800> the<00:06:01.040> abyss

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
you guys have gone through the abyss

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.010 
you guys have gone through the abyss
before<00:06:01.400> when<00:06:02.030> you're<00:06:02.150> inside<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:02.510> abyss<00:06:02.750> it

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
before when you're inside the abyss it

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.420 
before when you're inside the abyss it
doesn't<00:06:03.410> matter<00:06:03.590> whether<00:06:03.830> you<00:06:04.040> get<00:06:04.130> a<00:06:04.160> mining

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
doesn't matter whether you get a mining

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.270 
doesn't matter whether you get a mining
obstacle<00:06:04.850> or<00:06:04.970> not<00:06:05.090> but<00:06:05.300> you<00:06:06.020> you<00:06:07.010> have<00:06:07.250> a

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
obstacle or not but you you have a

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.740 
obstacle or not but you you have a
chance<00:06:07.580> of<00:06:07.669> getting<00:06:07.790> a<00:06:07.940> mining<00:06:08.180> obstacle<00:06:08.510> or<00:06:08.720> a

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
chance of getting a mining obstacle or a

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.600 
chance of getting a mining obstacle or a
agility<00:06:09.680> obstacle<00:06:10.040> as<00:06:10.130> your<00:06:10.220> closest

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
agility obstacle as your closest

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.090 
agility obstacle as your closest
obstacles<00:06:11.090> and<00:06:11.300> once<00:06:12.169> you<00:06:12.290> get<00:06:12.410> through<00:06:12.740> the

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
obstacles and once you get through the

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.530 
obstacles and once you get through the
outer<00:06:13.430> ring<00:06:13.760> you<00:06:13.880> just<00:06:13.910> want<00:06:14.180> to<00:06:14.240> drop<00:06:14.360> your

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
outer ring you just want to drop your

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.969 
outer ring you just want to drop your
pickaxe<00:06:14.690> and<00:06:14.930> then<00:06:15.080> you<00:06:15.169> can<00:06:15.290> exit<00:06:15.950> through

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
pickaxe and then you can exit through

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.950 
pickaxe and then you can exit through
the<00:06:16.160> law<00:06:16.340> rift<00:06:16.580> and<00:06:16.820> you'll<00:06:17.270> be<00:06:17.419> all<00:06:17.570> fine<00:06:17.810> and

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
the law rift and you'll be all fine and

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.409 
the law rift and you'll be all fine and
set<00:06:18.169> to<00:06:18.290> go<00:06:18.440> and<00:06:18.760> they<00:06:19.760> are<00:06:19.940> going<00:06:20.180> to<00:06:20.270> be<00:06:20.390> a

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
set to go and they are going to be a

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:22.150 
set to go and they are going to be a
decent<00:06:21.050> amount<00:06:21.110> faster<00:06:21.560> experience<00:06:21.710> per<00:06:22.070> hour

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
decent amount faster experience per hour

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.000 
decent amount faster experience per hour
which<00:06:22.400> is<00:06:22.520> a<00:06:22.550> nice<00:06:22.930> plus<00:06:23.930> to<00:06:24.169> this<00:06:24.320> method<00:06:24.950> of

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
which is a nice plus to this method of

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.250 
which is a nice plus to this method of
room<00:06:25.160> crafting<00:06:25.550> and<00:06:25.729> you<00:06:26.690> just<00:06:26.900> have<00:06:27.020> to<00:06:27.110> keep

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
room crafting and you just have to keep

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.540 
room crafting and you just have to keep
an<00:06:27.410> eye<00:06:27.470> on<00:06:27.500> your<00:06:27.680> hip<00:06:27.830> points<00:06:28.010> because<00:06:28.430> you

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
an eye on your hip points because you

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.310 
an eye on your hip points because you
can<00:06:28.729> get<00:06:28.910> hit<00:06:29.120> free<00:06:29.390> hard<00:06:29.600> and<00:06:29.780> just<00:06:29.900> depends

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
can get hit free hard and just depends

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.050 
can get hit free hard and just depends
on<00:06:30.380> the<00:06:30.470> run<00:06:30.650> really<00:06:30.950> so<00:06:31.580> you<00:06:31.669> just<00:06:31.850> have<00:06:32.000> to

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
on the run really so you just have to

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.850 
on the run really so you just have to
keep<00:06:32.240> that<00:06:32.360> in<00:06:32.510> mind<00:06:32.720> but<00:06:32.930> crafting<00:06:33.590> laws

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
keep that in mind but crafting laws

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.930 
keep that in mind but crafting laws
through<00:06:34.070> the<00:06:34.130> abyss<00:06:34.340> is<00:06:34.460> definitely<00:06:34.789> a<00:06:34.820> good

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
through the abyss is definitely a good

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.240 
through the abyss is definitely a good
way<00:06:35.060> to<00:06:35.120> go<00:06:35.330> and<00:06:35.570> it<00:06:36.500> will<00:06:36.710> get<00:06:36.919> you<00:06:37.010> a<00:06:37.039> bit

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
way to go and it will get you a bit
