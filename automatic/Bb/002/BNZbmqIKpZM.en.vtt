 The place of practice while being closed a year ago Even if I moved from Miyagi Prefecture Sendai to Aichi Prefecture Nagoya 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:21.650

 Oh well, I 'm Gyousan Yeung state 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.110
 Among the very harsh environment in the sense that links the circumstances of all over the country to say the Japanese archipelago 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:16.220
 It is a strong intention to do the devil world and continue like Suzuki 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.880
 Body likely by really tough for the players because raffia environment disappears 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.440
 Because 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:25.630
 I have to go to various links and I'm missing my home leaf 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.630

 I'm working hard Suzuki player 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:47.830
 Five of the original it may very well force because the triple is the player that has the jump 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.830
 I would like to concentrate on this and have a good performance until the end 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.620
 Ken Honda player and Shizuka Arakawa players 8 players were brought up from childhood 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.780
 Long and under the coach 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.780
 I moved my base to this Nagoya 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.480
 Stomach Torei to type 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.480

 Sequence of Kano step was to Akio give pen towards climax 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.520
 How to use the state is also good 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.750
 I have four slow and slow 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.130

 Akiko Suzuki has moved to this Nagoya 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.390

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.060

 It is the expression of Akiko Suzuki who is pulling up 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:52.099
 It was the first triple rutz jump, and there was growth after entering and getting off 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.099
 I think it was a very good quality triple Lutz 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:00.629
 I came for a while, but I'm stepping out 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.629
 This is subject to limitation 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:17.300
 It is a jump sequence from triple toe loop to double axel 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:23.289
 Tan came hard Tsuyoko half 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.289
