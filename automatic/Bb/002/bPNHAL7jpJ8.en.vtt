00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.430
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.700
 10 but today we are in a new news 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.750
 of xbox one and is that as you can see in 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.850
 the title is a rumor a rumor that I do not 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.980
 what a subscriber said in the 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.410
 comments of a video and well I put myself 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.499
 to investigate and really the news 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.470
 He called a lot of attention from here 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:28.079
 thank you very much this subscriber 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.769
 for telling me this news I was 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.790
 investigating and xbox one could be 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.040
 suffering from problems 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.130
 overheating because I say this 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.950
 because from the neogaf forums that is 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.850
 a forum that you already know is famous for 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.890
 his serious court where there are foreros who 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.650
 they say news of the very last hour and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.320
 many times all are true 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.540
 rumors that there are indicated not so much 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.000
 let's take this as a rumor and what 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.540
 we comment 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.630
 in the last hours a terrible rumor 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.720
 is scared during this forum by this 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.450
 forum and the power of the xbox one gpu 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.140
 it would be reduced to avoid problems 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.970
 with the schramm are already three foreros 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.220
 of said forum that match this 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.619
 information and some with enough 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.220
 renown within the community not of 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.930
 neogaf for information by analysis 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.750
 given by themselves that later they 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.259
 have confirmed for the moment what they claim 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.670
 and ratify the foreros are the 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.190
 following the name of the forums do not 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.920
 I'm going to say because it's not necessary but 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.899
 well they are at the source and it says so by 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.399
 problems with the schramm would lower the 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.979
 watches from gpu to 8 900 gigaflops for 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.410
 games but it is that at the last minute 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.140
 united a new vase that in its day already 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.360
 was one of the first to filter part 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.399
 of willy's specifications and it's 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.220
 considered one of the brakes with more 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.740
 contacts of the moment ensures that they 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.960
 listen to this comment and believe it 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.140
 when he says that his information is of 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.759
 first hand and says well and it's different 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.470
 this is true 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.260
 the explanation as they imply 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.290
 that the schramm is not ready to 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.840
 process less data bus at the same 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.329
 rhythm that calculations are sent to the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.120
 ram network producing a 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:26.220
 overheating of the system will be 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.920
 if we would receive the first 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.260
 years of life of the xbox 360 with the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.299
 famous red lights which was nefarious 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.000
 for the company as well as for the 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.819
 Microsoft user I already said in a 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.620
 official news by microsoft that this 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.019
 it was not going to happen with the new console 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.950
 therefore you have to catch with pincitas 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:49.409
 this rumor and apparently the solution that 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.510
 he had thought microsoft was down the 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.569
 speed of the console to avoid 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.700
 global warming of it which 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.430
 would significantly reduce the power of 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.379
 it is speculated in the forum that 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.200
 they would talk about a minimum of 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.970
 between 100 and 200 megahertz so 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.639
 we will be attentive to this news 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.980
 we will be attentive to the neogaf forums 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.770
 and well you have to take this news as 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.460
 a rumor 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.930
 nothing official and good as always 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.790
 informing in last you already know comment 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.980
 like and favorites to spread this 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.980
 information and see you in the next
