indicates<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.809> running<00:00:58.140> version<00:00:58.699> 1.7<00:00:59.989> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989

max<00:01:01.230> blow<00:01:01.620> feature<00:01:02.030> was<00:01:03.030> first<00:01:03.329> introduced<00:01:03.930> in

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
max blow feature was first introduced in

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.179 
max blow feature was first introduced in
version<00:01:04.519> 1.6<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.020> version<00:01:07.409> 1.6

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
version 1.6 so if you have version 1.6

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.120 
version 1.6 so if you have version 1.6
or<00:01:08.490> version<00:01:08.850> 1.7<00:01:09.450> or<00:01:09.780> something<00:01:10.110> later<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
or version 1.7 or something later it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.249 
or version 1.7 or something later it
will<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.640> feature<00:01:11.880> built<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:15.080> I'm<00:01:16.080> gonna

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
will have the feature built in I'm gonna

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.870 
will have the feature built in I'm gonna
restart<00:01:17.570> first<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:18.840> our<00:01:18.990> version<00:01:19.880> then

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
restart first we get our version then

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840 
restart first we get our version then
after<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.960> done<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:23.070> blower<00:01:23.310> will<00:01:23.580> ramp

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
after this is done the blower will ramp

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.700 
after this is done the blower will ramp
up<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.240> ramp<00:01:24.299> back<00:01:24.720> down<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.170> part<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.500> those

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
up and ramp back down as part of those
