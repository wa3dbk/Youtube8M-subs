brilliant<00:00:10.830> but<00:00:11.130> as<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.309> team<00:00:11.610> team<00:00:12.000> effort<00:00:12.330> I

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
brilliant but as a team team effort I

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.600 
brilliant but as a team team effort I
think<00:00:12.599> we've<00:00:13.380> dug<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.740> it's<00:00:14.160> going<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.309> be<00:00:14.429> hard

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
think we've dug in it's going to be hard

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.490 
think we've dug in it's going to be hard
coming<00:00:14.759> out<00:00:14.969> here<00:00:15.179> abroad<00:00:15.540> no<00:00:16.230> there's<00:00:16.410> only

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
coming out here abroad no there's only

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.349 
coming out here abroad no there's only
one<00:00:16.680> goal<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.100> luckily<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.029> got<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.240> first

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
one goal in it luckily we got the first

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.060 
one goal in it luckily we got the first
goal<00:00:18.539> which<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:18.960> control<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> bit<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.039> us

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
goal which can control it a bit for us

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.790 
goal which can control it a bit for us
but<00:00:20.449> unfortunately<00:00:21.449> hit<00:00:21.630> back<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.109> it's

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
but unfortunately hit back and it's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.870 
but unfortunately hit back and it's
always<00:00:22.890> going<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> nerve<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.490> second<00:00:23.760> half

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
always going to nerve in the second half

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.269 
always going to nerve in the second half
but<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.480> think<00:00:24.930> once<00:00:25.080> we<00:00:25.170> get<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.529> second<00:00:26.189> go

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
but I think once we get that second go

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.640 
but I think once we get that second go
there<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.580> score<00:00:26.760> three<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.689> control<00:00:28.560> it

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
there to score three so you control it

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.500 
there to score three so you control it
from<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.039> top<00:00:29.880> there's<00:00:30.179> any<00:00:30.269> doubt<00:00:30.449> of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
from then on top there's any doubt of

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.420 
from then on top there's any doubt of
the<00:00:30.779> two<00:00:30.990> tizer<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.099> were<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.250> better

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the two tizer that we were the better

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.729 
the two tizer that we were the better
side<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.000> tonight<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.870> show<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.020> control

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
side and tonight just show that control

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.930 
side and tonight just show that control
and<00:00:34.980> possession<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.489> professionalism

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
and possession and professionalism

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.790 
and possession and professionalism
throughout<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.540> team<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.170> own<00:00:37.380> was

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
throughout the team it was own was

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.650 
throughout the team it was own was
really<00:00:38.010> good<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.219> watch<00:00:38.340> yeah<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.390> got<00:00:39.510> taught

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
really good to watch yeah we got taught

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.420 
really good to watch yeah we got taught
a<00:00:39.690> half<00:00:39.840> time<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.320> need<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.590> press<00:00:41.100> her<00:00:41.250> up

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
a half time that we need to press her up

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.549 
a half time that we need to press her up
and<00:00:41.610> keep<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> ball<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.660> show<00:00:43.379> quite

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
and keep the ball and I think show quite

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.750 
and keep the ball and I think show quite
a<00:00:43.590> lot<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> balls<00:00:43.920> from<00:00:44.070> there<00:00:44.280> from<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> team

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
a lot of balls from there from the team

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.330 
a lot of balls from there from the team
to<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.690> when<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> was<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.140> close<00:00:46.410> we

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
to to do that when it was so close we

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.250 
to to do that when it was so close we
should<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.579> quality<00:00:47.879> an<00:00:47.940> end<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.989> took<00:00:49.110> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
should have quality an end you took a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.750 
should have quality an end you took a
took<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.649> few<00:00:49.800> whacks<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.399> kept<00:00:50.550> coming

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
took a few whacks but you kept coming

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.830 
took a few whacks but you kept coming
back<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:50.969> more<00:00:51.120> i<00:00:51.180> think<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.480> corrections

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
back for more i think the corrections

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.299 
back for more i think the corrections
are<00:00:51.930> probably<00:00:52.140> sick<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> sight<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.160> by

are probably sick of the sight of you by

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
are probably sick of the sight of you by
the<00:00:53.340> end<00:00:53.520> when<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.820> stick<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.449> yeah<00:00:55.230> i

think you expect that and as I said
coming<00:00:57.180> over<00:00:57.449> here<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.660> gonna<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.870> tough<00:00:58.050> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
coming over here it's gonna be tough and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.709 
coming over here it's gonna be tough and
the<00:00:59.129> crowd<00:00:59.340> get<00:00:59.550> involved<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.629> just

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the crowd get involved and you just

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.529 
the crowd get involved and you just
gotta<00:01:01.520> play<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.879> player<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.329> game

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
gotta play up to the player to the game

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.170 
gotta play up to the player to the game
and<00:01:03.780> take<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.500> knocks<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:06.090> on

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and take the knocks if if so and get on

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.700 
and take the knocks if if so and get on
with<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> game<00:01:06.360> once<00:01:07.140> you've<00:01:07.260> scored<00:01:07.470> that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
with the game once you've scored that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.440 
with the game once you've scored that
made<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.070> 4-2<00:01:08.340> an<00:01:08.640> aggregate<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:09.330> it

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
made it 4-2 an aggregate I think it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.359 
made it 4-2 an aggregate I think it
really<00:01:09.630> killed<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> time<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.890> last<00:01:11.070> 15

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
really killed the time the last 15

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.050 
really killed the time the last 15
minutes<00:01:11.520> where<00:01:11.700> they<00:01:11.790> were<00:01:11.880> really

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
minutes where they were really

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.820 
minutes where they were really
comfortable<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> end<00:01:12.810> definitely<00:01:13.710> i've

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
comfortable in the end definitely i've

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.859 
comfortable in the end definitely i've
said<00:01:14.130> before<00:01:14.180> when<00:01:15.180> there's<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.450> goal<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
said before when there's one goal in it

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.350 
said before when there's one goal in it
can<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.200> quite<00:01:16.350> nervy<00:01:16.770> no<00:01:17.610> mistake<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.119> allowed

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
can be quite nervy no mistake to allowed

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.539 
can be quite nervy no mistake to allowed
but<00:01:18.689> once<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> second<00:01:20.070> death<00:01:20.280> score

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
but once we get a second death score

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.090 
but once we get a second death score
three<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.090> i<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:22.049> they<00:01:22.140> kind<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.590> gave<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:22.799> it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
three so i think they kind of gave up it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.560 
three so i think they kind of gave up it
which<00:01:23.310> allowed<00:01:23.520> which<00:01:24.090> allows<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.479> control

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
which allowed which allows to control

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.330 
which allowed which allows to control
the<00:01:24.840> game<00:01:24.930> even<00:01:25.229> more<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:26.009> been<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> brilliant

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the game even more it's been a brilliant

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.920 
the game even more it's been a brilliant
campaign<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.970> mean<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.299> out<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.750> group

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
campaign I mean for out the the group

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
campaign I mean for out the the group
stages<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.470> then<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.829> playoffs<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.640> it's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
stages and then the playoffs so it's

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.370 
stages and then the playoffs so it's
real<00:01:29.970> confidence<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.570> take<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:31.259> in

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
real confidence we can take now going in

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.109 
real confidence we can take now going in
towards<00:01:31.680> next<00:01:31.799> summer<00:01:32.040> most<00:01:32.700> definitely<00:01:33.030> I

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
towards next summer most definitely I

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.179 
towards next summer most definitely I
think<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:34.079> showed<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.350> quality<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.009> how<00:01:35.130> we

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
think we showed up quality and how we

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.520 
think we showed up quality and how we
can<00:01:35.280> play<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.909> think<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.990> lot<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> people<00:01:37.380> a

can play and think a lot of people a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.260 
can play and think a lot of people a
perception<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.070> England<00:01:38.729> they<00:01:38.790> work<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.000> the
