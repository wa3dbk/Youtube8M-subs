00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.870 
a GCSE biology syllabus statement 215 B
here<00:00:07.680> we're<00:00:07.890> looking<00:00:08.040> at<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.309> effect<00:00:08.760> of

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
here we're looking at the effect of

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.720 
here we're looking at the effect of
temperature<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:12.380> the<00:00:13.380> rate<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:14.070> movement<00:00:14.340> of

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
temperature on the rate of movement of

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.010 
temperature on the rate of movement of
substances<00:00:15.230> into<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.470> out<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.490> cell<00:00:18.020> it's

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
substances into and out of the cell it's

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.480 
substances into and out of the cell it's
important<00:00:19.650> for<00:00:19.800> us<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.949> remember<00:00:20.279> that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
important for us to remember that

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.810 
important for us to remember that
temperature<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.420> equal<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:23.130> average

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.540 

kinetic<00:00:27.680> energy<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:29.810> the<00:00:30.810> molecules<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.650> we

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
kinetic energy of the molecules that we

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.330 
kinetic energy of the molecules that we
are<00:00:32.640> talking<00:00:33.090> about<00:00:33.739> which<00:00:34.739> may<00:00:34.950> be<00:00:35.010> moving

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
are talking about which may be moving

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.729 
are talking about which may be moving
into<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.030> out<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> cells<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.230> thinking<00:00:37.620> of

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
into and out of the cells so thinking of

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.119 
into and out of the cells so thinking of
the<00:00:37.800> kinetic<00:00:38.460> energy<00:00:39.469> so<00:00:40.469> let's<00:00:40.620> start<00:00:40.950> with

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the kinetic energy so let's start with

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.970 
the kinetic energy so let's start with
the<00:00:41.399> scenario<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.809> cell<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:43.290> 10<00:00:43.620> degrees

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the scenario of a cell at 10 degrees

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.279 
the scenario of a cell at 10 degrees
centigrade<00:00:49.070> cell<00:00:50.070> membrane<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:51.300> nucleus<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
centigrade cell membrane the nucleus and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.729 
centigrade cell membrane the nucleus and
molecule<00:00:53.250> was<00:00:53.370> roundabout<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.739> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
molecule was roundabout and the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.720 
molecule was roundabout and the
temperature<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.550> 10<00:00:57.420> degrees<00:00:57.809> centigrade<00:00:58.730> so

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
temperature is 10 degrees centigrade so

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.590 
temperature is 10 degrees centigrade so
these<00:00:59.879> molecules<00:01:00.949> around<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.219> cell<00:01:02.520> will<00:01:03.390> be

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
these molecules around the cell will be

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.800 
these molecules around the cell will be
moving<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.320> kinetic<00:01:04.890> energy<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:06.600> variety

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
moving with kinetic energy in a variety

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.320 
moving with kinetic energy in a variety
of<00:01:07.170> directions<00:01:07.490> some<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.640> which<00:01:08.880> will<00:01:09.119> take

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
of directions some of which will take

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.660 
of directions some of which will take
them<00:01:09.630> through<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.590> cell<00:01:10.890> membrane

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.770 

like<00:01:15.270> so

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:27.450 

however<00:01:20.780> if<00:01:21.200> we<00:01:21.729> increase<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.390> temperature

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.539 

we<00:01:28.460> also<00:01:28.759> increase<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:31.520> average<00:01:33.549> kinetic

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
we also increase the average kinetic

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.249 
we also increase the average kinetic
energy<00:01:35.210> of<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.509> particles<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.780> that<00:01:38.959> for<00:01:39.140> the

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
energy of the particles so that for the

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.230 
energy of the particles so that for the
same<00:01:39.619> cell<00:01:40.039> with<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:42.380> same<00:01:42.649> molecules<00:01:43.280> these

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
same cell with the same molecules these

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.990 
same cell with the same molecules these
molecules<00:01:44.869> have<00:01:44.959> greater<00:01:45.560> kinetic<00:01:46.039> energy<00:01:49.000> so

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
molecules have greater kinetic energy so

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.440 
molecules have greater kinetic energy so
they'll<00:01:50.209> be<00:01:50.390> moving<00:01:50.689> more<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.299> therefore<00:01:53.299> the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
they'll be moving more and therefore the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.389 
they'll be moving more and therefore the
chance<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:54.049> them<00:01:54.259> passing<00:01:54.709> through<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.069> cell

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
chance of them passing through the cell

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.389 
chance of them passing through the cell
is<00:01:56.060> greater<00:01:56.539> so<00:01:58.689> the<00:01:59.689> increased<00:02:00.140> temperature

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
is greater so the increased temperature

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.850 
is greater so the increased temperature
have<00:02:01.399> increased<00:02:02.000> kinetic<00:02:02.420> energy<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.709> there's

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
have increased kinetic energy so there's

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.029 
have increased kinetic energy so there's
an<00:02:04.009> increase<00:02:04.549> in<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:06.110> molecules<00:02:07.450> going<00:02:09.039> into

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
an increase in the molecules going into

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.120 
an increase in the molecules going into
the<00:02:10.910> cell<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:12.130> effect<00:02:13.130> of<00:02:13.549> temperature<00:02:13.940> on

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
the cell the effect of temperature on

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.620 
the cell the effect of temperature on
substances<00:02:16.130> moving<00:02:16.610> into<00:02:17.060> or<00:02:17.569> out<00:02:18.079> of<00:02:18.319> cells
