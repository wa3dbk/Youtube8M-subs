00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.480
 hi friends metro amateurs today in a special video my friend javier 28 0 6 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.170
 96 and I alstom 314 we will present you the story of a subway train of the 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.269
 Mexico City Nothing more and nothing less than the grandiose FM 86 a feve train or 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.090
 enjoy the video 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.310
 the fm 86 is the first railroad train model this type of trains 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.400
 were launched in Mexico in 1991 built and designed by the 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.330
 builder with carrick 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.510
 in railways the argument is because Canary Islands with 750 vcf 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.760
 similar to trolleybuses by means of a cable 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.080
 juanlu minio supported with insulators and the power socket is by means of 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.640
 a mechanism of so much graph with a skate of friction of coal 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.890
 Forged steel metal wheels perform the same guiding function and 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.290
 transmit tensile stresses 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.240
 Each car is supported by two iron-type trucks each- 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.150
 consists of two axes on the ends of which are fixed two metal wheels 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.250
 they roll on railway-type metal rails 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.719
 the wheels in addition to supporting the load of the vehicle serve for it 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.600
 the trains as well as for their displacement 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.610
 the truck has a system 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.790
 - discs on each axis on both sides of the disc act as fittings 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.790
 braking of the semi-metallic compound type civil 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.960
 the compressed air base 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.660
 feeding of the driving cars is done through the tachograph 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.670
 equipment mounted on the roof of the cars that has movement assist 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.619
 p this theme of which remains 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.100
 in contact during the movement of the trains with the contact wire of the 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.530
 composite catenary is about a power system 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.539
 whose function is to provide electric power to trains in motion 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.380
 It is made up of seven and those subject to pendulums and harnesses that 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.809
 allow their attachment to posts along the line 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:22.870

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.639
 interiors of the year 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.269
 with navy blue seats with white finishes or that 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.529
 curiosities of the day 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:38.119
 there is a scenario 86 behaved type of a bombardier fm 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.119

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.229

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.290
 to continue now we will talk a little about the ancestor of this train about 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.290
 The repercussion 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:56.149
 I had planned 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:58.529
 the construction of 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.119
 it's a lot of difference since the terrain 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:04.119
 thanks for alpha letters replicas 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.539
 like the other lines built at that time 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.280
 note that it is really the first complaint 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.459
 but with the plans 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.639
 final that the pspc had for the construction of hectares lines 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.189
 alphabetic railways 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.029
 instead the b line was decided to make a matica and has another story with the 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:25.239
 mp 68 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.629
 dates from 1988 to 1991 when construction work began on 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:32.649
 the line ap 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:36.319
 they needed a model of railway running gear with the same length 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.489
 of classic railroad track 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.549
 later the first prototype of train fm 86 came out but that 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.450
 prototype has the almost exact figure of a light rail from here or the same subway 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.599
 from Monterrey 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.189
 from there it was based for the construction of around 40 trains 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.889
 so with rail I could build trains freely without needing 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.479
 Nobody's technical assistance or anything 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:05.249
 the Mexican company successfully built from the 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:07.779
 fm 1 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:09.899
 efe m 40 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:14.549
 literally this train has undergone many changes of which pull some 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.900
 examples 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.620
 the windows were replaced by the replacement speakers and 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.550
 vibrators or digital by those of the series 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.590
 and currently trains are possibly being adapted with more wagons 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.599
 that is to say they are killing us to nine wagons because the amendment is 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.439
 causing too many problems 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:37.680
 and six-car trains are not enough 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.810
 it is said that this train has been of higher quality since the passage ported its 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.830
 only line and has had some of the 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.569
 better supports 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.879
 Spain is for sale 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.800
 realities that have to its maintenance has not been done correctly in 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.770
 the last years 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.650
 just think that not even a fence for even review of 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.320
 interiors and calibration of engines in the crash 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.879
 It can be 100% 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.559
 much quality 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:06.879
 is an excellent award isidro the best third the number of amendments 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.069
 good friends is my problem 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.319
 but we have to resolve the serious ones in October as well as the two 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:20.499
 videos in which the bng considers that the government should start and 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:23.900
 to subscribe 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.870
 8 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:31.220
 of the six 96 and to this 314 they presented history of the fm 86
