 blond yoga on television good and now 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.910
 why because blond is honest with 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.489
 risto is sincere with the presenter 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.780
 open a little let's say and let go 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.820
 the feelings a little bit 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.829
 hidden feelings that I had 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.320
 inside and that and that showed us in a 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.199
 video things that I find perfect of 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.079
 made many fans to the majority the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.470
 Most internet almost makes martiana 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.360
 blond for this the truth 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.560
 that people liked a lot about 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.080
 done we have here for example here 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.960
 tweets where almost all the 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.880
 youtubers from animated spanish speaking 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.530
 Well, do blondes and give 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.020
 congratulations there were also criticisms in 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.140
 I thought they are not also a minority 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.640
 but there were criticisms like for example 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.070
 we have for example that as no 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.990
 surplus itself true that says my god 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.780
 after so many genocide wars and 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.690
 suffering see blond and home in full 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.060
 of 2015 is basically unacceptable says 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.800
 ok blond you need spaces to cry 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.420
 and what better to do it on television 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.610
 obviously if you get alone in your house 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.440
 nobody is going to win good 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.200
 advance showing the gas made a video 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.619
 about blond blond called yoga 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.100
 on television with the rejection of rain 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.100
 because, well 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.750
 apparently as he says I think 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.910
 because I reject rain you do not know 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.940
 those of the sun yes since blond was wanted 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.640
 that was with diadems so good not 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.979
 I'm going to tell you a lot because the truth is 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.590
 that's why I interviewed risto reviews 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.909
 on twitter and follow every second or 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.960
 every two seconds coming out in your and 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.060
 different so 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.130
 If I had to comment on everything everything 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.899
 is saying is impossible is still 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.000
 being a bombshell right now and that 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.740
 it was yesterday night so I 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.240
 I recommend that walsh to the Lord for real 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.680
 that you go to the link is of course the 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.240
 description so you can see first the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.430
 video unless you've already seen 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.980
 it's worth second I entered twitter and by the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.569
 hashtag interview remains blond and see 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.190
 everything you are saying because it is that 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.930
 that if I had to pay in each 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.370
 tweet every tweet is a union salsero 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.170
 because everyone has an opinion every 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.239
 one is talking about the subject then 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.800
 I would like to be left in the 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.100
 comments you what is what 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.540
 you think it's worth from my point of view 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.720
 I think he has been very courageous 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.640
 of rubén open up on television when 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.720
 I knew that internet is that everything was going to see 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.830
 the good as in their videos because 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.080
 apart also the public of the 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.390
 television that happens there are many people 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.400
 which says that that is done then for 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.739
 make an audience to get money not 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.019
 I know I do not know how much it is that for the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.330
 people do this not and you can also see 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.980
 pretty honest but good I think that 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.480
 It has been the very good interview 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.670

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.070

 interview that shows that it is 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.310
