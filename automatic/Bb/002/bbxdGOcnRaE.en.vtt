00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
trace those three pets as fast as you

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.990 
trace those three pets as fast as you
can<00:01:13.869> exactly<00:01:14.680> trying<00:01:15.369> to<00:01:15.430> gather<00:01:15.640> as<00:01:15.880> many

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
can exactly trying to gather as many

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.230 
can exactly trying to gather as many
cards<00:01:16.360> as<00:01:16.509> you<00:01:16.659> can<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:17.110> cards<00:01:17.380> come<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.770> you

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
cards as you can the cards come to you

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.380 
cards as you can the cards come to you
and<00:01:19.860> each<00:01:20.860> die<00:01:21.220> roll<00:01:21.520> makes<00:01:21.760> even<00:01:22.060> if<00:01:22.240> you're

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
and each die roll makes even if you're

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.210 
and each die roll makes even if you're
playing<00:01:22.600> with<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.810> same<00:01:23.020> cards<00:01:23.409> each<00:01:23.650> tyrol

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
playing with the same cards each tyrol

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.890 
playing with the same cards each tyrol
makes<00:01:24.430> it<00:01:24.610> vastly<00:01:24.909> different<00:01:25.600> what<00:01:25.720> you're

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
makes it vastly different what you're

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.680 
makes it vastly different what you're
trying<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.350> do<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:26.890> some<00:01:27.580> cards<00:01:28.000> are<00:01:28.210> simpler

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
trying to do so some cards are simpler

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.560 
trying to do so some cards are simpler
in<00:01:28.900> there<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:30.159> what<00:01:30.460> they're<00:01:30.580> doing<00:01:30.640> fewer

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
in there in what they're doing fewer

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.320 
in there in what they're doing fewer
lines<00:01:31.900> some<00:01:32.770> are<00:01:32.950> really<00:01:33.250> more<00:01:33.430> intertwining

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
lines some are really more intertwining

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.050 
lines some are really more intertwining
so<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:35.110> can<00:01:35.260> play<00:01:35.440> with<00:01:35.590> more<00:01:36.400> advanced<00:01:36.790> or

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
so you can play with more advanced or

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.880 
so you can play with more advanced or
less<00:01:37.240> advanced<00:01:37.840> so<00:01:38.350> there's<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.710> fast

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
less advanced so there's the fast

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.680 
less advanced so there's the fast
gateway<00:01:39.430> so<00:01:39.490> that<00:01:39.760> you<00:01:39.820> got<00:01:39.970> sort<00:01:40.180> of<00:01:40.240> advanced

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
gateway so that you got sort of advanced

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.469 
gateway so that you got sort of advanced
or<00:01:40.810> easy<00:01:41.020> cards<00:01:41.530> yes<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.400> can<00:01:42.430> mix<00:01:43.090> them<00:01:43.270> in

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
or easy cards yes you can mix them in

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.160 
or easy cards yes you can mix them in
how<00:01:43.689> you'd<00:01:43.900> like<00:01:44.110> but

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
how you'd like but

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.499 
how you'd like but
who<00:01:46.070> doesn't<00:01:46.400> like<00:01:46.490> monsters<00:01:47.000> who<00:01:47.180> doesn't

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
who doesn't like monsters who doesn't

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.630
