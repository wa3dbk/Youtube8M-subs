rev the engine see if it puffs out a
little<00:00:36.930> more<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.230> sometimes<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.010> doesn't

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
little more but sometimes it doesn't

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:46.160 
little more but sometimes it doesn't
until<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.700> put<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> load<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.210> it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.060 

you<00:00:47.170> can<00:00:47.350> see<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.820> smoke<00:00:48.820> billowing<00:00:49.300> out<00:00:49.480> now

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.770 
you can see the smoke billowing out now
and<00:00:51.070> it's<00:00:51.399> trying<00:00:51.699> to<00:00:51.850> stall<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.829> smoke

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
and it's trying to stall with the smoke

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.149 
and it's trying to stall with the smoke
mainly<00:00:55.780> because<00:00:56.050> it's<00:00:56.440> burning<00:00:56.769> out<00:00:56.890> of<00:00:57.070> the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
mainly because it's burning out of the

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.770 
mainly because it's burning out of the
turbo<00:00:57.519> right<00:00:58.329> now<00:00:58.600> I<00:00:58.930> have<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.649> car<00:00:59.890> floor<00:01:00.219> and
