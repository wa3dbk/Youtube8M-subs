00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
when looking at auxiliary lighting is

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.330 
when looking at auxiliary lighting is
the<00:01:52.869> way<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.289> hook<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.859> lights<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.219> the

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
the way that you hook the lights to the

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.370 
the way that you hook the lights to the
bike<00:01:54.579> now<00:01:55.390> when<00:01:55.539> I<00:01:55.600> say<00:01:55.750> hook<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.109> lights<00:01:56.259> to

bike now when I say hook the lights to
the<00:01:56.469> bike<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:56.829> meaning<00:01:57.159> power<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.880> lights

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
the bike and meaning power the lights

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.169 
the bike and meaning power the lights
for<00:01:59.439> example<00:01:59.799> Kuryakin<00:02:00.429> has<00:02:00.579> this<00:02:00.789> really

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
for example Kuryakin has this really

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.690 
for example Kuryakin has this really
awesome<00:02:01.679> universal<00:02:02.679> wire<00:02:02.890> relay<00:02:03.280> which<00:02:03.490> I

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
awesome universal wire relay which I

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.580 
awesome universal wire relay which I
would<00:02:03.880> recommend<00:02:04.329> anybody<00:02:04.810> putting<00:02:05.409> lights

would recommend anybody putting lights
on<00:02:05.770> their<00:02:05.920> bike<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.899> fused<00:02:08.649> unit<00:02:09.009> with<00:02:09.490> the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
on their bike it's a fused unit with the

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.270 
on their bike it's a fused unit with the
relay<00:02:10.500> positive<00:02:11.500> negative<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.920> battery
