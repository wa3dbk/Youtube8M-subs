00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.720 
with Japanese white missile because it's
so<00:02:43.110> good<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.770> strong<00:02:44.160> but<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:45.510> very<00:02:45.780> delicate

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
so good so strong but it's very delicate

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.970 
so good so strong but it's very delicate
so<00:02:48.140> probably<00:02:49.140> will<00:02:49.320> do<00:02:49.470> something<00:02:49.709> with

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
so probably will do something with

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
so probably will do something with
Japanese<00:02:50.459> missile

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
Japanese missile

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.170 
Japanese missile
there<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.480> no<00:02:51.660> rule<00:02:52.020> by<00:02:52.380> inspiration<00:02:53.180> because

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
there is no rule by inspiration because

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.210 
there is no rule by inspiration because
it's<00:02:54.740> it's<00:02:55.740> a<00:02:55.860> very<00:02:55.890> free<00:02:56.610> thinking<00:02:58.220> sometimes

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
it's it's a very free thinking sometimes

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.790 
it's it's a very free thinking sometimes
coming<00:02:59.519> from<00:02:59.670> nowhere<00:02:59.880> I<00:03:00.410> wanted<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.500> create

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
coming from nowhere I wanted to create

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.180 
coming from nowhere I wanted to create
this<00:03:02.040> business<00:03:02.820> before<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.920> first

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
this business before the first

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.810 
this business before the first
motivation<00:03:06.120> was<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.959> do<00:03:07.620> my<00:03:07.860> work<00:03:08.130> like<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.610> want

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
motivation was to do my work like I want

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:23.059 
motivation was to do my work like I want
