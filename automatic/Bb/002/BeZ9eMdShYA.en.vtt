close<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:06.000> I'm<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.270> slide<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.110> hit

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
close so I'm going to slide up and hit

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.270 
close so I'm going to slide up and hit
my<00:02:07.649> thumb<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.280> f-sharp

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
my thumb on the f-sharp

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.230 
my thumb on the f-sharp
I'm<00:02:10.000> gonna<00:02:10.119> hit<00:02:10.360> my<00:02:10.650> 2<00:02:11.650> or<00:02:11.920> my<00:02:12.100> index<00:02:12.730> finger

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
I'm gonna hit my 2 or my index finger

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.530 
I'm gonna hit my 2 or my index finger
pointer<00:02:13.630> finger<00:02:13.660> on<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.190> leave<00:02:16.000> my<00:02:16.210> 5

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
pointer finger on the a and leave my 5

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.650 
pointer finger on the a and leave my 5
on<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> D<00:02:17.170> or<00:02:17.200> my<00:02:17.500> pinky<00:02:17.890> finger<00:02:17.920> okay<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.330> that

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
on a D or my pinky finger okay so that

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.710 
on a D or my pinky finger okay so that
makes<00:02:19.960> up<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.350> D<00:02:20.590> chord<00:02:20.920> it's<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.910> same<00:02:22.150> as<00:02:22.300> it

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
makes up the D chord it's the same as it

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.430 
makes up the D chord it's the same as it
it's<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:24.270> what<00:02:25.270> we<00:02:25.300> call<00:02:25.540> inverted<00:02:26.200> or<00:02:26.290> in<00:02:26.350> a

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
it's just what we call inverted or in a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.440 
it's just what we call inverted or in a
different<00:02:26.800> position<00:02:26.950> it's<00:02:27.430> it's<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:27.970> minimal

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
different position it's it's the minimal

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.110 
different position it's it's the minimal
movement<00:02:28.930> method<00:02:29.320> so<00:02:29.470> we<00:02:29.560> can<00:02:29.709> go<00:02:29.860> from<00:02:30.130> G<00:02:30.430> for

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
movement method so we can go from G for

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:39.290 
movement method so we can go from G for
x<00:02:34.410> slide<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.590> up<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:35.890> D<00:02:36.190> hit<00:02:36.820> that<00:02:37.060> four<00:02:37.420> times

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
x slide it up to D hit that four times

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.770 
x slide it up to D hit that four times
three<00:02:40.300> four<00:02:41.280> okay<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.760> now<00:02:43.360> we're<00:02:43.630> going<00:02:43.720> to

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
three four okay and now we're going to

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.740 
three four okay and now we're going to
go<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:43.989> C<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.650> our<00:02:45.250> C<00:02:45.550> chord<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:46.150> made<00:02:46.390> up<00:02:46.540> of

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
go to C and our C chord is made up of

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.229 
go to C and our C chord is made up of
the<00:02:46.989> C<00:02:47.440> e<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:48.370> g<00:02:50.010> but<00:02:51.010> we're<00:02:51.220> right<00:02:51.459> here<00:02:51.489> so

the C e and g but we're right here so

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.720 
the C e and g but we're right here so
how<00:02:52.480> are<00:02:52.600> we<00:02:52.720> gonna<00:02:52.840> hit<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.200> or<00:02:53.739> find<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:54.370> C

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
how are we gonna hit that or find that C

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.910 
how are we gonna hit that or find that C
chord<00:02:55.000> well<00:02:55.300> we're<00:02:56.200> gonna<00:02:56.320> have<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.560> slide

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
chord well we're gonna have to slide

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.490 
chord well we're gonna have to slide
back<00:02:57.190> down<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.910> I'm<00:02:58.300> gonna<00:02:58.390> see<00:02:58.660> okay<00:02:58.870> I've

put our three and our five on those two
on<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.430> C<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.880> E<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.420> have<00:03:10.540> GCE<00:03:11.459> using<00:03:12.459> this

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
on the C and E so I have GCE using this

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.229 
on the C and E so I have GCE using this
progressed<00:03:13.030> with<00:03:13.360> using<00:03:13.870> this<00:03:14.049> finger

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
progressed with using this finger

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.030 
progressed with using this finger
formation<00:03:16.239> here<00:03:16.390> so<00:03:16.690> we're<00:03:17.500> gonna<00:03:17.620> come<00:03:17.860> out

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
formation here so we're gonna come out

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.560 
formation here so we're gonna come out
of<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.370> D<00:03:18.640> slide<00:03:19.390> down<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:20.950> C<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.580> we're

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
of the D slide down to the C and we're

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.289 
of the D slide down to the C and we're
going<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.750> hit<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.989> C<00:03:23.230> eight<00:03:23.470> times<00:03:23.950> okay<00:03:24.519> it's

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
going to hit the C eight times okay it's

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.630 
going to hit the C eight times okay it's
just<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.690> popular<00:03:26.110> progression<00:03:26.739> and<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.489> will

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
just a popular progression and that will

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.890 
just a popular progression and that will
make<00:03:27.760> sense<00:03:28.030> later<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:28.510> we're<00:03:28.600> gonna<00:03:28.690> hit<00:03:28.810> the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
make sense later so we're gonna hit the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.460 
make sense later so we're gonna hit the
G<00:03:29.140> four<00:03:29.470> times<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:30.730> d<00:03:31.000> four<00:03:31.330> times<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.170> C

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
G four times the d four times and the C

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.350 
G four times the d four times and the C
eight<00:03:32.709> times<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.489> that's<00:03:33.610> going<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.850> make<00:03:34.090> up

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
eight times and that's going to make up

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.259 
eight times and that's going to make up
our<00:03:34.600> verse<00:03:35.140> okay<00:03:36.070> progression<00:03:36.640> so<00:03:37.030> it's<00:03:37.150> going

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
our verse okay progression so it's going

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.160 
our verse okay progression so it's going
to<00:03:37.360> sound<00:03:37.510> like<00:03:37.630> this<00:03:37.950> one<00:03:38.950> two<00:03:39.610> three<00:03:40.480> four

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
to sound like this one two three four

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.580 
to sound like this one two three four
one<00:03:41.950> two<00:03:42.510> three

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
one two three

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.610 
one two three
two<00:03:45.590> three<00:03:49.540> okay<00:03:50.569> so<00:03:51.080> that's<00:03:51.260> all<00:03:51.410> we're<00:03:51.530> gonna

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
two three okay so that's all we're gonna

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.840 
two three okay so that's all we're gonna
do<00:03:51.830> for<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.069> next<00:03:52.190> couple<00:03:52.520> days
