00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.950
 today we will finally talk about metal 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.480
 the legendary espionage franchise 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.280
 tactical action created by hideo 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.469
 kojima that has gone through more than 10 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.300
 titles 4 generations of consoles and has 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.900
 sold over 33 million copies to 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.900
 world level 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.980
 today we will see the last delivery 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.330
 metal gear solid 5th centuries which is for 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.400
 new generation consoles but 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.470
 warning this is just an advance to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.050
 phantom paint which is a complete game 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 that will be out in a few months and here you 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.760
 I comment if it's worth it then 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.230
 buy or not the story take place in 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.850
 1975 just after the events of the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.320
 game peace walker which is very 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 advisable to have played it for 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.400
 understand what is happening and who they are 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.629
 the characters in austere night has 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.580
 to infiltrate a military camp 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.280
 called middle field to rescue two 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.900
 prisoners of war the map is like 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.820
 a mini city ​​that allows you to explore 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.130
 each of the corners without a path 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.660
 predefined the game is controlled from 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.980
 Similar to metal gear solid 4 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.600
 although some have been made 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.790
 modifications that are welcome to the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.229
 series things like shoot at first 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.060
 person and scenes in slow motion 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.220
 are signs that colima has known 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.660
 adapt to modern times the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.490
 artificial intelligence responds 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.590
 appropriate form to your actions and in the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.020
 difficult way is a real challenge not to be 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.520
 detected at a playable level there are few 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.510
 things to reproach ground zero 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.700
 especially if they are fans of the series 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.070
 as you can see the graphics are impressive 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.530
 Snake has never looked so good in a 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.630
 in a console and now let's see 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.180
 some good towers is always in the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.440
 typical dragged by the floor you go to 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.850
 look for an enemy here 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.500
 because since he has found me with 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.470
 four types and I'm going 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:50.540
 say good night to this 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:53.630
 when also or try to give it double 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.120
 and in cases that try to detect by 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.280
 example I'm going to approach 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.440
 detect there 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.680
 I would say player in charge of a 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.680
 little 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.510
 what we have not seen 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.510
 bye 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.740
 in the case they see me and they detect me what 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.740
 The hole allows you to do is old 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.519
 this is slow motion in which I eat 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.250
 that you have a few seconds to 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.310
 try to prevent the guards from calling 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.170
 to the alarm in this case I'm all 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.150
 behind now gone to action and now 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.810
 and kill everyone and hide until 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.880
 pass the alarm 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.190
 in playstation 4 the experience runs 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.840
 in full hd and at 60 frames per second what 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.270
 which is something unprecedented for a 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.980
 game of this kind by parties there 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.050
 some textures of lower quality than 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.030
 they contrast and some animations seem 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.770
 of the last generation but the fox 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.200
 singing promises enough for future 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.180
 video game 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.010
 the sound and music section is like 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.480
 always the best and the voice of keepers 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.580
 you will see how osney is fine 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.519
 executed even if you miss a bit the 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.290
 classical voice virgin also strange 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.150
 to have the radar to know where they are 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.769
 the enemies and I did not find a single 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.560
 box of oranges to hide 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.569
 below the most worrying point of this 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.519
 its title is short since I 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.769
 it took less than an hour and a half to finish the 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.930
 main mission the ending is somewhat 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.400
 abrupt but links well with the trailer 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.709
 of phantom pain that we have seen in the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.510
 last months then they were unlocked 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.790
 four other missions with interesting 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.340
 variants but they only lasted about 20 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.170
 minutes each for more replayable than 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.069
 look like this title left me wanting 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.069
 more for what you pay 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.940
 there is no doubt that this is a great game 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.110
 the graphics are very well achieved and 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.000
 the number of ways you can 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.530
 facing situations is very entertaining 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.940
 and it's a very good omen of what 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.720
 we can expect every few months 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.720
 when the pain fan 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.580
 the problem is that this is just a 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.930
 prologue and in basically three hours 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.670
 can see everything the game can 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.470
 offer which ends up being more like 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.470
 an extended demo to $ 30 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.280
 that's why I would say that this game only 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.720
 should buy the fans of the series to 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.580
 those with more experience that comes out 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.680
 full game or it was lent a 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.020
 friend because the brevity of grausinos is 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.480
 a bit disappointing I repeat this is a 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.870
 very good game but it does not justify so much 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.870
 the price
