00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.549

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.850
 even antivirus already does this cleaning 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.850
 automatic for you 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.230
 creative of our list is norton

 check your device as fast as possible. 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.500
 check if he has no problem 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.660
 is that he is doing the verification 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:48.860
 for those who show that of the 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:51.140
 nokia is a very good woman who allows 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.080
 that you find some viruses 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:57.200
 all else had some viruses that were 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.570
 detected by the note 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.440
 so it's worth checking the app 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:06.050
 because of this despite the fact that the 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.010
 that found a virus in my 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.290
