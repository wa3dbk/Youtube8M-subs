00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
 Hello everyone, we are cooking fried 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.049
 potatoes with mushrooms 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.220
 pan I already set there really 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.130
 a little water hit 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.730
 intel terrible and first carve 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.650
 with you add which I cut by 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.619
 it turned out to be modern in size 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:25.080
 such thickness manually we can cut on 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.730
 will say temporarily 3 millimeters thickness 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.800
 so so what we lay so 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.290
 I already warmed up the pan add 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.290
 oils now pour our map here and 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.879
 cut mushrooms 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.270
 my case is moved fresh champignons 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.620
 I also need a jar to use 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.620
 first cut answer 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:12.759
 and cut further 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.360
 let the chopped they should get 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:19.350
 such devices 45 millimeters mix 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.350
 our potatoes 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.750
 so the potatoes were prevented but not salted 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.310
 first i'm a little fire coil further 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.530
 we will throw mushrooms and 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.020
 the representatives 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.810
 tajally I don’t remember -7 they’re exactly 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.649
 interfered several times 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:44.850
 so let's do things a little wrong first 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:50.810
 on sony and leg plan this review is good 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.220
 he is not a coil and on top we will throw with you 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.880
 mushrooms so the effect is just that you are not 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.710
 interfered then be born interfere filmed 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.710
 let them soften our mushrooms 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:13.350
 even now it seems like a strange 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:18.989
 we had mushrooms too 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:21.150
 salty skype soup worth a minute 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.709
 one and a half two nights when you need to 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.500
 interfere we will begin misha 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.840
 so I have several times prevented our 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.870
 potatoes, I will add more 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.690
 have time to universal you can them at all 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.420
 mega 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:40.380
 I am very strong included very birds 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:44.040
 there is quite doubtful much for 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.040
 now prevented 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.520
 clog was given will cover sharply 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.730
 but this is a great recipe of mine personally 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.340
 opinion i love potatoes like that 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.680
 not completely dry if you want 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.780
 crispy crust there with all the affairs 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.330
 fry until the last cover 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.400
 the lid does not cover but do not pour it 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.209
 water just frying until she herself 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:25.150
 you will prepare an avid report on him 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:28.130
 on the water a glass of water and sang a gun 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.920
 yourself and your family, only this 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.040
 the potato turns out like a semi fried 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.350
 semi boiled if you will not now 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.540
 write comments there or letters by 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.380
 about the fact that you can not do that 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.840
 nonsense then please do not bother me 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.819
 told you if you want fried crust 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.420
 fry until the end of the cover and not 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.160
 lid do not pour water everything so everything 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.709
 I will be ready to show you what I have 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.200
 it turned out the window we all see what we have 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.459
 happened 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.459
 the water should all evaporate 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.310
 how can I have everything now and be noted 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.110
 serve up 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.110
 that's all for now
