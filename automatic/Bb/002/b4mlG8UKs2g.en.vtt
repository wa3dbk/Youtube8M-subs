that's<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.740> keyboard<00:01:11.369> shortcut<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.330> it

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
that's the keyboard shortcut for but it

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.929 
that's the keyboard shortcut for but it
might<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.600> always<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:14.250> smudge<00:01:14.580> tool<00:01:14.610> it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
might not always be the smudge tool it

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.820 
might not always be the smudge tool it
could<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> sharpen<00:01:15.840> tool<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.560> blur

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
could be the sharpen tool of the blur

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.560 
could be the sharpen tool of the blur
tool<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.759> much<00:01:17.939> tulle<00:01:18.180> looks<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
tool so get this much tulle looks like a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.640 
tool so get this much tulle looks like a
hand<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:21.509> strength<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.229> something

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
hand and the strength is something

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.140 
hand and the strength is something
you'll<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.979> play<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.400> usually<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.939> keep

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you'll have to play with usually I keep

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.859 
you'll have to play with usually I keep
it<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.420> thirty<00:01:24.780> percent<00:01:25.430> any<00:01:26.430> higher<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.630> it

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
it on thirty percent any higher and it

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.520 
it on thirty percent any higher and it
just<00:01:27.900> kind<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:29.009> works<00:01:29.460> too<00:01:29.729> well<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:31.200> at

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
just kind of it works too well so at

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.440 
just kind of it works too well so at
3030<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.250> smooth<00:01:32.460> enough<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.850> gist<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.360> you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
3030 is smooth enough to gist if you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.539 
3030 is smooth enough to gist if you
just<00:01:33.630> drag<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.930> along<00:01:34.140> drag<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.159> along<00:01:35.250> back

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
just drag it along drag it along back

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.859 
just drag it along drag it along back
and<00:01:35.729> forth<00:01:37.159> see<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.250> smooths<00:01:38.640> out<00:01:39.000> whatever

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
and forth see it smooths out whatever

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.620 
and forth see it smooths out whatever
colors<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.409> got<00:01:42.079> so<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.380> helps<00:01:44.630> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
colors you got so that that helps and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.030 
colors you got so that that helps and
it's<00:01:45.869> something<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.500> could<00:01:46.649> use<00:01:46.710> later

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
it's something that you could use later

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.270 
it's something that you could use later
on<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.369> do<00:01:47.460> fer<00:01:47.670> effects<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:49.280> some

closer you do like that it just takes a

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.780 
closer you do like that it just takes a
lot<00:03:03.570> longer<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.560> have<00:03:04.680> more<00:03:04.920> control<00:03:05.070> over<00:03:05.310> in

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
lot longer you have more control over in

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.850 
lot longer you have more control over in
a<00:03:05.880> way<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.780> doesn't<00:03:06.990> always<00:03:07.110> look<00:03:07.320> as<00:03:07.500> good

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
a way but it doesn't always look as good

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
as these look see then you can come back

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:23.340
