00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
just completely invalid so yeah let's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.410 
just completely invalid so yeah let's
just<00:01:07.470> get<00:01:07.590> started<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.700> first<00:01:09.119> thing<00:01:09.299> I

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
wanted to go over is that a lot of

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.859 
wanted to go over is that a lot of
YouTube<00:01:11.490> commentators<00:01:12.000> are<00:01:12.390> making<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
YouTube commentators are making the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.289 
YouTube commentators are making the
claim<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.860> shot<00:01:14.100> one<00:01:14.369> kill<00:01:14.400> would

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
claim that the one shot one kill would

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.510 
claim that the one shot one kill would
make<00:01:15.509> recon<00:01:16.020> too<00:01:16.259> powerful<00:01:16.860> they're<00:01:17.250> gonna<00:01:17.369> be

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
make recon too powerful they're gonna be

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.399 
make recon too powerful they're gonna be
way<00:01:17.729> too<00:01:17.790> good<00:01:18.000> at<00:01:18.299> both<00:01:18.479> long<00:01:18.750> range<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
way too good at both long range and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.800 
way too good at both long range and
close<00:01:19.830> range<00:01:20.130> engagements<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.630> is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
close range engagements and that this is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.289 
close range engagements and that this is
a<00:01:21.840> problem<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> can't<00:01:23.729> want<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.150> over

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
a problem so I can't want to go over

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.730 
a problem so I can't want to go over
some<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.509> these<00:01:24.659> counter-arguments<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.530> why

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
some of these counter-arguments and why

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.170 
some of these counter-arguments and why
I<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:26.189> they're<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.520> silly<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.060> they

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
I think they're kind of silly and they

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.469 
I think they're kind of silly and they
don't<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.540> apply<00:01:27.979> one<00:01:28.979> individual<00:01:29.790> posted

don't really apply one individual posted
a<00:01:30.630> hardcore<00:01:31.079> gameplay<00:01:31.500> where<00:01:31.740> he<00:01:31.920> was<00:01:32.070> using<00:01:32.280> I

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
a hardcore gameplay where he was using I

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.010 
a hardcore gameplay where he was using I
think<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.820> was<00:01:32.909> maybe<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> sv-98<00:01:33.600> one<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
think it was maybe the sv-98 one of the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.020 
think it was maybe the sv-98 one of the
bolt-action<00:01:34.229> rifles<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.070> he<00:01:35.579> was<00:01:35.729> using<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
bolt-action rifles and he was using the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.090 
bolt-action rifles and he was using the
red<00:01:36.210> dot<00:01:36.390> sight<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.900> he<00:01:37.470> was<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.799> close

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
red dot sight and he was in a close

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.370 
red dot sight and he was in a close
quarter<00:01:38.369> engagement

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
quarter engagement

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.870 
quarter engagement
it<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.470> actually<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.890> very<00:01:41.100> impressive<00:01:41.430> kill

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
it was actually a very impressive kill

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.450 
it was actually a very impressive kill
streak<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.720> was<00:01:42.840> only<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.229> 30-second<00:01:44.220> clip

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
streak but it was only a 30-second clip

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
streak but it was only a 30-second clip
and<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:45.119> did<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:45.420> think<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.290> thirty

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and I did not think that this thirty

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.740 
and I did not think that this thirty
seconds<00:01:47.130> was<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> true<00:01:47.729> representation<00:01:48.240> of

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
seconds was a true representation of

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.139 
seconds was a true representation of
what<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.079> Recon<00:01:49.530> class<00:01:49.770> class<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.430> gonna<00:01:50.970> be

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
what the Recon class class is gonna be

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.899 
what the Recon class class is gonna be
like<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.360> every<00:01:51.930> situation<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:53.549> course<00:01:53.759> he

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
like in every situation so of course he

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.340 
like in every situation so of course he
was<00:01:54.000> playing<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.240> hardcore<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.049> body<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
was playing on hardcore so the body it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.429 
was playing on hardcore so the body it
was<00:01:55.439> kind<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.799> pseudo<00:01:57.290> comparison<00:01:58.290> of

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
was kind of like a pseudo comparison of

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.319 
was kind of like a pseudo comparison of
what<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.979> could<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.280> possible<00:01:59.759> if<00:01:59.969> they<00:02:00.119> made

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
what it could be possible if they made

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.179 
what it could be possible if they made
this<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.840> new<00:02:01.020> change<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> Recon<00:02:01.950> class

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
this this new change to the Recon class

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.310 
this this new change to the Recon class
and<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.270> honest<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:03.869> reminded<00:02:04.200> me

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
and to be honest it just reminded me

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.620 
and to be honest it just reminded me
that<00:02:04.350> he<00:02:04.680> was<00:02:04.860> using<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.460> shotgun<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.240> really

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
that he was using a shotgun it really

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.059 
that he was using a shotgun it really
wasn't<00:02:06.810> any<00:02:07.049> difference<00:02:07.409> from<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.680> player<00:02:07.890> who

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
wasn't any difference from a player who

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.410 
wasn't any difference from a player who
was<00:02:08.099> running<00:02:08.399> around<00:02:08.550> with<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.789> shotgun<00:02:09.090> in

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
was running around with a shotgun in

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.240 
was running around with a shotgun in
hardcore<00:02:09.720> mode<00:02:09.780> or<00:02:10.500> even<00:02:10.709> in<00:02:10.830> normal<00:02:11.160> mode

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
hardcore mode or even in normal mode

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.450 
hardcore mode or even in normal mode
because<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.090> can

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
because you can you can

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.490 
because you can you can
one<00:02:12.670> shot<00:02:12.880> one<00:02:13.030> kills<00:02:13.240> with<00:02:13.900> these<00:02:14.080> shotguns

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
one shot one kills with these shotguns

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.860 
one shot one kills with these shotguns
and<00:02:14.800> if<00:02:15.430> he<00:02:15.640> was<00:02:15.760> using<00:02:15.880> buckshot<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.660> flare

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
and if he was using buckshot that flare

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.210 
and if he was using buckshot that flare
would<00:02:17.050> also<00:02:17.230> be<00:02:17.500> able<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.740> go<00:02:17.890> for<00:02:18.070> headshots

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
would also be able to go for headshots

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.430 
would also be able to go for headshots
at<00:02:18.610> longer<00:02:18.850> ranges<00:02:19.330> just<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.260> person

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
at longer ranges just like the person

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.600 
at longer ranges just like the person
with<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.890> sv-98

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
with the sv-98

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.360 
with the sv-98
with<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.150> red<00:02:22.420> dot<00:02:22.570> sight<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.470> really<00:02:24.250> did

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
with the red dot sight so I really did

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.980 
with the red dot sight so I really did
not<00:02:24.490> see<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.880> difference<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:25.480> really<00:02:25.810> just

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
not see the difference it really just

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.470 
not see the difference it really just
reminded<00:02:26.500> me<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.620> if<00:02:27.100> you<00:02:27.280> use<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:28.090> Recon

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
reminded me that if you use the Recon

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.570 
reminded me that if you use the Recon
kit<00:02:28.780> with<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.290> red<00:02:29.530> dot<00:02:29.710> sight<00:02:29.950> or<00:02:30.160> something

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
kit with a red dot sight or something

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.390 
kit with a red dot sight or something
with<00:02:31.210> you<00:02:31.450> know<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.620> scope<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.650> isn't<00:02:33.250> I

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
with you know a scope that isn't I

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.880 
with you know a scope that isn't I
powered<00:02:33.850> it's<00:02:34.300> gonna<00:02:34.510> resemble<00:02:34.840> more<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.530> a

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
powered it's gonna resemble more of a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.230 
powered it's gonna resemble more of a
closed<00:02:36.670> core

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
closed core

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.000

weapon<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:37.870> you're<00:02:38.200> gonna<00:02:38.290> be<00:02:38.500> you're<00:02:38.920> gonna

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
weapon and you're gonna be you're gonna

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.040

do<00:02:39.220> well<00:02:39.400> up<00:02:39.580> close<00:02:39.820> but<00:02:40.300> let's<00:02:40.510> say<00:02:40.690> if<00:02:40.900> you

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
do well up close but let's say if you

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.720 
do well up close but let's say if you
still<00:02:41.320> use<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.650> same<00:02:41.860> setup<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.400> go<00:02:42.490> for

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
still use that same setup and you go for

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.550 
still use that same setup and you go for
long-range<00:02:43.210> shots<00:02:43.540> you're<00:02:43.810> not<00:02:44.020> gonna<00:02:44.230> be<00:02:44.410> as

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
long-range shots you're not gonna be as

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.130 
long-range shots you're not gonna be as
effective<00:02:45.010> as<00:02:45.040> someone<00:02:45.640> who<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.180> using<00:02:46.420> the

using the twelve octave and I'm at

using the twelve octave and I'm at
long-range<00:02:56.740> and<00:02:57.550> someone<00:02:58.030> else<00:02:58.150> is<00:02:58.270> using<00:02:58.480> the

amazing<00:03:27.730> up<00:03:28.090> close<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.720> at<00:03:29.140> long-range<00:03:29.380> is

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
amazing up close and at long-range is

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.660 
amazing up close and at long-range is
kind<00:03:31.360> of<00:03:31.420> iffy<00:03:31.690> with<00:03:32.020> that<00:03:32.260> argument<00:03:32.670> another

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
kind of iffy with that argument another

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.830 
kind of iffy with that argument another
thing<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.180> lot<00:03:34.330> of<00:03:34.360> players<00:03:34.600> are

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
thing is that a lot of players are

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.270 
thing is that a lot of players are
saying<00:03:35.020> that<00:03:35.320> there<00:03:35.440> is<00:03:35.530> going<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.800> be<00:03:35.980> just<00:03:36.160> a

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
saying that there is going to be just a

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.010 
saying that there is going to be just a
lot<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.490> montage<00:03:36.880> people<00:03:37.270> out<00:03:37.390> there<00:03:37.600> there's

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
lot of montage people out there there's

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.840 
lot of montage people out there there's
already<00:03:38.260> a<00:03:38.560> lot<00:03:38.770> of<00:03:38.890> montage<00:03:39.250> people<00:03:39.700> there

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
already a lot of montage people there

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.880 
already a lot of montage people there
everyone<00:03:40.270> it's<00:03:40.450> it's<00:03:40.750> even<00:03:41.020> more<00:03:41.290> incentive

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
everyone it's it's even more incentive

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.760 
everyone it's it's even more incentive
to<00:03:41.920> be<00:03:42.670> a<00:03:42.700> montage<00:03:43.180> idiot<00:03:43.600> if<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:44.350> go<00:03:44.590> for

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
to be a montage idiot if you go for

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.410 
to be a montage idiot if you go for
headshots<00:03:44.950> it's<00:03:45.340> even<00:03:45.550> more<00:03:45.730> impressive<00:03:46.060> up

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
headshots it's even more impressive up

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.150 
headshots it's even more impressive up
close<00:03:46.630> like<00:03:46.870> it's<00:03:47.020> insane<00:03:47.500> if<00:03:47.710> you<00:03:47.830> just<00:03:48.010> get

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
close like it's insane if you just get

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.650 
close like it's insane if you just get
headshot<00:03:48.520> after<00:03:48.730> headshot<00:03:49.090> after<00:03:49.300> headshot

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
headshot after headshot after headshot

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.630 
headshot after headshot after headshot
it's<00:03:50.080> a<00:03:50.230> lot<00:03:50.470> more<00:03:50.680> impressive<00:03:51.070> than<00:03:51.370> just

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
it's a lot more impressive than just

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.220 
it's a lot more impressive than just
getting<00:03:51.790> kills<00:03:52.120> at<00:03:52.330> body<00:03:52.570> shot<00:03:52.780> at<00:03:52.930> least<00:03:53.080> in

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
getting kills at body shot at least in

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.410 
getting kills at body shot at least in
my<00:03:53.350> opinion<00:03:53.740> so<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.520> incentive<00:03:55.000> maybe<00:03:55.240> there

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
my opinion so the incentive maybe there

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.300 
my opinion so the incentive maybe there
will<00:03:55.570> be<00:03:55.630> a<00:03:55.810> couple<00:03:56.050> more<00:03:56.380> but<00:03:56.740> I<00:03:56.920> don't<00:03:56.980> think

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
will be a couple more but I don't think

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.130 
will be a couple more but I don't think
it's<00:03:57.460> gonna<00:03:57.580> be<00:03:57.730> just<00:03:57.760> an<00:03:58.030> overwhelming<00:03:58.420> swell

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
it's gonna be just an overwhelming swell

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.050 
it's gonna be just an overwhelming swell
of<00:03:59.440> players<00:03:59.830> who<00:04:00.130> are<00:04:00.220> playing<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.490> recon<00:04:00.850> kit

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
of players who are playing the recon kit

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.210 
of players who are playing the recon kit
just<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.540> get<00:04:01.690> montage<00:04:02.140> clips<00:04:02.380> I<00:04:02.710> think<00:04:03.100> that

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
just to get montage clips I think that

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.770 
just to get montage clips I think that
argument<00:04:03.670> is<00:04:03.760> silly<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.270> it's<00:04:04.360> really<00:04:04.630> not

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
argument is silly and it's really not

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.380 
argument is silly and it's really not
going<00:04:05.020> to<00:04:05.140> apply<00:04:05.700> so<00:04:06.700> in<00:04:06.820> my<00:04:06.940> opinion<00:04:07.060> I<00:04:07.360> think

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
going to apply so in my opinion I think

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.940 
going to apply so in my opinion I think
these<00:04:07.720> changes<00:04:08.080> are<00:04:08.170> fine<00:04:08.380> I<00:04:08.590> don't<00:04:08.680> think

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
these changes are fine I don't think

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.290 
these changes are fine I don't think
they're<00:04:09.070> going<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.280> ruin<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.610> game<00:04:09.820> or<00:04:10.060> the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
they're going to ruin the game or the

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.110 
they're going to ruin the game or the
class<00:04:10.660> in<00:04:10.900> any<00:04:11.140> form<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.830> I<00:04:12.520> just<00:04:12.820> think<00:04:12.940> it's

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
class in any form and I just think it's

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.670 
class in any form and I just think it's
gonna<00:04:13.300> add<00:04:13.450> another<00:04:13.630> layer<00:04:13.960> to<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.230> game<00:04:14.440> if

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
gonna add another layer to the game if

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.860 
gonna add another layer to the game if
I'm<00:04:15.190> using<00:04:15.370> 12<00:04:15.700> up<00:04:15.820> exhume<00:04:16.180> someone<00:04:16.510> rounds<00:04:16.750> a

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
I'm using 12 up exhume someone rounds a

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.270 
I'm using 12 up exhume someone rounds a
corner<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:17.320> don't<00:04:17.380> have<00:04:17.650> my<00:04:17.799> pistol<00:04:18.160> out

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.280 
corner and I don't have my pistol out
I'm<00:04:18.460> not<00:04:18.730> gonna<00:04:18.940> be<00:04:19.150> sad<00:04:19.420> if<00:04:19.690> I<00:04:19.930> get<00:04:20.080> a<00:04:20.109> quick

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
I'm not gonna be sad if I get a quick

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.470 
I'm not gonna be sad if I get a quick
scope<00:04:20.530> off<00:04:20.710> on<00:04:20.919> him<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.910> hit<00:04:22.030> him<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.210> chest

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
scope off on him and I hit him the chest

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.570 
scope off on him and I hit him the chest
and<00:04:22.660> he<00:04:22.960> dies<00:04:23.260> I'm<00:04:23.530> not<00:04:23.710> gonna<00:04:23.830> be<00:04:23.980> sad<00:04:24.220> by<00:04:24.370> that

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
and he dies I'm not gonna be sad by that

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.220 
and he dies I'm not gonna be sad by that
I<00:04:24.610> think<00:04:24.970> it's<00:04:25.090> fine<00:04:25.330> it's<00:04:25.600> gonna<00:04:25.720> take<00:04:25.930> skill

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
I think it's fine it's gonna take skill

it's<00:04:41.440> only<00:04:41.560> gonna<00:04:41.710> be<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.920> really<00:04:42.460> skilled

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
it's only gonna be the really skilled

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.770

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.300 
players they're gonna be able to pull it
off<00:04:43.870> so<00:04:44.230> I<00:04:44.440> don't<00:04:44.680> think<00:04:44.950> it's<00:04:45.070> gonna<00:04:45.160> be<00:04:45.280> a

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
off so I don't think it's gonna be a

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.530 
off so I don't think it's gonna be a
problem<00:04:45.490> I<00:04:45.700> think<00:04:45.730> it's<00:04:45.940> gonna<00:04:46.030> be<00:04:46.180> a<00:04:46.210> welcome

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
problem I think it's gonna be a welcome

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.660 
problem I think it's gonna be a welcome
change<00:04:46.800> but<00:04:47.800> if<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:47.950> could<00:04:48.070> actually<00:04:48.280> change

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
change but if I could actually change

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.460 
change but if I could actually change
one<00:04:49.000> thing<00:04:49.240> about<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.660> Recon<00:04:49.990> class<00:04:50.230> it<00:04:50.410> would

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
one thing about the Recon class it would

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.850 
one thing about the Recon class it would
actually<00:04:50.830> be<00:04:51.010> to<00:04:51.040> give<00:04:51.730> them<00:04:52.090> c4<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:53.080> think<00:04:53.650> that

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
actually be to give them c4 I think that

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.560 
actually be to give them c4 I think that
the<00:04:53.950> Recon<00:04:54.280> class<00:04:54.490> is<00:04:54.670> a<00:04:54.700> little<00:04:54.940> weak<00:04:55.120> against

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
the Recon class is a little weak against

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.540 
the Recon class is a little weak against
vehicles<00:04:55.750> they<00:04:56.080> do<00:04:56.170> have<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:56.620> flam<00:04:56.890> but<00:04:57.520> I

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
vehicles they do have the so flam but I

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.400 
vehicles they do have the so flam but I
don't<00:04:57.970> like<00:04:58.090> how<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.420> requires<00:04:58.810> your

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
don't like how it requires your

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.810 
don't like how it requires your
teammates<00:04:59.860> to<00:05:00.070> take<00:05:00.220> it<00:05:00.310> out<00:05:00.430> and<00:05:00.610> if<00:05:00.700> you're

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
teammates to take it out and if you're

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.470 
teammates to take it out and if you're
by<00:05:01.000> yourself

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
by yourself

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.240 
by yourself
and<00:05:01.600> you<00:05:01.990> have<00:05:02.110> no<00:05:02.260> one<00:05:02.410> on<00:05:02.620> your<00:05:02.680> team<00:05:02.800> using

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
and you have no one on your team using

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.100 
and you have no one on your team using
the<00:05:03.400> javelin<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:04.210> just<00:05:04.570> it's<00:05:04.870> really

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
the javelin it just it's really

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.380 
the javelin it just it's really
frustrating<00:05:05.350> when<00:05:05.710> you<00:05:06.280> have<00:05:06.550> no<00:05:06.850> way<00:05:07.150> of
