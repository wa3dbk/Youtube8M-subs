 we are going to start control panel 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.920

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.799

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.300
 once I fall we select the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.210
 amount that our album will have 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.090
 local in my case I have a hard drive 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.370
 of 500 GB and if I want my local disk 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.650
 I mean, gigabytes, I'll have to put 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.530

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.070
 we wait 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.700
 when our partition appears that 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.070
 is the one that will make our local disk 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.700
 we give you right click and in new volume 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.700
 simple 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.360
 next next 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.490
 and here we assign the law and we click 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.490
 in following 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.069
 in this part we will select the one 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.140
 he says format this volume with the 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.150
 following configuration 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.700
 in volume label this is the name 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.280
 that we will put to the partition I will 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.740
 I'll put local disk since that 's what 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.340
 videos about 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.340

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.340
 Following 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.569
 we wait for him to load 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.610
 and as we see we already have our disk 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.440
 local configured and that's it 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.230
 and finally we go to teams 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.810
 and as we see we already have our disk 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.810
 local configured and that's it
