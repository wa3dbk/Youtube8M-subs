00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009

 make video gameplay you are 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.870
 Seeing that I'm here with a game of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.759
 background the witcher 3 this video goes 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.320
 be a little faster will make for just 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.849
 take some doubts out of here 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.490
 players just as I was half 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.250
 lost in the game when they arrived here in 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.189
 candle in we are here on gel in 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.640
 making a mission to the subjects of 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.019
 family and there comes a point of the mission 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.689
 you 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.010
 after doing all the others but 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.899
 other small steps of the mission to you 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.350
 arrive here at the point you have to 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.140
 investigate the remaining lanes and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.450
 find the baron's wife and then you 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.239
 literally hangs because it has no 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.520
 where does not appear on the map 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.610
 Now what do you have to do? 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.449
 look, then my 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.180
 and the tip no more what has happened is that I 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.300
 I managed to find on the internet that you 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.570
 Have you started here at the mission? 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.150
 forest ladies I say suggested 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.790
 that I know you get this mission 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:18.320
 her what you help a friend who is the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.990
 want will no longer appear in the book of 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.479
 layoffs because there have been 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.409
 things and then she will disappear from the book 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.130
 emissions 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.960
 I will not expose there so she took over 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.060
 Then I'll show you who the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.939
 want to attack character list 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.500
 here is the one you want meters 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.960
 then this witch you will find the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.820
 why the Baron arrives and talks to the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.079
 team says that someone has to 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.520
 peasants are talking about a witch and 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.079
 You'll have to go after her. 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.329
 anyway you will come across 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.159
 with this witch sometime then 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:03.829
 You have to help her and after that she 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.090
 will give you this mission that is the mission 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.039
 forest shadow 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.959
 soon after this you will have to read 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.710
 about the ladies of the forest that is a 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.640
 book that stays aquino 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.980
 in the inventory in the part of dismissal items 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.380
 I did not realize it took forever to 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.510
 find out what they had and if these 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.910
 mission here, I actually knew it but I 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.380
 never stopped to look right 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.510
 So this is a game that you have to 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.450
 always be reading everything that is 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.220
 happening then it comes and it will give you the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.240
 forest 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.700
 There you go, read it and it goes. 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.740
 unlock the rest of the mission so that 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.950
 I understood and from what I heard people 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.620
 will not make any progress in this 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.850
 Mission, I'm just going to be able to unlock here. 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.380

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.660
 to find the baron's wife after 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.370
 I finish this mission here, what are the 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.440

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.070

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.930
