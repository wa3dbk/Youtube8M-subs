00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.830 
monday night game including hitting her
only<00:00:49.980> wise<00:00:50.340> guy<00:00:50.670> play<00:00:50.910> which<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:51.210> actually<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
only wise guy play which was actually a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.990 
only wise guy play which was actually a
play<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.590> think<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.219> gave<00:00:53.370> here<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
play that I think we gave here if I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.639 
play that I think we gave here if I
remember<00:00:54.449> Oakland<00:00:54.899> they<00:00:55.110> almost<00:00:55.320> won

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
remember Oakland they almost won

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.340 
remember Oakland they almost won
outright<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.280> covered<00:00:56.579> easily<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.660> you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
outright but they covered easily so you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.380 
outright but they covered easily so you
know<00:00:58.469> some<00:00:58.920> mixed<00:00:59.219> results<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> NFL

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
know some mixed results but in the NFL

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.270 
know some mixed results but in the NFL
looks<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:00.780> another<00:01:01.170> winning<00:01:01.620> week<00:01:01.739> well<00:01:02.039> one

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
week the analysis is somewhat similar in

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.670

between he and Ryan but it seems like

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.670 
between he and Ryan but it seems like
he's<00:03:26.060> going<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.329> be<00:03:26.450> angry<00:03:26.959> at<00:03:27.049> whoever<00:03:27.320> is<00:03:27.530> the

Belichick those people who love Him will
tell<00:04:19.010> you<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:19.280> not<00:04:19.459> so<00:04:19.700> much<00:04:19.760> that<00:04:19.910> he's

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
tell you it's not so much that he's

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.120 
tell you it's not so much that he's
great<00:04:20.599> a<00:04:20.630> preparing<00:04:21.169> of<00:04:21.289> course<00:04:21.500> not<00:04:21.769> say<00:04:22.010> that

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
great a preparing of course not say that

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.830 
great a preparing of course not say that
he's<00:04:22.520> not<00:04:22.729> but<00:04:23.030> he<00:04:23.060> makes<00:04:23.660> in

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
he's not but he makes in

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.990 
he's not but he makes in
game<00:04:25.020> adjustment<00:04:25.949> so<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.370> short<00:04:26.699> week

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
game adjustment so the short week

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.720 
game adjustment so the short week
benefits<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.139> superior<00:04:28.680> coach<00:04:28.919> not<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.460> long

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
benefits the superior coach not the long

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.730 
benefits the superior coach not the long
rest<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.240> think<00:04:30.389> that<00:04:30.660> yeah<00:04:31.199> New<00:04:31.350> England

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
rest so I think that yeah New England

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.800 
rest so I think that yeah New England
with<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.460> better<00:04:32.669> coach<00:04:32.970> will<00:04:33.419> certainly

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
with the better coach will certainly

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.750 
with the better coach will certainly
benefit<00:04:34.410> much<00:04:34.680> more<00:04:34.979> from<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.310> short<00:04:35.520> rest

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
benefit much more from the short rest

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.520 
benefit much more from the short rest
where<00:04:35.940> I<00:04:35.970> think<00:04:36.240> really<00:04:36.540> if<00:04:36.750> it's<00:04:36.930> an<00:04:37.050> inferior

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
where I think really if it's an inferior

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.200 
where I think really if it's an inferior
coat<00:04:37.770> sometimes<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.340> long<00:04:38.520> rest<00:04:38.760> can<00:04:38.970> give<00:04:39.090> an

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
coat sometimes a long rest can give an

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.360 
coat sometimes a long rest can give an
inferior<00:04:39.660> coach<00:04:39.870> a<00:04:40.020> chance<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:40.470> mix<00:04:41.100> in<00:04:41.340> some

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
inferior coach a chance to mix in some

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.180 
inferior coach a chance to mix in some
wrinkles<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.210> what-have-you<00:04:43.139> so<00:04:43.380> now<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.800> I

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
wrinkles and what-have-you so now I I

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.920 
wrinkles and what-have-you so now I I
think<00:04:44.729> the<00:04:44.910> Patriots<00:04:45.300> are<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.600> big<00:04:45.720> play<00:04:45.900> here

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
think the Patriots are the big play here

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.300 
think the Patriots are the big play here
and<00:04:46.199> again<00:04:46.410> this<00:04:46.560> is<00:04:46.710> somebody<00:04:47.010> who<00:04:47.040> doesn't

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
and again this is somebody who doesn't

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.610 
and again this is somebody who doesn't
normally<00:04:47.669> like<00:04:48.090> my<00:04:48.389> big<00:04:49.020> number<00:04:49.350> but<00:04:49.380> when

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
normally like my big number but when

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.600 
normally like my big number but when
