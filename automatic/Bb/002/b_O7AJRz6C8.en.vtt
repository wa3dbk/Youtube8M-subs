it's beyond just a product working well

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.080 
it's beyond just a product working well
it's<00:00:16.170> about<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.560> product<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.250> evokes<00:00:17.940> an

it's about a product that evokes an

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.870 
it's about a product that evokes an

emotional response blue sky really
started<00:00:21.210> as<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> small<00:00:22.519> grouping<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.640> products

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
started as a small grouping of products

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.950 
started as a small grouping of products
and<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:25.109> I've<00:00:25.800> traveled<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.820> become<00:00:27.180> aware<00:00:27.539> of

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
and as I've traveled you become aware of

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.279 
and as I've traveled you become aware of
different<00:00:28.920> designs<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.970> designers<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.929> you

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
different designs and designers and you

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.590 
different designs and designers and you
develop<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.800> much<00:00:32.130> broader<00:00:32.940> much<00:00:33.360> more

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
develop this much broader much more

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.360 
develop this much broader much more
global<00:00:33.930> perspective<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.070> realize

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
global perspective and you realize

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.639 
global perspective and you realize
pretty<00:00:35.550> quickly<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.989> world<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.469> getting

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
pretty quickly that the world is getting

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.580 
pretty quickly that the world is getting
smaller<00:00:41.750> something<00:00:42.750> that's<00:00:42.870> really<00:00:43.170> relevant

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
smaller something that's really relevant

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.490 
smaller something that's really relevant
now<00:00:44.210> where<00:00:45.210> you're<00:00:45.510> seeing<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.960> transition

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
now where you're seeing this transition

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.240 
now where you're seeing this transition
from<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.610> heavily<00:00:48.059> task<00:00:48.510> intensive<00:00:49.289> work

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
from really heavily task intensive work

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.810 
from really heavily task intensive work
process<00:00:51.239> work<00:00:51.710> that<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:52.860> largely<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
process work that was largely the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.959 
process work that was largely the
product<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.510> individual<00:00:55.260> effort<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.460> more

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
product of individual effort to more

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.069 
product of individual effort to more
collaborative<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:58.760> engaging<00:00:59.809> teamwork<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
collaborative more engaging teamwork and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.240 
collaborative more engaging teamwork and
so<00:01:01.739> these<00:01:02.340> third<00:01:02.760> spaces<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.510> these

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
so these third spaces are these

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.700 
so these third spaces are these

these common areas or EOC more

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.040 
these common areas or EOC more
residential<00:01:07.250> style<00:01:07.730> furniture<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.570> tables
