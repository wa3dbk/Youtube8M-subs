 zac in this very violent game 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.270
 I found that being arrested everyone expensive not 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.119
 this is it for you 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.180

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.970
 problem in digital games in games 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.859
 multiplayer online games and such that you 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.720
 is suddenly throwing someone your team 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.759
 Quitting this creates a terrible problem. 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.980
 because of your team getting weaker 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.320
 must have competed the way it goes it went 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.820
 assaulted to leave the south is also a 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.820
 even more extensive for example the people 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.579
 Jeff plays and country by a1 game extension 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.190
 fasting half hour 40 minutes one hour 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.980
 two hours of that staff was bad but 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.180
 if someone leaves face that unbalances 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.300
 much now the xbox joker swift the year 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.609
 he made a very nice scheme of a 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.270
 fasting system that is this face for example 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.250
 if you speak 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.530
 playing with a component I was 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.260
 suddenly losing public I played for 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.600
 to lose water down the ranking he goes to 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.070
 money where you go to jail for a 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.229
 chain within the game 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.350
 This is the end of the 4 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.990
 hours and this guy can only fight with 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.830
 players also trapped in these 24 hours 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.600
 if by chance the guy is recidivist he 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.630
 turn off the game again in there 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.329
 of the chain within the game a fight in the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.250
