00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.889 
wasn't hitting you and one point 0 for
you<00:02:02.670> couldn't<00:02:02.939> dodge<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.509> still<00:02:03.659> hit<00:02:03.810> you

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
you couldn't dodge in and still hit you

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.480 
you couldn't dodge in and still hit you
but<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.380> weren't<00:02:04.590> doing<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:05.070> much<00:02:05.219> damage<00:02:05.280> then

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
but we weren't doing as much damage then

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.479 
but we weren't doing as much damage then
and<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:08.140> had<00:02:08.289> more<00:02:08.470> defense<00:02:08.950> stuff<00:02:09.340> like<00:02:09.459> that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
and we had more defense stuff like that

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.699 
and we had more defense stuff like that
because<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:10.000> most<00:02:10.209> of<00:02:10.390> power<00:02:10.569> you<00:02:11.230> know<00:02:11.380> all

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
because the most of power you know all

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.610 
because the most of power you know all
this<00:02:11.920> stuff<00:02:12.040> anyways<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.870> can't<00:02:14.140> dodge<00:02:14.380> it

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
this stuff anyways you can't dodge it

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.440 
this stuff anyways you can't dodge it
anymore<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.310> now<00:02:15.550> you're<00:02:15.730> consoling<00:02:16.150> getting

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
anymore so now you're consoling getting

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.570 
anymore so now you're consoling getting
divided<00:02:16.750> reflects<00:02:17.080> damage<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.770> we<00:02:18.250> have<00:02:18.370> less

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
divided reflects damage and we have less

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.790 
divided reflects damage and we have less
events<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.300> doing<00:02:19.690> more<00:02:20.020> damage<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.620> just

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
events and doing more damage and it just

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.440 
events and doing more damage and it just
hurts<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.220> as<00:02:21.520> you<00:02:21.640> can<00:02:21.760> see<00:02:21.940> right<00:02:21.970> there<00:02:22.270> I

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
hurts so as you can see right there I

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
guys what I just thought that was

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.530 
guys what I just thought that was
interesting<00:02:29.590> there<00:02:30.519> was<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> bug<00:02:31.000> where<00:02:31.209> we<00:02:31.360> can

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
interesting there was a bug where we can

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.920 
interesting there was a bug where we can
dodge<00:02:31.750> reflect<00:02:32.470> damage<00:02:32.800> now<00:02:33.700> there<00:02:33.940> isn't<00:02:34.120> so

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
dodge reflect damage now there isn't so

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.170 
dodge reflect damage now there isn't so
that's<00:02:35.560> been<00:02:35.830> fixed<00:02:36.099> and<00:02:36.459> they're<00:02:36.760> also<00:02:36.880> think

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
that's been fixed and they're also think

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.030 
that's been fixed and they're also think
about<00:02:37.239> reworking<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.319> reflects<00:02:38.650> damage

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
about reworking the reflects damage

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.009 
about reworking the reflects damage
little<00:02:39.370> bit<00:02:39.459> too<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:39.970> some<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.690> things<00:02:40.870> are

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
little bit too so some of the things are

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.590 
little bit too so some of the things are
thinking<00:02:41.319> about<00:02:41.410> our<00:02:41.769> like<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.360> short<00:02:43.360> time

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
thinking about our like a short time

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.000 
thinking about our like a short time
window<00:02:43.989> where<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.260> hurts<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.769> then<00:02:44.890> it
