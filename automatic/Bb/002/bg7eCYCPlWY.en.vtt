00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
also when you're typing I remember that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.580 
also when you're typing I remember that
your<00:01:07.890> wrists<00:01:08.220> are<00:01:08.220> very<00:01:08.880> sensitive<00:01:09.590> ligaments

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
forearm so you form a straight line and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.340 
forearm so you form a straight line and
you're<00:01:19.439> not<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:20.250> down<00:01:21.210> or<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:21.990> side

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
when you're typing because that can

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.810 
when you're typing because that can
