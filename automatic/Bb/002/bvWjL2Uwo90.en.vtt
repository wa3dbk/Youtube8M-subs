 It's not the first Gangjeong event, but it's very exciting and exciting. 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.690
 In the future to the pulpit this year will also be constantly uploaded there because of the slow ramp 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.100
 I'll do it. 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.240
 If you look behind that Sophie course of construction wood ax grass ditch block or so 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.969
 I did. 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:38.010
 I think it would be a bit flat and hard when I was doing architectural courses in general flat ground. 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:43.230
 I built a studio studio like this. Yeah. 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:48.570

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:53.130
 Let's do the photon 4 Thank you in advance. 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.950
 It's a command you already know, but there's nothing wrong with seeing it again. 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:01.180
 Like the introduction video of Shinhwa Part 2 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:05.530
 I hope it will not be history 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.570

 I 'm tied up. 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.950
 When you use dd every month, you do not need a wooden ax. 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.720
 You can hold it. 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.790
 If you look at the external material, you can see red sting glass and blue stems 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.970
 You 've seen the class. 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.380
 To help you talk easily when you are a little hot 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.160

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:50.970
 If you click on it, it will be a second position set. 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.970
 You can not see it , but it's nice that the pawl was held in a square. 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.130
 Now this'll go a pebble into the room status to other blocks 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:08.090
 I'll change it to processed wood number five. 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:16.129

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.640
 So catch this flow 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.620
 Now, when you boil the wall, put your eye on the glass. 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.770
 I will not be. 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:44.660
 But now the way to fill the position so have a lot of down time 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:50.660
 It's a take. 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:53.540
 Tea is also yes would get going to be so much 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.350
 If you use a lot of suckers 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.260

 I'm reading color, but I have a short stamina. 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:14.190
 It's something I can operate in this way. 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.700

 You can operate this way 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:35.960
 You can do it this way. Oh, and to you. 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:41.240

 It's very similar to the 2 3 0 2 command. 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:01.820
 It's the same. 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:06.080
 What do you think about the console ? 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:09.160
 The more you wrote with the waist command, the easier it is not to block 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.160
 I can not be like this . 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.310
