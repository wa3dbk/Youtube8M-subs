00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
cornmeal hemi this potted plant a lot of

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.330 
cornmeal hemi this potted plant a lot of
people<00:00:43.260> don't<00:00:43.350> know<00:00:43.560> what<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.800> do<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.250> the

people don't know what to do with the
plants<00:00:44.700> themselves<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.930> exactly

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
plants themselves so this is exactly

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.110 
plants themselves so this is exactly
what<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.710> need<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.129> when<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:47.850> arrive

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
with you first of all take the tag out

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.119 
with you first of all take the tag out
you<00:00:50.790> don't<00:00:51.000> need<00:00:51.150> that<00:00:51.500> second<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.530> all<00:00:52.680> you

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
you don't need that second of all you

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.130 
you don't need that second of all you
then<00:00:53.309> need<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.550> remove<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.270> plant<00:00:54.510> from<00:00:55.080> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
then need to remove the plant from the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.010 
then need to remove the plant from the
pot<00:00:55.290> itself<00:00:55.830> now<00:00:56.629> sometimes<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.809> quite

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
pot itself now sometimes it's quite

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.439 
pot itself now sometimes it's quite
tricky<00:00:58.290> so<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.340> pinch<00:00:59.640> at<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.910> top<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
tricky so you just pinch at the top and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.710 
tricky so you just pinch at the top and
then<00:01:01.110> pull<00:01:01.380> away<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.940> pot<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.390> no<00:01:03.540> longer

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
then pull away the pot you no longer

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.190 
then pull away the pot you no longer
need<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.250> chuck<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.759> bit

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
need you can chuck that in a bit

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.590 
need you can chuck that in a bit
now<00:01:07.200> you've<00:01:07.410> got<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> rock<00:01:07.950> core<00:01:08.540> now<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
now you've got the rock core now the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.749 
now you've got the rock core now the
rock<00:01:09.990> wall<00:01:10.259> just<00:01:10.470> needs<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:11.009> removed<00:01:11.399> from

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
rock wall just needs to be removed from

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:12.440 
rock wall just needs to be removed from
the<00:01:11.940> plant

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the plant

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.810 
the plant
it's<00:01:12.780> normally<00:01:13.560> fairly<00:01:13.800> simple<00:01:14.280> depending<00:01:14.729> on

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
it's normally fairly simple depending on

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.510 
it's normally fairly simple depending on
how<00:01:15.030> much<00:01:15.240> root<00:01:15.990> structure<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:17.280> plant

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
how much root structure the plant

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.820 
how much root structure the plant
actually<00:01:17.759> has<00:01:18.149> in<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.479> case<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:19.080> got<00:01:19.410> some

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
actually has in this case it's got some

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.730 
actually has in this case it's got some
not<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> lot<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.450> certainly<00:01:21.990> some<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.440> make<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
not a lot but certainly some to make it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.090 
not a lot but certainly some to make it
stick<00:01:23.009> together<00:01:23.160> so<00:01:23.910> we<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.210> split<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.920> rock

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
stick together so we just split the rock

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.840 
stick together so we just split the rock
wall<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.610> half<00:01:27.680> get<00:01:28.680> rid<00:01:28.830> of<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> again

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
wall in half get rid of that and again

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.430 
wall in half get rid of that and again
on<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> other<00:01:30.270> side<00:01:31.160> teasing<00:01:32.160> it<00:01:32.250> away<00:01:32.490> slowly

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
on the other side teasing it away slowly

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.070 
on the other side teasing it away slowly
you<00:01:34.440> can<00:01:34.590> throw<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.069> rock<00:01:35.250> wall<00:01:35.459> in<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.670> bin

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
you can throw the rock wall in the bin

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.249 
you can throw the rock wall in the bin
because<00:01:37.080> that's<00:01:37.350> no<00:01:37.500> longer<00:01:37.890> needed

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
because that's no longer needed

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:46.029 
because that's no longer needed
gradually<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.179> tease<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.600> away<00:01:44.270> now

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
gradually you just tease it away now

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.559 
gradually you just tease it away now
don't<00:01:47.039> get<00:01:47.130> too<00:01:47.190> concerned<00:01:48.090> if<00:01:48.270> you're<00:01:48.390> left

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
don't get too concerned if you're left

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.570 
don't get too concerned if you're left
with<00:01:48.720> some<00:01:48.899> rock<00:01:49.140> wall<00:01:49.410> on<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.130> plant<00:01:50.369> like

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
with some rock wall on the plant like

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.910 
with some rock wall on the plant like
that<00:01:50.819> no<00:01:51.330> big<00:01:51.630> deal

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
that no big deal

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.669 
that no big deal
you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.610> rinse<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.149> under<00:01:54.450> water<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:55.110> under

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
you can rinse this under water it under

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.980 
you can rinse this under water it under
tap<00:01:55.890> water<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.399> comes<00:01:56.729> off<00:01:56.880> quite<00:01:57.090> nicely<00:01:57.420> if

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
tap water this comes off quite nicely if

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.690 
tap water this comes off quite nicely if
you<00:01:58.289> want<00:01:58.470> it<00:01:58.560> completely<00:01:58.679> clean<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.369> rock

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
you want it completely clean of rock

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.699 
you want it completely clean of rock
balled-up<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.420> best<00:02:00.599> approach<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.229> in

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
balled-up be the best approach but in

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.040 
balled-up be the best approach but in
this<00:02:01.860> situation<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.849> fine<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.179> for<00:02:03.630> some

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
this situation it's fine just for some

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.620 
this situation it's fine just for some
to<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.319> left<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.679> there<00:02:04.920> now<00:02:05.550> we've<00:02:06.179> got<00:02:06.450> our

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
to be left on there now we've got our

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.870 
to be left on there now we've got our
plant<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:08.130> we're<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.490> split<00:02:08.819> that

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
plant here and we're going to split that

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.969 
plant here and we're going to split that
up<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.420> really<00:02:09.690> important<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> split<00:02:10.500> most

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
up it's really important to split most

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.520 
up it's really important to split most
plants<00:02:11.459> up<00:02:11.610> as<00:02:11.819> much<00:02:12.450> as<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.290> this

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
plants up as much as you can in this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.000 
plants up as much as you can in this
case<00:02:13.830> probably<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> do<00:02:15.770> four<00:02:16.770> or<00:02:16.800> five

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
case probably going to do four or five

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.850 
case probably going to do four or five
different<00:02:17.430> ones<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.990> teasing<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.560> apart

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
different ones so just teasing it apart

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.830 
different ones so just teasing it apart
you<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.610> hear<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.880> roots<00:02:21.090> breaking<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.720> little

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
you can hear the roots breaking a little

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.760 
you can hear the roots breaking a little
bit<00:02:21.990> that's<00:02:22.860> fine<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:24.750> one<00:02:24.930> came<00:02:25.170> away<00:02:25.440> quite

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
bit that's fine that one came away quite

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.309 
bit that's fine that one came away quite
nicely<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.310> you've<00:02:26.430> got<00:02:26.580> one<00:02:26.819> there<00:02:30.140> hold<00:02:31.140> this

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
nicely so you've got one there hold this

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.479 
nicely so you've got one there hold this
away<00:02:33.080> quite<00:02:34.080> heavily<00:02:34.620> embedded<00:02:34.860> these<00:02:35.190> ones

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
away quite heavily embedded these ones

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.070 
away quite heavily embedded these ones
but<00:02:36.270> that's<00:02:36.420> okay<00:02:38.120> too

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
but that's okay too

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.790 
but that's okay too
okay<00:02:40.920> remove<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.820> rock<00:02:42.030> wall<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.800> this

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
okay remove that rock wall and this

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.450 
okay remove that rock wall and this
one's<00:02:44.040> quite<00:02:44.280> bunched<00:02:44.730> together<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:46.280> we<00:02:47.280> might

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
one's quite bunched together so we might

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.890 
one's quite bunched together so we might
be<00:02:47.490> able<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.820> split<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:50.660> there's<00:02:51.660> another

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
be able to split that there's another

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.400 
be able to split that there's another
one<00:02:53.270> I'm<00:02:54.270> just<00:02:54.510> going<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.690> get<00:02:54.900> four<00:02:55.170> out<00:02:55.380> of

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
one I'm just going to get four out of

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.710 
one I'm just going to get four out of
this<00:02:55.590> one<00:02:56.300> sometimes<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.420> get<00:02:57.510> more

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
this one sometimes you get more

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.140 
this one sometimes you get more
depending<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:58.350> how<00:02:58.590> easily<00:02:59.220> they<00:02:59.610> come<00:02:59.850> upon

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
depending on how easily they come upon

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.080 
depending on how easily they come upon
so<00:03:00.990> now<00:03:01.140> you've<00:03:01.290> got<00:03:01.320> your<00:03:01.470> four<00:03:02.090> plantlets

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
so now you've got your four plantlets

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.150 
so now you've got your four plantlets
here<00:03:03.390> now<00:03:04.230> when<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.470> plant<00:03:04.740> them<00:03:04.920> in<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
here now when you plant them in the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.820 
here now when you plant them in the
substrate<00:03:05.640> make<00:03:05.970> sure<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:07.380> put<00:03:07.620> them<00:03:07.740> in

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
substrate make sure you put them in

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.790 
substrate make sure you put them in
about<00:03:08.100> an<00:03:08.460> inch<00:03:08.670> or<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:08.910> deep<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.570> about<00:03:10.530> two

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
about an inch or so deep and about two

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.860 
about an inch or so deep and about two
inches<00:03:11.100> apart<00:03:11.460> give<00:03:11.760> them<00:03:11.970> some<00:03:12.210> space<00:03:12.360> don't

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
inches apart give them some space don't

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.870 
inches apart give them some space don't
cramp<00:03:13.260> them<00:03:13.470> up<00:03:13.590> just<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.400> couple<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.700> inches

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
cramp them up just a couple of inches

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.660 
cramp them up just a couple of inches
apart<00:03:15.330> now<00:03:15.960> if<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.200> can<00:03:16.410> use<00:03:17.310> pair<00:03:17.580> of

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
apart now if you can use pair of

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.820 
apart now if you can use pair of
tweezers<00:03:17.910> they're<00:03:18.450> really<00:03:18.810> useful<00:03:18.990> for

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
tweezers they're really useful for

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.830 
tweezers they're really useful for
grabbing<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.730> plant<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.330> putting<00:03:21.660> them<00:03:21.810> down

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
grabbing the plant and putting them down

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.370 
grabbing the plant and putting them down
it<00:03:22.560> disturbs<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.400> substrate<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.120> lot<00:03:24.360> less<00:03:24.630> but

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
it disturbs the substrate a lot less but

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.750 
it disturbs the substrate a lot less but
if<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.590> don't<00:03:25.830> you<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.160> use<00:03:26.190> your<00:03:26.400> fingers

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.150 
if you don't you can use your fingers
but<00:03:26.790> worthwhile<00:03:27.800> investing<00:03:28.800> in<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.980> pair<00:03:29.130> of
