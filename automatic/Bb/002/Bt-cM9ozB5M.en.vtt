00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
that's interesting if you put the power

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.350 
that's interesting if you put the power
cord<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:40.099> see<00:02:41.099> a<00:02:41.129> little<00:02:41.430> orange<00:02:41.760> light<00:02:42.030> comes

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
cord in see a little orange light comes

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.350 
cord in see a little orange light comes
on<00:02:42.540> there<00:02:43.400> which<00:02:44.400> means<00:02:44.640> it's<00:02:44.849> not<00:02:45.000> fully

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
on there which means it's not fully

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.089 
on there which means it's not fully
charged<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.470> batteries<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.010> and

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
charged and the batteries in and

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.830 
charged and the batteries in and
everything<00:02:47.579> but<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.239> what<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.480> wanted<00:02:48.780> to

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
everything but this is what I wanted to

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.210 
everything but this is what I wanted to
show<00:02:49.049> you<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.290> I'm<00:02:49.349> just<00:02:49.440> going<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.739> silent

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
show you and I'm just going to be silent

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:58.880 
show you and I'm just going to be silent
so<00:02:56.239> what<00:02:57.239> actually<00:02:57.360> happens<00:02:58.049> is<00:02:58.290> when<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.590> plug

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
so what actually happens is when I plug

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.280 
so what actually happens is when I plug
it<00:02:59.010> in<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.459> then<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.819> open<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.150> up<00:03:00.269> because<00:03:00.959> it

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
it in and then I open it up because it

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.650 
it in and then I open it up because it
was<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.560> sleep<00:03:01.890> mode<00:03:02.160> when<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:03.060> open<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.540> up

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
was on the sleep mode when I open it up

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.509 
was on the sleep mode when I open it up
like<00:03:04.110> little<00:03:04.319> part<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.739> power<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.099> don't<00:03:05.310> know

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
like little part of power I don't know

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.960 
like little part of power I don't know
what<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.819> is<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:07.440> actually<00:03:07.709> turns<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.790> on

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
what it is but it actually turns it on

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.539 
what it is but it actually turns it on
for<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.420> little<00:03:09.599> bit<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.959> I'll<00:03:10.860> do<00:03:11.190> it<00:03:11.310> again

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
for a little bit and I'll do it again

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.940 
for a little bit and I'll do it again
quickly

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.130

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.259 
as you can see as well the wife white
light<00:03:20.410> comes<00:03:20.739> on<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.220> then<00:03:21.550> goes<00:03:21.730> off<00:03:21.970> and

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
light comes on and then goes off and

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.449 
light comes on and then goes off and
there's<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.959> click<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.620> we<00:03:23.890> was<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.280> was

there's a click and we was I was
listening<00:03:24.819> to<00:03:24.849> it<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.540> other<00:03:25.660> day<00:03:25.870> as<00:03:26.080> well

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
listening to it the other day as well

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.699 
listening to it the other day as well
there's<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.209> click<00:03:28.540> when<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:29.019> turns<00:03:29.260> back<00:03:29.530> off

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
there's a click when it turns back off

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.430 
there's a click when it turns back off
again<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.300> I<00:03:31.480> lift<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.140> upside<00:03:32.410> down

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
again and it and I lift it upside down

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.780 
again and it and I lift it upside down
and<00:03:32.650> done<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.129> it's<00:03:33.250> coming<00:03:33.549> from<00:03:33.670> this

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
and done it and it's coming from this

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.520 
and done it and it's coming from this
area<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.569> would<00:03:34.690> imagine<00:03:34.750> that's<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.260> hard

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
area and I would imagine that's the hard

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.759 
area and I would imagine that's the hard
drive<00:03:35.830> area<00:03:36.069> and<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:37.510> thinking<00:03:37.989> thing<00:03:38.560> where

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
drive area and the thinking thing where

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.339 
drive area and the thinking thing where
you<00:03:39.250> know<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.459> does<00:03:39.640> stuff<00:03:39.849> and<00:03:40.060> them<00:03:40.420> I<00:03:40.690> don't

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
you know it does stuff and them I don't

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.229 
you know it does stuff and them I don't
I<00:03:41.680> wouldn't<00:03:42.370> imagine<00:03:42.519> it's<00:03:42.790> got<00:03:42.910> anything<00:03:43.150> to

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
I wouldn't imagine it's got anything to

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.930 
I wouldn't imagine it's got anything to
do<00:03:43.510> with<00:03:43.540> it<00:03:43.810> not<00:03:43.959> coming<00:03:44.170> back<00:03:44.410> on<00:03:44.760> but<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.790> had

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
do with it not coming back on but I had

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.559 
do with it not coming back on but I had
games<00:03:46.209> on<00:03:46.450> there<00:03:46.660> like<00:03:47.370> minecraft<00:03:48.569> rFactor

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
games on there like minecraft rFactor

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.530 
games on there like minecraft rFactor
flight<00:03:49.930> simulator<00:03:50.200> things<00:03:50.860> just<00:03:51.340> those<00:03:51.670> free

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
flight simulator things just those free

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.120 
flight simulator things just those free
simple<00:03:52.959> games<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.440> that's<00:03:53.560> all<00:03:53.680> I<00:03:53.799> hide<00:03:53.980> on

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
simple games and that's all I hide on

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.030 
simple games and that's all I hide on
there<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.780> yeah<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:55.870> happened<00:03:56.290> in<00:03:56.410> September

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
there and yeah it happened in September

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.970 
there and yeah it happened in September
so<00:03:57.459> I<00:03:57.489> I'd<00:03:58.120> had<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:58.780> just<00:03:58.860> under<00:03:59.860> a<00:03:59.890> year

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
so I I'd had it just under a year

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.000 
so I I'd had it just under a year
basically<00:04:00.900> cut<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:01.930> like<00:04:02.140> four<00:04:02.410> months<00:04:02.560> under<00:04:02.980> a

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
basically cut a like four months under a

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.539 
basically cut a like four months under a
year<00:04:04.379> and<00:04:05.379> I<00:04:05.470> less<00:04:05.829> than<00:04:06.010> that<00:04:06.129> a<00:04:06.190> lot<00:04:06.340> less

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
year and I less than that a lot less

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.940 
year and I less than that a lot less
than<00:04:06.730> that<00:04:06.879> actually<00:04:07.500> about<00:04:08.500> half<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:08.890> year

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
than that actually about half a year

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.979 
than that actually about half a year
I've<00:04:09.190> had<00:04:09.340> it<00:04:09.489> so<00:04:10.709> if<00:04:11.709> you<00:04:12.370> guys<00:04:13.329> have<00:04:13.660> got<00:04:13.810> any
