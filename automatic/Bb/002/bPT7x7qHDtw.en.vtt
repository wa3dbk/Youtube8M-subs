00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.370 
like the Christmas pack that we were
given<00:03:21.120> for<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.360> DLC<00:03:21.840> where<00:03:22.049> it<00:03:22.110> was<00:03:22.230> snowing

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
given for the DLC where it was snowing

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.949 
given for the DLC where it was snowing
maybe<00:03:23.280> there's<00:03:23.519> some<00:03:23.730> sort<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.390> fireworks

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
maybe there's some sort of a fireworks

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.870 
maybe there's some sort of a fireworks
show<00:03:25.049> that<00:03:25.320> we<00:03:25.410> will<00:03:25.530> get<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:25.920> would<00:03:26.370> have<00:03:26.700> to

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
show that we will get I would have to

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.670 
show that we will get I would have to
say<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.180> if<00:03:27.570> there<00:03:27.750> was<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.959> fireworks<00:03:28.560> show

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
say that if there was a fireworks show

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.160 
say that if there was a fireworks show
it<00:03:29.040> would<00:03:29.160> have<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.370> be<00:03:29.549> somewhere<00:03:30.090> by<00:03:30.420> the

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
it would have to be somewhere by the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.680 
it would have to be somewhere by the
actual<00:03:31.859> ferris<00:03:32.790> wheel<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.209> think<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.480> would

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
actual ferris wheel I think that would

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.319 
actual ferris wheel I think that would
be<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.930> ideal<00:03:34.019> spot<00:03:34.680> by<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.010> beach<00:03:35.370> normally

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
be the ideal spot by the beach normally

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.699 
be the ideal spot by the beach normally
when<00:03:36.540> there's<00:03:36.780> fireworks<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.500> stuff<00:03:37.650> that

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
when there's fireworks and stuff that

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.770 
when there's fireworks and stuff that
I've<00:03:38.040> been<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.310> they<00:03:39.000> always<00:03:39.150> have<00:03:39.420> them<00:03:39.570> down

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
I've been to they always have them down

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.210 
I've been to they always have them down
by<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.019> beach<00:03:40.230> area<00:03:40.500> because<00:03:40.920> it's<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.190> know

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
by the beach area because it's you know

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.190 
by the beach area because it's you know
nice<00:03:41.820> little<00:03:42.090> romantic<00:03:42.180> thing<00:03:42.780> kind<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.079> a

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
nice little romantic thing kind of a

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.080 
nice little romantic thing kind of a
scene<00:03:43.380> but<00:03:43.590> if<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.250> had<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.400> take<00:03:44.609> a<00:03:44.640> guess<00:03:44.730> with

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
scene but if I had to take a guess with

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.120 
scene but if I had to take a guess with
GTA<00:03:45.420> 5<00:03:45.660> if<00:03:45.930> they<00:03:46.170> actually<00:03:46.590> did<00:03:46.769> implement

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
GTA 5 if they actually did implement

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.979 
GTA 5 if they actually did implement
fireworks<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.150> stuff<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.660> would<00:03:48.780> be

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
fireworks and stuff and it would be

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.660 
fireworks and stuff and it would be
somewhere<00:03:49.440> located<00:03:49.980> by<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.160> ferris<00:03:50.489> wheel

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
somewhere located by the ferris wheel

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.949 
somewhere located by the ferris wheel
they<00:03:50.970> would<00:03:51.090> probably<00:03:51.269> have<00:03:51.480> people<00:03:51.780> on<00:03:51.870> the

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
they would probably have people on the

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.690 
they would probably have people on the
beach<00:03:52.109> barbecuing<00:03:52.859> you<00:03:53.340> know<00:03:53.430> they<00:03:53.579> would

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
beach barbecuing you know they would

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.160 
beach barbecuing you know they would
have<00:03:53.820> people<00:03:54.120> with<00:03:54.209> hat<00:03:54.390> gathering<00:03:54.870> up<00:03:54.989> by<00:03:55.140> a

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
have people with hat gathering up by a

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.289 
have people with hat gathering up by a
fire<00:03:55.500> doing<00:03:55.920> some<00:03:56.070> s'mores<00:03:56.430> stuff<00:03:56.970> like<00:03:57.269> that

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
fire doing some s'mores stuff like that

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.349 
fire doing some s'mores stuff like that
that's<00:03:58.019> my<00:03:58.380> guess<00:03:58.440> when<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.340> think<00:03:59.730> about<00:04:00.030> this

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
that's my guess when I think about this

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.270 
that's my guess when I think about this
update<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.170> pack<00:04:01.350> that<00:04:01.590> could<00:04:02.130> be

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
update and the pack that could be

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.090 
update and the pack that could be
possibly<00:04:02.670> coming<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.180> GTA<00:04:03.630> 5<00:04:04.019> online<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:04.739> don't

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
possibly coming to GTA 5 online I don't

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.770 
possibly coming to GTA 5 online I don't
believe<00:04:05.160> any<00:04:05.459> cars<00:04:05.760> would<00:04:06.090> be<00:04:06.209> coming<00:04:06.480> maybe

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
believe any cars would be coming maybe

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.600 
believe any cars would be coming maybe
they<00:04:06.959> might<00:04:07.140> have<00:04:07.320> one<00:04:07.680> particular<00:04:08.040> vehicle

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
they might have one particular vehicle

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.030 
they might have one particular vehicle
that's<00:04:09.030> themed<00:04:09.360> that<00:04:09.599> was<00:04:09.750> maybe<00:04:10.080> I<00:04:10.680> don't

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
that's themed that was maybe I don't

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.259 
that's themed that was maybe I don't
know<00:04:11.099> somehow<00:04:11.400> themes<00:04:11.909> with<00:04:12.180> the

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
Independence Day not too sure how that

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.490 
Independence Day not too sure how that
