00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.500
 the symbol 2 who for a passenger 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:38.379
 symbol 19 drivers now trick on this 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.300
 icon displayed goes on bed that 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.150
 means long-term and building example 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.540
 break after four hours, press on 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.410
 the button then comes ready time 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.890
 for whoever passenger again on 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.010
 other working time example who be and 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.539
 unloaded 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.399
 now comes the bed again 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.840
 I start then there is automatic 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.590
 on steering time so it can be here now 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.720
 do not adjust 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:13.000
 it starts automatically depending on how 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:15.509
 was on the life of the company and 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.509
 texte 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.490
 see the other way around 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.190
 after asking the question 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.850
 the creative end is not the endpoint 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.120
 leave 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.180
 and there are blue unbelievably overheated 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:39.210
 was but the disc looks so much more 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.840
 well know from behind in principle the same 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.710
 which players have exactly on it 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.710
 insert here 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.050
 good if now the brake pads 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.050
 I want to be able to control this here 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.080
 enter menu then comes the vehicle 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:06.440
 I want to go out then I scroll down 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:10.459
 control data then I go down 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:15.310
 brake pads confirm that then I see 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:18.050
 that the brake pads are almost new 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.770
 then everyone goes out here with the 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.770
 skip 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:54.900
 then display the display error message 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:59.590
 would have to be working again then 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:03.329
 then do not press the switch firmly then 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.329
 I have to make a count 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.950
 not automatically 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.080
 which work and outline shine 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.530
 none 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.090
 overfilled washer and the 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.090
 settings 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:20.100
 we would just go with the 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.100
 needle 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.050
 write 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:55.219
 But nothing makes the driver 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.360
 wind not buy and reasonably 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.360
 clean so mirror
