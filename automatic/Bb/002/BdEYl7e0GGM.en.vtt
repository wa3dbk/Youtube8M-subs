00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.750
 many of you who see the video now 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.400
 or have the video clicked on think 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.670
 now what should the gummi bear 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.840
 muscle building after sport 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.029
 gummy bear 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.519
 It is now better than the post workout 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.170
 sheikh many who know me know that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.760
 I sometimes look for it from time to time 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.470
 sports right after the sport a few 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.809
 eat gummy bears and I'll be you 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.489
 briefly explain why not that way 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.890
 bad is why no no go 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.110
 why you quite rubber which after the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.090
 can consume sports and why me 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.160
 that actually helps too 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.480
 muscle building if you have time 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.190
 gummy bear if that really 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.110
 now the typical ones 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.300
 gummibÃ¤rchen now none none 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.559
 special grape sugar gummy bears 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.390
 or similar but quite normal 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.270
 Gummy bears consist of glucose syrup 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.960
 mainly sugar from dextrose 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.920
 and that's actually the way it is 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.260
 main ingredients and if you like 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.900
 considering ex rose is of course very good 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.250
 simple carbohydrates after exercise 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.810
 the courses syrup is also quite right 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.570
 fast carbohydrate too 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.210
 fast in the blood and just sugar 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.150
 also not the slowest and it has 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.380
 even an advantage over fruits 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.900
 maybe you already know it when you are 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.939
 Fruit after sport is sugar 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.509
 fructose so that has the fructose 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.470
 a fairly low glycemic index 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.110
 Do not let me lie but would have to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.159
 be approximately at 23 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.200
 we do it again own theme for 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.090
 Chemical index simply means 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.790
 fast this is this sugar 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.590
 practically in your body or for yours 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.320
 body available how fast is the im 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.549
 blood and we want to be that at 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 we already saw the other videos 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.000
 want to have the gamers very fast 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.850
 we want to have them available quickly 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.490
 That's why my body is fruit 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.500
 opinion after not advisable after the sport 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.119
 and if you really are natural one 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.649
 Post workout sheikh better so if you are 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.899
 dextrose purifies or even better 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.630
 maltodextrin with a happy index 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.489
 of 120 130 of course even faster in the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.720
 blood is better but if 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.910
 you really just not at hand 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.890
 you have to go fast somehow 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.569
 it does not have spontaneous training 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.520
 managed to take and shake in the 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.080
 studio, there are no shakes and 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.540
 is currently running somewhere at the department store 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.430
 jump over a couple of picks 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.760
 gummy bears it is really better than 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.510
 nothing I really want with it 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.190
 if you just say after training 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.720
 no possibility have anything to 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.430
 you have no shape channel 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.040
 know you have no dextrose can paint 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.780
 and extremely gets you directly from the training 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.920
 There is everywhere at every gas station in the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.390
 Supermarket picks you up a few 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.980
 gummy bears or any 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.080
 fruit gums looks back on it looks 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.500
 that there is no fat in it looks that 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.680
 which is really just made from glucose syrup and 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.080
 consist of dextrose and sugar and it 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.730
 the right after the training for your 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.110
 biogenic store to replenish 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.409
 to raise the insulin level 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.810
 you will see the success comes better 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.980
 as if you do not have gummy bears after that 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.200
 training is as if you were only one 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.519
 So apple is that's my conclusion 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.519
 and see you next time
