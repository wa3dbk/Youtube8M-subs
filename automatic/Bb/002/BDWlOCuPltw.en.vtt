00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.700
 it's the effect I hope everyone 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.800
 okay today I wanted to make a 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.139
 short video to show you the way 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.969
 which I think is green to color 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.440
 the sources there are several techniques 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.820
 to do it several products 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.140
 different that we can use 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.119
 for sure I'm going to show you 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.289
 my way to me but as I tell you from 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.420
 many ways to do it 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.160
 then I also tried a lot of 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.019
 products before really falling on this 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.910
 than ever the best 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.590
 I tried a lot of difference roses 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.239
 and especially the rose that I developed 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.640
 when I had pink hair first 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.000
 white I found a use to my 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.820
 small breasts thus proving stuff 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.530
 like that I already told you about it 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.960
 thought I did not know how 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.700
 use them but ultimately it's 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.230
 for him on six is ​​really beautiful 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.969
 so I have more color in this summit but 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.370
 my three favorite for the deaf if 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.809
 so the pink the bad the blue it's 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.280
 really stuff that's all the same 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.830
 and so easily there we remove this here 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.970
 then like that a mouthpiece like that because 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.520
 that they are not all the same kind in 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.670
 you but with a tip like that I 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.110
 quench my beveled brush and then I 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.869
 just take it directly on 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.030
 the tip what I noticed with my 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.100
 experiments in the background the tests and 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.140
 mistakes I made for my concern 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.030
 is that if we try to do this too 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.830
 it does not work if you try them 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.909
 corridor eyebrows have to go thoroughly 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.590
 the ddt 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.780
 so that's why it takes a 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.740
 stay that is really well defined not 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.329
 too shielded do not try to imitate 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.280
 to avoid the effect of the natural eyebrow 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.280
 finally so that's why I like 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.430
 many little ones could deloche it 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.450
 really gives an infinity very very but 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.180
 very very defined so it's one of the very 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.649
 good steps of the game that's why another 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.860
 thing I tried it is not 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.899
 poker in cream there are several good 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.119
 sure it is with them that brilliant 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.890
 in it's not the ideal but 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.450
 Recently I bought the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.560
 details like that so yielded I you 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.940
 watch 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.860
 from childhood and eye shadows my 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.570
 cream one could even say it's 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.910
 liners but in short that it gives some 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.780
 ipapy thing increased it applies 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.940
 well anyway 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.820
 despite a little more south to 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.400
 apply that stuff in cash but 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.780
 there is a super good hold at this well 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.730
 we can always go fix with a 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.480
 eye shadow over it's going very 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.520
 very well too 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.350
 of course we can use shadows to 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.960
 eyelids alone also problems 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.910
 that are well spiced we can just 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.490
 applied a little more fix on the 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.500
 brush before going to fetch 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.040
 the shadows finally and that's like 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.750
 something more more younger 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.700
 finally more liquid than that 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.070
 applies better as a concern but me 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.370
 my favorite product for my sources and 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.150
 of colors is the watercolors of 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.090
 make up for ever 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.190
 it's small bottles like that 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.020
 I think it's also the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.130
 make up for professional products 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.990
 ever but it turns out I do not know 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.610
 how am I going to buy this be 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.910
 what do I know about 20 dollars 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.910
 for a bottle so I knew 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.350
 that reprieve rozsa come live in 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.060
 the c for what I invested on that 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.530
 there I do not think I do not know if I'm going 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.520
 to buy but for now I have 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.580
 this one 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.810
 so it's just a shadow a center 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.640
 they do not fund a shadow to 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.950
 eyelids does not arise at the liner is a 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.709
 little anything it's just a 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.390
 colored liquid then it applies 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.250
 beautifully well knew what I'm wearing 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.660
 today remains at the listened I will 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.239
 show you in the background my technique 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.440
 to make them on six colors the 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.959
 first step is to work well 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.870
 stay to really place to do 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.390
 really the right angle finally so 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.010
 with a whirlwind like this salty play 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.660
 that's what I'm going to use 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.130
 today as product it is 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.610
 the watercolor of make up for ever so 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.959
 Here's what a bottle like that then 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.260
 in the bar then I go directly 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.420
 in the slow hood so I have it here 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.660
 then I apply them with a brush 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.489
 beveled so beveled brush like that 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.959
 I would take a question 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.150
 really do not have to go 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.850
 a lot on the brush I 'm going 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.150
 start with the inner corner 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:30.670
 also the child would just follow poorly 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:33.460
 and from here I could stop m 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.720
 a darker color but hey we go there 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.100
 just go a red color in game 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.250
 which I finally take back a little 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.250
 little 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.600
 the ocean spending because I exceed a 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:53.260
 little bit up with a cotton swab 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.210
 surplus valves as I told you if 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.270
 a lot of these will go so that's important 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.410
 it's really about practicing then 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.780
 to find one's own technique 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.390
 finally me it's my technique but 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.110
 it may not work for 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.120
 everybody 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.250
 so I hope you have even in 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.780
 video then forgot not all subscribers to my 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.940
 channel I'm trying to put videos 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.920
 more regularly this is so 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.530
 That's it I tell you I wish you 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.130
 a day spa then we 'll know soon 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.130
 ciao
