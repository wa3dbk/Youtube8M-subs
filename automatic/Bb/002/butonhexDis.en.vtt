00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:10.110
 1000ps live from the motorbike in linz 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.509
 2014 I'm on the shooting range with the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.580
 hannes hannes you wanted us that 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.900
 I will introduce the air system soon 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.670
 know that only from the professionals from the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.150
 motogp already exists for you 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.650
 to buy 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.420
 the first time welcome to 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.970
 the bike linz also in the name of the company 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.310
 danese we present you here today 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.869
 the dr 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.539
 reyes and that's the first system that is 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.410
 an innovative airbag system for 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.090
 motorcyclist 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.370
 It has been in the last ten years of 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.690
 the eso develops in cooperation with 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.899
 many racers with many 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.489
 driving on the streets 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.530
 There are two different rails and 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.200
 Although the airways and the first ried it 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.610
 is especially for road driving 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.969
 Motorcyclists have been developed 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.890
 It recognizes the special accident process 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.870
 in traffic, so impact and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.510
 hard obstacles 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.940
 sit here sensors in the vehicle, the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.989
 Vehicle electronics of the airbag system 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.880
 is via radio with the airbag vest or 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.600
 The motorcyclist complained closer 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.479
 connected 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.119
 in case of an impact accidental fall 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.119
 solve this system within 45 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.409
 milliseconds that means after 45 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.840
 milliseconds is this first 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.409
 completely inflated and has her 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.880
 Total protection achieved when I 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.380
 now a completely different light weight 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.570
 slip and the system actually 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.920
 it would not be necessary to solve it 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.590
 or is it at very light 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.350
 rush and so is not dissolving in it 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.420
 In this case, in the geÃ¤st raid system 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.729
 because in traffic even at light 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.040
 German slides are the danger 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.680
 that's it too 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.050
 serious injury comes from others 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.160
 road users by impact 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.440
 hard obstacles 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.770
 So it's one in this case 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.890
 Decided where you in doubt that 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.230
 system there to trigger 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.050
 Which price region move us 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.180
 because with these kombis in the kombis 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:07.360
 we move at around 2700 euro 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.150
 2800 euro depending on the equipment of the combo 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.580
 mdr street system that gives it a vest 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.640
 that's a genius and there is a krake 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.830
 moving almost 2,000 euros s100 is 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.870
 Expensive as we all know if I am now 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.800
 The system had an accident 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.780
 triggered 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.910
 then the combination is completely in the bucket 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.080
 or can I resolve that again when 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.700
 the air race system solves this airbag 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.989
 this airbag under the leather from the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.580
 means he is actually when he is not 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.310
 the leather is completely torn through 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.540
 the thing remains undamaged one can 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.640
 then fill it again 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.080
 you have to send it to the ether then 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.940
 It will be checked each time 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.110
 the full functionality 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.090
 is reproduced as us together 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.640
 a new one is applied 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.380
 Gas cartridge installed and then gets 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.790
 the customer back then that says 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.190
 you can just support it again 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.190
 thank you very much and goodbye
