we're going to talk about the future of
the<00:00:09.200> wallet<00:00:10.200> tell<00:00:11.160> me<00:00:11.250> about<00:00:11.340> where<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
the wallet tell me about where is the

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.789 
the wallet tell me about where is the
wallet<00:00:12.450> going<00:00:12.690> are<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:12.840> going<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.440> get<00:00:13.590> rid<00:00:13.769> of

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
wallet going are we going to get rid of

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.950 
wallet going are we going to get rid of
all<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.040> stack<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.820> cards<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.420> cash<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.900> we

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
all that stack of cards and cash that we

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.349 
all that stack of cards and cash that we
carry<00:00:16.170> around<00:00:16.260> anytime<00:00:16.830> soon<00:00:17.130> well<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> think

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
carry around anytime soon well I think

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.950 
carry around anytime soon well I think
it<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.660> going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.869> happen<00:00:18.990> both<00:00:19.850> Google<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
it is going to happen both Google and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.750 
it is going to happen both Google and
the<00:00:21.960> ISIS<00:00:22.650> consortium<00:00:23.279> have<00:00:23.430> come<00:00:23.609> together

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the ISIS consortium have come together

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.960 
the ISIS consortium have come together
to<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:25.230> construct<00:00:25.710> digital<00:00:26.580> wallets<00:00:26.880> that

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
to to construct digital wallets that

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.429 
to to construct digital wallets that
will<00:00:27.210> be<00:00:27.269> going<00:00:27.480> into<00:00:27.599> mobile<00:00:27.930> phones<00:00:28.140> which

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
will be going into mobile phones which

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.450 
will be going into mobile phones which
have<00:00:28.650> NFC<00:00:29.070> capability<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:31.040> and<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.369> is

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
have NFC capability and and so this is

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.819 
have NFC capability and and so this is
going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> happen<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.840> question<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.800> it

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
going to happen the question is is it

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.530 
going to happen the question is is it
going<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.130> catch<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.090> value<00:00:36.390> proposition

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
going to catch is the value proposition

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.510 
going to catch is the value proposition
going<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.260> catch<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:38.010> terms<00:00:38.309> of

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
going to catch on in terms of

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.139 
going to catch on in terms of
convenience<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.120> customers<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.690> then

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
convenience for customers and then

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.400 
convenience for customers and then
convenience<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.360> merchants<00:00:42.870> issuers

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
convenience for the merchants issuers

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.520 
convenience for the merchants issuers
and<00:00:43.440> mobile<00:00:43.860> operators<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.260> it's<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.469> to

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and mobile operators so it's going to

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.200 
and mobile operators so it's going to
happen<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:47.100> going<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.340> start<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.879> think<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
happen it's going to start I think the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.290 
happen it's going to start I think the
real<00:00:48.360> issue<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> catch<00:00:50.300> so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
real issue is is it going to catch so

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.660 
real issue is is it going to catch so
for<00:00:51.600> consumers<00:00:52.440> probably<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> thing<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
for consumers probably the thing that a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.340 
for consumers probably the thing that a
lot<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.940> people<00:00:54.030> are<00:00:54.210> paranoid<00:00:54.360> about<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.930> how

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
lot of people are paranoid about is how

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.650 
lot of people are paranoid about is how
secure<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.550> able<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:56.969> all<00:00:57.180> of

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
secure is it to be able to have all of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.340 
secure is it to be able to have all of
your<00:00:57.870> payment<00:00:58.559> data<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.309> your<00:00:59.370> phone<00:00:59.850> right<00:01:00.539> so

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
your payment data on your phone right so

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.939 
your payment data on your phone right so
the<00:01:01.440> good<00:01:01.530> news<00:01:01.590> there<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
the good news there is that the the

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.440 
the good news there is that the the
whole<00:01:04.949> paradigm<00:01:05.220> around<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> wallet<00:01:06.150> is

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
whole paradigm around the wallet is

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.050 
whole paradigm around the wallet is
using<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.320> pretty<00:01:07.799> good<00:01:08.159> tried<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.000> true

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
using a pretty good tried and true

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.270 
using a pretty good tried and true
security<00:01:09.630> practice<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.530> I'll<00:01:10.799> give<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.220> a

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
security practice and I'll give you a

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520 
security practice and I'll give you a
few<00:01:11.430> examples<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.200> first<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.290> all<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
few examples of that first of all the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.310 
few examples of that first of all the
wallet<00:01:13.830> application<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:15.030> actually<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:16.140> going

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
wallet application is actually not going

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.560 
wallet application is actually not going
to<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.560> put<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.430> general<00:01:17.790> processing<00:01:18.360> area

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
to be put in the general processing area

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.730 
to be put in the general processing area
of<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> smartphone<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> be

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
of the smartphone it's going to be

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.410 
of the smartphone it's going to be
placed<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:20.670> they<00:01:20.759> call<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> secure

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
placed and what they call the secure

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.109 
placed and what they call the secure
element<00:01:21.600> which<00:01:22.439> could<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.710> an<00:01:22.799> SD<00:01:23.159> card<00:01:23.189> or<00:01:23.700> on

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
element which could be an SD card or on

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.700 
element which could be an SD card or on
the<00:01:24.240> sin<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.840> separate<00:01:25.200> from<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
the sin but it's separate from the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.609 
the sin but it's separate from the
general<00:01:26.009> processor<00:01:26.549> space<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.330> from<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
general processor space and so from a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.950 
general processor space and so from a
security<00:01:29.159> perspective<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:30.210> always<00:01:30.570> good<00:01:30.930> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
security perspective it's always good to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.060 
security perspective it's always good to
put<00:01:33.200> applications<00:01:34.200> doing<00:01:34.619> sensitive

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
put applications doing sensitive

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.929 
put applications doing sensitive
operations<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:36.210> separate<00:01:37.170> physical<00:01:38.009> hardware

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
operations in separate physical hardware

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.190 
operations in separate physical hardware
and<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.600> that's<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.170> good<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.979> good<00:01:41.009> notion

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
and so that's a good it's a good notion

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.080 
and so that's a good it's a good notion
additionally<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.829> whole<00:01:43.979> ecosystem<00:01:44.820> around

additionally the whole ecosystem around

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.569 
additionally the whole ecosystem around

are out there there's the EMV
contactless<00:01:56.780> communication<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.899> security

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
communicating back to issuing banks so I

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.210 
communicating back to issuing banks so I
think<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.420> good<00:02:06.600> news<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.560> they're<00:02:08.099> not

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
think the good news is that they're not

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.380 
think the good news is that they're not
sort<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.520> trying<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> roll<00:02:08.910> their<00:02:09.060> own<00:02:09.209> it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
sort of trying to roll their own it

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.820 
sort of trying to roll their own it
looks<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.660> they're<00:02:09.810> trying<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.140> use<00:02:10.379> good

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
looks like they're trying to use good

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.140 
looks like they're trying to use good
security<00:02:11.280> practice<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.180> so

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
security practice and so

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.470 
security practice and so
the<00:02:13.870> concept<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.489> your<00:02:15.489> payment<00:02:16.060> card

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
the concept that your payment card

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.520 
the concept that your payment card
information<00:02:16.810> will<00:02:17.470> be<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.549> device<00:02:19.530> that

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
information will be in this device that

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.979 
information will be in this device that
is<00:02:21.040> running<00:02:21.939> sort<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.299> in<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.480> separate<00:02:22.780> piece

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
is running sort of in a separate piece

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.530 
is running sort of in a separate piece
of<00:02:23.140> hardware<00:02:23.560> using<00:02:24.250> cryptography<00:02:24.879> for

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
of hardware using cryptography for

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.899 
of hardware using cryptography for
securing<00:02:25.959> this<00:02:26.049> information<00:02:26.650> actually<00:02:27.310> is

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
securing this information actually is

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.089 
securing this information actually is
even<00:02:28.659> a<00:02:28.720> much<00:02:28.840> more<00:02:28.989> secure<00:02:29.349> paradigm<00:02:29.859> than

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
even a much more secure paradigm than

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.729 
even a much more secure paradigm than
having<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.459> credit<00:02:30.760> card<00:02:31.030> where<00:02:31.840> your<00:02:32.170> account

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
having a credit card where your account

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.470 
having a credit card where your account
information<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.370> on<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.519> mag<00:02:33.760> stripe<00:02:33.939> that

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
information is on a mag stripe that

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.380 
information is on a mag stripe that
isn't<00:02:34.720> encrypted<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.640> my<00:02:36.640> response<00:02:37.269> to<00:02:37.329> that

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
isn't encrypted so my response to that

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.880 
isn't encrypted so my response to that
is<00:02:37.569> yeah<00:02:37.959> it's<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.439> going<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.650> be<00:02:38.739> more

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
is yeah it's it's going to be more

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.619 
is yeah it's it's going to be more
secure<00:02:39.159> well<00:02:39.730> yeah<00:02:39.790> because<00:02:39.879> that's<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.329> the

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
secure well yeah because that's the the

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.690 
secure well yeah because that's the the
magnetic<00:02:41.379> stripe<00:02:41.590> on<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:42.189> back<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.340> every

credit<00:02:42.970> card<00:02:43.000> if<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.599> have<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.840> reader<00:02:44.079> you<00:02:44.230> can

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
credit card if you have a reader you can

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.930 
credit card if you have a reader you can
read<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.799> data<00:02:44.950> that's<00:02:45.129> their<00:02:45.370> right<00:02:45.609> that's

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
read the data that's their right that's

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.629 
read the data that's their right that's
that's<00:02:46.209> correct<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:47.379> you<00:02:47.739> know<00:02:47.859> the<00:02:47.950> prop

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
that's correct and in you know the prop

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.210 
that's correct and in you know the prop
there<00:02:48.879> is<00:02:49.030> well<00:02:49.209> gee<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.599> credit<00:02:50.500> card<00:02:50.829> number

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
there is well gee the credit card number

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.589 
there is well gee the credit card number
is<00:02:51.340> actually<00:02:51.489> on<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.790> card<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:52.299> why<00:02:52.420> do<00:02:52.480> we

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
is actually on the card so why do we

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.940 
is actually on the card so why do we
have<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:52.810> encrypt<00:02:53.109> it<00:02:53.230> on<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.409> stripe<00:02:53.680> right

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
have to encrypt it on the stripe right

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.970 
have to encrypt it on the stripe right
okay<00:02:54.310> but<00:02:54.909> again<00:02:55.629> what<00:02:56.109> the<00:02:56.349> wallet<00:02:56.859> is

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
okay but again what the wallet is

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.449 
okay but again what the wallet is
allowing<00:02:57.430> us<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.549> do<00:02:57.819> is<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.090> use<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.930> know

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
allowing us to do is to use you know

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.740 
allowing us to do is to use you know
cryptography<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.489> encrypt<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.090> information

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
cryptography to encrypt that information

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.330 
cryptography to encrypt that information
to<00:03:02.170> actually<00:03:02.439> put<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.739> in<00:03:02.829> a<00:03:02.889> little<00:03:02.980> separate

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340

better both for the buyer and for the

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
person that's on the merchant side of

person that's on the merchant side of
the<00:03:41.230> equation<00:03:41.440> right<00:03:41.889> well<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:43.419> couple<00:03:43.840> things

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
the equation right well a couple things

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.500 
the equation right well a couple things
I<00:03:44.530> think<00:03:44.979> from<00:03:45.099> the<00:03:45.280> merchants<00:03:45.879> and<00:03:46.030> issuers

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
I think from the merchants and issuers

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.629 
I think from the merchants and issuers
you<00:03:47.500> know<00:03:47.590> one<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.919> things<00:03:48.129> they<00:03:48.340> do<00:03:48.400> look

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
you know one of the things they do look

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.909 
you know one of the things they do look
at<00:03:48.819> is<00:03:49.030> sort<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.419> security<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.889> security

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
at is sort of the security the security

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.800 
at is sort of the security the security
side<00:03:51.729> of<00:03:51.940> things<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:54.449> you<00:03:55.449> know<00:03:55.510> they're

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
side of things and so you know they're

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.080 
side of things and so you know they're
there<00:03:56.379> think<00:03:56.739> they're<00:03:57.280> correctly<00:03:57.729> thinking

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
there think they're correctly thinking

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.280 
there think they're correctly thinking
that<00:03:58.329> they'll<00:03:58.690> be<00:03:58.750> able<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:59.019> get<00:03:59.109> a<00:03:59.139> much

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
that they'll be able to get a much

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.259 
that they'll be able to get a much
better<00:03:59.819> foothold<00:04:00.819> on<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.780> whole<00:04:01.930> issue<00:04:02.260> of

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
better foothold on the whole issue of

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.339 
better foothold on the whole issue of
you<00:04:04.269> know<00:04:04.299> controlling<00:04:04.690> those<00:04:04.840> credit<00:04:05.199> card

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
you know controlling those credit card

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.939 
you know controlling those credit card
numbers<00:04:05.639> from<00:04:06.639> a<00:04:06.729> consumer<00:04:07.180> perspective<00:04:07.949> I

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
numbers from a consumer perspective I

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.830 
numbers from a consumer perspective I
think<00:04:09.280> it's<00:04:09.430> sort<00:04:09.579> of<00:04:09.639> the<00:04:09.729> fat<00:04:09.940> wallet<00:04:10.389> issue

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
think it's sort of the fat wallet issue

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.740 
think it's sort of the fat wallet issue
and<00:04:11.379> that<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.459> like<00:04:12.669> every<00:04:13.030> you<00:04:13.449> know<00:04:13.479> every

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
and that is like every you know every

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.300 
and that is like every you know every
guy's<00:04:13.900> wallet<00:04:14.169> which<00:04:14.530> stuff<00:04:14.859> with<00:04:15.010> credit

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
guy's wallet which stuff with credit

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.550 
cards and loyalty cards and all sorts of
stuff<00:04:17.909> that<00:04:18.909> all<00:04:19.120> collapses<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:20.199> know<00:04:20.289> down

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
stuff that all collapses you know down

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.650 
stuff that all collapses you know down
to<00:04:20.949> your<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.549> your<00:04:21.579> digital<00:04:22.029> wallet<00:04:22.450> and<00:04:22.630> so

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
to your to your digital wallet and so

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.710 
to your to your digital wallet and so
you<00:04:25.660> know<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.870> makes<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.500> more<00:04:27.460> manageable<00:04:27.910> in

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
you know it makes it more manageable in

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.930 
you know it makes it more manageable in
the<00:04:29.260> abstract<00:04:29.590> but<00:04:29.919> I<00:04:29.979> think<00:04:30.160> I<00:04:30.490> think<00:04:30.880> the

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
the abstract but I think I think the

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.990 
the abstract but I think I think the
question<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:33.370> know<00:04:33.400> in<00:04:33.610> terms<00:04:33.760> of

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
question is you know in terms of

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.640 
question is you know in terms of
practically<00:04:34.840> using<00:04:35.169> that<00:04:35.260> on<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.440> day-to-day

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
practically using that on a day-to-day

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.460 
practically using that on a day-to-day
basis<00:04:36.370> are<00:04:36.820> you<00:04:37.030> going<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.330> reach<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:37.990> cadence

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
basis are you going to reach a cadence

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.439 
basis are you going to reach a cadence
or<00:04:38.650> rhythm<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:39.280> allows<00:04:39.669> you<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.000> do<00:04:40.300> it

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
or rhythm that allows you to do it

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.360 
or rhythm that allows you to do it
easily<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:40.930> i<00:04:41.199> think<00:04:41.410> that's<00:04:41.590> still<00:04:41.919> somewhat

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
easily and i think that's still somewhat

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.390 
easily and i think that's still somewhat
of<00:04:42.430> an<00:04:42.520> open<00:04:42.729> question<00:04:42.880> i<00:04:43.360> know<00:04:44.110> i<00:04:44.199> have<00:04:44.470> a<00:04:44.500> case

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
of an open question i know i have a case

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.460 
of an open question i know i have a case
on<00:04:45.639> my<00:04:45.790> own<00:04:45.970> phone<00:04:46.449> that<00:04:46.720> holds<00:04:46.990> like<00:04:47.110> two

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
on my own phone that holds like two

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
on my own phone that holds like two
credit<00:04:47.830> cards<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.250> so<00:04:48.340> one<00:04:48.550> of<00:04:48.580> them<00:04:48.760> is<00:04:48.940> my

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
credit cards and so one of them is my

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.550 
credit cards and so one of them is my
transit<00:04:51.490> pass<00:04:51.639> and<00:04:51.970> the<00:04:52.600> other<00:04:52.690> one<00:04:52.810> is<00:04:52.840> a<00:04:52.930> card

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
transit pass and the other one is a card

that I carry with me and that is

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.659 
that I carry with me and that is

to fall out one of the questions I
wonder<00:05:34.270> about<00:05:34.360> is<00:05:34.510> you<00:05:35.169> know<00:05:35.229> like<00:05:35.520> starbucks

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
wonder about is you know like starbucks

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
other companies do as well and part of

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.520 
other companies do as well and part of
the<00:05:40.720> reason<00:05:40.750> they<00:05:41.020> encourage<00:05:41.289> you<00:05:41.410> to<00:05:41.500> use

the reason they encourage you to use
their<00:05:41.800> card<00:05:42.039> is<00:05:42.250> because<00:05:42.490> they<00:05:42.669> reduce<00:05:42.940> their

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
their card is because they reduce their
