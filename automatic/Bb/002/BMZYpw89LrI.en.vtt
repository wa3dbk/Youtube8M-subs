00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
onward period of Transformers I was a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.439 
onward period of Transformers I was a
huge<00:00:49.050> fan<00:00:49.080> of<00:00:49.350> Cyclonus<00:00:50.040> I<00:00:50.160> mean<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.640> thought

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
huge fan of Cyclonus I mean I I thought

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.450

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
his voice was cool I thought the design

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.729 
his voice was cool I thought the design
of<00:00:53.670> him<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:53.970> cold<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> jet<00:00:54.750> was<00:00:54.989> very<00:00:55.230> nice<00:00:55.470> as

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
of him was cold the jet was very nice as

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.650 
of him was cold the jet was very nice as
well<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:57.180> jet<00:00:57.420> actually<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.989> toy<00:00:58.230> form<00:00:58.620> does

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
well the jet actually in toy form does

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.979 
well the jet actually in toy form does
show<00:01:00.660> does<00:01:01.290> is<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> good<00:01:02.690> representation<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
show does is a good representation of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.999 
show does is a good representation of
the<00:01:04.800> cartoon<00:01:05.550> counterpart<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.479> cyclones<00:01:07.290> as

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
the cartoon counterpart of cyclones as

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.719 
the cartoon counterpart of cyclones as
you<00:01:08.190> can<00:01:08.310> see<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> futuristic<00:01:09.210> jet<00:01:10.729> not

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
you can see it's a futuristic jet not

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.400 
you can see it's a futuristic jet not
bad<00:01:11.940> really<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.360> mean<00:01:12.479> considering<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.290> an

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
bad really I mean considering this is an

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.240 
bad really I mean considering this is an
old<00:01:13.560> toy<00:01:14.539> as<00:01:15.539> I<00:01:15.810> mentioned<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:17.039> is<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
old toy as I mentioned it was this is a

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.200 
old toy as I mentioned it was this is a
Targetmaster<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.250> same<00:01:20.610> mold<00:01:20.910> as

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
Targetmaster so this is the same mold as

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.870 
Targetmaster so this is the same mold as
the<00:01:21.450> initial<00:01:22.070> cyclonus<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.280> only<00:01:23.520> difference

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
the initial cyclonus the only difference

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.230 
the initial cyclonus the only difference
is<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.360> retooled<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.860> peg<00:01:26.399> hole<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.940> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
is that they retooled a peg hole in the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.139 
is that they retooled a peg hole in the
top<00:01:27.539> of<00:01:27.690> his<00:01:27.869> jet<00:01:28.289> if<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.399> just<00:01:29.550> probably<00:01:29.729> jet

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
top of his jet if we just probably jet

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.029 
top of his jet if we just probably jet
down<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.539> second<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:30.959> we<00:01:31.080> had<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.470> look<00:01:31.830> at

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
down for a second and we had a look at

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.059 
down for a second and we had a look at
his<00:01:32.369> target<00:01:33.119> master<00:01:33.720> counterpart<00:01:34.649> nightstick

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
his target master counterpart nightstick

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.800 
his target master counterpart nightstick
being<00:01:38.069> again<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.550> this<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.729> from<00:01:39.209> the<00:01:39.360> 80s

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
being again that this is from the 80s

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.540 
being again that this is from the 80s
there's<00:01:40.050> really<00:01:40.259> not<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.530> lot<00:01:40.679> in<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.280> way<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.700> I

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
there's really not a lot in the way of I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.800 
there's really not a lot in the way of I
mean<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.670> detailing<00:01:45.179> is<00:01:45.300> there<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.630> there's

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
mean the detailing is there but there's

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.969 
mean the detailing is there but there's
certainly<00:01:46.050> not<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.289> lot<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.679> way<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.800> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
certainly not a lot in the way of the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.620 
certainly not a lot in the way of the
articulation<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.789> figure<00:01:47.849> I<00:01:48.240> mean<00:01:48.539> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
articulation of the figure I mean the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.020 
articulation of the figure I mean the
figure<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:49.020> pretty<00:01:49.440> much<00:01:49.560> bend<00:01:49.950> at<00:01:50.819> the<00:01:50.880> waist

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
figure can pretty much bend at the waist

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.050 
figure can pretty much bend at the waist
but<00:01:51.479> that's<00:01:51.660> about<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.349> only<00:01:52.470> is

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
but that's about it and it only is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.020 
but that's about it and it only is
because<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.240> his<00:01:54.420> transformation<00:01:56.030> now

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
because of his transformation now

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.350 
because of his transformation now

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
liked the idea of a robotic sidekick and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.450

actually<00:02:53.730> just<00:02:53.910> take<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:55.370> nightstick<00:02:56.370> into<00:02:58.430> now

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
actually just take a nightstick into now

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.340 
actually just take a nightstick into now
I<00:02:59.460> mean<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.790> looks<00:03:00.120> bulky<00:03:00.330> on<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.750> on<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.050> ship

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350

it<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:02.030> never<00:03:03.030> have<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.420> displayed<00:03:03.870> as<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.050> ship<00:03:04.320> I

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
it I never have it displayed as a ship I

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.680 
it I never have it displayed as a ship I
would<00:03:04.890> have<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.220> transformed<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.210> robot<00:03:06.660> mode

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
would have it transformed in robot mode

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.420 
would have it transformed in robot mode
and<00:03:07.080> then<00:03:07.200> I'd<00:03:07.320> have<00:03:07.530> him<00:03:07.740> holding<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.220> gun

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.900 
and then I'd have him holding the gun

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
additional holes they did that with all

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.810 
additional holes they did that with all
the<00:03:13.380> target<00:03:13.680> masters<00:03:14.040> they<00:03:14.160> they<00:03:14.490> tooled

you<00:04:39.210> can<00:04:39.360> actually<00:04:39.480> fold<00:04:39.870> down<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.590> as<00:04:41.520> you

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
you can actually fold down and as you

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.379 
you can actually fold down and as you
can<00:04:41.790> see<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.090> can<00:04:42.240> see<00:04:42.750> his<00:04:42.840> face<00:04:43.050> as<00:04:43.290> well

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
can see you can see his face as well

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.499 
can see you can see his face as well
and<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.080> way<00:04:45.169> of<00:04:45.289> transformation<00:04:46.330> all<00:04:47.330> you

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
and the way of transformation all you

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.760 
and the way of transformation all you
want<00:04:47.719> to<00:04:47.810> do<00:04:47.960> is<00:04:48.379> fold<00:04:49.250> out<00:04:49.520> these<00:04:49.759> legs<00:04:50.770> it's

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
want to do is fold out these legs it's

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.170 
want to do is fold out these legs it's
not<00:04:51.919> really<00:04:52.159> going<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.370> be<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.490> lot<00:04:52.759> in<00:04:52.969> the<00:04:53.060> way

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
not really going to be a lot in the way

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.610 
not really going to be a lot in the way
of<00:04:53.210> transformation<00:04:53.900> just<00:04:54.020> because<00:04:54.289> these<00:04:54.409> are

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
of transformation just because these are

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.159 
of transformation just because these are
older<00:04:55.009> toys<00:04:55.360> but<00:04:56.360> what<00:04:56.539> you<00:04:56.599> want<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.870> do<00:04:56.960> is

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
older toys but what you want to do is

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.770 
older toys but what you want to do is
fold<00:04:57.650> out<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.039> legs<00:04:58.400> and<00:04:58.789> make<00:04:59.210> sure<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.509> feet

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
fold out the legs and make sure the feet

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.409 
fold out the legs and make sure the feet
out<00:04:59.810> are<00:05:00.169> fully<00:05:00.710> extended<00:05:01.009> and<00:05:01.490> then<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:02.300> can

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
out are fully extended and then you can

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.149 
out are fully extended and then you can
take<00:05:02.599> these<00:05:02.750> panels<00:05:03.229> and<00:05:03.349> separate<00:05:03.919> them<00:05:04.069> out

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
take these panels and separate them out

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.360 
take these panels and separate them out
just<00:05:04.460> so<00:05:04.580> that<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.849> feet<00:05:05.330> are<00:05:05.360> loose<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.370> then

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
just so that the feet are loose and then

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.879 
just so that the feet are loose and then
what<00:05:07.610> you<00:05:07.729> want<00:05:07.939> to<00:05:08.060> do<00:05:08.210> is<00:05:08.509> you<00:05:09.439> want<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.650> take

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
what you want to do is you want to take

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:16.480 
what you want to do is you want to take
his<00:05:10.340> hand<00:05:12.039> and<00:05:13.090> fold<00:05:14.090> it<00:05:14.210> out<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:15.770> take<00:05:16.310> his

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
his hand and fold it out and take his

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.540 
his hand and fold it out and take his
other<00:05:16.669> hand<00:05:19.419> and<00:05:20.419> fold<00:05:20.900> it<00:05:21.020> out<00:05:21.139> and<00:05:21.590> then<00:05:22.460> you

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
other hand and fold it out and then you

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.830 
other hand and fold it out and then you
can<00:05:22.699> take<00:05:22.969> his<00:05:24.580> wing<00:05:25.580> asked<00:05:26.180> part<00:05:26.479> of<00:05:26.569> it<00:05:26.689> and

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
can take his wing asked part of it and

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.689 
can take his wing asked part of it and
fold<00:05:27.259> to<00:05:27.439> those<00:05:27.620> end<00:05:27.949> just<00:05:28.250> because<00:05:28.370> they're

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
fold to those end just because they're

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.929 
fold to those end just because they're
going<00:05:28.789> to<00:05:28.849> give<00:05:29.000> you<00:05:29.120> problems<00:05:29.629> with<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:30.939> with

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:31.939

want fold those in and then you can take
the<00:05:38.360> wing<00:05:38.629> parts<00:05:39.139> and<00:05:39.319> fold<00:05:39.590> those<00:05:39.740> in<00:05:39.979> as<00:05:40.099> well

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
the wing parts and fold those in as well

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.179 
the wing parts and fold those in as well
you<00:05:41.419> can<00:05:41.569> bring<00:05:41.689> these<00:05:41.930> up<00:05:42.229> that's<00:05:42.800> entirely

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:43.189 
you can bring these up that's entirely

you can bring these up that's entirely
up<00:05:43.460> to<00:05:43.490> you<00:05:43.729> though<00:05:44.229> and<00:05:45.229> bring<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:45.949> hands<00:05:46.340> out

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
up to you though and bring the hands out

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
and then when you're finished with all

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.320 
and then when you're finished with all
that<00:05:50.449> you<00:05:50.599> can<00:05:50.750> pop<00:05:51.050> the<00:05:51.259> head<00:05:51.469> down<00:05:51.770> and<00:05:52.330> there

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
that you can pop the head down and there

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.189 
that you can pop the head down and there
you<00:05:53.360> have<00:05:53.650> in<00:05:54.650> all<00:05:54.889> his<00:05:55.360> wondrous<00:05:56.360> splendor

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
you have in all his wondrous splendor

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:01.329 
you have in all his wondrous splendor
there<00:05:57.560> you<00:05:57.710> have<00:05:57.979> cyclonus<00:05:59.979> I'm<00:06:00.979> sure<00:06:01.190> the

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:01.339 
there you have cyclonus I'm sure the

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:04.059 
there you have cyclonus I'm sure the
camera<00:06:01.580> gets<00:06:01.759> all<00:06:01.909> this<00:06:02.080> once<00:06:03.080> again<00:06:03.379> they've

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:04.069 
camera gets all this once again they've

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.420 
camera gets all this once again they've
retooled<00:06:04.729> the<00:06:04.940> hands<00:06:05.509> on<00:06:05.800> cyclonus<00:06:06.800> a<00:06:06.979> little

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
retooled the hands on cyclonus a little

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.219 
retooled the hands on cyclonus a little
bit<00:06:07.550> larger<00:06:08.000> than<00:06:08.029> the<00:06:08.180> initial<00:06:08.479> cyclone<00:06:09.080> it's

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 
bit larger than the initial cyclone it's

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.019 
bit larger than the initial cyclone it's
just<00:06:09.440> so<00:06:09.560> he<00:06:09.650> could<00:06:09.800> hold<00:06:09.979> nightstick<00:06:10.729> and

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:13.029 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:16.089 

unlike<00:06:14.029> the<00:06:14.300> Transformers<00:06:15.110> Universe<00:06:15.319> cyclone

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
unlike the Transformers Universe cyclone

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:18.909 
unlike the Transformers Universe cyclone
it's<00:06:16.279> you<00:06:16.400> could<00:06:16.520> actually<00:06:16.699> hope<00:06:17.180> house<00:06:17.919> it's

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
it's you could actually hope house it's

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.939 
it's you could actually hope house it's
gonna<00:06:19.099> say<00:06:19.250> hose<00:06:19.550> I<00:06:19.909> was<00:06:20.810> gonna<00:06:20.990> say<00:06:21.259> hose<00:06:21.469> but

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
gonna say hose I was gonna say hose but

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:23.800 
gonna say hose I was gonna say hose but
you<00:06:22.099> can<00:06:22.279> you<00:06:22.909> can<00:06:23.060> have<00:06:23.089> him<00:06:23.449> holding

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
you can you can have him holding

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.610 
you can you can have him holding
nightstick<00:06:24.680> in<00:06:24.860> either<00:06:25.129> hand<00:06:26.349> again<00:06:27.349> I<00:06:27.379> mean

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
nightstick in either hand again I mean

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.469 
nightstick in either hand again I mean
there's<00:06:27.800> really<00:06:27.860> not<00:06:28.129> a<00:06:28.189> lot<00:06:28.370> to<00:06:28.939> the<00:06:29.120> figure

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
there's really not a lot to the figure

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.429 
there's really not a lot to the figure
just<00:06:29.719> because<00:06:30.529> this<00:06:30.710> is<00:06:30.949> a<00:06:31.279> generation<00:06:31.939> 1

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:32.439 
just because this is a generation 1

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.829 
just because this is a generation 1
transformer<00:06:33.439> but<00:06:34.159> I<00:06:34.550> still<00:06:35.180> think<00:06:35.449> he<00:06:35.629> has<00:06:35.810> a

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:35.839 
transformer but I still think he has a

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:38.950 
transformer but I still think he has a
nice<00:06:36.050> little<00:06:36.080> charm<00:06:37.330> he's<00:06:38.330> a<00:06:38.360> neat<00:06:38.659> looking

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
nice little charm he's a neat looking

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.459 
nice little charm he's a neat looking
figure<00:06:39.199> and<00:06:40.089> I'm<00:06:41.089> really<00:06:41.810> really<00:06:41.960> glad<00:06:42.319> I

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:42.469 
figure and I'm really really glad I

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:44.200 
figure and I'm really really glad I
picked<00:06:42.800> him<00:06:42.979> up<00:06:43.099> I<00:06:43.279> mean<00:06:43.460> again<00:06:43.729> I<00:06:43.759> wish<00:06:44.089> I

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
picked him up I mean again I wish I

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.269 
picked him up I mean again I wish I
could<00:06:44.360> remember<00:06:44.509> the<00:06:44.659> sellers<00:06:45.169> name<00:06:45.379> because

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:46.279
