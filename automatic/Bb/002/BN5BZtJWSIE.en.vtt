 Hello, today's video for those 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.740
 anyone have a dishwasher for those 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.750
 whom 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:13.200
 hard water many use 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.440
 add salt to soften water and 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.779
 to get rid of the white plaque on a 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.789
 days after she washed well and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 for the situation protect all equipment 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.460
 inside many people buy such funds 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.220
 as 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.769
 finish but we have the most common salt 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.780
 for dishwashers 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:38.460
 many who want to save and pit 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.390
 regular table salt but i'm not 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.270
 supporter to replace the finish for cookery 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.050
 salt since the salt is only 70 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.600
 3 percent chlorine clean need 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.309
 quite a lot of others 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.739
 impurities is unknown how it will affect 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.260
 equipment 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:04.559
 internal dishwashers in order 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:07.140
 what to replace and ordinary salt and finish 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.240
 just go to any store that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.799
 sells equipment for 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.570
 filters for the filter themselves 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.409
 bargain heating system tank 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.409
 here is a bear 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:34.380
 Here are the bags of 25 That's the salt 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.450
 she tableted if 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.310
 more precisely the salt than the plus of this salt is that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.250
 she is in pills and not so fast she 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.110
 dissolves data machine that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.110
 we are more on stands at maximum 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.350
 water hardness 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.100
 there are three types of stiffness it stands on 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:01.560
 maximum consumption 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:04.230
 when we rolled the finish bought for but 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.260
 Now it is in the area of â€‹â€‹the Internet is from 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.760
 140 to 160 bought somewhere 150 rubles for 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.490
 one and a half kilograms a pack she snapped at 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.380
 us somewhere from 7 to 9 days after nine 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.420
 nine days 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.520
 mostly 7 days well 9 will be ignited 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:27.300
 light bulb on what needs to be added 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:31.489
 salt and this bag is this bag 25 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.489
 kilogram of Turkish salt can be seen here 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.260
 99 and five percent minimum sodium chlorine 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:47.640
 almost one hundred percent pure sodium chlorine 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:50.370
 and there are no foreign impurities 1 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.060
 a pack costs 150 rubles for it is enough for 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.310
 9 days if you take 360 days to read 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.940
 divided by 9 this is obtained per year 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.090
 leaves 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.400
 45 it is provided that the thumb machine 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.130
 only once a day on broad 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.340
 large volume 10 load breakfast lunch 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.640
 dinner and after dinner we had that 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.340
 once-a-day benefit costs 9 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.880
 not enough comes out 40 packs 40 multiply 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.660
 150 goes to the expense for the year 6 thousand 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:26.519
 rubles and now I will tell you how much it costs 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:31.620
 here is this bag here is this bag 25 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:34.819
 kilogram average price of it from 420 to 500 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.370
 rubles and enough tone 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.590
 more than one year because the same typewriter 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.950
 this is the second year the truth is the first bag we have 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.870
 was 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.189
 20 kilogram production of Israel 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.709
 Israeli production she had enough 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:51.349
 Exactly for a year 20 kilograms is 25 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.560
 kilogram is still midnight to they sprout 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:57.590
 half a year has passed even help to me 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.409
 it seems even more than will be 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.639
 year and here's how to calculate the difference 500 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.930
 rubles or 6 thousand and you know a hundred 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:10.189
 percent what are you 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.349
 c5 pure sodium chlorine and not play with 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.629
 packs of salt though up with packs of salt too 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.880
 It throws into small it very quickly 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.430
 these granules dissolve they last longer 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.759
 thereby dissolving copper than i am not 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.370
 dissolves the longer it serves 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.800
 all the powder is now washed onto the chain 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.789
 goes this is the salt of our usual which we 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.979
 adding cookery in mind she 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:36.740
 dissolve quickly one cycle will help and 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:40.150
 she will wash it all and you will have to again 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.440
 pour all the same will come fullness 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.610
 so I suggest you buy here 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.889
 such salt in bags and you will be calmer 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:54.009
 for your machine will not worry and 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:57.020
 same time will save me seems 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:02.659
 5,500 rubles in savings a year is pretty 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:06.789
 even a lot if anyone is interested in her 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:09.380
 write questions, I will answer all bye 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.690
 subscribe like like that 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.560
 I need to shoot more then write 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.560
