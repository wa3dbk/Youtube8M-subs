gonna<00:01:39.180> put<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:40.079> kind<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
gonna put this as kind of so this is a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.440 
gonna put this as kind of so this is a
horizontal<00:01:42.329> view<00:01:43.640> let's<00:01:44.640> draw<00:01:44.939> stuff<00:01:45.240> real

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
horizontal view let's draw stuff real

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.609 
horizontal view let's draw stuff real
easy<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.869> don't<00:01:46.079> want<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> make<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.500> too

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
easy I don't want to make it too

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.350 
easy I don't want to make it too
difficult<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:50.000> draw<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> line

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
difficult for you and I draw a line

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.999 
difficult for you and I draw a line
across<00:01:51.750> there<00:01:52.079> maybe<00:01:52.380> another<00:01:52.530> line

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
across there maybe another line

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.499 
across there maybe another line
underneath<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:55.280> then<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.880> want<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> draw<00:01:57.329> these

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
underneath it then we want to draw these

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.639 
underneath it then we want to draw these
arches<00:01:58.229> all<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.250> way<00:01:59.399> along<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.869> we're<00:02:01.500> going

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
arches all the way along and we're going

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.649 
arches all the way along and we're going
to<00:02:01.710> want<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> bit<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.000> 3d<00:02:03.710> ness<00:02:04.710> here

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
to want to get a bit of 3d ness here

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.449 
to want to get a bit of 3d ness here
down<00:02:06.659> kind<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.619> middle<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.190> then

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
down kind of to the middle and then

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.449 
down kind of to the middle and then
we're<00:02:08.670> going<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.879> want<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.239> go<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.440> end

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
we're going to want to go to that end

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.830 
we're going to want to go to that end
so<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:11.849> kind<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.090> get<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.269> feeling<00:02:12.689> for<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
so we kind of get a feeling for the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.740 
so we kind of get a feeling for the
thickness<00:02:13.409> of<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:14.060> wall<00:02:15.060> but<00:02:15.269> that<00:02:15.420> will<00:02:15.569> kind

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
thickness of the wall but that will kind

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.530 
thickness of the wall but that will kind
of<00:02:15.840> fade<00:02:16.079> out<00:02:16.109> by<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> time<00:02:16.739> we<00:02:16.799> get<00:02:17.040> there<00:02:17.540> and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
of fade out by the time we get there and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.920 
of fade out by the time we get there and
then<00:02:18.959> I'm<00:02:19.650> going<00:02:19.859> to<00:02:19.980> put<00:02:20.189> these<00:02:20.840> kind<00:02:21.840> of

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
then I'm going to put these kind of

it's a shading will come down there you

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.650 
it's a shading will come down there you
will<00:05:56.110> get<00:05:56.259> a<00:05:56.289> bit<00:05:56.500> of<00:05:57.330> shading<00:05:58.330> in<00:05:58.630> there<00:05:59.340> and

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
will get a bit of shading in there and

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.939 
will get a bit of shading in there and
then<00:06:01.660> the<00:06:03.539> dome<00:06:04.539> will<00:06:04.870> get<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.050> bit<00:06:05.289> of<00:06:05.409> shading

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
then the dome will get a bit of shading

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:10.890 
then the dome will get a bit of shading
just<00:06:05.979> on<00:06:06.400> that<00:06:06.759> side<00:06:07.440> they<00:06:09.479> maybe<00:06:10.479> you'll<00:06:10.690> see

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
just on that side they maybe you'll see

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.059 
just on that side they maybe you'll see
some<00:06:11.080> trees<00:06:11.440> and<00:06:11.500> things<00:06:12.069> and<00:06:12.400> there<00:06:13.440> or<00:06:14.440> you

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:15.069 
some trees and things and there or you

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:17.399 
some trees and things and there or you
can<00:06:15.190> pretend<00:06:15.520> that<00:06:15.610> there's<00:06:15.849> are<00:06:16.030> people<00:06:16.479> you

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:17.409 
can pretend that there's are people you

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:20.999 
can pretend that there's are people you
might<00:06:17.590> have<00:06:17.770> some<00:06:17.979> kind<00:06:18.190> of<00:06:18.960> pattern<00:06:20.009> thing

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 
might have some kind of pattern thing

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.010 
might have some kind of pattern thing
going<00:06:21.340> on<00:06:21.490> in<00:06:21.639> there<00:06:21.849> as<00:06:22.000> well<00:06:22.270> just<00:06:22.539> add<00:06:22.990> a

going on in there as well just add a

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.140 
going on in there as well just add a
little<00:06:23.199> bit<00:06:23.470> more<00:06:23.500> pattern<00:06:24.099> it's<00:06:24.970> like<00:06:25.120> a

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
little bit more pattern it's like a

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.719 
little bit more pattern it's like a
little<00:06:25.419> triangle<00:06:25.870> e<00:06:26.050> shape<00:06:26.319> there<00:06:26.620> and<00:06:27.580> there

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
little triangle e shape there and there
