00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.529 
handles anodized green and bronze you
can<00:00:56.659> see<00:00:56.920> it<00:00:57.920> kind<00:00:58.100> of<00:00:58.190> has<00:00:58.370> bronze<00:00:58.729> notes<00:00:59.239> in

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
can see it kind of has bronze notes in

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.680 
can see it kind of has bronze notes in
the<00:00:59.749> green<00:00:59.989> there<00:01:00.289> I<00:01:00.499> think<00:01:01.460> what<00:01:01.579> he<00:01:01.670> does<00:01:01.850> is

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
the green there I think what he does is

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.200 
the green there I think what he does is
he<00:01:02.749> analyzes<00:01:03.319> it<00:01:03.530> green<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.489> then<00:01:04.610> tumbles<00:01:05.059> it

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
he analyzes it green and then tumbles it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.450 
he analyzes it green and then tumbles it
and<00:01:05.390> then<00:01:05.720> anodized<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:06.350> again<00:01:06.560> bronze<00:01:06.920> the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
and then anodized it again bronze the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.460 
and then anodized it again bronze the
green<00:01:07.670> is<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.820> higher<00:01:08.060> voltage<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:08.720> that<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.229> it

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
green is a higher voltage so that so it

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.880 
green is a higher voltage so that so it
doesn't<00:01:10.130> get<00:01:10.250> covered<00:01:10.969> up<00:01:11.060> by<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.560> bronze<00:01:12.560> but

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
doesn't get covered up by the bronze but

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.010 
doesn't get covered up by the bronze but
the<00:01:13.009> exposed<00:01:13.460> metal<00:01:14.000> after<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:14.600> tumbling

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
the exposed metal after the tumbling

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.139 
the exposed metal after the tumbling
does<00:01:15.290> it<00:01:15.860> has<00:01:16.009> a<00:01:16.040> carbon<00:01:16.369> fiber<00:01:16.610> backspacer

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
does it has a carbon fiber backspacer

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.150 

solid<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.840> grinds<00:02:18.290> on<00:02:18.349> this<00:02:18.530> blade<00:02:18.830> let<00:02:19.069> me

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
solid the grinds on this blade let me

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.650 
solid the grinds on this blade let me
see<00:02:19.310> if<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.459> can<00:02:19.610> pull<00:02:19.760> this<00:02:19.910> blade<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.330> and

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
see if I can pull this blade in and

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.479 
see if I can pull this blade in and
you're<00:02:20.959> closer<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.319> focus<00:02:21.860> looks<00:02:22.250> like<00:02:22.400> that's

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
you're closer to focus looks like that's

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.640 
you're closer to focus looks like that's
about<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.819> can<00:02:23.090> do<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:24.080> grinds<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.500> ever

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
about I can do the grinds that ever

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.860 
about I can do the grinds that ever
really<00:02:24.800> incredible<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.760> have<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:25.940> match<00:02:26.180> your

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
really incredible you have to match your
