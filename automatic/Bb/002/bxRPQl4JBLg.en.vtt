00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Our subject is now handling let's 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.839
 learn a different technique where 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.590
 Mare presence not only reassures the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:15.900
 another as well as there basic emotions 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:19.320
 how to head the Greek used to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.539
 deworming now has another function 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.769
 in this work the presence of the mother is 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.000
 essential for reassuring the other 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.390
 You see that this is a point that never was 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.149
 isolate has been dosed but was caused without 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.340
 put the salt before putting the boÃ§al 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.980
 the port needs to get used to the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.110
 presence of the tamer marcelo cimarron 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.210
 every time it's a rope it's a 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.879
 monster he freaks out 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.620
 so I'll try to lay my hand on him and 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.770
 of security for him 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.590
 with the quietest point comes the time of 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.010
 look for home important be firm but 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.829
 to avoid sudden movements is indicated 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 use a rope like this thin and light 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.920
 not to hurt the colt the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.110
 first notions of how to head should 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.970
 be given to the mother 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.970
 I'll pass the rope around the ego's neck . 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.439
 This is the training halter. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.759
 wake up should be loose for not 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.030
 hurt mother 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.080
 then passed through the ribs and 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.090
 finally on the neck of the port 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.960
 result the two leaving brett with the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.960
 greater tranquility 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.640
 naturally the picture tends to follow the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 and this is the goal of the work that 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.590
 the fact of being in the boat and being pulled 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.590
 by a halter does not cause strangeness 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.259
 now the work can be done in one 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.960
 fenced site 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.250
 The ideal is to keep the mother close and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.579
 to gradually approach the other 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.409
 Let it all away I do not stay the time 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.320
 It's on his side, that'll be soon. 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.350
 It's going to be something normal for him, I do not 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.729
 I'm thinking of opening up to the stride. 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.310
 At first I 'm already trying to move forward. 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.030
 although it is not hurting and so 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.890
 none 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.520
 Let me come, I'll pass the rope through 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.480
 him several times at the moment 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.890
 Here I run the rope over him. 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.129
 I step on his rump 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.010
 now the goal is to teach the head 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.970
 it is important to have a good halter 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.170
 accomplished 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.810
 the work should be done laterally 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.340
 A little bit, I'm strumming. 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.819
 This is very important happened here. 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.090
 He tried to quit and I could not 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.400
 here I stop I stop and easy to turn 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.220
 alone when he is looking for the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.099
 Slack rope left calm 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.739
 properly subject to the sides now 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.580
 the goal is that the other way is 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.670
 front 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.830
 wake up barely stretched and he already looked for 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.959
 Fire there I walk back and easy. 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.110
 due to my direction one step 2 and 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.110
 I phoned, I repeat to both there how many 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.120
 times is necessary and I am increasing my 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.459
 last training contention forward or 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.680
 in my opposite direction and obeying the 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.170
 tamer commands comes the time of 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.420
 working in a wider location 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.360
 exercises follow the same 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.290
 the lateral displacement and then to 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.530
 forward 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.870
 and the other about 40 minutes ago 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.260
 had no idea what it was 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.709
 halter shows good will to follow 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.709
 the tamer
