a double boiler or sickness in the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.220 
a double boiler or sickness in the
microwave<00:02:52.340> until<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.790> melts<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.569> then<00:02:54.110> when

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
microwave until it melts and then when

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.870 
microwave until it melts and then when
it's<00:02:54.349> all<00:02:54.470> completely<00:02:54.950> melted<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.430> just<00:02:55.640> stir

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
it's all completely melted you just stir

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.509 
it's all completely melted you just stir
it<00:02:55.910> up<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.440> just<00:02:57.470> pour<00:02:57.829> into<00:02:58.010> your<00:02:58.250> little

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
it up and you just pour into your little

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.150 
it up and you just pour into your little
containers<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.410> about<00:03:00.650> one<00:03:00.980> ounce

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
containers so this is about one ounce

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.030 
containers so this is about one ounce
and<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.360> could<00:03:02.540> probably<00:03:02.690> get<00:03:03.110> about<00:03:03.440> four

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
and I could probably get about four

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.059 
and I could probably get about four
these<00:03:04.280> containers<00:03:05.090> with<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:05.720> recipe<00:03:06.200> this

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
these containers with that recipe this

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.460 
these containers with that recipe this
by<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.340> way<00:03:07.519> has<00:03:08.000> lasted<00:03:08.510> me<00:03:08.660> for<00:03:08.930> probably<00:03:09.290> at

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
by the way has lasted me for probably at

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.640 
by the way has lasted me for probably at
least<00:03:09.790> two<00:03:10.790> months<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.569> takes<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:12.140> little

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
least two months so it takes a little

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.949 
least two months so it takes a little
bit<00:03:12.890> goes<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.069> long<00:03:13.310> way<00:03:13.549> I<00:03:13.879> don't<00:03:14.510> use<00:03:14.629> it<00:03:14.690> every

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
bit goes a long way I don't use it every

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.360 
bit goes a long way I don't use it every
single<00:03:15.110> day<00:03:15.349> because<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.620> don't<00:03:15.799> need<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.040> that

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
single day because I don't need it that

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.880 
single day because I don't need it that
badly<00:03:16.610> but<00:03:17.030> if<00:03:17.840> you<00:03:17.930> have<00:03:18.019> really<00:03:18.230> dry<00:03:18.440> skin<00:03:18.560> on

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.160 
badly but if you have really dry skin on
your<00:03:19.010> face<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.370> probably<00:03:19.879> need<00:03:20.090> more<00:03:20.170> go

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
through it faster it also makes a great
