 We will give due watch to clarity, he did not 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:03.840

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.550
 Kiev 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.550
 now a little bit 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.530
 we continue our experiment on 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.510

 two monaco alber ii to say exactly 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.740
 find it difficult 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.740
 but see from ahead 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.760
 decrees owned 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.760

 fire in mp screen turnout candle bright subscriptions 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.080

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080
 got attached minivan 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.609
 so keep moving 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.609
 preset tempo 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.839
 Nato members hours 8 minutes received 380 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.839

 Mozhayskoe highway 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:42.159
 I understand that most of the way already 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.159
 passed 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.669

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:51.719
 clinker 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.879
 I find it difficult but 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.879
 judging by the instrument readings 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.189
 if you see something 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.189
 I estimate 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.469
 car in a village somewhere around six families 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:14.429
 maybe I'm wrong 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.219
 nevertheless we continue 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.219
 what movement 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.759
 he still holds on confidently 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.789
 I repeat what is the use of the accident 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.959
 like this is quite possible 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.389
