and so whenever they get brown on this
side<00:02:18.700> we're<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:19.850> going<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.120> flip<00:02:20.450> them<00:02:20.720> over

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.339 

this<00:02:32.970> stuff<00:02:33.239> here<00:02:33.510> we're<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:33.720> going<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.049> kind

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
this stuff here we're just going to kind

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:49.190 
this stuff here we're just going to kind
of<00:02:34.440> break<00:02:34.739> that<00:02:34.799> off<00:02:35.900> flip<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.080> over

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.600 

so<00:02:50.200> whatever<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.590> side<00:02:50.950> gets<00:02:51.189> browned<00:02:51.459> a

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
so whatever that side gets browned a

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.679 
so whatever that side gets browned a
little<00:02:51.819> bit<00:02:51.970> what<00:02:52.120> we're<00:02:52.209> going<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:52.360> do<00:02:52.540> is

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
little bit what we're going to do is

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.869 
little bit what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:52.870> going<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.079> start<00:02:53.290> making<00:02:53.500> sure<00:02:53.879> we're

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
we're going to start making sure we're

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.500
