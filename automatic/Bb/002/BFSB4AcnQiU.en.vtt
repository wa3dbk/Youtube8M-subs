00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 
evening it because of the skill level on

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:37.110 
evening it because of the skill level on
a<00:07:11.500> professional<00:07:11.680> skill<00:07:34.800> the<00:07:35.800> key<00:07:36.010> to<00:07:36.250> thinking

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 
a professional skill the key to thinking

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:49.020 
a professional skill the key to thinking
positive<00:07:37.960> is<00:07:38.080> actually<00:07:38.440> not<00:07:38.590> thinking<00:07:39.010> at<00:07:39.099> all

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.030 

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:54.030 

that's<00:07:49.600> just<00:07:49.810> something<00:07:52.140> you<00:07:53.140> start<00:07:53.410> getting

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.040 
that's just something you start getting

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.570 
that's just something you start getting
scared

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:54.580 
scared

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.360 
scared
it's<00:07:54.790> called<00:07:55.560> theorization<00:07:56.560> by<00:07:56.860> analyzation

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:57.370 
it's called theorization by analyzation

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.880 
it's called theorization by analyzation
so<00:07:57.730> I<00:07:57.790> do<00:07:58.480> everything<00:07:58.810> but<00:07:59.260> think<00:07:59.560> about<00:07:59.770> the

00:07:59.880 --> 00:07:59.890 
so I do everything but think about the

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.130 
so I do everything but think about the
fight
