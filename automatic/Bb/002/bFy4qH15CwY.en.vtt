then it does have the nice bubble
blocking<00:02:19.050> laces<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.680> whenever<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.250> tighten

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
blocking laces so whenever you tighten

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.900 
blocking laces so whenever you tighten
them<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.080> have<00:02:22.709> trouble<00:02:22.920> tying<00:02:23.340> shoes<00:02:23.700> I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
them and you have trouble tying shoes I

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.850 
them and you have trouble tying shoes I
guess<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:25.170> laces<00:02:26.010> actually<00:02:26.370> lock<00:02:26.580> together

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
guess the laces actually lock together

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.340 
guess the laces actually lock together
