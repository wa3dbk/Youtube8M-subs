00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
line they don't know the danger this is

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.469 
line they don't know the danger this is
astounding<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.840> how<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.110> fight<00:01:52.410> it<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.800> God

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
astounding so how do we fight it you God

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.770 
astounding so how do we fight it you God
and<00:01:54.479> they<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.660> is<00:01:54.900> like<00:01:55.410> any<00:01:55.890> intelligence<00:01:56.780> it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
and they I is like any intelligence it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.670 
and they I is like any intelligence it
has<00:01:58.020> needs<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.770> real<00:01:58.979> will<00:01:59.220> died<00:02:00.440> it'll<00:02:01.440> start

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
has needs the real will died it'll start

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.320 
has needs the real will died it'll start
to<00:02:01.740> evolve<00:02:03.380> where's<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.619> machine<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:06.180> them

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
to evolve where's the machine to them

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.859 
to evolve where's the machine to them
cause

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.360 

perhaps<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.739> entire<00:02:10.039> world<00:02:12.220> where<00:02:13.220> are<00:02:13.280> you

perhaps the entire world where are you

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.140 
perhaps the entire world where are you
going

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150

I<00:02:29.500> think<00:02:30.500> if<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.770> hadn't<00:02:31.130> just<00:02:31.340> seen<00:02:31.580> her

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
I think if I hadn't just seen her

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.610 
I think if I hadn't just seen her
another<00:02:32.570> movie<00:02:32.960> about<00:02:33.110> artificial

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
another movie about artificial

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.410 
another movie about artificial

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
intelligence I would be more excited

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.150 
intelligence I would be more excited
about<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:35.660> but<00:02:36.500> it's<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:36.740> weird<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.130> know

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
about this but it's this weird you know

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.590 
about this but it's this weird you know
how<00:02:37.340> Hollywood<00:02:37.730> always<00:02:37.910> makes<00:02:38.120> movies<00:02:38.480> about

is<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:15.050> seems<00:03:15.260> very<00:03:15.410> pedestrian<00:03:16.310> wally

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970

uh<00:03:18.710> you<00:03:19.130> know<00:03:19.330> backing<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.480> support<00:03:20.510> but<00:03:21.260> it

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
uh you know backing and support but it

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.410 
uh you know backing and support but it
clearly<00:03:21.590> doesn't<00:03:21.830> have<00:03:22.070> his<00:03:22.220> budgets<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:22.940> I

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
clearly doesn't have his budgets and I

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.850 
clearly doesn't have his budgets and I
think<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.840> don't<00:03:23.960> know<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:24.620> kind

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
think that I don't know that this kind

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.130 
think that I don't know that this kind
of<00:03:25.010> grand<00:03:25.370> scheme<00:03:25.820> this<00:03:26.060> grand<00:03:26.330> idea<00:03:26.450> can

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
of grand scheme this grand idea can

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.470 
of grand scheme this grand idea can
really<00:03:27.350> be<00:03:27.470> done<00:03:27.500> at<00:03:27.830> this<00:03:27.950> level<00:03:28.220> in<00:03:29.060> terms<00:03:29.270> of

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
really be done at this level in terms of

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.630 
really be done at this level in terms of
you<00:03:29.720> know<00:03:29.750> budgetary<00:03:30.440> restraints<00:03:31.040> because<00:03:31.370> it

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
you know budgetary restraints because it

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.850 
you know budgetary restraints because it
just<00:03:31.970> seems<00:03:32.239> small<00:03:32.630> like<00:03:32.870> I<00:03:32.959> said<00:03:33.170> pedestrian

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
just seems small like I said pedestrian

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.740 
just seems small like I said pedestrian
it<00:03:33.950> seems<00:03:34.160> like<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.340> very<00:03:34.430> be<00:03:35.150> level<00:03:35.510> picture

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
it seems like a very be level picture

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.770 
it seems like a very be level picture
and<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:36.739> think<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.040> really<00:03:37.130> lock<00:03:38.090> people<00:03:38.390> in<00:03:38.600> and

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
and I think to really lock people in and

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.050 
and I think to really lock people in and
make<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.080> seem<00:03:39.410> like<00:03:39.560> just<00:03:39.800> a<00:03:39.920> b-level<00:03:40.489> sci-fi

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
make it seem like just a b-level sci-fi

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.699 
make it seem like just a b-level sci-fi
film<00:03:41.360> to<00:03:41.510> get<00:03:41.630> that<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.900> level<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:42.500> want

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
film to get that a level that you want

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.990 
film to get that a level that you want
to<00:03:42.770> get<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.070> kind<00:03:43.220> of<00:03:43.310> gross<00:03:43.520> that<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.820> need

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
to get the kind of gross that you need

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.750 
to get the kind of gross that you need
to<00:03:44.150> pay<00:03:44.480> for<00:03:44.720> Johnny<00:03:44.900> Depp's<00:03:45.140> salary<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:46.550> need

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
to pay for Johnny Depp's salary you need

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.340 
to pay for Johnny Depp's salary you need
to<00:03:46.910> make<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.239> seem<00:03:47.390> more<00:03:47.450> epic<00:03:47.900> which<00:03:48.020> I<00:03:48.170> don't

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
to make it seem more epic which I don't

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.340 
to make it seem more epic which I don't

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
this we'll see how it turns out maybe

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.060 
this we'll see how it turns out maybe

he<00:04:37.490> can't<00:04:37.669> quite<00:04:37.850> match<00:04:38.030> up<00:04:38.060> as<00:04:38.360> well<00:04:38.750> it's

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
he can't quite match up as well it's

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.480 
he can't quite match up as well it's
easy<00:04:39.590> to<00:04:39.770> shoot<00:04:39.950> for<00:04:40.190> an<00:04:40.280> all

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
easy to shoot for an all

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.510 
easy to shoot for an all
but<00:04:40.849> maybe<00:04:41.030> not<00:04:41.210> so<00:04:41.419> easy<00:04:41.599> to<00:04:41.900> be<00:04:42.289> Nolan<00:04:42.560> write

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520
