much<00:02:31.760> better<00:02:31.970> than<00:02:32.210> this<00:02:32.390> case<00:02:32.690> this<00:02:32.870> case<00:02:33.110> was

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
much better than this case this case was

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.040 
much better than this case this case was
99<00:02:33.740> cent<00:02:34.070> off<00:02:34.220> budget<00:02:34.640> gadgets<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.570> just

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
99 cent off budget gadgets so I just

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.420 
99 cent off budget gadgets so I just
have<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.320> there<00:02:36.470> for<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.740> texture<00:02:37.280> difference

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
have it there for the texture difference

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.600 
have it there for the texture difference
because<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.650> pro<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.190> we'll<00:02:40.340> get<00:02:40.520> to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
because that is a pro and we'll get to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.250 
because that is a pro and we'll get to
that<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.910> little<00:02:40.940> bit<00:02:41.210> but<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.960> con<00:02:42.230> is

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
that in a little bit but the con is

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.170 
that in a little bit but the con is
you'll<00:02:42.890> notice<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.250> even<00:02:43.520> if<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.820> pinch<00:02:44.090> it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
you'll notice that even if you pinch it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.280 
you'll notice that even if you pinch it
a<00:02:44.300> tiny<00:02:44.570> bit<00:02:44.900> you'll<00:02:45.710> notice<00:02:46.100> that<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:47.290> thing

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
a tiny bit you'll notice that the thing

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.170 
a tiny bit you'll notice that the thing
that<00:02:48.320> covers<00:02:48.710> the<00:02:48.830> bezel<00:02:49.250> or<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:49.670> home<00:02:49.910> button

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
that covers the bezel or the home button

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.900 
that covers the bezel or the home button
it<00:02:50.420> does<00:02:50.600> just<00:02:50.840> go<00:02:51.260> up<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.800> even<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.490> don't

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
it does just go up and even you don't

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.630 
it does just go up and even you don't
pinch<00:02:53.270> it<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.600> still<00:02:53.960> can<00:02:54.110> see<00:02:54.560> in<00:02:54.830> between

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
pinch it you still can see in between

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.940 
pinch it you still can see in between
there<00:02:55.820> right<00:02:56.030> there<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.200> then<00:02:57.380> you<00:02:57.830> know

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
there right there and so then you know

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.950 
there right there and so then you know
dust<00:02:58.370> can<00:02:58.580> get<00:02:58.730> in<00:02:58.880> there<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.840> know

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
dust can get in there and you know

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.260 
dust can get in there and you know
that's<00:03:00.140> not<00:03:00.290> good<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.830> also<00:03:01.400> does<00:03:01.760> not<00:03:01.910> cover

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
that's not good and also does not cover

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.120 
that's not good and also does not cover
all<00:03:02.540> this<00:03:02.720> chrome<00:03:03.110> right<00:03:03.320> here<00:03:03.620> i<00:03:03.650> want<00:03:04.010> that

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
all this chrome right here i want that

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.890 
all this chrome right here i want that
covered<00:03:04.700> like<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:06.380> rink<00:03:06.680> case<00:03:07.100> that<00:03:07.580> i<00:03:07.610> have

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
covered like the rink case that i have

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.110 
covered like the rink case that i have
it<00:03:08.900> does<00:03:09.110> cover<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.620> bottom<00:03:09.830> bezel<00:03:10.430> which<00:03:10.970> is

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
it does cover the bottom bezel which is

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.510 
it does cover the bottom bezel which is
really<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.480> great<00:03:11.570> add-on<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.710> those<00:03:12.920> cases

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
really a great add-on to those cases

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.160 
really a great add-on to those cases
because<00:03:13.910> dust<00:03:14.240> can<00:03:14.450> get<00:03:14.630> in<00:03:14.750> there<00:03:14.990> and

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
because dust can get in there and

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.870 
because dust can get in there and
scratch<00:03:15.620> up<00:03:15.830> your<00:03:15.860> device<00:03:16.130> i<00:03:16.870> do<00:03:17.870> like<00:03:18.260> how<00:03:18.500> the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
scratch up your device i do like how the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.880 
scratch up your device i do like how the
buttons<00:03:19.880> fire<00:03:20.180> at<00:03:20.450> all<00:03:20.660> every<00:03:21.170> time<00:03:21.440> you<00:03:21.650> press

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
buttons fire at all every time you press

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.020 
buttons fire at all every time you press
some<00:03:22.190> volume<00:03:22.970> as<00:03:23.330> well<00:03:23.390> um<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:25.520> camera<00:03:25.880> cut

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
some volume as well um the camera cut

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.580 
some volume as well um the camera cut
out<00:03:26.150> there's<00:03:26.360> one<00:03:26.480> giant<00:03:26.960> camera<00:03:27.200> cut<00:03:27.470> out

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
out there's one giant camera cut out

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.560 
out there's one giant camera cut out
right<00:03:27.800> there<00:03:28.220> but<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:28.880> do<00:03:28.970> not<00:03:29.240> like<00:03:29.420> the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
right there but I do not like the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.590 
right there but I do not like the
backing<00:03:30.170> as<00:03:30.410> in<00:03:30.860> that<00:03:31.400> you'll<00:03:31.580> collect<00:03:32.090> so

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
backing as in that you'll collect so

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.050 
backing as in that you'll collect so
much<00:03:32.780> dust<00:03:33.110> you<00:03:33.320> can<00:03:33.470> see<00:03:33.770> that<00:03:33.800> it<00:03:34.370> is<00:03:34.580> a<00:03:34.610> dust

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
much dust you can see that it is a dust

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.550 
much dust you can see that it is a dust
and<00:03:35.330> lint<00:03:35.660> magnet<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.970> collects<00:03:38.690> everything

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
and lint magnet it collects everything

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.550 
and lint magnet it collects everything
but<00:03:40.490> the<00:03:40.580> probe<00:03:40.910> this<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.420> you<00:03:41.600> can<00:03:41.630> wash<00:03:42.290> it

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
but the probe this is you can wash it

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.740
