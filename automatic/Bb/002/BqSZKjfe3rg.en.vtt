 your bike is the second mode 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.840
 the laser flickering is very interesting it 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.660
 have seen save power and 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:43.099

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:16.049

 seatpost 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.130

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.610
 to send 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.040

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.480
 cost if you include a kilo for 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.480
