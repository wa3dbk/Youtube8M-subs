I've never had the orange cake

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:39.409 
I honestly to be completely honest I

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.680 
I honestly to be completely honest I
have<00:00:39.829> seen<00:00:40.100> this<00:00:40.249> box<00:00:40.489> before<00:00:40.819> and<00:00:41.389> walked

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
have seen this box before and walked

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.869 
have seen this box before and walked
past<00:00:42.019> it<00:00:42.229> because<00:00:42.350> I<00:00:42.620> thought<00:00:42.859> it<00:00:42.920> was<00:00:43.729> the

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
past it because I thought it was the

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.239 
past it because I thought it was the
same<00:00:44.120> cake<00:00:44.449> and<00:00:44.749> it<00:00:44.870> was<00:00:45.019> just<00:00:45.229> colored<00:00:45.800> orange

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:46.249 
same cake and it was just colored orange

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.469 
same cake and it was just colored orange
I<00:00:46.429> didn't<00:00:46.789> know<00:00:46.940> it<00:00:47.089> had<00:00:47.210> an<00:00:47.329> orange<00:00:47.690> flavor<00:00:48.109> so

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
I didn't know it had an orange flavor so

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.289 
I didn't know it had an orange flavor so
I<00:00:50.649> figured<00:00:51.649> I've<00:00:51.920> not<00:00:52.249> tried<00:00:52.549> the<00:00:52.789> orange<00:00:53.089> cake

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
I figured I've not tried the orange cake

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.930 
I figured I've not tried the orange cake
and<00:00:53.600> if<00:00:53.690> it's<00:00:53.839> that<00:00:53.959> good<00:00:54.409> then<00:00:55.280> if<00:00:55.519> it's<00:00:55.699> your

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
and if it's that good then if it's your

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.199 
and if it's that good then if it's your
favorite<00:00:56.269> then<00:00:56.929> I'm<00:00:57.319> willing<00:00:57.709> to<00:00:57.739> try<00:00:58.100> it<00:00:58.209> it

00:00:59.199 --> 00:00:59.209 
favorite then I'm willing to try it it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.229

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
was only 250 at Walmart which I don't

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.960 
was only 250 at Walmart which I don't
think<00:01:02.449> is<00:01:02.719> that<00:01:02.749> bad<00:01:03.199> there<00:01:03.920> are<00:01:04.190> eight<00:01:04.519> cakes

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
think is that bad there are eight cakes

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.900 
think is that bad there are eight cakes
so<00:01:05.570> if<00:01:05.900> you<00:01:06.049> eat<00:01:06.260> one<00:01:06.680> at<00:01:06.830> a<00:01:06.950> time<00:01:07.250> that's<00:01:07.610> eight

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
so if you eat one at a time that's eight

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:15.640 
so if you eat one at a time that's eight
desserts<00:01:09.190> each<00:01:10.190> cake<00:01:10.670> is<00:01:11.350> 180<00:01:12.350> calories<00:01:14.650> here

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
desserts each cake is 180 calories here

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:24.490 
desserts each cake is 180 calories here
individually<00:01:16.130> wrapped<00:01:21.040> they're<00:01:22.040> 1/8<00:01:23.500> and

individually wrapped they're 1/8 and

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.950 
individually wrapped they're 1/8 and

dense and firm I don't necessarily like

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.820 
dense and firm I don't necessarily like
that<00:02:42.560> as<00:02:42.680> much<00:02:42.890> as<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.840> regular<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.440> true

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830

cupcake<00:02:46.310> but<00:02:46.940> they're<00:02:47.480> good<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:48.140> one<00:02:48.230> does

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
cupcake but they're good that one does

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.630 
cupcake but they're good that one does
have<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.620> better<00:02:48.799> flavor<00:02:49.130> as<00:02:49.280> far<00:02:49.459> as<00:02:49.549> the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
have a better flavor as far as the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.030 
have a better flavor as far as the

about<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:54.019> don't<00:02:54.079> know<00:02:54.290> why<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.590> orange

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
about it and I don't know why the orange

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.699 
about it and I don't know why the orange
would<00:02:55.489> make<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.760> difference<00:02:56.500> but<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:59.500> icing<00:03:00.500> on

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
would make a difference but the icing on

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.170 
would make a difference but the icing on
the<00:03:00.799> top<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.489> frosting<00:03:02.060> seems<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.140> have<00:03:03.380> a

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
the top the frosting seems to have a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.199 
the top the frosting seems to have a
sweeter<00:03:05.180> take<00:03:05.660> a<00:03:05.930> flavor<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.829> more<00:03:07.209> sugary

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
sweeter take a flavor a more sugary

sweeter take a flavor a more sugary
flavor<00:03:09.790> that<00:03:10.790> orange<00:03:11.299> just<00:03:11.600> really<00:03:11.930> does

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
flavor that orange just really does

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.289 
flavor that orange just really does
something<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.799> it<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.489> also<00:03:13.790> like<00:03:14.269> that

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.660 
something to it and I also like that
it's<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.870> firm<00:03:16.420> layer<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:18.620> frosting<00:03:19.250> some<00:03:19.549> of

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
have noticed that they weren't different

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.289

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
that they were a different flavor I just

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.760 
that they were a different flavor I just
thought<00:04:21.450> they<00:04:21.630> were<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.780> different<00:04:21.989> color<00:04:22.350> well

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
thought they were a different color well

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.140 
thought they were a different color well
the<00:04:22.919> only<00:04:23.280> thing<00:04:23.370> that's<00:04:23.639> different<00:04:23.669> flavors

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
the only thing that's different flavors

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.000 
the only thing that's different flavors
is<00:04:24.270> frosting<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.840> cake<00:04:24.870> itself<00:04:25.380> is<00:04:25.530> exact

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
is frosting the cake itself is exact

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.890 
is frosting the cake itself is exact
same<00:04:26.220> well<00:04:26.639> I<00:04:26.669> think<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.389> makes<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:27.870> huge

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
same well I think that makes a huge

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.680 
same well I think that makes a huge
difference<00:04:28.260> you<00:04:28.889> know<00:04:29.040> it<00:04:29.880> paints<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.510> whole

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
difference you know it paints the whole
