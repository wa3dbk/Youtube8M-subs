before I could get them to move freely
once<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.040> got<00:02:27.250> them<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.520> move<00:02:27.670> freely<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.240> didn't

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
once I got them to move freely I didn't

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.820 
once I got them to move freely I didn't
have<00:02:28.780> any<00:02:28.900> problems<00:02:29.230> removing<00:02:29.500> them<00:02:29.620> after

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
have any problems removing them after

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.470 
have any problems removing them after
that<00:02:29.980> there<00:02:30.880> was<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:31.090> hinge

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
that there was a hinge

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.930 
that there was a hinge
above<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.500> below<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.770> elbow<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.910> wrist

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
above and below the elbow the wrist

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.210 
above and below the elbow the wrist
itself<00:02:37.600> turns<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.489> fingers<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.750> thumb

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
itself turns and the fingers the thumb

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.729 
itself turns and the fingers the thumb
and<00:02:42.220> I'll<00:02:42.310> move<00:02:42.459> individually<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.150> each<00:02:43.269> other

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.430 

here<00:02:47.739> on<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.950> leg<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.840> ball<00:02:50.080> joint<00:02:50.380> here

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
here on the leg that a ball joint here

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.310 
here on the leg that a ball joint here
at<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.769> hip<00:02:51.120> hinge<00:02:52.120> joints<00:02:52.570> above<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.080> below

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
at the hip hinge joints above and below

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.410 
at the hip hinge joints above and below
the<00:02:53.440> knee<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:54.570> hinge<00:02:55.570> joint<00:02:55.870> on<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.110> ankle<00:02:57.420> and

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
the knee a hinge joint on the ankle and

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.240 
the knee a hinge joint on the ankle and
then<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.989> toes<00:02:59.230> move<00:02:59.500> independently<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.160> each

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
then the toes move independently of each

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.110 
then the toes move independently of each
other<00:03:00.370> as<00:03:00.550> well<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.080> very<00:03:05.260> center<00:03:06.120> you

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
other as well and the very center you

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.360 
other as well and the very center you
can<00:03:07.269> turn<00:03:07.480> just<00:03:07.840> below<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.170> chest<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:09.190> then

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
can turn just below the chest and then

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.550 
can turn just below the chest and then
forward<00:03:09.790> lean<00:03:10.180> back<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.989> range<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.290> motion

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
forward lean back that range of motion

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.720 
forward lean back that range of motion
is<00:03:11.620> fairly<00:03:11.980> limited<00:03:13.170> let's<00:03:14.170> see<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.440> air<00:03:14.730> it's

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
is fairly limited let's see the air it's

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.000 
is fairly limited let's see the air it's
about<00:03:15.910> your<00:03:16.209> full<00:03:16.390> range<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:16.690> motion<00:03:16.810> but<00:03:17.650> you

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
about your full range of motion but you

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.520 
about your full range of motion but you
can<00:03:18.160> turn<00:03:18.340> quite<00:03:18.610> a<00:03:18.670> ways<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:23.049> then<00:03:23.260> here<00:03:23.470> at

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
can turn quite a ways and then here at

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.970 
can turn quite a ways and then here at
the<00:03:23.560> legs<00:03:23.860> as<00:03:24.190> well<00:03:25.049> kind<00:03:26.049> of<00:03:26.140> hard<00:03:26.320> to<00:03:26.350> grip<00:03:26.799> it

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
the legs as well kind of hard to grip it

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.920 
the legs as well kind of hard to grip it
and<00:03:27.100> move<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.400> here<00:03:27.579> on<00:03:27.670> camera<00:03:27.910> but<00:03:28.660> there<00:03:28.810> is

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
and move it here on camera but there is

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.430 
and move it here on camera but there is
a<00:03:29.640> joint<00:03:30.640> right<00:03:30.760> here<00:03:30.820> in<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:32.049> middle<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.380> the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
a joint right here in the middle of the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:41.679 
a joint right here in the middle of the
quad<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:34.090> be<00:03:34.180> able<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.390> rotate<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.870> legs<00:03:35.049> some

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.729 

now<00:03:42.689> with<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.260> many<00:03:43.439> points<00:03:43.590> of

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
now with this many points of

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.890 
now with this many points of
articulation<00:03:44.060> these<00:03:45.060> figures<00:03:45.420> are<00:03:45.629> more

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
articulation these figures are more

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.069 
articulation these figures are more
suited<00:03:46.349> probably<00:03:46.709> towards<00:03:47.060> display<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.870> a

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
suited probably towards display and a

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.729 
suited probably towards display and a

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
collector than necessarily play Tom but

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.869 
collector than necessarily play Tom but
they<00:03:55.739> look<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:55.920> good<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.430> nobody's<00:03:56.819> gonna

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
they look so good that nobody's gonna

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.690 
they look so good that nobody's gonna
blame<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.329> if<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:57.620> can't<00:03:58.620> help<00:03:58.799> it<00:03:58.950> sit<00:03:59.519> down

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
blame you if you can't help it sit down

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.910 
blame you if you can't help it sit down
and<00:03:59.909> play<00:04:00.030> with<00:04:00.060> home<00:04:00.359> or<00:04:00.510> let<00:04:01.409> the<00:04:01.530> kids<00:04:01.709> have

I'm<00:04:42.120> not<00:04:42.240> sure<00:04:42.419> how<00:04:42.570> well<00:04:42.720> that<00:04:42.840> translates<00:04:43.460> on

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
I'm not sure how well that translates on

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.450 
I'm not sure how well that translates on
the<00:04:44.580> video<00:04:45.710> but<00:04:46.710> if<00:04:46.949> you<00:04:47.039> remember<00:04:47.340> the

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
the video but if you remember the

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.360 
the video but if you remember the
original<00:04:47.550> line<00:04:48.479> of<00:04:48.599> toys<00:04:48.750> from<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:48.990> 80s<00:04:49.370> the

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
original line of toys from the 80s the

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.469 
original line of toys from the 80s the
figures<00:04:50.669> had<00:04:52.010> varying<00:04:53.010> degrees<00:04:53.400> of<00:04:53.430> green<00:04:54.120> on

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
figures had varying degrees of green on

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.379 
figures had varying degrees of green on
them<00:04:56.930> you<00:04:57.930> can<00:04:58.080> see<00:04:58.260> here<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:59.389> also

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
them you can see here that that also

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:07.089 
them you can see here that that also
holds<00:05:00.930> true<00:05:00.960> it's<00:05:01.919> subtle<00:05:02.280> but<00:05:03.530> it<00:05:04.530> is<00:05:04.710> there

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099
