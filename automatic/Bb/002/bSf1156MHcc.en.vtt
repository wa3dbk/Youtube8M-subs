00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
another thing about this game you're

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.120 
another thing about this game you're
going<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.270> notice<00:01:29.499> even<00:01:30.499> considering<00:01:31.100> buying

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
going to notice even considering buying

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.389 
going to notice even considering buying
it<00:01:31.520> is<00:01:31.670> it's<00:01:31.819> expensive<00:01:32.210> it's<00:01:33.039> ten<00:01:34.039> dollars

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
it is it's expensive it's ten dollars

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.989 
it is it's expensive it's ten dollars
for<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:35.090> thousand<00:01:35.780> dsi<00:01:36.109> points<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:36.850> think<00:01:37.850> it's

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:37.999 
for a thousand dsi points I think it's

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:41.160 
for a thousand dsi points I think it's
definitely<00:01:38.210> worth<00:01:38.810> it

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.010 

it's<00:01:41.830> a<00:01:41.920> hard<00:01:42.159> game<00:01:42.369> our<00:01:43.360> learning<00:01:43.780> curve<00:01:43.990> but

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
it's a hard game our learning curve but

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.050 
it's a hard game our learning curve but
I<00:01:44.619> don't<00:01:45.040> think<00:01:45.130> that<00:01:45.250> should<00:01:45.400> ever<00:01:45.549> be<00:01:45.790> a

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
I don't think that should ever be a

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.210 
I don't think that should ever be a
reason<00:01:46.930> not<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.170> buy<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.350> game<00:01:47.619> it<00:01:47.799> just<00:01:47.830> takes<00:01:48.130> a

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
reason not to buy a game it just takes a

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.980 
reason not to buy a game it just takes a
little<00:01:48.310> while<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.700> get<00:01:48.820> used<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.210> but<00:01:49.780> I<00:01:49.840> mean

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
little while to get used to but I mean

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.480 
little while to get used to but I mean
you<00:01:50.080> can<00:01:50.200> see<00:01:50.380> levels<00:01:50.740> like<00:01:50.890> this<00:01:51.100> it's<00:01:51.399> just

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
you can see levels like this it's just

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.310 
you can see levels like this it's just
awesome<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:55.750> little<00:01:55.990> taste<00:01:56.200> of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
awesome so that's little taste of

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.889 
awesome so that's little taste of
thorium<00:01:56.649> Wars<00:01:56.950> I<00:01:57.220> would<00:01:57.820> recommend<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.450> hard

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899
