that you see all this cover is kind of

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.539 
that you see all this cover is kind of
the<00:01:16.290> main<00:01:16.470> justice<00:01:16.799> Lee<00:01:16.950> we'd<00:01:17.100> usually<00:01:17.280> been

the main justice Lee we'd usually been

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.249 
the main justice Lee we'd usually been
seeing<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.970> mean<00:01:18.090> Batman<00:01:18.689> Superman<00:01:18.930> Wonder

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
seeing I mean Batman Superman Wonder

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.560 
seeing I mean Batman Superman Wonder
Woman<00:01:19.560> Aquaman<00:01:20.100> cyborg<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.970> flash<00:01:21.210> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
Woman Aquaman cyborg and flash and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.350 
Woman Aquaman cyborg and flash and
possibly<00:01:22.470> Green<00:01:22.740> Lantern<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.280> powering<00:01:23.670> they

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
possibly Green Lantern or powering they

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.850 
possibly Green Lantern or powering they
kind<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.869> don't<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.320> who<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
kind of we don't really know who that is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.910 
kind of we don't really know who that is
my<00:01:26.549> guess<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.939> powering<00:01:27.390> because<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.200> don't

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
my guess is to powering because I don't

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.230 
my guess is to powering because I don't
know<00:01:28.950> why<00:01:29.159> Green<00:01:29.460> Lantern<00:01:29.759> would<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.970> involved

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
know why Green Lantern would be involved

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.850 
know why Green Lantern would be involved
in<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:31.049> now<00:01:31.079> Green<00:01:31.500> Lantern

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
in this because right now Green Lantern

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.010 
in this because right now Green Lantern
is<00:01:32.040> going<00:01:32.340> through<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.790> gods<00:01:33.119> head<00:01:33.450> story<00:01:33.810> arc

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
is going through the gods head story arc

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.080 
is going through the gods head story arc
and<00:01:34.140> everything<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.890> my<00:01:35.790> guess<00:01:35.850> is

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and everything like that so my guess is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.569 
and everything like that so my guess is
that<00:01:36.329> that's<00:01:36.720> powering<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.500> what's<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.490> on

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that that's powering so what's going on

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.069 
that that's powering so what's going on
right<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.390> Justice<00:01:39.930> League<00:01:40.049> is

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
right here is the Justice League is

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
you can see this is the original Justice

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.069 
you can see this is the original Justice
League<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.760> not<00:03:17.849> just<00:03:18.180> like<00:03:18.389> we<00:03:18.510> saw<00:03:18.690> on<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
League and not just like we saw on the

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.379 
League and not just like we saw on the
Batman<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.590> Robin<00:03:19.949> story<00:03:20.280> arc<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:20.699> that's

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
Batman and Robin story arc so that's

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.030 
Batman and Robin story arc so that's
kind<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.690> confusing<00:03:21.870> because<00:03:22.319> like<00:03:22.829> where's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
kind of confusing because like where's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.309 
kind of confusing because like where's
Lex<00:03:23.310> Luthor<00:03:23.730> why<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.239> Superman<00:03:25.019> like

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
Lex Luthor why is Superman like

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.229 
Lex Luthor why is Superman like
completely<00:03:25.919> normal<00:03:26.340> now<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.549> everything<00:03:26.970> so

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
completely normal now and everything so

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.819 
completely normal now and everything so
I<00:03:27.449> really<00:03:28.109> don't<00:03:28.199> know<00:03:28.319> what<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.500> say<00:03:28.709> about

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
I really don't know what to say about

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.770 
I really don't know what to say about
that<00:03:28.949> but<00:03:29.489> what's<00:03:29.940> really<00:03:30.120> important<00:03:30.629> is<00:03:30.720> that

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
that but what's really important is that

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.569 
that but what's really important is that
Batman<00:03:31.379> is<00:03:31.410> fighting<00:03:31.980> off<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.129> Justice

Batman is fighting off the Justice

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.670 
Batman is fighting off the Justice
League<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:32.910> obviously<00:03:33.419> Batman<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.260> about<00:03:34.560> to

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
something that I connect to Batman all

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.740 
something that I connect to Batman all
the<00:04:17.159> time<00:04:17.310> I<00:04:17.340> mean<00:04:17.579> come<00:04:17.760> on<00:04:17.820> half<00:04:18.090> as<00:04:18.329> villains

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
the time I mean come on half as villains

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.810 
the time I mean come on half as villains
are<00:04:18.930> psychotic<00:04:19.560> like<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.010> Joker<00:04:20.280> two-face

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
are psychotic like the Joker two-face

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.270 
are psychotic like the Joker two-face
all<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.630> were<00:04:21.720> basically<00:04:21.959> psychotic<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:22.979> the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
all that were basically psychotic so the

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.800 
all that were basically psychotic so the
word<00:04:23.430> psychotic<00:04:24.030> in<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.270> world<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.630> same

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
word psychotic in the world and same

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.750 
word psychotic in the world and same
kind<00:04:25.200> of<00:04:25.260> revolve<00:04:25.560> around<00:04:25.680> Batman<00:04:26.130> so<00:04:26.610> maybe

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
kind of revolve around Batman so maybe

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.650 
kind of revolve around Batman so maybe
that's<00:04:26.940> going<00:04:27.120> to

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
that's going to

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.570 
that's going to
to<00:04:27.720> be<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.050> main<00:04:28.260> focus<00:04:28.290> of<00:04:28.770> endgame<00:04:29.040> is<00:04:29.400> that

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
to be the main focus of endgame is that

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.310 
to be the main focus of endgame is that
Batman<00:04:30.150> is<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.480> one<00:04:30.660> that's<00:04:30.840> going<00:04:30.990> in<00:04:31.170> saying

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
Batman is the one that's going in saying

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.590 
Batman is the one that's going in saying
this<00:04:31.500> time<00:04:31.740> so<00:04:32.250> that's<00:04:32.430> my<00:04:32.580> guess<00:04:32.640> I<00:04:33.060> guess<00:04:33.450> is

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
this time so that's my guess I guess is

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.240 
this time so that's my guess I guess is
that<00:04:33.630> maybe<00:04:33.960> Batman<00:04:34.200> going<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:34.860> insane<00:04:35.220> that

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
that maybe Batman going so insane that

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.690 
that maybe Batman going so insane that
he's<00:04:36.150> kind<00:04:36.390> of<00:04:36.680> becoming<00:04:37.680> like<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.130> Joker<00:04:38.460> and

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
he's kind of becoming like the Joker and

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.520 
he's kind of becoming like the Joker and
wants<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:38.940> kill<00:04:39.150> everybody<00:04:39.390> kills<00:04:39.930> villains

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
wants to kill everybody kills villains

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.440 
wants to kill everybody kills villains
so<00:04:40.770> maybe<00:04:41.310> he<00:04:41.490> finally<00:04:41.640> does<00:04:41.940> get<00:04:42.120> pushed<00:04:42.330> over

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
so maybe he finally does get pushed over

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.940 
so maybe he finally does get pushed over
the<00:04:42.600> line<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.200> Justice<00:04:43.500> League<00:04:43.650> has<00:04:43.800> to

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
the line and the Justice League has to

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.070 
the line and the Justice League has to
stop<00:04:44.190> him<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.640> you<00:04:45.240> know<00:04:45.390> that<00:04:45.750> would<00:04:45.960> be
