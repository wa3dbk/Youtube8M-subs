00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.170
 so come with one after 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.350
 paraglider just afraid of the 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.720
 strong wind head and had this 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.040
 ground handling exercises with several 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.199
 different scheme with higher 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.330
 Classified started backwards 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.530
 started forward and for me it was 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.530
 really a full success 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.070
 most beautiful experiences were the flights on the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.970
 parallels rich and some beautiful 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.310
 Flightdays where you are self-employed 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.840
 A land could land down on the beach 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.550
 then change to the thin high ground 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.200
 could stop and up again 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.690
 could that has repeatedly me 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.010
 done in a row and that shows 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.210
 Really that you have a lot here 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.260
 That's what you really learned 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.260
 could do alone 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.180
 the flight the beautiful is because 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.920
 one learns on the one hand because 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.110
 just the whole is looked after by one 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.100
 flight instructor of a level exercise leader 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.870
 about the areas and such a points and 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.990
 the evening sitting together 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.400
 it's also great to be part of it 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.050
 Time is always the same 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.230
 you meet and it is really very 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.230
 beautiful 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:55.840
 to align just not easy 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.120
 the good never let go here 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.159
 somehow as protection to hold on there 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.849
 want and not to work alone 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.640
 not coupled 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.739
 I definitely hope that's great 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.870
 learn states and especially screen 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.400
 facing up is very important to me 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.860
 important because simply with us 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.290
 Unternberg in Ruhpolding also very often 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.849
 strong wind is and there is the normal 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.519
 too often are difficult now we wait 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.760
 only once over the piece to the right 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.760
 in addition 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:40.970
 nice that walter apply that 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.349
 yes, that's the only way to go 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.920
 my opinion where you in groups with 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.420
 other similarly active people like this 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.489
 flight can develop sport 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.690
 I can not go home alone every day 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.940
 but I have to somehow fly 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.769
 I'm still trying on such trips 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.130
 to develop and that is one 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.400
 wonderful mix of team travel and 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.400
 learn 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.410
 that looks great this side is great 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.460
 the bernd of the lot are under me 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.620
 you have to look 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.600
 sometimes it is a bit more behind 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.700
 So it does not have to be in the beginning 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.110
 nice to hold because am but 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.610
 now back to try something 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.000
 a few meters further back in to 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.000
 fly 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.060
 So I got into it 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.770
 to make air travel because I'm in this 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.480
 command and land much for me 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.360
 Potential does not look any further 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.520
 develop and above all things under 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.080
 professional guidance of these areas 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.400
 to fly because I believe you 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.470
 he has to fly everything for him 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.600
 piece and my big goal - to 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.720
 One day the big round to 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.720
 create 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.860
 certainly extremely helpful again 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.080
 another level of self-confidence too 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.940
 get on training in the man 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.039
 Everything can be done can be done 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:37.229
 Slowly dismantle the care here and 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.229
 but then expand the independence 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.080
 Now we go slowly to the left 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.909
 stay with me on the brake 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.729
 both sides remain at the area that 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.740
 good female good the area easily 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.009
 keep to the left bisserl and more bands 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.300
 yet fabian this to you surely break 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:15.119
 keep watching me a bit higher 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.080
 let your hands slide, still glide 

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:25.849
 and drop nicely emerge hands up 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:25.849
 predecessor rolf martin schmitz good 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:32.279
 reference point and anklam lan or zu 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.460
 low courses stop with one 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:38.939
 we do not plan to call much now 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:54.589
 always not do very bitter 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:54.589
 hour his first top landing exciting 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:04.379
 33 andre kaczor but nervous something almost 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:07.639
 again from promis no problem that is 

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:09.599
 even cool somehow 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.399
 First, the advantage that one at 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.379
 flying will be taken care of if you ever 

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:15.149
 Always needs the wings were often 

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:17.099
 you can use them to know the berner 

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:19.489
 Restaurants will be where you can get here 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:21.539
 just as well what you eticket 

00:07:19.489 --> 00:07:23.069
 Worth seeing manner ghetto stress-free 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:25.169
 the whole thing museum care nothing 

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:28.009
 And that's actually the travel price 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:28.009
 definitely worth it
