00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.029
 hello to all guys and welcome back up 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.789
 gta clan channel here you talking 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.500
 and today we are back on advanced warfare 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.360
 I haven't commented on it for a while 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.850
 beautiful gameplay created by 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.560
 great storm appears my one of the 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.199
 best players in Italy regarding the 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.210
 public of advanced warfare precisely yes 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.730
 it is a triple DNA in solo 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.159
 realized on ascend domain if not 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.219
 I remember he described it a bit 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:41.350
 long ago on the clan group are 90 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.969
 argan streak then triple DNA 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.760
 equivalent correct me if I'm wrong 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.469
 because anyway I can't see the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.149
 gameplay and has only been told that 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.089
 a triple 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.309
 however it is already a like because the map 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.429
 and a triple dna drops I don't think of 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.440
 have never seen on this map then in 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.609
 just with the ball on such a giant map 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.519
 let's say it's not like that 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:07.090
 easy anyway let's start immediately with 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.130
 commentaries before starting 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.649
 in fact I tell you that I have changed the microphone 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.369
 I bought 60 euros a lot of microphone 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.909
 very sic 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.729
 so I hope you can appreciate this 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.619
 gesture is also my new voice if so 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.039
 can you say or my voice in high 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.950
 quality nothing 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:28.810
 however, today I wanted to talk to you a little 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.460
 of the differences between campaigns and 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.810
 multiplayer of a game hoping not 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.770
 having already done this commentary 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.840
 however, let's start with the campaign 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.869
 that what I play a little less than 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.049
 however, there are usually many aspects of 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.570
 this thing to say about this mode 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.899
 more than anything else to talk about and many 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.070
 important aspects to tell you not between 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.720
 quotation marks 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.920
 let's start by saying that the last one 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.869
 campaign that really has me 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.850
 passionate was that of call of 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.039
 duty gloucester that many were not 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.140
 liked for the short duration anyway 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.770
 but to me he really had left a 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.170
 open mouth because it was one of the first 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.440
 Codec campaigns duke also played 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.090
 in fact before digos as I have always said 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.340
 meanwhile I hope the alarm is not there 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.950
 chair yourself like I always said I had 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.950
 played only mv 3 first of costa precisely 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.330
 I had just done some missions 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.599
 I no longer liked the countryside 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.489
 he had dumped her there for a while 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.920
 costs instead took me really a lot 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.549
 at the beginning no and at the beginning a little slow 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.430
 but then how to take a short rope 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.670
 with events and everything becomes one 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.440
 what really fun especially the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.140
 final leaves you speechless and al 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.340
 final you can understand the campaign of 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.190
 ghost because after the subtitles of the tail 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.260
 of the final c type a crazy fact that 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.329
 I ca n't tell you if you haven't played it 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.750
 however from that fact we understand that there 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:08.480
 it will certainly still be 99 percent 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.930
 a second if that of this beautiful title 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.239
 my here appears before that 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.580
 instead there are already I played a lot 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.940
 of games both suites on playstation 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.129
 but obviously before maybe I was on 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.530
 generally a bit of football then fifa and of 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.410
 there the countryside there maybe not the thing in 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.330
 single player had played far cry and lo 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.250
 I'm still playing for four because 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.200
 infinite type that game doing all 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.000
 these all secondary missions 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.370
 because anyway going to make a 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.010
 normal mission a primary mission 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.849
 on the way we meet 40 thousand 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.870
 missions to that game never ends 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:49.310
 apart from that other games like outlast 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.769
 or those of the pokÃ©mon 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.160
 those really did eat them from me 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:59.359
 small are all aspects however that 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.310
 make the game rich there is a campaign 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.650
 good makes a title really great 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.799
 because he takes a lot anyway 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.260
 you feel like repeating it and something of the 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.480
 kind especially if in the countryside there 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.910
 are unexpected things compelling facts or 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.609
 however if a horror game the campaign 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.010
 must do a tot of fear or how out 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.470
 plus that I really can't 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.840
 to finish it because I 'm always afraid 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.169
 I close everything that's like that other game 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.630
 su su console pt here I do not know how many 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.520
 of you have that game on ps4 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.490
 I fear a lot I can't 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.990
 finish it even if it's a little more anyway 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.400
 psychological one and has no real e 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.590
 my own campaign is however in my opinion it is 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.349
 a really fantastic mode the 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.599
 single player bar campaign but then 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.310
 going to see multiplayer there are a 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:53.350
 lots of other aspects apart 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.240
 ie certain in multiplayer it cannot be 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.030
 bold and unpredictable things like that 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.160
 but the fact is that in the countryside you 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.960
 computer games here instead 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.870
 multiplayer games against other people 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.880
 so no good people with whom 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.390
 being able to compare real people 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.890
 above all it is however in the countryside yes 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.800
 there is room for improvement in 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.210
 as maybe missions to things like that 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.280
 because most of you guys can 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.110
 understand that in multiplayer there is a 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.200
 absurd room for improvement because 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.700
 if already in the campaign and the classes 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.790
 there are always the usual ones 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.370
 enemies that smoothing always comes out from the 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.470
 same parts here instead in multiplayer 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.200
 you have to create the tuglie 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.420
 equipment and already to have one 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.820
 shit class like I had maybe 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.620
 beginning ghost that in mind or of mr like 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.270
 primary machine gunner as secondary me 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.460
 I changed the corners with the 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.950
 craftsmanship here to tell you is triple 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.650
 accessory then has to go to make a 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:53.260
 class because in quotation marks or otherwise 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.920
 in the case a pretty good class with 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:06:00.880
 made with the criterion thinking if the 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.820
 we say reasoning is really a great one 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.220
 improvement is already from that the 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:12.490
 multiplayer offers many possibilities here 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.830
 then nothing guys there is to say that the 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.050
 campaign once ends multiplayer 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.970
 there are ten prestigious works for is 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.320
 the countryside is almost infinite 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.240
 you can do it again 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.340
 how many times do you though 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.020
 in multiplayer it does not find there once 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.250
 that you did that enough bus 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:32.770
 maximum change changing difficulty 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.110
 but here in multiplayer you will never do 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.500
 an identical match a caveri already 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.479
 therefore played is infinite even though it can 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.009
 be a little repetitive because of the 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.169
 weapons are always those maps are 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:46.569
 always those will never be repetitive 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:49.830
 like playing a campaign then maybe 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:51.970
 obviously this is my reasoning 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.419
 it changes from person to person 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:57.250
 everyone can think differently is nothing 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.960
 the big video is over me 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.490
 I recommend you will lay Comment 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.720
 the only time I ask you to pass 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.919
 from my channel because we are going to 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.050
 get to the thousand 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:06.759
 I would like to get there by the end of the month 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.840
 so as to make a great special dario that 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:09.840
 all beautiful 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:22.930
 you don't like igt ft killed arrival
