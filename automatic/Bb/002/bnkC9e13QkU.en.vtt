00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Hello everyone, Irina is now in the summer 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:15.570
 hot time very often girls write 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.480
 that orchids have lower leaves lose 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.670
 turgor that supposedly watered normal 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:28.230
 as before 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.109
 but the less the plant all the same lower 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.399
 leaves we lose turgor with what all 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.010
 it is related 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.370
 Well, first of all, this is due to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.329
 that in the heat especially in sunny weather 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.559
 summer plant 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:50.460
 evaporates moisture through the leaves 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:52.800
 the roots do not have time to get drunk the plant is not 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.699
 can consume as much moisture as 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.420
 evaporates its leaves in the heat 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:03.320
 such cases are very good at least 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.900
 turn on the fan at maximum 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.450
 air conditioning because really 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.760
 plants are very hard to bear strong 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:19.080
 heat here if your plant from me 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.759
 here is this mom with babies if she is worth 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.580
 I have it from time to time like this 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.750
 just doesnâ€™t fall for a barrel of roses and 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.030
 What do I do then? 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.110
 already showed and said that this 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.549
 I put the orchid in the pots 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.210
 glass pots on heavy that's not 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.439
 plastic 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.110
 this glass and I temporarily put an orchid 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.909
 in this cache 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.170
 such an orchid needs to be watered much 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.840
 more often than all your other plants then 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.719
 there is sprayed on the roots sprayed 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.750
 on the sheet from the outside and from 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.000
 inside but do it in 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.210
 morning time before the plant 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.580
 the sun begins to shine sleep I her 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.660
 forgot again not 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:16.210
 leg pritenit and a little bit my little joke 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.010
 bit got such a light burn 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:24.260
 so spray the plants by 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:29.330
 opportunities take away from the heat here 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:33.410
 so the plants will be better than themselves 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:38.120
 feel if you do at least 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:42.260
 a little cool room at least 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:47.450
 even using a fan for plants 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:50.270
 it will be something so be very 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.610
 careful in the heat do not forget your 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:58.760
 plants in the sun although I understand it happens 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.170
 rolled up forgot but nevertheless need 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.990
 you need to try to protect our plants 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.790
 how to separate the radical babe so much 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:14.180
 many questions already queries well maybe 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.910
 maybe i will ripen and show you how it is 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.560
 done basically nothing complicated there 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.989
 no but she's not for something to do 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:28.430
 neatly because baby is connected to 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:32.830
 mom conditionally rod such here 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.360
 the rod will need to be neatly cut 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.910
