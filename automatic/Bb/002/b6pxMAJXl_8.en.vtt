00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:07.919
 welcome home hen we go 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:12.019
 show you our henhouse where lives 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.849
 six hens of redhead and 4 black so 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.600
 lately we have left our 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.789
 hens their henhouse there she was wandering 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.900
 until now until a few months 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.170
 in the garden but we do so much 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.699
 havoc that we decided the clo t 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.390
 for the season from sowing until 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.270
 September October 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.170
 so here we let them go again 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:45.690
 so she takes advantage of the garden so here we go 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:49.079
 hand-crafted artisanal and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.640
 we get into the chicken there you go 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.789
 we ended thou art in 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:03.120
 relatively well exposed place so 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.280
 south facing with a wall paying it 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.439
 avoid them too much wind and then we 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.590
 have side in a place where there is 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:16.049
 dd trees so shade 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.990
 this is the little hen house 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.280
 bought it from ib around 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.990
 350 400 euros the assembly is very very 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.850
 easy in an hour and a half 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.549
 editing is done with 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.979
 explanations that are very well done 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.659
 so hens you have to know it the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.030
 morning at night forgiveness 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.320
 she goes back to the henhouse alone 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.290
 we do not need to bring them in 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:48.899
 so in fact she comes from there they 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:52.549
 show by this small scale and the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.549
 hatch there is closed I'm going to open it 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.930
 she goes back through the hatch into the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.430
 henhouse and so when the night 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.399
 begins to fall she goes home alone 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.579
 so we just have to close the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.579
 trap 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.120
 So then our hens are in their 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.130
 henhouse that is in height that allows 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.730
 so that they are safe from 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.959
 humidity 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.040
 and then and then cold so I'm going 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.989
 show you the inside of the chicken coop 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.049
 which at the base is made for 4 5 hens 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:29.310
 we have six so we put 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.940
 the straw at the nest box for 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.140
 that she can settle 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.410
 quietly and so basically there is 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.540
 the douar or big sea bridge are in 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.690
 train to make a couv had so in fact 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.299
 we let them do it we remove the 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.560
 eyes laugh regularly but it takes to 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:51.660
 about 21 so 28 days after a 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.130
 a little month they leave quiet 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.170
 there are some pretty barbaric methods for 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.450
 stop them from hatching but we get them 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.620
 do not care 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.810
 So here is the winter we put a little 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.030
 red lamp when it's too cold 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.720
 so that it is not too cold 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.180
 in their henhouse 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.109
 despite everything as soon as the henhouse and is 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.620
 relatively hermetic it is necessary especially 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.109
 not that they adhere to it 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:22.560
 here are the chickens very well supports the 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:26.579
 cold so we'll go to the level of 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.170
 douar bridge that we open and so we see 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.170
 our two little babies from the east sea 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.849
 quiet 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.849
 so we take the eggs every day 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.030
 or every two days we have six hens 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:46.769
 so when no one actually covers 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.620
 she gives us four ace 4 to 5 by 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.030
 day there like there are two chickens that 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.380
 cover it's true it makes us 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:58.349
 three four hours a day 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:01.860
 that's it shut down there is a system for 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.720
 clean or we can pull so this 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.340
 part 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.830
 here are two notches 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.290
 and it pulls itself there I do not do it because 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.879
 that it's complicated that's fine 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.629
 thank you 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:19.949
 my wife and then there is a small 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:21.840
 window that we open or close in 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.440
 function that's when in the teeth the 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.120
 very hot days one leaves open in 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.169
 during our little hens 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.020
 it's very easy to feed chickens 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:39.000
 so in the summer we leave their 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.729
 feeder and their water trough here 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.220
 otherwise we put it inside as soon as they 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:48.900
 start to do bad we have 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.410
 stored our seeds so in a 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.380
 trash can 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.979
 it avoids the humidity it allows 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.380
 to avoid rodents gets carried 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.520
 because there are wheels etc it's 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.320
 easy because it's next to the 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.870
 chicken coop 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.810
 that's it and so we're actually giving them a 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:12.090
 mix so there lately 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:15.750
 it was a mix that's real with 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:21.770
 granules here is you showing the 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:25.080
 corn corn barley composition and it's rare 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.400
 here and we make a mix also 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.460
 since we have dogs and we have 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.990
 account that dogs on one hand was doing 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.910
 very good with other chickens 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.190
 Besides the chickens back to the reis 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.860
 dog food for wet cat 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.130
 with water so that's it's theirs 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.950
 supplement when it is very cold 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:51.090
 hens love a little paw and with 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:55.470
 hot water and so in the morning every 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.650
 mornings when when we get up at the moment 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.860
 breakfast and as soon as the sun 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.160
 survey 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.490
 in fact we open it 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.440
 the hatch for our chickens who ate 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:14.100
 who will start to wander in the 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:17.180
 garden so here they are very good 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:22.020
 housekeeping with dogs very good housekeeping 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.520
 with cats and it's really 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:28.050
 little beasts that are very easy to 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:32.340
 live who the winter are going to go kill and go 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:35.940
 eat all the pests of the garden and 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.440
 who gives us good ones with 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.740
 which we make piles of state dishes 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.930
 of pancakes state abyss here thank you for 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.740
 we have followed and see you soon 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.740
 goodbye
