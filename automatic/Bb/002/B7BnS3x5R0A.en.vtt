 therapy and training center organizes the usa times together with foot ability 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.990
 look and sports election a test and no thought for cyclists 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.469
 the bike position meeting and the maximum tests are preceded by a 

00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:26.469
 podiatrist arguing and physical examination 

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:31.859
 if both tracks are investigated, the scan will have looked at the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.199
 position of the feet and their influence on the rest of the body 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.000
 the physical examination performed by a manual therapist is examined 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 to the posture and locomotor apparatus 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.500
 the spine and adjacent joints we will become 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.550
 checked for blockages and sheath as standard

 even if you experience complaints during or cycled home this often has too

 posture on the bike 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.020
 hey if their weight is not functioning properly there will be this for the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.810
 pointed position measurements are treated to get as low as possible on the bike 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.370
 put 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.970
 the goal is to get cyclists from recreational to professional as good as possible on the bike 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.970
 with the optimal action position will follow 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.579
 This position must ensure that the UWV music that power is optimal 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.020
 converted to speed 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.190
 a 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.400
 now it is possible to show the difference between a wrong attitude and 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 just the corrected attitude 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.689
 the movement is recorded with a digital camera 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.689
 and analyzed using advanced software 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.730
 so before the college to determine the millimeter to call in bikini 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.280
 a position of the back end 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.280
 the height of the saddle etcetera 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.049
 exercise physiologist is research 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.919
 a lot of sports after the introduction in a medical questionnaire 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:23.219
 containing questions about the health of heart defects and injuries 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.479
 The first measurements take place starting with blood pressure 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.059
 the height of the body 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.140
 the body fat and the fat-free muscle mass is determined on the basis of 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.139
 the meeting of four her project 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.549
 the exercise test is taken on the owner's well-adjusted bicycle 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.549
 but after the first run at the end of July 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.509

 the club won four sensor be exercise tests started

 based on the results and a statement can be made about the police 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.799
 the turning point and the maximum power 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:22.089
 the results are processed in a clear, clear test report 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:26.349
