worry that farm right chat overlay is

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.639 
worry that farm right chat overlay is
only<00:00:06.270> there<00:00:06.509> for<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.750> few<00:00:06.810> seconds<00:00:07.319> because<00:00:07.560> I

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
only there for a few seconds because I

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.140 
only there for a few seconds because I
opened<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.980> couple<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.280> these<00:00:08.370> on<00:00:08.580> my<00:00:08.849> live

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
opened a couple of these on my live

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.629 
opened a couple of these on my live
stream<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:10.110> I've<00:00:10.349> saved<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.710> video<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.190> opening

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
stream so I've saved a video of opening

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.509 
stream so I've saved a video of opening
50<00:00:12.120> exactly<00:00:12.929> 50<00:00:13.349> supply<00:00:13.710> drops<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.370> I

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
50 exactly 50 supply drops so that I

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.709 
50 exactly 50 supply drops so that I
could<00:00:14.820> share<00:00:14.969> them<00:00:15.179> with<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.450> internet

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
could share them with the internet

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.000 
could share them with the internet
because<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.049> think<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.470> kind<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.740> thing<00:00:16.920> is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
because I think this kind of thing is

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.680 
because I think this kind of thing is
fun<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.310> watch<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:18.119> basically<00:00:18.390> like<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
fun to watch it's basically like the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.090 
fun to watch it's basically like the
people<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:18.990> new<00:00:19.230> trading<00:00:19.560> card<00:00:19.890> pack

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
people that new trading card pack

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.130 
people that new trading card pack
openings<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.880> stuff<00:00:21.090> like<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.689> guess

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
openings and stuff like that I guess

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.750 
openings and stuff like that I guess
it's<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.350> fun<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.650> open<00:00:23.070> these<00:00:23.279> things<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
it's just fun to open these things and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.220 
it's just fun to open these things and
see<00:00:23.910> what<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.359> get<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.689> know<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.930> few<00:00:25.080> other

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
see what you can get I know a few other

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.420 
see what you can get I know a few other
people<00:00:25.500> have<00:00:25.590> done<00:00:25.740> these<00:00:25.949> types<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.340> videos

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
people have done these types of videos

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.730 
people have done these types of videos
and<00:00:26.760> usually<00:00:27.420> avoid<00:00:27.660> repeating<00:00:28.199> something<00:00:28.619> I

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
and usually avoid repeating something I

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.080 
and usually avoid repeating something I
don't<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.220> doing<00:00:29.429> stuff<00:00:29.519> other<00:00:29.760> people<00:00:29.820> have

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
don't like doing stuff other people have

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.030 
don't like doing stuff other people have
done<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.750> had<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.050> idea<00:00:31.230> way<00:00:31.529> before<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
done but I had this idea way before the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.709 
done but I had this idea way before the
game<00:00:32.189> even<00:00:32.219> came<00:00:32.669> out<00:00:32.790> I've<00:00:33.030> been<00:00:33.210> recording

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
game even came out I've been recording

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.510 
game even came out I've been recording
every<00:00:34.079> supply<00:00:34.380> drop<00:00:34.649> from<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> beginning<00:00:35.370> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
every supply drop from the beginning and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.920 
every supply drop from the beginning and
I'm<00:00:35.730> not<00:00:35.850> about<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.120> delete<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.570> all<00:00:36.660> because

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
I'm not about to delete it all because

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.090 
I'm not about to delete it all because
some<00:00:37.110> other<00:00:37.170> people<00:00:37.590> have<00:00:37.680> done<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> similar

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
some other people have done a similar

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.619 
some other people have done a similar
thing<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.640> that's<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> beauty<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.420> type

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
thing and that's the beauty of this type

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.090 
thing and that's the beauty of this type
of<00:00:39.660> video<00:00:39.960> even<00:00:40.350> though<00:00:40.559> other<00:00:40.770> people<00:00:40.800> have

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
of video even though other people have

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.010 
of video even though other people have
done<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.489> no<00:00:41.850> two<00:00:41.910> videos<00:00:42.360> will<00:00:42.600> be<00:00:42.629> alike

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
done this no two videos will be alike

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.600 
done this no two videos will be alike
there's<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.350> good<00:00:43.469> chance<00:00:43.680> I'll<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:44.040> radically

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
there's a good chance I'll get radically

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.040 
there's a good chance I'll get radically
different<00:00:44.910> loot<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> won't<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.899> here
