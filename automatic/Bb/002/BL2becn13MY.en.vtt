00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
the innovator and that's more than a

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.520 
the innovator and that's more than a
name<00:00:58.270> it's<00:00:58.510> called<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:58.750> innovator<00:00:59.140> because

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
name it's called the innovator because

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.980 
name it's called the innovator because
it<00:01:00.070> sets<00:01:00.310> itself<00:01:00.490> up<00:01:00.760> Chris<00:01:01.060> it<00:01:01.450> sets<00:01:01.810> itself

Jeff<00:01:15.680> how<00:01:15.860> long<00:01:16.070> does<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:16.280> take<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:16.610> set<00:01:17.000> all

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
Jeff how long does it take to set all

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.500 
Jeff how long does it take to set all
its<00:01:18.190> computer<00:01:19.190> parameters<00:01:19.670> it<00:01:20.120> takes<00:01:20.390> about

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
its computer parameters it takes about

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.240 
its computer parameters it takes about
three<00:01:20.900> minutes<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.290> do<00:01:21.440> and<00:01:21.470> it<00:01:21.860> sets<00:01:22.130> the

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
three minutes to do and it sets the

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.310 
three minutes to do and it sets the
cyclic<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.970> collective<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.900> tail<00:01:24.080> up

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
cyclic the collective and the tail up

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.140 
cyclic the collective and the tail up
for<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:24.950> if<00:01:25.250> you've<00:01:25.640> never<00:01:25.790> set<00:01:26.000> up<00:01:26.030> a

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
for you so if you've never set up a

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.240 
for you so if you've never set up a
helicopter<00:01:26.540> before<00:01:26.690> this<00:01:27.680> is<00:01:27.830> a<00:01:27.860> perfect

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
helicopter before this is a perfect

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.620 
helicopter before this is a perfect
helicopter<00:01:28.670> for<00:01:28.820> you<00:01:28.910> because<00:01:29.210> there's<00:01:29.479> no

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
helicopter for you because there's no

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.450 
helicopter for you because there's no
experience<00:01:30.350> required<00:01:30.440> as<00:01:30.800> far<00:01:30.950> as<00:01:31.040> helicopter

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
experience required as far as helicopter

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.960 
experience required as far as helicopter
set<00:01:31.610> up<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.479> can<00:01:32.660> see<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.930> tail<00:01:33.140> is<00:01:33.170> very

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
set up so you can see the tail is very

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.990 
set up so you can see the tail is very
locked<00:01:34.970> in<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.950> it's<00:01:37.190> at<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.310> head<00:01:37.460> holding<00:01:37.729> gyro

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
locked in so it's at a head holding gyro

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.200 
locked in so it's at a head holding gyro
and<00:01:38.300> it's<00:01:39.080> got<00:01:39.440> great<00:01:39.619> performance<00:01:40.160> so<00:01:41.000> what's

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
and it's got great performance so what's

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.320 
and it's got great performance so what's
the<00:01:41.330> secret<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.750> its<00:01:41.930> stability<00:01:42.760> well<00:01:43.760> or<00:01:44.119> is

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
the secret to its stability well or is

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.510 
the secret to its stability well or is
that<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.479> top<00:01:44.720> secret<00:01:44.930> well<00:01:45.680> it's<00:01:46.130> part<00:01:46.400> of<00:01:46.430> it

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
that a top secret well it's part of it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.639 
that a top secret well it's part of it
still<00:01:46.759> it's<00:01:47.210> ability<00:01:47.540> is<00:01:47.660> inherent<00:01:48.290> due<00:01:48.440> to

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
still it's ability is inherent due to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.320 
still it's ability is inherent due to
the<00:01:48.800> foam<00:01:49.280> blades<00:01:49.550> that<00:01:49.729> we<00:01:49.820> have<00:01:49.940> there<00:01:50.119> and

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
the foam blades that we have there and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.960 
the foam blades that we have there and
also<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.170> upper<00:01:51.740> slung<00:01:51.979> fly<00:01:52.550> bar<00:01:52.759> that<00:01:52.910> you

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
also the upper slung fly bar that you

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.180 
also the upper slung fly bar that you
see<00:01:53.149> within<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.930> innovator<00:01:54.320> similar<00:01:55.009> to<00:01:55.100> that

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
see within the innovator similar to that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.580 
see within the innovator similar to that
of<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.430> raptor<00:01:55.820> makes<00:01:56.660> it<00:01:56.810> very<00:01:56.930> stable<00:01:57.290> in<00:01:57.500> a

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
of a raptor makes it very stable in a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.469 
of a raptor makes it very stable in a
hover<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.310> this<00:01:58.460> is<00:01:58.610> great<00:01:58.759> again<00:01:59.149> for<00:01:59.390> an

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
hover so this is great again for an

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.730 
hover so this is great again for an
entry-level<00:01:59.690> model<00:02:00.170> or<00:02:00.259> trying<00:02:00.440> to<00:02:00.500> get<00:02:00.619> in

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
entry-level model or trying to get in

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.800 
entry-level model or trying to get in
and<00:02:00.920> unlike<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.910> coax<00:02:02.390> we<00:02:03.320> have<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.500> USB<00:02:03.890> on<00:02:04.460> the

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
and unlike a coax we have a USB on the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.639 
and unlike a coax we have a USB on the
side<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.990> body<00:02:06.140> there<00:02:06.380> where<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.619> can

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
side of the body there where you can

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.020 
side of the body there where you can
actually<00:02:06.860> program<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.460> head<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:07.820> make<00:02:07.910> this

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
actually program the head and make this

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.969 
actually program the head and make this
a<00:02:08.090> fully<00:02:08.360> 3d<00:02:08.810> helicopter<00:02:09.320> just<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.619> change<00:02:09.770> the

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
a fully 3d helicopter just to change the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.580 
a fully 3d helicopter just to change the
blades<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.550> you're<00:02:10.640> ready<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.850> go<00:02:10.970> 3d<00:02:11.380> so<00:02:12.380> get

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
blades and you're ready to go 3d so get

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.590 
blades and you're ready to go 3d so get
rid<00:02:12.709> of<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.890> phone<00:02:13.070> blades<00:02:13.400> program<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.450> for

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
rid of the phone blades program it for

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.949 
rid of the phone blades program it for
3d<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.340> that's<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.520> yeah<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:16.880> go<00:02:17.120> 3d<00:02:17.480> simple

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
3d and that's it yeah you go 3d simple

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.229 
3d and that's it yeah you go 3d simple
as<00:02:18.050> that<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.440> we'll<00:02:19.340> have<00:02:19.459> profiles<00:02:19.940> much

application you apply a profile for

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.880 
application you apply a profile for
let's<00:02:24.530> say<00:02:25.840> intermediate<00:02:26.840> novice<00:02:27.350> or<00:02:27.500> expert

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
let's say intermediate novice or expert

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.640 
let's say intermediate novice or expert
and<00:02:28.150> it'll<00:02:29.150> have<00:02:29.420> different<00:02:29.959> pitch<00:02:30.410> curves

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
and it'll have different pitch curves

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.960 
and it'll have different pitch curves
and<00:02:30.769> throttle<00:02:31.010> curves<00:02:31.190> according<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.850> those

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
and throttle curves according to those

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.270 
and throttle curves according to those
parameters<00:02:32.450> well<00:02:33.049> I<00:02:33.140> certainly<00:02:33.470> call<00:02:33.920> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
parameters well I certainly call the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.200 
parameters well I certainly call the
