00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.369 
don't know what they did to update this
or<00:00:41.730> why<00:00:41.850> they<00:00:42.000> updated<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> Club<00:00:43.230> him

kind<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.010> differentiate<00:00:53.640> between

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
kind of like differentiate between

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.689 
kind of like differentiate between
enemies<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> popular<00:00:56.190> server<00:00:56.399> I'm<00:00:56.550> not
