 Downside the runner-up 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.619
 that has to be clearly defined 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.619
 Clemens August reached away 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.690
 how expensive it is to stand on the same pole on the other side of the road 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.640
 Glider not even and Sexseiten is that his also bugged 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.940
 Backwards at the top, he claims he is doing well 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.640
 that's bitter, his nervousness had not gotten more probable 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.010
 Christian Vietoris is even better than if that's a crucial one 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.120
 Role that was not safe 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.120
 but seen that rear-end collisions in the starting phase 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.010
 Diaz princess field afterwards but that many 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.219

 you also have to know 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.900
 there is a small piece 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.890
 that you can cope on a track spirit in this case Eduardo 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.220
 Mortara Telekom is Zulu bring optimistic and then went even 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.950
 Nothing 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.020
 even a friend that's all ears 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.260
 In principle, the weekend is dramatic after its botched 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.430
 Had run 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.720
 two drivers are there with increased values ​​Bianchi the colorful 1 to 25 drive as 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.260
 For fans, Mainz brought 24 9 and you have to say

 Winnenden so everything remains unchanged 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.480
 if you're on Web 2 0 in front 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.800
 on Monday 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.140
 It would be both the thumbs that something like slowing down sales would be if that 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.950
 sometimes panthers a bit 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.270
 to take care of the customers 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.170
 these things are isolated cases 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.540
 the situation for Nicki 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.460
 Everyone knows himself when you realize that you write that comes to draw 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.460
 just not close to the opponent 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.359
 beautiful talked about the industry documents risks, of course, too 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:20.709
 belongs 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.170
 that was already extremely difficult to become professional series 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.580
 the equally big teams Mücke Motorsport for the largest German 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.219
 Team not at all 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.819
 with the French 13 until the end of January with Mehner Motorsport 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.509
 Melzer 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.549
 it oozes rafts the French so it is already 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.309
 so far the largest international competition currently running over 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:45.039
 selection window 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.299
 compared to 50 that being here too last have just a lot less 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.859
 Data good luck 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.079
 the few options come into play 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.849
 afterwards she hopes time is at 10 o'clock 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.930
 the free practice sessions this very limited and then you can never 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.930
 so many houses two children with four cars 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:08.179
 Essential Bytes wukies so 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:12.439
 only at the Formula 3 Euro Series on the way pity with these pilots the

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.159
 entire championship 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.950
 They talk about their choice a lot of experience even with the team boss so 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.949
 Kris Nissen Kris Nissen also makes sense to those responsible 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:40.280
 Motorsport the rights of the self yes 86 with a VW engine in the rear of the 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:42.349
 Formula 3 has become champion 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.349
 if it is so long ago then what can actually percent 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.089
 Introducing people into motorsport, what exactly is that more? 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:50.689
 still the experience one has animals 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.699
 It is simply numbers suitable because they should be the mother 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.819
 not anymore and that's why the yellow car is still there 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.549
 now in position three 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.239
 They are also important to be able to show their 7 mobile phone 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.109
 that you can assemble percent of women for the drivers 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.359
 I just have to do my next race 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.169
 Going for the next year, the seats are relaxed 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.530
 Willers sucks the extraordinary turn of the year form a team 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.469
 the gap Vowe first, many want it 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.370
 how many times is it that the drivers year already percent 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.689
 the manager was name sponsor in 2008 and even 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.919
 together 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.550
 now it was time to drive in the center almost to zero Peter Mücke 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.319
 is that, for example, listening to this 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.390
 In the winter, however, it is said that in the test, that is 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.409
 we will see 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.519
 maybe more club sets it compares to the compare and then to more 

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:58.150
 when analyzed as 8 decided that our monetary system a very important issue if 

00:04:58.149 --> 00:05:01.149
 then everything fits and you race drivers too 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:29.870
 the cars more and more 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.730
 a sequential six-speed gearboxes works that 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.720
 yes that is in the meantime in the formula 1 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.979
 Rice or 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.879
 is the technology up 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.879
 yes every year daughter evolves in a study 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.180
 Tillmann 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.849
 such a case 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.339
 this is where situations are 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:15.940
 with 16 men 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.009
 the day has come Check out the backlog 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:20.650
 he had the mistake and 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.419
 you can already see it on the clock and switched to that some companies track 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.270
 because the repetition 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.500
 the seventh goal gets to grief Sichuan track on the way it is true that he 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.550
 the car does not completely lose 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.119
 well so lost a second 

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:38.189
 If you throw a bit of vacation from now on, yes 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:43.229
 Werner the air that the car even more nervous nati-keeper stone oversteer 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.009
 loses the electricity and district heating is already past only return journey 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:49.539
 Copper no noise so tested 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:53.899
 in the wiping of the stones each Eifert, according to him, found the fly 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:57.999
 Immediately Berne, however, after that, gets something like that, too 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.819
 if only fdp-man Adolf Herbst 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.889
 but that seems to have caught again that is still looking forward to a curve 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.080
 the coca-cola then has that 

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:23.499
 new is also that the arm 

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:24.930
 Seal 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.990
 the finish line of Nico Hulkenberg Folkerts instead of him at no time 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.710
 Not quite as Boller was right from the start in the first position 

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:36.580
 So victory for the German Nico Hülkenberg is a very important victory 

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:40.189
 really say after Bostock also passable in Salford 

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:42.369
 the SZ 

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:46.309
 At the first race at the Nürburgring, it is on top of the list 

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:47.909
 the one on 3 

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:52.719
 and with love as he stays the position twice as she is there as on the podium 

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:55.719
 once the ODS Zeller Racing 

00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:57.319
 Wittenberg
