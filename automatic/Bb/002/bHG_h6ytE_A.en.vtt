here's the screen shield and then the

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.809 
here's the screen shield and then the
backing<00:03:52.139> which<00:03:52.349> again<00:03:52.739> talks<00:03:53.220> about<00:03:53.549> how<00:03:53.760> to

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
backing which again talks about how to

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.599 
backing which again talks about how to
install<00:03:54.659> it<00:03:54.720> peel<00:03:55.590> from<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.919> corner<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.489> then

place it down so i'm just going to

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.559 
place it down so i'm just going to
adjust<00:03:58.349> myself<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:59.340> you<00:04:00.209> know<00:04:00.239> i'll<00:04:00.359> probably

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
adjust myself and you know i'll probably

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.179 
adjust myself and you know i'll probably
step<00:04:00.930> into<00:04:01.169> frame<00:04:01.409> a<00:04:01.439> little<00:04:01.739> bit<00:04:01.889> but<00:04:02.099> i'm

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
it by the sides being careful not to

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.199

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.490 
touch the screen shield portion and then
i'm<00:04:12.329> just<00:04:12.359> going<00:04:12.629> to<00:04:12.720> line<00:04:13.019> up<00:04:13.169> the<00:04:13.199> home

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.710 
i'm just going to line up the home
button<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:13.979> i'm<00:04:14.849> going<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.150> line<00:04:15.479> up<00:04:15.689> the

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
button and i'm going to line up the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.189 
button and i'm going to line up the
camera<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.739> proximity<00:04:17.729> sensor<00:04:18.139> and<00:04:19.139> I

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
camera and the proximity sensor and I

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.229 
camera and the proximity sensor and I
kind<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.470> use<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.650> taco<00:04:20.190> method<00:04:20.759> to<00:04:21.030> make

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
kind of use that taco method to make

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.149 
kind of use that taco method to make
sure<00:04:21.450> everything<00:04:21.900> is<00:04:22.019> straight<00:04:22.169> kind<00:04:23.070> of<00:04:23.099> just

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
sure everything is straight kind of just

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.909 
sure everything is straight kind of just
flexing<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.969> screen<00:04:24.599> shield<00:04:24.779> as<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:25.020> go<00:04:25.229> I<00:04:25.469> want

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
flexing the screen shield as I go I want

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.930 
flexing the screen shield as I go I want
to<00:04:26.010> make<00:04:26.130> sure<00:04:26.159> it's<00:04:26.460> perfect

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
to make sure it's perfect

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.000 
to make sure it's perfect
and<00:04:27.630> again<00:04:27.840> it's<00:04:27.990> hard<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.290> do<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.530> on<00:04:28.680> camera

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
and again it's hard to do it on camera

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.670 
and again it's hard to do it on camera
but<00:04:29.820> I'll<00:04:30.690> be<00:04:30.780> able<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:31.020> get<00:04:31.140> this<00:04:31.260> done<00:04:31.470> much

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
but I'll be able to get this done much

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.020 
but I'll be able to get this done much
easier<00:04:32.040> with<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.310> type<00:04:32.490> of<00:04:32.520> screen<00:04:32.850> shield

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
easier with this type of screen shield

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.510 
easier with this type of screen shield
then<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:34.470> traditional<00:04:34.980> time<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.400> that

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
then the traditional time so that

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.250 
then the traditional time so that
doesn't<00:04:35.790> look<00:04:35.880> lined<00:04:36.300> up<00:04:36.540> so<00:04:36.780> I'll<00:04:36.870> just<00:04:36.930> peel

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
doesn't look lined up so I'll just peel

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.500 
doesn't look lined up so I'll just peel
it<00:04:37.290> up<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.530> little<00:04:37.650> bit<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:37.920> start<00:04:38.130> again<00:04:38.510> see

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
it up a little bit and start again see

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.830 
it up a little bit and start again see
one<00:04:39.690> more<00:04:39.870> time<00:04:40.110> see<00:04:40.650> if<00:04:40.740> we<00:04:40.800> got<00:04:40.860> at<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:41.220> time

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
one more time see if we got at that time

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.360 
one more time see if we got at that time
that<00:04:42.840> looks<00:04:43.020> pretty<00:04:43.440> good<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.920> home<00:04:44.040> buttons

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
that looks pretty good the home buttons

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.650 
that looks pretty good the home buttons
a<00:04:44.430> little<00:04:44.460> off<00:04:44.790> and<00:04:44.820> again<00:04:45.150> I<00:04:45.210> can<00:04:45.450> play<00:04:45.630> with

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
a little off and again I can play with

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.410 
a little off and again I can play with
this<00:04:45.870> until<00:04:46.140> I<00:04:46.200> get<00:04:46.410> it<00:04:46.500> absolutely<00:04:47.240> just<00:04:48.240> how

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
this until I get it absolutely just how

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.910 
this until I get it absolutely just how
I<00:04:48.450> want<00:04:48.600> it<00:04:48.870> that<00:04:48.930> looks<00:04:49.320> good<00:04:49.500> for<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.740> home

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
I want it that looks good for the home

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.430 
I want it that looks good for the home
button<00:04:50.160> but<00:04:50.460> I'm<00:04:50.580> not<00:04:50.760> lined<00:04:51.000> up<00:04:51.180> up<00:04:51.300> top<00:04:51.570> so

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
button but I'm not lined up up top so

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.920 
button but I'm not lined up up top so
let<00:04:52.620> me<00:04:52.650> readjust<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:53.640> I<00:04:54.270> think<00:04:54.510> that's<00:04:54.720> going

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
let me readjust and I think that's going

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.600 
let me readjust and I think that's going
to<00:04:54.990> be<00:04:55.140> it<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:55.590> once<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.860> have<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.040> straight<00:04:56.370> I

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
to be it so once I have it straight I

along<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.400> screen<00:05:05.670> shield<00:05:05.850> to<00:05:06.480> make<00:05:06.630> sure

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
along the screen shield to make sure

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.410 
along the screen shield to make sure
it's<00:05:06.990> kind<00:05:07.200> of<00:05:07.320> adhered<00:05:08.250> now<00:05:09.000> remember<00:05:09.330> the

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
it's kind of adhered now remember the

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.960 
it's kind of adhered now remember the
only<00:05:09.540> sticky<00:05:09.960> part<00:05:10.320> is<00:05:10.560> this<00:05:10.890> green<00:05:11.220> frame<00:05:11.610> so

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
only sticky part is this green frame so

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.090 
only sticky part is this green frame so
i<00:05:12.000> can<00:05:12.360> just<00:05:12.540> kind<00:05:12.780> of<00:05:12.810> go<00:05:12.870> along<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.620> smooth

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
i can just kind of go along and smooth

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.530 
i can just kind of go along and smooth
out<00:05:14.250> any<00:05:14.400> air<00:05:14.610> bubbles<00:05:14.640> that<00:05:15.180> might<00:05:15.240> have

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
out any air bubbles that might have

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.630 
out any air bubbles that might have
formed<00:05:15.960> underneath<00:05:16.350> sometimes<00:05:17.190> you<00:05:17.340> will<00:05:17.490> get

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
formed underneath sometimes you will get

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.140 
formed underneath sometimes you will get
some<00:05:18.170> but<00:05:19.170> generally<00:05:19.830> you<00:05:20.610> end<00:05:20.760> up<00:05:20.880> with<00:05:21.000> the

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
some but generally you end up with the

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.420 
some but generally you end up with the
perfect<00:05:21.330> installation<00:05:21.750> and<00:05:22.410> again<00:05:22.860> i<00:05:23.010> just<00:05:23.070> go

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
perfect installation and again i just go

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.680 
perfect installation and again i just go
along<00:05:23.670> and<00:05:23.910> make<00:05:24.060> sure<00:05:24.090> that<00:05:24.360> this<00:05:24.480> adhesive

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
along and make sure that this adhesive

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.310 
along and make sure that this adhesive
is<00:05:25.230> totally<00:05:25.830> set<00:05:26.130> along<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.300> screen<00:05:27.570> frame<00:05:27.900> so

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
is totally set along the screen frame so

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.410 
is totally set along the screen frame so
let<00:05:28.560> me<00:05:28.590> just<00:05:28.800> do<00:05:28.950> that<00:05:29.070> can<00:05:29.700> kind<00:05:29.940> of<00:05:29.970> hear<00:05:30.240> it

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
let me just do that can kind of hear it

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.990 
let me just do that can kind of hear it
maybe<00:05:31.080> as<00:05:31.410> i<00:05:31.440> do<00:05:31.650> that<00:05:31.950> at<00:05:32.250> one<00:05:32.430> time<00:05:32.460> it<00:05:32.850> kind

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
maybe as i do that at one time it kind

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.270 
maybe as i do that at one time it kind
of<00:05:33.120> clicks<00:05:33.450> in<00:05:33.660> and<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.500> adhesive<00:05:34.980> sets

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
of clicks in and and the adhesive sets

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.530 
of clicks in and and the adhesive sets
kind<00:05:35.580> of<00:05:35.640> like<00:05:35.730> when<00:05:35.850> you're<00:05:36.000> pressing<00:05:36.240> down

scotch tape and let's see there we go so
as<00:05:41.310> you<00:05:41.460> can<00:05:41.610> see<00:05:41.850> pretty<00:05:42.330> much<00:05:42.450> perfect<00:05:43.080> let

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
as you can see pretty much perfect let
