this<00:00:01.650> video<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.610> going<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.939> be<00:00:03.030> about<00:00:03.210> the

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
this video is going to be about the

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.920 
this video is going to be about the
mandibular<00:00:03.810> lateral<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.589> cisors<00:00:05.930> okay

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
mandibular lateral and the cisors okay

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.810 
mandibular lateral and the cisors okay
let's<00:00:07.109> look<00:00:07.230> at<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.500> shape<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.580> tooth

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
let's look at the shape of the tooth

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.629 
let's look at the shape of the tooth
from<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.360> facial<00:00:09.990> lingual<00:00:10.830> view<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.370> gonna<00:00:11.490> be

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
from a facial lingual view it's gonna be

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.330 
from a facial lingual view it's gonna be
trapezoidal<00:00:12.179> from<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.139> mesial<00:00:13.590> distal<00:00:13.620> view

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
trapezoidal from a mesial distal view

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.939 
trapezoidal from a mesial distal view
it's<00:00:14.490> gonna<00:00:14.639> be<00:00:14.880> triangular<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.870> then<00:00:16.710> from

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
it's gonna be triangular and then from

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.000 
it's gonna be triangular and then from
an<00:00:17.039> incisive<00:00:17.369> view<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:17.789> gonna<00:00:17.910> be<00:00:18.150> oval<00:00:22.010> okay

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
an incisive view it's gonna be oval okay

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.769 
an incisive view it's gonna be oval okay
as<00:00:23.369> far<00:00:23.519> as<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> size<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> shape<00:00:24.600> is

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
as far as the size of the shape is

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.460 
as far as the size of the shape is
concerned

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
concerned

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.099 
concerned
this<00:00:26.070> tooth<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.580> slightly<00:00:27.000> larger<00:00:27.570> than<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
this tooth is slightly larger than the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.950 
this tooth is slightly larger than the
mandibular<00:00:28.650> central<00:00:29.580> incisor<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.539> here's<00:00:30.840> a

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
mandibular central incisor so here's a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.590 
mandibular central incisor so here's a
central<00:00:31.590> right<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.009> here's<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> lateral<00:00:33.239> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
central right here here's a lateral and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.720 
central right here here's a lateral and
there<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.960> see<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.500> little<00:00:35.219> bit<00:00:35.430> bigger

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
there you can see a little bit bigger

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.650 
there you can see a little bit bigger
than<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> central<00:00:38.180> okay<00:00:39.180> we're<00:00:39.329> gonna<00:00:39.420> take<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
than the central okay we're gonna take a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.529 
than the central okay we're gonna take a
look<00:00:39.809> at<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> incisal<00:00:40.469> edge<00:00:43.969> okay<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
look at the incisal edge okay so the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.470 
look at the incisal edge okay so the
right<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.960> left<00:00:46.230> mandibular<00:00:46.890> laterals<00:00:47.610> can

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
right and left mandibular laterals can

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.880 
right and left mandibular laterals can
be<00:00:48.629> distinguished<00:00:49.230> from<00:00:49.320> each<00:00:49.440> other

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
be distinguished from each other

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.279 
be distinguished from each other
you<00:00:50.010> might<00:00:50.190> get<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.570> occasionally<00:00:52.140> get

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
you might get it you occasionally get

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.510 
you might get it you occasionally get
questions<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> board<00:00:53.340> will

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
questions like this on the board will

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.369 
questions like this on the board will
they'll<00:00:53.670> ask<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.149> how<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.989> tell<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
they'll ask you how can you tell the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.229 
they'll ask you how can you tell the
right<00:00:55.649> tooth<00:00:55.920> from<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.340> left<00:00:56.550> tooth<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.120> know

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
right tooth from a left tooth you know

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.020 
right tooth from a left tooth you know
like<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.840> hockey<00:00:58.140> player<00:00:58.410> comes<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.699> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
like a hockey player comes in with the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.599 
like a hockey player comes in with the
tooth<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.780> their<00:01:01.170> hand

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
tooth in their hand

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.850 
tooth in their hand
what<00:01:03.390> distinguishing<00:01:04.170> feature<00:01:04.409> would<00:01:04.650> let

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
what distinguishing feature would let

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.380 
what distinguishing feature would let
you<00:01:05.010> know<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.400> was<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> left<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.299> right

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
you know if it was a left or a right

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.980 
you know if it was a left or a right
tooth<00:01:07.250> okay<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.580> right<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.720> left

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
tooth okay so the right and the left

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.440 
tooth okay so the right and the left
lateral<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.369> distinguished<00:01:11.880> because

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
lateral can be distinguished because

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.289 
lateral can be distinguished because
each<00:01:13.110> one<00:01:13.380> has<00:01:13.560> an<00:01:13.680> incisal<00:01:14.280> edge<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
each one has an incisal edge that

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.100 
each one has an incisal edge that
appears<00:01:15.689> twisted<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.500> its<00:01:16.680> apex<00:01:17.630> okay<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.689> here

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
appears twisted on its apex okay so here

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.980 
appears twisted on its apex okay so here
we<00:01:19.200> go<00:01:19.369> it's<00:01:20.369> not<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> straight<00:01:21.030> line<00:01:21.270> across<00:01:21.450> do

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
we go it's not a straight line across do

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.390 
we go it's not a straight line across do
you<00:01:22.049> see<00:01:22.170> how<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.409> kind<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.650> twisted<00:01:23.220> there

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
you see how it's kind of twisted there

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.030 
you see how it's kind of twisted there
on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> distal<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.200> goes<00:01:25.380> from<00:01:25.530> mesial

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
on the distal so as it goes from mesial

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.480 
on the distal so as it goes from mesial
to<00:01:26.159> distal<00:01:26.299> it<00:01:27.299> curves<00:01:27.810> lingually<00:01:28.490> okay

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
to distal it curves lingually okay

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.310 
to distal it curves lingually okay
another<00:01:29.670> way<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.939> might<00:01:30.030> see<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.509> up<00:01:31.140> here

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
another way you might see this up here

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.460 
another way you might see this up here
on<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> board's<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.880> incisal<00:01:33.299> edge<00:01:33.659> follows

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
on the board's the incisal edge follows

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.310 
on the board's the incisal edge follows
the<00:01:34.770> arch<00:01:35.090> curvature<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.299> relation<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the arch curvature in relation to the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.789 
the arch curvature in relation to the
facial<00:01:37.680> lingual<00:01:38.579> axis<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.350> perfect

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
facial lingual axis this is a perfect

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.700 
facial lingual axis this is a perfect
example<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.390> wording<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.570> question<00:01:43.049> where<00:01:43.259> it's

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
example of wording a question where it's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.859 
example of wording a question where it's
you<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.399> kind<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.780> you're

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
you just kind of like see it and you're

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.480 
you just kind of like see it and you're
like<00:01:45.960> what<00:01:46.500> are<00:01:46.590> they<00:01:46.710> talking<00:01:47.189> about

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
like what are they talking about

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.830 
like what are they talking about
and<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.710> here's<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.770> picture<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.840> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and so here's a picture of it the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.560 
and so here's a picture of it the
incisal<00:01:52.290> edge<00:01:52.619> follows<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.460> arch<00:01:53.850> curvature

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
incisal edge follows the arch curvature

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.109 
incisal edge follows the arch curvature
so<00:01:55.020> here's<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.710> arch<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> mouth<00:01:56.820> right

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
so here's the arch of the mouth right

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.219 
so here's the arch of the mouth right
and<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:58.770> tooth<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.420> distal<00:02:00.810> remember<00:02:01.140> it

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
and the tooth on the distal remember it

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.980 
and the tooth on the distal remember it
curves<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.310> curve<00:02:02.640> helps<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.270> follow

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
curves and so that curve helps it follow

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.219 
curves and so that curve helps it follow
the<00:02:04.409> arch<00:02:04.590> curvature<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.810> relation<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the arch curvature in relation to the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.779 
the arch curvature in relation to the
facial<00:02:07.500> lingual<00:02:08.099> access

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
facial lingual access

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.339 
facial lingual access
all<00:02:10.789> right<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.090> incisal<00:02:11.420> edge<00:02:11.690> continued

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
all right the incisal edge continued

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.020 
all right the incisal edge continued
because<00:02:13.040> there's<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.400> little<00:02:13.640> bit<00:02:13.879> of<00:02:13.970> a

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
because there's that little bit of a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.680 
because there's that little bit of a
distal<00:02:14.599> twist<00:02:15.140> on<00:02:15.799> it<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.940> can<00:02:17.150> see<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
distal twist on it you can see the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.280 
distal twist on it you can see the
distal<00:02:18.140> marginal<00:02:18.590> view<00:02:18.890> from<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.370> mesial<00:02:20.290> so

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
distal marginal view from the mesial so

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.020 
distal marginal view from the mesial so
this<00:02:21.500> little<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:22.129> mean<00:02:22.310> this<00:02:22.430> little<00:02:22.640> piece

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
this little I mean this little piece

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.550 
this little I mean this little piece
poking<00:02:23.540> out<00:02:23.659> right<00:02:23.810> there<00:02:23.989> is<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.110> distal

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
poking out right there is a distal

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.170 
poking out right there is a distal
marginal<00:02:24.950> Ridge<00:02:25.629> ok<00:02:26.629> occlusion<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:29.030> is

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
marginal Ridge ok occlusion this is

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.600 
marginal Ridge ok occlusion this is
another<00:02:29.390> potential<00:02:29.950> board<00:02:30.950> question<00:02:31.400> so

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
another potential board question so

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.550 
another potential board question so
here's<00:02:31.879> the<00:02:32.090> central<00:02:32.599> here's<00:02:33.049> the<00:02:33.230> lateral

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
here's the central here's the lateral

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.789 
here's the central here's the lateral
this<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:33.799> one<00:02:33.980> we're<00:02:34.129> looking<00:02:34.400> at<00:02:35.260> where<00:02:36.260> fast

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
this is one we're looking at where fast

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.119 
this is one we're looking at where fast
where<00:02:37.310> facets<00:02:37.760> on<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.480> incisal<00:02:38.959> edge<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.829> the

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
where facets on the incisal edge of the

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.280 
where facets on the incisal edge of the
mandibular<00:02:40.579> laterals<00:02:41.209> are<00:02:41.540> caused<00:02:41.989> by

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
mandibular laterals are caused by

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.180 
mandibular laterals are caused by
occlusion<00:02:43.010> with<00:02:43.280> which<00:02:44.120> teeth<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:45.950> if<00:02:46.010> we

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
occlusion with which teeth and so if we

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.830 
occlusion with which teeth and so if we
look<00:02:46.220> up<00:02:46.879> here<00:02:47.209> we<00:02:47.930> can<00:02:48.920> see<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.190> occludes<00:02:49.549> with

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
look up here we can see it occludes with

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.020 
look up here we can see it occludes with
central<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.260> upper<00:02:51.530> central<00:02:51.859> and<00:02:52.160> lateral

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
central the upper central and lateral

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.380 
central the upper central and lateral
ears<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.769> topic<00:02:57.769> that's<00:02:57.980> been<00:02:58.549> seen<00:02:58.940> as<00:02:59.329> a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
ears a topic that's been seen as a

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.809 
ears a topic that's been seen as a
potential<00:02:59.840> board<00:03:00.200> question<00:03:00.730> we're<00:03:01.730> gonna

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
potential board question we're gonna

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.050 
potential board question we're gonna
look<00:03:02.000> at<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.209> CDJ<00:03:02.810> right<00:03:03.019> here<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:04.060> the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
look at the CDJ right here and so the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.339 
look at the CDJ right here and so the
the<00:03:05.390> lingual<00:03:05.720> cervical<00:03:06.319> line<00:03:06.879> here<00:03:07.879> is

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
the lingual cervical line here is

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.430 
the lingual cervical line here is
positioned<00:03:09.349> more<00:03:09.590> epicly<00:03:10.370> than<00:03:11.359> the<00:03:11.840> facial

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
positioned more epicly than the facial

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.490 
positioned more epicly than the facial
cervical<00:03:13.280> line<00:03:13.510> remember<00:03:14.510> coronal<00:03:15.139> e<00:03:15.260> is

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
cervical line remember coronal e is

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.550 
cervical line remember coronal e is
towards<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.280> crown<00:03:16.750> epicly<00:03:17.750> is<00:03:17.930> towards<00:03:18.410> the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
towards the crown epicly is towards the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.640 
towards the crown epicly is towards the
root<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.069> so<00:03:19.880> on<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.569> lingual<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.049> CDJ<00:03:21.530> is

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
root and so on the lingual the CDJ is

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.229 
root and so on the lingual the CDJ is
gonna<00:03:21.829> be<00:03:22.010> positioned<00:03:22.669> a<00:03:22.760> little<00:03:22.790> bit<00:03:23.090> more

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
gonna be positioned a little bit more

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.610 
gonna be positioned a little bit more
towards<00:03:23.569> the<00:03:23.959> root<00:03:24.169> than<00:03:24.739> on<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.579> facial<00:03:26.620> okay

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
towards the root than on the facial okay

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.430 
towards the root than on the facial okay
let's<00:03:27.769> take<00:03:27.919> a<00:03:27.980> look<00:03:28.040> at<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.430> roots<00:03:29.380> this<00:03:30.380> is

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
let's take a look at the roots this is

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.550 
let's take a look at the roots this is
the<00:03:30.859> tooth<00:03:31.459> that's<00:03:31.700> most<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.989> most<00:03:33.200> likely

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
the tooth that's most the most likely

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.780 
the tooth that's most the most likely
incisor<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.459> have<00:03:34.639> two<00:03:35.000> canals<00:03:35.389> and<00:03:36.160> two<00:03:37.160> roots

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
incisor to have two canals and two roots

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.729 
incisor to have two canals and two roots
that's<00:03:38.180> important<00:03:38.810> at<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.019> end<00:03:39.049> in<00:03:39.590> there

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
that's important at the end in there

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.949 
that's important at the end in there
because<00:03:40.010> if<00:03:40.160> it<00:03:40.310> was<00:03:40.459> just<00:03:40.730> you<00:03:41.239> know<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.510> two

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
because if it was just you know the two

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.409 
because if it was just you know the two
canals<00:03:42.370> we<00:03:43.370> might<00:03:43.579> think<00:03:43.760> about<00:03:43.880> them<00:03:44.239> and

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
canals we might think about them and

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.800 
canals we might think about them and
dibbler<00:03:44.870> centrioles<00:03:45.470> but<00:03:46.180> two<00:03:47.180> canals<00:03:47.569> and

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
dibbler centrioles but two canals and

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.970 
dibbler centrioles but two canals and
two<00:03:48.019> roots<00:03:48.609> it's<00:03:49.609> gonna<00:03:49.790> be<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:51.500> mandibular

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
two roots it's gonna be the mandibular

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.210 
two roots it's gonna be the mandibular
lateral<00:03:52.879> and<00:03:53.540> there's<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.410> there<00:03:54.889> are

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
lateral and there's a there are

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.460 
lateral and there's a there are
cavities<00:03:55.790> on<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.030> mesial<00:03:56.299> and<00:03:56.720> distal<00:03:56.810> of<00:03:57.349> the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
cavities on the mesial and distal of the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.140 
cavities on the mesial and distal of the
root<00:03:57.680> so<00:03:57.859> you<00:03:57.889> can<00:03:58.040> see<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.430> right<00:03:58.579> here<00:03:58.639> this

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
root so you can see that right here this

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.069 
root so you can see that right here this
little<00:03:59.769> concavity<00:04:00.769> right<00:04:01.129> there

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
little concavity right there

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.970 
little concavity right there
alright<00:04:03.079> that's<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.470> end<00:04:03.590> of<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.739> video

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980
