whether<00:00:00.570> you<00:00:00.840> are<00:00:00.989> fast<00:00:01.290> or<00:00:01.770> slow<00:00:02.070> you<00:00:02.790> can

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
whether you are fast or slow you can

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.970 
whether you are fast or slow you can
always<00:00:03.210> get<00:00:03.510> faster<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.170> you<00:00:04.290> always<00:00:04.560> should

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
always get faster and you always should

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.820 
always get faster and you always should
be<00:00:05.640> working<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.210> get<00:00:06.359> faster<00:00:06.839> so<00:00:07.049> just<00:00:07.710> because

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
be working to get faster so just because

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.560 
be working to get faster so just because
you<00:00:08.220> may<00:00:08.400> not<00:00:08.700> be<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.970> fastest<00:00:09.300> player<00:00:09.420> on

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
you may not be the fastest player on

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.430 
you may not be the fastest player on
your<00:00:09.660> team<00:00:09.719> you're<00:00:09.960> one<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.230> slower

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
your team you're one of the slower

your team you're one of the slower
players<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.950> always<00:00:11.340> felt<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.849> you've<00:00:12.000> been

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
players you always felt that you've been

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.150 
players you always felt that you've been
one<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.480> slower<00:00:12.840> players<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.860> doesn't

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
one of the slower players that doesn't

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.379 
one of the slower players that doesn't
mean<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.460> can't<00:00:14.700> be<00:00:14.849> fast<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.269> you're

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
mean that you can't be fast and you're

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.970 
mean that you can't be fast and you're
never<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.809> be<00:00:15.929> fast<00:00:16.170> all<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.619> comes<00:00:16.800> down

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
never going to be fast all it comes down

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.400 
never going to be fast all it comes down
to<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:18.150> put<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.750> training<00:00:19.199> on<00:00:19.320> your

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
to is you put it in the training on your

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.429 
to is you put it in the training on your
own<00:00:19.470> making<00:00:20.369> your<00:00:20.670> body<00:00:20.939> stronger<00:00:21.570> working<00:00:22.289> on

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
own making your body stronger working on

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.620 
own making your body stronger working on
your<00:00:22.650> running<00:00:22.980> technique<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.820> that's<00:00:24.449> what

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
your running technique and that's what

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.970 
your running technique and that's what
I'm<00:00:24.720> going<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.900> talk<00:00:25.109> about<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.680> video

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
I'm going to talk about in this video

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.679 
I'm going to talk about in this video
and<00:00:26.130> then<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.519> top<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.880> all<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.330> have<00:00:27.539> to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
and then on top of all that you have to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.359 
and then on top of all that you have to
clean<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> work<00:00:28.109> even<00:00:28.800> if<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.130> how<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
clean the work even if you know how to

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.040 
clean the work even if you know how to
run<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> strong<00:00:30.300> body<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.900> don't

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
run you have a strong body but you don't

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.959 
run you have a strong body but you don't
practice<00:00:31.320> running<00:00:31.890> you're<00:00:32.460> not<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.910> be

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
practice running you're not going to be

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.310 
practice running you're not going to be
fast<00:00:37.399> in<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.910> video<00:00:39.239> I'm<00:00:39.480> going<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.840> discuss

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
fast in this video I'm going to discuss

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.040 
fast in this video I'm going to discuss
running<00:00:40.950> technique<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.660> important

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
running technique that is so important

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
running technique that is so important
that<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.500> being<00:00:43.710> efficient<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.579> your

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
that you are being efficient with your

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.479 
that you are being efficient with your
movement<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.480> your<00:00:45.800> movement<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.980> side<00:00:47.250> to

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
movement if your movement is side to

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.940 
movement if your movement is side to
side<00:00:47.700> rather<00:00:48.090> than<00:00:48.510> forward<00:00:49.440> or<00:00:49.590> frontal

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
side rather than forward or frontal

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.200 
side rather than forward or frontal
movement<00:00:50.370> you're<00:00:50.489> going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.700> waste<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.030> lot<00:00:51.059> of

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
movement you're going to waste a lot of

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.400 
movement you're going to waste a lot of
energy<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.660> you're<00:00:51.780> not<00:00:51.930> going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.230> as

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
energy and you're not going to be as

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.000 
energy and you're not going to be as
fast<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:57.109> the<00:00:58.109> first<00:00:58.140> concept<00:00:58.890> I

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
fast as you can be the first concept I

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.819 
fast as you can be the first concept I
want<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.370> talk<00:00:59.550> about<00:00:59.699> is<00:01:00.050> keeping<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.620> upper

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
want to talk about is keeping your upper

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.210 
want to talk about is keeping your upper
body<00:01:02.250> above<00:01:03.090> or<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.539> front<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:05.040> lower

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
body above or in front of your lower

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.820 
body above or in front of your lower
body<00:01:05.519> especially<00:01:06.330> when<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.080> are<00:01:07.170> starting<00:01:07.500> if

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
body especially when you are starting if

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.899 
body especially when you are starting if
you<00:01:08.040> want<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.790> good

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
you want to have a really good

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.390 
you want to have a really good
acceleration<00:01:09.240> fast<00:01:09.900> off<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.200> line<00:01:10.320> fast<00:01:11.189> from

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
acceleration fast off the line fast from

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.880 
acceleration fast off the line fast from
the<00:01:11.460> standstill<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:13.049> always<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.710> keep

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the standstill you always have to keep

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.010 
the standstill you always have to keep
your<00:01:14.040> lower<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.580> your<00:01:14.939> upper<00:01:15.240> body<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.659> front

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
your lower but your upper body in front

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.810 
your lower but your upper body in front
of<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:16.860> lower<00:01:17.040> body<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.549> you're<00:01:17.670> running

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
of your lower body when you're running

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.870 
of your lower body when you're running
as<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.390> pick<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.750> speed<00:01:19.280> that's<00:01:20.280> when<00:01:20.520> I'll<00:01:20.640> come

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
as I pick up speed that's when I'll come

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.179 
as I pick up speed that's when I'll come
up<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.869> I'll<00:01:22.020> stay<00:01:22.200> forward<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:22.619> even<00:01:22.920> still

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
up and I'll stay forward but even still

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.380 
up and I'll stay forward but even still
you<00:01:23.369> want<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> try<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> keep<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.180> lean

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
you want to try to keep your lean

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.590 
you want to try to keep your lean
forward<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.400> this<00:01:26.400> will<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:26.790> produce<00:01:27.030> more

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
forward and this will just produce more

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.380 
forward and this will just produce more
more<00:01:28.290> energy<00:01:28.680> more<00:01:28.950> power<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.700> more<00:01:29.759> forward

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
more energy more power and more forward

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.340 
more energy more power and more forward
momentum

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.929 

the<00:01:35.350> next<00:01:35.619> thing<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:35.799> want<00:01:36.009> to<00:01:36.040> talk<00:01:36.220> about<00:01:36.549> is

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
the next thing I want to talk about is

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.749 
the next thing I want to talk about is
the<00:01:37.630> way<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:37.840> plant<00:01:38.320> your<00:01:38.560> feet<00:01:38.799> you<00:01:39.580> should

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
the way you plant your feet you should

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.249 
the way you plant your feet you should
be<00:01:39.850> landing<00:01:40.150> on<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.509> balls<00:01:40.750> of<00:01:40.930> your<00:01:41.110> feet

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
be landing on the balls of your feet

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.840 
be landing on the balls of your feet
rather<00:01:41.619> than<00:01:41.770> your<00:01:42.159> soil<00:01:42.399> and<00:01:42.549> what<00:01:42.700> most

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
rather than your soil and what most

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.310 
rather than your soil and what most
people<00:01:43.119> do<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:43.479> if<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:43.720> ever<00:01:43.869> get<00:01:44.080> shin

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
people do and if you ever get shin

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.990 
people do and if you ever get shin
splints<00:01:44.649> is<00:01:45.100> probably<00:01:45.549> because<00:01:45.820> you're
