00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello everyone with you cuirassier we continue 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.359
 play hunger games on the demon card 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.809
 pliz 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.230
 so where to go let's start from the center 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:18.000
 runs there 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:21.199
 one man horseradish took off not 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.590
 understand where but even there was not seen 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:33.320
 I still started to push this cock 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:36.690
 half also with us here with arrows and 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:43.370
 who is good so should throw all sorts 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.370
 lamps lava and he jumped from there 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.440
 since all the places have already been dismantled 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.890
 go here on principle is enough 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.220
 not a bad place as we have here all the more 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:00.050
 they have it all you can reset 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.309
 of course there is hardly where everything flew away 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.700
 it is necessary but still the way I have it sucks 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.690
 weapons still circling i dropped that sword so 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:16.460
 I saw Tariq wrote that you can from the bow 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:21.860
 touch but no and the fishing rod does not go astray 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:28.610
 full protection whip and now I'm for 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:32.619
 this is you three years lost the sword of the village 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.469
 so too boots 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:39.920
 it is good that I noticed in time that behind me 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:42.710
 shadowing well rather by that time it is already 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.759
 it is not the flash drive that is the attack 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.240
 some kind of okay gotta go down 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:54.259
 let's start right roots don't start a 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:59.469
 let's continue wow, that's good here 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.469
 they now have a good sword 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.880
 Yes of course 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:11.080
 a little weird start okay 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.590
 climb and watch the chests here 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.900
 exactly the same less important take away from the bottom 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.870
 in my opinion oh, no, you go there 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:28.060
 Immediately 2 iron still kolchuzhnaya 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:33.540
 clothes left to find pants but shoes 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.540
 in principle, it is also possible to fit the bottom 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.650
 he expected that 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:51.400
 then as whom you run is not clear 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:54.160
 yes just not in lava your things I do not want 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.340
 so they hit the lava so I don't want 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.200
 Now kill here but I will not have 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.200
 Well, what the fuck damn 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.050
 how could you not here merge that 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.910
 in any case, things you probably 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:18.630
 scattered and fell into lava bolin well 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:26.580
 okay lost a few things and kidneys 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:28.680
 you need to be fine someone has fruit here 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.830
 Kim is a man of three people so you 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.830
 kidding 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:45.690
 one of them iron sword okay without 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:48.880
 lighters oh no pants this joke 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.540
 The main thing is that what the fuck he with 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.690
 With a diamond sword, she is to let that dude 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.360
 was in time with those 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:04.860
 Well, go here if you pretend that we 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.860
 two so 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:14.380
 I'll run off wait a little tactic what 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:28.110
 what I did not want guys to be so 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:31.300
 it happened where the sword well ka I thought that 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.140
 happen a little bit different honest 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.800
 the word therefore 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.800
 well how did it happen 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:49.980
 another guy came out of a bye now they 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:54.250
 they want me to merge this life 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:59.020
 little there still someone shot with what 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:03.630
 hand damn where I shoot at all 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.630
 I do not understand in the morning at all somehow it 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.370
 arm 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.370
 let's go back 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:19.880
 Okay, I'll get ready and think something from 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.880
 this will come out so 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.670
 fine 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:33.210
 data 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:38.189
 the battle of -1 began but its just plain 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.199
 I finished it so I thought it would go so far 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:44.490
 that I will not shoot a little bit closer 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:51.300
 although he runs in a straight line if now 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:55.129
 got engineering flew to where is she or 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.129
 no he's standing here 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.699
 I wash my one more one okay 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.530
 so what 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:18.950
 Palin in general simply shock sometimes from their 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:29.330
 same countries philosopher pilot it was clearly 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:35.030
 real sometimes shocked well did not hit great 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:36.890
 burned out gorgeous I'm just in shock with me 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.810
 here is something real 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:43.340
 all my life when I played some 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:46.160
 games then on starcraft then really rushing 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.590
 me, that is, I myself often do not even 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.050
 the fact that opponents come across something better 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.310
 worse namely just feeling 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.900
 and were assembled 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:07:00.850
 then I like the other way around 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:03.110
 how to say on some kind of relaxed and 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:07.370
 let's say now I feel I don't feel that 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:10.060
 I'm good at me sometimes straight 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.060
 really rushing 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.670
 so I do not know but all my life so 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:21.100
 up then down goes such a strip of men 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:23.110
 and some of them play as they say 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.090
 constantly good so they play nectar 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:31.960
 constantly bad play constantly bad 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:34.120
 play in principle with this there burned the floor 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:39.850
 it turns out well that did not go on 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:43.570
 the glass is very good everything is ready well yes 

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:46.060
 interesting enough to get the game well 

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.590
 In general, on this all the guys all big 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.230
