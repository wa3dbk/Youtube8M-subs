00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
of children who'd like to paint when

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.789 
of children who'd like to paint when
they<00:00:11.099> come<00:00:11.250> into<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.610> play<00:00:11.790> therapy<00:00:12.210> room

they come into the play therapy room
finding<00:00:13.820> smocks<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.389> were<00:00:15.630> relatively

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
finding smocks that were relatively

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.650 
finding smocks that were relatively
inexpensive<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.250> easy<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.940> maintain<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.570> not

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
inexpensive and easy to maintain and not

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.750 
inexpensive and easy to maintain and not
have<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.960> replace<00:00:19.230> frequently<00:00:19.800> was<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> bit<00:00:20.670> of

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
have to replace frequently was a bit of

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.509 
have to replace frequently was a bit of
a<00:00:20.850> challenge<00:00:21.529> so<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.560> came<00:00:22.800> up<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> easy

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
a challenge so I came up with the easy

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.570 
a challenge so I came up with the easy
solution<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.050> paint<00:00:25.560> smock<00:00:25.949> made<00:00:26.340> out

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
solution this is a paint smock made out

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.779 
solution this is a paint smock made out
of<00:00:26.849> an<00:00:26.970> old<00:00:27.119> hand<00:00:27.689> towel<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.740> size<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> good

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
of an old hand towel this size is a good

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.840 
of an old hand towel this size is a good
size<00:00:30.060> fit<00:00:30.449> for<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> preschool<00:00:31.380> age<00:00:31.740> child<00:00:32.099> if<00:00:32.489> we

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
size fit for a preschool age child if we

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.400 
size fit for a preschool age child if we
used<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.090> regular<00:00:33.510> size<00:00:33.780> towel<00:00:34.050> with<00:00:34.380> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
used a regular size towel with a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.590 
used a regular size towel with a
preschooler<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.100> would<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.309> too<00:00:35.910> long<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.540> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
preschooler it would be too long and it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.970 
preschooler it would be too long and it
would<00:00:36.690> probably<00:00:37.110> drag<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> floor<00:00:37.920> in

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
would probably drag on the floor in

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.200 
would probably drag on the floor in
front<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.280> them<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.640> could<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> safety

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
front of them and that could be a safety

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.780 
front of them and that could be a safety
hazard<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:40.320> an<00:00:40.410> older<00:00:40.680> child<00:00:40.790> you're

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
hazard with an older child you're

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.639 
hazard with an older child you're
probably<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.329> I'm<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.960> want<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.350> use<00:00:43.620> a

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
probably what I'm going to want to use a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.709 
probably what I'm going to want to use a
larger<00:00:44.219> towel<00:00:44.550> probably<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> bath

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
larger towel probably more like a bath

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.010 
larger towel probably more like a bath
size<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.190> take<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> towel<00:00:48.149> much<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.870> this

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
size so you take a towel much like this

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.900 
size so you take a towel much like this
one<00:00:49.520> fold<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:51.000> top<00:00:51.629> down<00:00:52.020> about<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.100> far<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
one fold the top down about this far and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.830 
one fold the top down about this far and
you<00:00:54.780> could<00:00:54.930> use<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> pencil<00:00:55.920> or<00:00:56.399> marker<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:57.449> draw

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
you could use a pencil or marker to draw

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.709 
you could use a pencil or marker to draw
a<00:00:58.170> semicircle<00:00:58.760> where<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.000> want<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.359> cut<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
a semicircle where you want to cut the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.750 
a semicircle where you want to cut the
hole<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.469> use<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> really<00:01:02.190> sharp<00:01:02.430> scissor

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
hole you use a really sharp scissor

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.359 
hole you use a really sharp scissor
something<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.690> will<00:01:03.870> cut<00:01:04.110> through<00:01:04.369> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
something that will cut through the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.899 
something that will cut through the
terrycloth

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
terrycloth

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.969 
terrycloth
fabric<00:01:06.360> I'm<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.990> gonna<00:01:07.080> eyeball<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.770> one

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
that is then you're limiting the amount

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.510 
that is then you're limiting the amount
of<00:02:36.870> paint<00:02:37.200> that's<00:02:37.380> available<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.100> child<00:02:38.370> to
