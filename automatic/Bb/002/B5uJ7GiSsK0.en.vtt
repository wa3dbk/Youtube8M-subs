00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
question about that you know a lot of

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.260 
question about that you know a lot of
our<00:01:03.679> crews<00:01:03.920> were<00:01:04.189> already<00:01:07.030> committed<00:01:08.030> at<00:01:08.090> that

our crews were already committed at that
point<00:01:08.740> but<00:01:09.740> I<00:01:09.979> think<00:01:10.490> it<00:01:10.780> gains<00:01:11.780> some<00:01:12.049> interest

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
point but I think it gains some interest

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.410 
point but I think it gains some interest
in<00:01:12.590> momentum<00:01:12.979> from<00:01:13.310> some<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:13.880> maybe<00:01:14.090> we're

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
in momentum from some that maybe we're

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.389 
in momentum from some that maybe we're
5050<00:01:14.930> weren't<00:01:15.500> really<00:01:15.680> sure<00:01:15.770> where<00:01:16.189> they<00:01:16.310> were

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
5050 weren't really sure where they were

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.039 
5050 weren't really sure where they were
going<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.610> take<00:01:16.759> that<00:01:16.939> last<00:01:17.299> one<00:01:17.750> or<00:01:17.869> two

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
going to take that last one or two

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.500 
going to take that last one or two
visits

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.680 

signing<00:01:24.410> day<00:01:24.560> is<00:01:24.830> what<00:01:25.580> we<00:01:25.700> call<00:01:25.910> game<00:01:26.180> 15

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
signing day is what we call game 15

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.480 
signing day is what we call game 15
because<00:01:26.930> this<00:01:27.380> really<00:01:27.620> kind<00:01:27.890> of<00:01:28.010> culminates

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
because this really kind of culminates
