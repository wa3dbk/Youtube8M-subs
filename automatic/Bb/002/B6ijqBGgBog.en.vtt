there<00:01:55.290> was<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> problem<00:01:55.860> with<00:01:56.159> GPS<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
there was a problem with GPS and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.100 
there was a problem with GPS and
whatever<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.770> was<00:01:58.890> pretty<00:01:59.100> fast<00:01:59.310> shipping

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
whatever but it was pretty fast shipping

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.960 
whatever but it was pretty fast shipping
and<00:02:01.230> it<00:02:01.440> says<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:03.290> this<00:02:04.290> wake<00:02:04.620> is<00:02:05.040> heat<00:02:05.640> safe

and it says that this wake is heat safe
up<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.740> 400Â°<00:02:08.570> so<00:02:09.570> that's<00:02:10.350> good

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.000 

this<00:02:14.520> here<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.180> about<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.780> think<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.230> about<00:02:16.440> 16

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
this here is about I think is about 16

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.100 
this here is about I think is about 16
inches<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:18.380> think<00:02:19.380> it's<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.740> bit<00:02:19.950> everyday<00:02:20.750> Lin<00:02:21.750> I

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
inches I think it's a bit everyday Lin I

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.770 
inches I think it's a bit everyday Lin I
like<00:02:22.890> really<00:02:23.550> long<00:02:23.730> hair<00:02:23.760> but<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.330> think<00:02:24.660> this

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
like really long hair but I think this

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.170 
like really long hair but I think this
is<00:02:24.990> pretty<00:02:25.260> conservative<00:02:25.860> length<00:02:26.340> for<00:02:26.640> work<00:02:26.850> I

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
is pretty conservative length for work I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.360 
is pretty conservative length for work I
don't<00:02:27.720> think<00:02:27.960> it's<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.200> shiny<00:02:28.560> actually<00:02:29.340> I

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
don't think it's that shiny actually I

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.300 
don't think it's that shiny actually I
think<00:02:29.610> it's<00:02:29.850> kind<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.210> natural<00:02:31.160> shingle<00:02:32.160> to

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
think it's kind of a natural shingle to

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.850 
think it's kind of a natural shingle to
it<00:02:32.490> it's<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.880> like<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.480> lot<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.560> weeks<00:02:34.710> that

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
it it's not like a lot of weeks that

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.620 
it it's not like a lot of weeks that
I've<00:02:35.070> seen<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.490> they're<00:02:35.700> super<00:02:35.910> shiny<00:02:36.330> you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
I've seen that they're super shiny you

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.660 
I've seen that they're super shiny you
got<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.840> put<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.050> lot<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.440> baby<00:02:37.650> powder<00:02:37.890> on<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.340> to

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
got to put a lot of baby powder on it to

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.940 
got to put a lot of baby powder on it to
even<00:02:38.940> look<00:02:39.900> sorta<00:02:40.380> believable<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:42.620> yeah<00:02:43.620> I

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
even look sorta believable so yeah I

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.320 
even look sorta believable so yeah I
think<00:02:44.130> it's<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.640> pretty<00:02:44.850> natural<00:02:45.120> time<00:02:46.100> this<00:02:47.330> is

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
think it's a pretty natural time this is

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.420 
think it's a pretty natural time this is
a<00:02:48.420> realistic<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:50.420> think<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:52.280> sorta<00:02:53.280> is

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
a realistic I think it sorta is

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.970 
a realistic I think it sorta is
realistic<00:02:54.209> but<00:02:54.990> you<00:02:55.290> definitely<00:02:55.740> have<00:02:55.860> to

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
realistic but you definitely have to

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.280 
realistic but you definitely have to
tweak<00:02:56.250> your<00:02:56.280> life<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:57.540> lace<00:02:58.020> oh<00:03:00.080> I'm<00:03:01.080> just

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
tweak your life this lace oh I'm just

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.890 
tweak your life this lace oh I'm just
having<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:01.830> much<00:03:02.209> such<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.240> difficult<00:03:03.750> time

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
having so much such a difficult time

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.170 
having so much such a difficult time
trying<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.500> make<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.860> lace<00:03:05.160> look<00:03:05.459> real<00:03:05.730> like

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
trying to make this lace look real like

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.699 
trying to make this lace look real like
I<00:03:06.510> took<00:03:07.050> out<00:03:07.200> my<00:03:07.230> edges<00:03:07.860> around<00:03:08.370> here<00:03:09.530> but<00:03:10.530> my

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
I took out my edges around here but my

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.140 
I took out my edges around here but my
hair<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.190> dark<00:03:12.230> off<00:03:13.230> black<00:03:13.769> and<00:03:14.130> this<00:03:14.880> hair

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
hair is a dark off black and this hair

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.650 
hair is a dark off black and this hair
is<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.300> number<00:03:15.540> four<00:03:16.100> so<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.489> kind<00:03:18.360> of<00:03:18.450> try<00:03:18.630> to

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
is the number four so I kind of try to

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.170 
is the number four so I kind of try to
put<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.080> on<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.620> root<00:03:20.070> up<00:03:20.310> here<00:03:20.580> just<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.030> could

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
put it on a root up here just so I could

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.470 
put it on a root up here just so I could
blend<00:03:21.510> my<00:03:21.660> hair<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:23.430> think<00:03:23.670> it's<00:03:23.790> sort<00:03:24.239> of

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
blend my hair and I think it's sort of

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.160 
blend my hair and I think it's sort of
working<00:03:24.690> but<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.730> don't<00:03:26.730> know<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.110> instead<00:03:28.110> of

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
working but I don't know and instead of

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.780 
working but I don't know and instead of
cutting<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.830> lace<00:03:29.040> just<00:03:29.280> like<00:03:29.459> straight

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
cutting the lace just like straight

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.150 
cutting the lace just like straight
across<00:03:30.000> when<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.510> cut<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.900> off<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.350> tried<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:32.040> do

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
across when you cut it off I tried to do

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.460 
across when you cut it off I tried to do
a<00:03:32.190> B<00:03:32.519> inside<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.690> would<00:03:33.840> kind<00:03:34.080> of<00:03:34.140> be<00:03:34.290> like<00:03:34.320> a

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
a B inside so it would kind of be like a

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.759 
a B inside so it would kind of be like a
smoother<00:03:35.010> transition<00:03:36.620> into<00:03:37.620> that<00:03:38.420> lace<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.680> I

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
smoother transition into that lace and I

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.420 
smoother transition into that lace and I
don't<00:03:40.830> have<00:03:41.130> any<00:03:41.310> makeup<00:03:41.459> on<00:03:41.820> right<00:03:42.890> on<00:03:43.890> that

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
don't have any makeup on right on that

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.960 
don't have any makeup on right on that
part

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
part

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.060 
part
so<00:03:45.230> probably<00:03:46.230> why<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.380> looks<00:03:46.650> kind<00:03:46.860> of<00:03:46.890> weird

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
so probably why it looks kind of weird

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.229 
so probably why it looks kind of weird
now<00:03:47.340> but<00:03:47.670> anyway<00:03:49.280> this<00:03:50.280> bag<00:03:50.640> is<00:03:50.940> pretty

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
now but anyway this bag is pretty

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.300 
now but anyway this bag is pretty
awesome

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
awesome

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.450 
awesome
it<00:03:52.820> came<00:03:53.090> kind<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.540> like<00:03:53.690> flip<00:03:53.990> back<00:03:54.260> but<00:03:57.460> kind

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
it came kind of like flip back but kind

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.970 
it came kind of like flip back but kind
of<00:03:58.520> Lex<00:03:58.870> straightened<00:03:59.870> down<00:03:59.990> lose<00:04:00.230> it

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.520 

and<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.130> was<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.280> longer<00:04:04.580> piece<00:04:04.970> right<00:04:05.510> here<00:04:05.570> but

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
and it was a longer piece right here but

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.650 
and it was a longer piece right here but
I<00:04:06.590> kind<00:04:06.830> of<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.220> cut<00:04:07.610> it<00:04:07.730> a<00:04:07.850> little<00:04:07.880> bit<00:04:08.270> just<00:04:08.570> so

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
I kind of I cut it a little bit just so

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.110 
I kind of I cut it a little bit just so
I<00:04:08.810> could<00:04:09.020> get<00:04:09.230> more<00:04:09.860> of<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.070> bang<00:04:10.340> I<00:04:10.700> might<00:04:11.000> even

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
I could get more of a bang I might even

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.180 
I could get more of a bang I might even
cut<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.480> little<00:04:11.840> bit<00:04:14.320> but<00:04:15.320> I<00:04:15.350> love<00:04:15.709> this<00:04:15.920> style

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
cut a little bit but I love this style

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.670 
cut a little bit but I love this style
I'm<00:04:16.820> always<00:04:16.970> looking<00:04:17.359> for<00:04:17.390> great<00:04:17.750> styles<00:04:18.470> that

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
I'm always looking for great styles that

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.750 
I'm always looking for great styles that
are<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:21.260> can<00:04:21.500> cover<00:04:21.769> up<00:04:21.980> my<00:04:22.100> forehead<00:04:22.550> to

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
are that can cover up my forehead to

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.110 
are that can cover up my forehead to
that<00:04:22.940> perfect<00:04:23.620> something<00:04:24.850> I'm<00:04:25.850> kind<00:04:26.000> of

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
that perfect something I'm kind of

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.700 
that perfect something I'm kind of
self-conscious<00:04:26.690> about<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.140> I<00:04:27.169> try<00:04:27.440> to<00:04:27.500> cover

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
self-conscious about so I try to cover

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.550 
self-conscious about so I try to cover
up<00:04:27.830> before<00:04:27.980> the<00:04:28.340> edges<00:04:28.760> I<00:04:29.270> just<00:04:30.260> think<00:04:30.440> this

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
up before the edges I just think this

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.980 
up before the edges I just think this
works<00:04:30.800> is<00:04:30.950> really<00:04:31.100> good<00:04:31.430> but<00:04:32.120> there<00:04:32.540> are<00:04:32.690> some

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
works is really good but there are some

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.710 
works is really good but there are some
cons<00:04:33.790> this<00:04:34.790> week<00:04:35.120> sheds<00:04:36.020> like<00:04:36.940> crazy<00:04:37.940> and<00:04:38.600> I

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
cons this week sheds like crazy and I

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.330 
cons this week sheds like crazy and I
mean<00:04:38.990> I've<00:04:39.500> only<00:04:39.680> had<00:04:39.890> this<00:04:40.040> wig<00:04:41.890> since<00:04:42.890> Monday

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
mean I've only had this wig since Monday

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.550 
mean I've only had this wig since Monday
and<00:04:43.580> it's<00:04:43.730> Thursday<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.630> I've<00:04:45.080> been<00:04:45.350> wearing

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
and it's Thursday and I've been wearing

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.750 
and it's Thursday and I've been wearing
it<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.860> work<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.880> sheds<00:04:47.240> so<00:04:47.750> much<00:04:48.470> I<00:04:48.980> don't

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
it to work and it sheds so much I don't

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.340 
it to work and it sheds so much I don't
know<00:04:49.940> if<00:04:50.090> it's<00:04:50.270> because<00:04:50.480> I<00:04:50.750> plucked<00:04:51.110> out<00:04:51.320> a

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
know if it's because I plucked out a

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.720 
know if it's because I plucked out a
little<00:04:51.710> bit<00:04:51.919> of<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.460> part<00:04:52.790> up<00:04:53.060> here<00:04:53.510> but<00:04:54.730> it's

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
little bit of the part up here but it's

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.840 
little bit of the part up here but it's
probably<00:04:56.060> not<00:04:56.240> that<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:56.870> sheds<00:04:57.620> a<00:04:57.890> lot<00:04:58.280> so<00:04:58.729> if

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
probably not that it sheds a lot so if

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.030 
probably not that it sheds a lot so if
you<00:04:59.090> is<00:04:59.900> that<00:05:00.110> bothers<00:05:00.500> you<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:00.710> probably

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
you is that bothers you you probably
