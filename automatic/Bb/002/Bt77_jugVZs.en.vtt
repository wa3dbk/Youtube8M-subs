00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
am still working off the prototype i

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.759 
am still working off the prototype i
have<00:00:52.470> no<00:00:52.710> reason<00:00:53.040> or<00:00:53.519> need<00:00:53.790> to<00:00:54.210> replace<00:00:54.570> it

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
have no reason or need to replace it

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.910 
have no reason or need to replace it
it's<00:00:55.769> not<00:00:55.980> as<00:00:56.250> refined<00:00:57.019> but<00:00:58.019> it's<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.769> as

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
it's not as refined but it's just as

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.330 
it's not as refined but it's just as
strong<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.519> working<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.210> well<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:01.830> one

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
strong and working just as well the one

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.549 
strong and working just as well the one
shortcoming<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> bitch

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
shortcoming that I have with the bitch

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.280 
shortcoming that I have with the bitch
and<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.100> pretty<00:01:05.369> minor<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> router

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and it's pretty minor is as a router

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.060 
and it's pretty minor is as a router
table<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.920> was<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.210> build<00:01:09.540> myself<00:01:10.020> as<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
table I was going to build myself as a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.999 
table I was going to build myself as a
similar<00:01:11.910> table<00:01:12.149> a<00:01:12.450> smaller<00:01:12.750> version<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.350> this

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
similar table a smaller version of this

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.609 
similar table a smaller version of this
to<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> separate<00:01:15.030> router<00:01:15.450> table<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.590> I

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
to be a separate router table but I

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.070 
to be a separate router table but I
decided<00:01:17.039> since<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.820> work<00:01:18.210> by<00:01:18.390> myself<00:01:18.810> or

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
decided since I work by myself or

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.660 
decided since I work by myself or
sometimes<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.649> just<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> couple<00:01:20.039> of<00:01:20.250> guys<00:01:20.369> I

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
sometimes with just a couple of guys I

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.180 
sometimes with just a couple of guys I
want<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.300> keep<00:01:21.450> my<00:01:22.020> setup<00:01:22.289> small<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.979> simple

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
want to keep my setup small and simple

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.700 
want to keep my setup small and simple
and<00:01:23.550> I<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:24.300> need<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> router<00:01:25.020> table<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and I don't need a router table that

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.100 
and I don't need a router table that
often<00:01:26.190> so<00:01:26.670> what<00:01:26.880> I've<00:01:27.000> decided<00:01:27.300> to<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.660> is<00:01:27.690> add

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
often so what I've decided to do is add

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.040 
often so what I've decided to do is add
a<00:01:28.470> drop-in<00:01:29.130> plate<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.300> fairly<00:01:30.899> large

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
a drop-in plate with a fairly large

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.410 
a drop-in plate with a fairly large
router<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.649> three<00:01:31.979> plus<00:01:32.220> horsepower<00:01:32.430> router

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
router a three plus horsepower router

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.380 
router a three plus horsepower router
with<00:01:34.200> electronic<00:01:34.890> speed<00:01:35.490> control<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> can

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
with electronic speed control so I can

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.810 
with electronic speed control so I can
turn<00:01:36.600> some<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.140> big<00:01:37.320> bits<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.430> want<00:01:38.700> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
turn some of the big bits if I want to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.200 
turn some of the big bits if I want to
build<00:01:39.200> cabinet<00:01:40.200> doors<00:01:40.439> or<00:01:40.950> run<00:01:41.640> some<00:01:41.850> larger

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
build cabinet doors or run some larger

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.000 
build cabinet doors or run some larger
moldings<00:01:42.630> as<00:01:42.780> well<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.439> do<00:01:43.619> some<00:01:43.650> of<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
moldings as well as do some of the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.490 
moldings as well as do some of the
smaller<00:01:44.340> bits<00:01:44.790> where<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.390> join<00:01:45.930> an<00:01:46.140> edge<00:01:46.290> or

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
smaller bits where I can join an edge or

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.030 
smaller bits where I can join an edge or
something<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:49.140> revision

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
something like that so that revision

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.340 
something like that so that revision
will<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.729> made<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> new<00:01:52.110> bench

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
will is made to the to the new bench

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.960 
will is made to the to the new bench
that<00:01:52.530> I'm<00:01:52.650> going<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.830> build<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.220> there's<00:01:53.729> some

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
that I'm going to build and there's some

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.850 
that I'm going to build and there's some
minor<00:01:54.420> differences<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.170> how<00:01:55.619> it's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
minor differences in how it's

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.890 
minor differences in how it's
constructed<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.909> simplify<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.630> little<00:01:57.659> bit

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
constructed to simplify it a little bit

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.410 
constructed to simplify it a little bit
and<00:01:58.229> also<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.340> little<00:01:59.759> bit<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.970> material

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
and also a little bit of material

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.520 
and also a little bit of material
changes<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.890> lighten<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.670> up<00:02:02.759> slightly<00:02:03.530> other

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
changes to lighten it up slightly other

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.380 
changes to lighten it up slightly other
than<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.250> same<00:02:05.310> bench<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.119> was

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
than that it's the same bench that was

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.630 
than that it's the same bench that was
that<00:02:06.810> has<00:02:06.990> been<00:02:07.229> available<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.519> I'm

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
that has been available so what I'm

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.880 
that has been available so what I'm
going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.790> do<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.079> record<00:02:10.079> the<00:02:10.170> process<00:02:10.380> of

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
going to do is record the process of

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.430 
going to do is record the process of
building<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.430> just<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.480> have<00:02:12.690> an<00:02:12.810> idea<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.200> what

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
building it just to have an idea of what

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.580 
building it just to have an idea of what
it<00:02:13.530> takes<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:15.079> we're<00:02:16.079> going<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.230> get<00:02:16.350> started

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
it takes and we're going to get started

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.210 
it takes and we're going to get started
the<00:02:17.220> plants<00:02:18.000> show<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.510> material<00:02:19.079> use<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:19.950> that

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
the plants show of material use so that

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.270 
the plants show of material use so that
I<00:02:20.579> can<00:02:21.150> get<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.420> most<00:02:21.600> efficient<00:02:22.110> cuts<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.220> I

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
I can get the most efficient cuts and I

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.240 
I can get the most efficient cuts and I
think<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:25.110> about<00:02:25.320> four<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.799> half<00:02:25.860> sheets

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
think it's about four and a half sheets

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.229 
think it's about four and a half sheets
of<00:02:26.459> half-inch<00:02:27.000> AC<00:02:27.660> ply<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:29.220> I'm<00:02:29.370> going<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.940> do

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
of half-inch AC ply so I'm going to do

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.620 
of half-inch AC ply so I'm going to do
all<00:02:30.269> my<00:02:30.420> ripping<00:02:31.049> first<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.769> half<00:02:31.950> inch

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
all my ripping first of the half inch

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.449 
all my ripping first of the half inch
the<00:02:33.630> existing<00:02:34.500> bench<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.860> I'm<00:02:35.010> using<00:02:35.220> to

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
the existing bench that I'm using to

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.220 
the existing bench that I'm using to
make<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.880> replacement<00:02:36.209> bench

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
make the replacement bench

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.119 
make the replacement bench
I've<00:02:37.980> been<00:02:38.370> using<00:02:38.610> these<00:02:39.830> strips<00:02:40.830> here

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
I've been using these strips here

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.949 
I've been using these strips here
they've<00:02:41.580> been<00:02:41.610> replaced<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.300> few<00:02:42.480> times<00:02:42.720> but

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
they've been replaced a few times but

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.050 
they've been replaced a few times but
they're<00:02:43.110> just<00:02:43.260> 3/4<00:02:43.830> inch<00:02:44.040> plywood

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
they're just 3/4 inch plywood

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.900 
they're just 3/4 inch plywood
that<00:02:45.540> they're<00:02:46.110> sacrificial<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.010> they<00:02:47.670> lay<00:02:47.790> on

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
that they're sacrificial and they lay on

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.310 
that they're sacrificial and they lay on
top<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.300> bench<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.780> can<00:02:48.990> see<00:02:49.140> this

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
top of the bench and you can see this

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.100 
top of the bench and you can see this
bench<00:02:49.530> being<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.070> couple<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.460> years<00:02:50.610> old

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
bench being a couple of years old

00:02:51.110 --> 00:03:37.199 
bench being a couple of years old
doesn't<00:02:52.110> have<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.350> cut<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.770> it<00:02:52.920> or<00:02:53.040> score<00:02:53.400> at<00:02:53.520> all

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.650 

tops<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.360> bottoms<00:03:38.720> cut<00:03:39.020> from<00:03:39.260> two<00:03:39.530> sheets<00:03:39.830> and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
tops and bottoms cut from two sheets and

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.170 
tops and bottoms cut from two sheets and
that's<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.870> fall-off<00:03:42.610> okay<00:03:43.610> so<00:03:43.670> I<00:03:43.790> got<00:03:44.000> the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
that's the fall-off okay so I got the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.000 
that's the fall-off okay so I got the
tops<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:44.959> bottoms<00:03:45.020> cut<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:45.830> now<00:03:45.860> I'm

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
tops and the bottoms cut so now I'm

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.010 
tops and the bottoms cut so now I'm
going<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:46.220> rip<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:47.330> sides<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.900> the

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
going to rip the the sides and the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.479 
going to rip the the sides and the
spreaders<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.739> spreaders<00:03:49.100> and<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.280> sides

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
spreaders the spreaders and the sides

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.120 
spreaders the spreaders and the sides
are<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.700> same<00:03:49.910> width<00:03:50.150> so<00:03:50.390> I'll<00:03:50.540> I'll<00:03:50.950> rip<00:03:51.950> them

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
are the same width so I'll I'll rip them

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.130 
are the same width so I'll I'll rip them
all<00:03:52.280> out<00:03:52.489> and<00:03:52.820> then<00:03:53.000> I'll<00:03:53.270> worry<00:03:53.840> about<00:03:54.020> all

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
all out and then I'll worry about all

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:32.320 
all out and then I'll worry about all
the<00:03:54.260> cross-cutting<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:55.670> separate<00:03:56.090> operation

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.140 

so<00:04:33.259> all<00:04:33.409> the<00:04:33.530> material<00:04:34.129> for<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.610> sides<00:04:34.909> and

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
so all the material for the sides and

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.170 
so all the material for the sides and
the<00:04:35.270> spreader<00:04:35.800> are<00:04:36.800> ripped<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:40.180> there's

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
the spreader are ripped and there's

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.140 
the spreader are ripped and there's
absolutely<00:04:41.750> no<00:04:42.379> waste<00:04:42.800> except<00:04:43.310> sawdust<00:04:43.879> and

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
absolutely no waste except sawdust and

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.510 
absolutely no waste except sawdust and
then<00:04:45.050> there's<00:04:45.319> this<00:04:45.530> leftover<00:04:45.979> strip<00:04:46.340> which

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
then there's this leftover strip which

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.330 
then there's this leftover strip which
would<00:04:46.639> be<00:04:46.759> used<00:04:46.970> for<00:04:47.360> some<00:04:48.080> other<00:04:48.879> parts<00:04:51.340> so

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
would be used for some other parts so

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.680 
would be used for some other parts so
that<00:04:52.370> was<00:04:52.759> a<00:04:53.949> two<00:04:54.949> sheets<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.940> do<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.240> tops<00:04:56.449> in

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
that was a two sheets to do the tops in

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.460 
that was a two sheets to do the tops in
the<00:04:56.780> bottoms<00:04:57.169> and<00:04:57.560> one<00:04:58.220> sheet<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.819> do<00:04:58.970> all<00:04:59.210> the

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
the bottoms and one sheet to do all the

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.800 
the bottoms and one sheet to do all the
spreaders<00:05:00.470> in<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:01.659> sides

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.330 

most<00:05:05.810> of<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:06.050> rips<00:05:06.229> are<00:05:06.440> done<00:05:06.620> so<00:05:07.099> I'm<00:05:07.190> going

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
most of the rips are done so I'm going

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:44.180 
most of the rips are done so I'm going
to<00:05:07.400> do<00:05:07.490> a<00:05:07.520> little<00:05:07.699> cross<00:05:07.940> cutting<00:05:08.270> now

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.379 

the<00:05:45.190> next<00:05:45.400> thing<00:05:45.550> I'm<00:05:45.639> going<00:05:45.759> to<00:05:45.819> do<00:05:45.970> before<00:05:46.360> I

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
the next thing I'm going to do before I

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.570 
the next thing I'm going to do before I
start<00:05:47.550> milling<00:05:48.550> all<00:05:48.789> the<00:05:48.970> parts<00:05:49.270> for<00:05:49.419> the<00:05:49.539> top

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
start milling all the parts for the top

00:05:50.580 --> 00:06:24.570 
start milling all the parts for the top
I'm<00:05:51.580> going<00:05:52.090> to<00:05:52.389> build<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:52.990> sawhorses

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.639
