 generated power 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.819
 this is important when cooking porridge with milk and 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:43.130
 bone broth meat in this process 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.170
 should be after a boil and remove 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.569
 formed foam quickly go to 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.340
 long and calm boil on 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.739
 electric stoves achieve this 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.359
 difficult in such a way cooking 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.370
 large number of servings 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.680
 on a powerful induction stove only 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.620
 significantly saves electricity but also 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.620
 allows you to achieve high taste 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.620
 characteristics 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.610
 previously used gas wok 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.770
 but now with the advent of new technologies 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.200
 they are increasingly being replaced by induction 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.160
 after loading crushed cold 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.260
 product in 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.269
 with hot vegetable oil she 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.549
 should boil again literally through 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.460
 three four seconds therefore never 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.050
 there were electric logs 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.880
 the emergence of induction technology like 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.600
 can not by the way come to the specific 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.100
 Asian Food Cooking 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.990
 real fragrant and tasty pilaf 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.460
 never succeed in ordinary 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.460

 half a thousand watts here you can 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.620
 set the required heating temperature 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.960
 and enable reverse timer after expiry 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.210
 whose stove shuts down exists 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.000
 dish serving which is made not on 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.830
 ordinary plates and in a pan in which 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.600
 they prepared the principle of action 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.150
 induction plates allows you to do this 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.160
 as a result, weight loss is reduced 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.760
 during heat treatment and the finished dish 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.630
 It turns juicy with a characteristic taste 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:19.120
 amazingly soft texture 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.700
 desktop wog unlike European 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.890
 but traditional for asian cuisine 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.020
 small fish meat 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.480
 vegetables and other foods require 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.140
 short but intense thermal 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.050
 processing 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:35.110
 the cook is constantly stirring fry and 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.060
 ingredients add sauces and spices 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.400
 the whole process of cooking 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.040
 passes quickly and looks very atr 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.080
 actively 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.970
 therefore, induction cookers are advantageous 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.330
 use in close proximity 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.040
 from preparations to wash the electric 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.770
 slab at the end of the shift 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.990
 not easy deal eliminating the winner
