00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
working with the same offense two years

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.310 
working with the same offense two years
straight<00:00:41.160> where<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.149> prior<00:00:42.600> years<00:00:42.660> he<00:00:43.170> had

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
straight where as in prior years he had

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.680 
straight where as in prior years he had
to<00:00:43.920> learn<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.100> whole<00:00:44.430> new<00:00:44.489> offensive<00:00:45.030> system<00:00:45.539> so

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
to learn a whole new offensive system so

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.100 
to learn a whole new offensive system so
this<00:00:45.840> should<00:00:46.020> benefit<00:00:46.670> Smith<00:00:47.670> who's

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
this should benefit Smith who's

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.369 
this should benefit Smith who's
notoriously<00:00:49.110> cerebral<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:51.239> had<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
notoriously cerebral and had the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.650 
notoriously cerebral and had the
tendency<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.860> hold<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> ball<00:00:53.660> because

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
tendency to hold on to the ball because

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.479 
tendency to hold on to the ball because
he<00:00:54.750> does<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> lot<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.199> thinking<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.039> being

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
he does a lot of thinking and so being

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.670 
he does a lot of thinking and so being
in<00:00:56.579> year<00:00:56.820> two<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.120> an<00:00:57.360> offense<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.020> think<00:00:58.590> it's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
in year two of an offense I think it's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.430 
in year two of an offense I think it's
going<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.949> more<00:00:59.100> automatic<00:00:59.609> for<00:00:59.940> him<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.440> I

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
going to be more automatic for him and I

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.439 
going to be more automatic for him and I
think<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.920> hope<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:03.090> know<00:01:03.180> he<00:01:03.300> left

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
think the hope is that you know he left

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.500 
think the hope is that you know he left
the<00:01:03.660> ball<00:01:04.080> fly<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> little<00:01:04.949> bit<00:01:05.040> more<00:01:05.390> get<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.010 
haven't been sort of wear and tear type
of<00:01:50.159> injury<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.729> think<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:51.540> part<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.899> it

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
of injury so I think you know part of it

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.569 
of injury so I think you know part of it
is<00:01:52.110> luck<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.590> know<00:01:52.710> whether<00:01:52.890> somebody<00:01:53.220> rolls

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
is luck you know whether somebody rolls

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.120 
is luck you know whether somebody rolls
on<00:01:53.820> your<00:01:53.970> ankle<00:01:54.270> wrong<00:01:54.680> so<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.979> know<00:01:56.070> you

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
on your ankle wrong so you know you

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.459 
on your ankle wrong so you know you
can't<00:01:56.399> really<00:01:56.579> plan<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:58.380> know

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
can't really plan for that but you know

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.420 
can't really plan for that but you know
he's<00:01:58.680> shown<00:01:59.250> no<00:01:59.549> signs<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.149> slowing<00:02:00.390> down<00:02:00.840> and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
he's shown no signs of slowing down and

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.980 
he's shown no signs of slowing down and
you<00:02:02.430> know<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> think<00:02:02.729> with<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.149> revamped

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
these great additions we got in the

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.140 
these great additions we got in the
draft<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:18.719> year<00:02:18.780> well<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:20.280> that's<00:02:20.549> a<00:02:20.790> big

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
draft this year well that that's a big

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.550 
draft this year well that that's a big
question<00:02:21.299> going<00:02:21.719> forward<00:02:21.810> one<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.439> those

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
question going forward one of those

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.530 
question going forward one of those
great<00:02:22.769> additions<00:02:23.459> actually<00:02:24.239> enter<00:02:24.510> the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
great additions actually enter the

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.830 
great additions actually enter the
lineup<00:02:25.079> you've<00:02:25.469> got<00:02:25.590> two<00:02:25.799> rookies<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:27.510> you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
lineup you've got two rookies and you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.360 
lineup you've got two rookies and you
know<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:27.959> think<00:02:28.379> there's<00:02:28.650> some<00:02:28.829> teams<00:02:29.069> out

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
know I think there's some teams out

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.860 
know I think there's some teams out
there<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.730> wouldn't<00:02:29.970> have<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.209> guts<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.569> put

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
there that wouldn't have the guts to put

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.349 
there that wouldn't have the guts to put
two<00:02:31.409> rookie<00:02:31.859> lineman<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.670> same<00:02:32.909> line<00:02:33.180> at

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
two rookie lineman on the same line at

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:34.940 
two rookie lineman on the same line at
the<00:02:33.450> same<00:02:33.599> time<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.989> 49ers<00:02:34.470> going<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.650> do<00:02:34.799> that

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
the same time the 49ers going to do that

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.589 
the same time the 49ers going to do that
so<00:02:35.159> that's<00:02:35.340> that's<00:02:35.819> sort<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.209> question<00:02:36.359> mark

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
so that's that's sort of a question mark

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.199 
so that's that's sort of a question mark
I<00:02:36.900> mean<00:02:37.049> are<00:02:37.200> these<00:02:37.319> guys<00:02:37.530> going<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:39.120> know

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
I mean are these guys going to you know

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.690 
I mean are these guys going to you know
go<00:02:39.450> through<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:40.109> you<00:02:40.859> know<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.310> ups<00:02:41.519> and

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
go through the you know the ups and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.179 
go through the you know the ups and
downs<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:42.209> every<00:02:42.510> young<00:02:43.230> linemen<00:02:43.530> has<00:02:43.889> and

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
downs that every young linemen has and

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.770 
downs that every young linemen has and
what<00:02:44.280> are<00:02:44.400> going<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.549> be<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.790> repercussions<00:02:45.599> I

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
what are going to be the repercussions I

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.599 
what are going to be the repercussions I
think<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.349> other<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.950> know<00:02:47.040> big<00:02:47.280> issue<00:02:47.430> is

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
think the other you know big issue is

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.050 
think the other you know big issue is
the<00:02:47.849> offense<00:02:48.209> itself<00:02:48.629> I<00:02:48.900> think<00:02:49.109> at<00:02:49.230> times

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
the offense itself I think at times

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.780 
the offense itself I think at times
Jimmy<00:02:51.060> Rays<00:02:51.239> offense<00:02:51.510> last<00:02:51.959> year<00:02:52.319> was<00:02:52.790> rather

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
Jimmy Rays offense last year was rather

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.729 
Jimmy Rays offense last year was rather
antiquated<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.810> was<00:02:54.930> stodgy<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.500> mean

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
antiquated it was stodgy I mean

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.319 
antiquated it was stodgy I mean
everybody<00:02:56.250> in<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.489> whole<00:02:56.669> stadium<00:02:57.030> including

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
everybody in the whole stadium including

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.789 
everybody in the whole stadium including
the<00:02:57.629> defense<00:02:58.049> knew<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.439> they<00:02:58.530> were<00:02:58.590> going<00:02:58.650> to

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
the defense knew that they were going to

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.449 
the defense knew that they were going to
run<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.069> ball<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.750> that<00:03:00.919> you<00:03:01.919> know<00:03:02.040> led<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.430> a

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
run the ball and that you know led to a

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.539 
run the ball and that you know led to a
lot<00:03:02.669> of<00:03:02.900> no<00:03:03.900> gains<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.560> lot<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.829> one<00:03:05.040> yard<00:03:05.280> games

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
lot of no gains a lot of one yard games

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.349 
lot of no gains a lot of one yard games
a<00:03:05.730> lot<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.970> minus<00:03:06.450> gains<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:08.010> think<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.909> think

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
a lot of minus gains so I think I think

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.690 
a lot of minus gains so I think I think
that<00:03:09.480> x<00:03:09.750> ray<00:03:10.439> has<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.769> kind<00:03:10.889> of<00:03:11.010> trust<00:03:11.280> his<00:03:11.489> guys

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
that x ray has to kind of trust his guys

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.240 
that x ray has to kind of trust his guys
and<00:03:12.000> open<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.659> up<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.019> they<00:03:13.200> can<00:03:13.409> keep<00:03:13.919> pace

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
and open it up so they can keep pace

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.449 
and open it up so they can keep pace
with<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:15.090> opposing<00:03:15.510> offense<00:03:16.010> 49ers<00:03:17.010> defense

strong pass rush will cure a lot of ills
and<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:31.079> think<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.409> that<00:03:31.620> also<00:03:32.280> will<00:03:32.340> take

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
and I think that that also will take

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.330 
and I think that that also will take
this<00:03:32.819> from<00:03:33.120> being<00:03:33.419> a<00:03:33.569> very<00:03:34.019> solid<00:03:34.560> defense<00:03:34.949> to

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
this from being a very solid defense to

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.099 
this from being a very solid defense to
an<00:03:35.639> elite<00:03:36.000> defense<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:36.599> think<00:03:36.780> they've<00:03:36.900> got

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
an elite defense and I think they've got

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.170 
an elite defense and I think they've got
you<00:03:37.799> know<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:38.040> horses<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.609> talent<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.000> do

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
you know the horses the talent to do

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.300 
you know the horses the talent to do
that<00:03:39.329> this<00:03:39.479> year<00:03:39.540> Taylor<00:03:40.260> Mays<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.919> Dashon

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
that this year Taylor Mays and Dashon

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.430 
that this year Taylor Mays and Dashon
Goldson<00:03:41.819> how<00:03:42.150> scary<00:03:42.569> are<00:03:42.750> they<00:03:42.870> together<00:03:43.019> with

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
Goldson how scary are they together with

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.619 
Goldson how scary are they together with
people<00:03:43.650> have<00:03:43.949> talked<00:03:44.190> about<00:03:44.370> safety<00:03:45.269> being

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
people have talked about safety being

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.629 
people have talked about safety being
like<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.229> quarterback<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:47.010> defense<00:03:47.190> I

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
like the quarterback of the defense I

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.399 
like the quarterback of the defense I
mean<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:48.060> mentally<00:03:48.780> challenging

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
mean it's a mentally challenging

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.009 
mean it's a mentally challenging
position<00:03:49.979> and<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.819> lot<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.060> rookies<00:03:51.389> can't<00:03:51.840> come

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
position and a lot of rookies can't come

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.110 
position and a lot of rookies can't come
in<00:03:52.199> as<00:03:52.409> you<00:03:53.129> know<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.400> their<00:03:53.519> first<00:03:53.669> year<00:03:53.819> and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
in as you know in their first year and

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.490 
in as you know in their first year and
master<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.569> so<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.750> think<00:03:55.049> he's<00:03:55.260> going<00:03:55.349> to<00:03:55.409> be

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
master it so I think he's going to be

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.000 
master it so I think he's going to be
sort<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.870> eased<00:03:57.870> into<00:03:58.229> the<00:03:58.319> situation<00:03:58.889> a<00:03:58.979> bit

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
sort of eased into the situation a bit

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.309 
sort of eased into the situation a bit
if<00:03:59.699> I<00:03:59.879> were<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.060> fan<00:04:00.359> I<00:04:00.389> wouldn't<00:04:00.780> expect<00:04:00.900> a

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
if I were a fan I wouldn't expect a

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.869 
if I were a fan I wouldn't expect a
whole<00:04:01.560> lot<00:04:01.799> from<00:04:02.069> him<00:04:02.159> this<00:04:02.310> year<00:04:02.519> I<00:04:02.579> think

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
whole lot from him this year I think

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.640 
whole lot from him this year I think
they're<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:04.049> know<00:04:04.109> I<00:04:04.319> think<00:04:04.560> the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
they're you know I think the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.199 
they're you know I think the
expectations<00:04:05.189> for<00:04:05.310> him<00:04:05.459> are<00:04:05.579> huge<00:04:05.909> but<00:04:06.150> i

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
expectations for him are huge but i

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.879 
expectations for him are huge but i
think<00:04:06.479> it's<00:04:06.629> those<00:04:06.959> expectations<00:04:07.290> are<00:04:07.709> down

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
think it's those expectations are down

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.999 
think it's those expectations are down
the<00:04:08.099> line<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:09.540> in<00:04:09.720> Golson<00:04:10.229> you<00:04:10.409> know<00:04:10.530> he's<00:04:10.979> a

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:11.009 
the line and in Golson you know he's a

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:13.099 
the line and in Golson you know he's a
guy<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:11.250> started<00:04:12.090> for<00:04:12.359> the<00:04:12.449> first<00:04:12.659> time<00:04:12.870> last

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
guy that started for the first time last

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.649 
guy that started for the first time last
year<00:04:13.699> was<00:04:14.699> a<00:04:14.729> little<00:04:15.000> shaky<00:04:15.269> in<00:04:15.419> the<00:04:15.479> beginning

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
year was a little shaky in the beginning

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.060 
year was a little shaky in the beginning
the<00:04:15.900> year<00:04:16.019> but<00:04:16.169> really<00:04:16.320> started<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.829> come<00:04:16.949> out

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
the year but really started to come out

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.879 
the year but really started to come out
come<00:04:17.130> on<00:04:17.549> at<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.880> end<00:04:18.199> so<00:04:19.199> he's<00:04:19.440> going<00:04:19.650> into

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
come on at the end so he's going into

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.050 
come on at the end so he's going into
the<00:04:20.009> season<00:04:20.190> with<00:04:20.459> quite<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:20.699> bit<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:20.970> momentum

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
the season with quite a bit of momentum

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.209 
the season with quite a bit of momentum
and<00:04:21.419> of<00:04:21.810> course<00:04:22.019> he's<00:04:22.169> in<00:04:22.289> his<00:04:22.380> contract<00:04:22.860> year

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
and of course he's in his contract year

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.100 
and of course he's in his contract year
so<00:04:23.909> he's<00:04:24.090> playing<00:04:24.300> for<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.479> lot<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.659> money<00:04:24.690> and

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
so he's playing for a lot of money and

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.990 
so he's playing for a lot of money and
so<00:04:25.800> that's<00:04:25.950> that's<00:04:26.460> quite<00:04:26.700> a

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
so that's that's quite a

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.670 
so that's that's quite a
bit<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.210> motivation<00:04:27.360> as<00:04:27.900> well<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.350> Niners

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
bit of motivation as well the Niners

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.410 
bit of motivation as well the Niners
haven't<00:04:28.950> been<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.250> playoffs<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.210> think

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
haven't been to the playoffs and I think

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.600 
haven't been to the playoffs and I think
it's<00:04:30.540> eight<00:04:30.810> years<00:04:31.310> what's<00:04:32.310> your<00:04:32.460> prediction

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
it's eight years what's your prediction

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.100 
it's eight years what's your prediction
for<00:04:32.850> this<00:04:33.060> year<00:04:33.300> what<00:04:33.540> do<00:04:33.600> we<00:04:33.720> have<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:33.990> look

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
for this year what do we have to look

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.200 
for this year what do we have to look
forward<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.980> started<00:04:35.730> to<00:04:35.820> come<00:04:35.970> from<00:04:36.090> this

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
forward to I started to come from this

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.130 
forward to I started to come from this
team<00:04:36.540> in<00:04:36.870> 2003<00:04:37.680> which<00:04:37.920> is<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.460> know<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:39.140> 2002

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
team in 2003 which is you know the 2002

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.890 
team in 2003 which is you know the 2002
is<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.440> last<00:04:40.650> year<00:04:40.950> that<00:04:41.130> they<00:04:41.280> went<00:04:41.430> to<00:04:41.610> the

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
is the last year that they went to the

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.690 
is the last year that they went to the
postseason<00:04:42.900> so<00:04:43.320> I<00:04:43.530> haven't<00:04:44.220> seen<00:04:44.370> them<00:04:44.460> go<00:04:44.640> to

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
postseason so I haven't seen them go to

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.250 
postseason so I haven't seen them go to
the<00:04:44.820> playoffs<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.240> I've<00:04:45.390> never<00:04:45.630> predicted<00:04:46.170> in

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
the playoffs and I've never predicted in

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.360 
the playoffs and I've never predicted in
the<00:04:46.350> offseason<00:04:46.500> that<00:04:46.890> they<00:04:47.010> were<00:04:47.100> going<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.250> go

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
the offseason that they were going to go

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.890 
the offseason that they were going to go
to<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.550> class<00:04:47.670> because<00:04:48.030> you<00:04:48.330> know<00:04:48.390> they've

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
to the class because you know they've

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.100 
to the class because you know they've
been<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:49.290> bad<00:04:49.590> team<00:04:49.950> I<00:04:50.190> think<00:04:50.940> I'm<00:04:51.690> pretty

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
been a bad team I think I'm pretty

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.050 
been a bad team I think I'm pretty
certain<00:04:52.530> this<00:04:52.860> year<00:04:53.130> will<00:04:53.250> be<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.610> year<00:04:53.910> that

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
certain this year will be the year that

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.880 
certain this year will be the year that
ends<00:04:54.480> that<00:04:54.540> I<00:04:54.660> mean<00:04:54.960> I<00:04:55.050> think<00:04:55.260> they've<00:04:55.410> taken<00:04:55.650> a

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
ends that I mean I think they've taken a

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.220 
ends that I mean I think they've taken a
step<00:04:56.100> forward<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.640> I<00:04:57.180> think<00:04:57.510> just<00:04:58.140> as

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
step forward and I think just as

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.720 
step forward and I think just as
important<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.920> rest<00:04:59.100> of<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.280> teams<00:04:59.460> in<00:04:59.610> that

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
important the rest of the teams in that

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.150 
important the rest of the teams in that
division<00:04:59.970> have<00:05:00.270> taken<00:05:00.540> a<00:05:00.600> step<00:05:00.750> backward<00:05:01.200> and
