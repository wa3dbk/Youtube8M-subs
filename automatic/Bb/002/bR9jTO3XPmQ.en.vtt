00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
hey guys this is adam lane of

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.970 
hey guys this is adam lane of
pocketnow.com<00:00:02.250> i<00:00:02.909> have<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.780> LG<00:00:04.020> optimus<00:00:04.440> 2x

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
pocketnow.com i have the LG optimus 2x

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.260 
pocketnow.com i have the LG optimus 2x
right<00:00:05.400> here<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:05.700> we're<00:00:05.819> going<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:06.000> do<00:00:06.060> some

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
right here and we're going to do some

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.350 
right here and we're going to do some
speed<00:00:06.690> tests<00:00:07.020> because<00:00:07.259> it's<00:00:07.620> got<00:00:08.090> dual<00:00:09.090> core

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
speed tests because it's got dual core

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.169 
speed tests because it's got dual core
processors<00:00:09.990> one<00:00:10.620> here<00:00:10.860> its<00:00:11.099> Tegra<00:00:11.400> 2<00:00:11.580> so

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
processors one here its Tegra 2 so

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.200 
processors one here its Tegra 2 so
should<00:00:12.900> be<00:00:13.019> pretty<00:00:13.049> quick<00:00:13.730> so<00:00:14.730> let's<00:00:14.940> check<00:00:15.120> it

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
should be pretty quick so let's check it

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:27.920 
should be pretty quick so let's check it
out<00:00:24.109> so<00:00:25.109> first<00:00:25.470> off<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:26.010> have<00:00:26.930> quadrant

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
out so first off I have quadrant

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.290 
out so first off I have quadrant
standard<00:00:28.099> this<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> benchmarking<00:00:29.910> program

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
standard this is a benchmarking program

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.130 
standard this is a benchmarking program
and<00:00:30.920> you<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:32.070> see<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:33.239> got<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> pretty<00:00:33.780> high

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
and you can see we got a pretty high

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.530 
and you can see we got a pretty high
score<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.210> can<00:00:36.420> see<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.870> optimus<00:00:37.320> 2x

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
score here so you can see the optimus 2x

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.639 
score here so you can see the optimus 2x
is<00:00:39.540> way<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.170> there<00:00:40.730> close<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.760> 2500<00:00:43.760> and

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
is way up there close to 2500 and

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.500 
is way up there close to 2500 and
there's<00:00:46.649> all<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> other<00:00:47.070> devices<00:00:50.420> have<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
there's all the other devices have a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.619 
there's all the other devices have a
couple<00:00:51.780> other<00:00:51.930> benchmark<00:00:52.530> programs<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.340> we

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
couple other benchmark programs that we

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.939 
couple other benchmark programs that we
use<00:00:54.629> here<00:00:54.660> now<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.500> smart<00:00:56.190> bench<00:00:56.399> 2011<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.449> one

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
use here now a smart bench 2011 this one

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.930 
use here now a smart bench 2011 this one
does<00:00:58.949> support<00:00:59.809> multiple<00:01:00.809> cores<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.670> should

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
does support multiple cores so it should

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.399 
does support multiple cores so it should
get<00:01:03.120> some<00:01:03.390> pretty<00:01:03.539> good<00:01:03.660> results<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:06.409> here's

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
get some pretty good results and here's

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.880 
get some pretty good results and here's
our<00:01:07.590> scores<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.490> LG<00:01:08.880> optimus<00:01:08.909> 2x<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.020> see

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
our scores for the LG optimus 2x and see

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.219 
our scores for the LG optimus 2x and see
it's<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.250> pretty<00:01:11.490> good<00:01:11.939> there<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:13.110> bit

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
it's a pretty good there a little bit

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.560 
it's a pretty good there a little bit
less<00:01:13.500> than<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.920> motorola<00:01:14.340> xoom<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.850> its<00:01:15.060> 1.5

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
less than the motorola xoom with its 1.5

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.340 
less than the motorola xoom with its 1.5
gigahertz<00:01:15.990> processor<00:01:17.210> but<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.900> look<00:01:18.990> down

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
gigahertz processor but if we look down

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.390 
gigahertz processor but if we look down
here<00:01:20.570> further<00:01:21.570> down<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.680> see<00:01:22.890> some<00:01:23.070> slower

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
here further down you see some slower

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.690 
here further down you see some slower
devices<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:25.159> galaxy<00:01:26.159> s<00:01:26.280> down<00:01:26.640> there<00:01:28.700> so

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
devices here galaxy s down there so

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.960 
devices here galaxy s down there so
pretty<00:01:30.270> good<00:01:30.360> score<00:01:31.009> we're<00:01:32.009> kind<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.549> slowing

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
pretty good score we're kind of slowing

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.840 
pretty good score we're kind of slowing
down with<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> scrolling<00:01:33.960> though<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
down with the scrolling though and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.620 
down with the scrolling though and
that's<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.240> smart<00:01:36.780> bench<00:01:36.960> 2011<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:39.509> have

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that's on smart bench 2011 and we have

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.679 
that's on smart bench 2011 and we have
one<00:01:39.810> more<00:01:42.740> this<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.860> linpack<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.479> going

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
one more this is linpack this is going

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.600 
one more this is linpack this is going
to<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:45.869> another<00:01:46.439> benchmarking<00:01:47.159> program<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.950> I

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
to be another benchmarking program and I

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.959 
to be another benchmarking program and I
get<00:01:50.759> 36<00:01:51.450> almost<00:01:52.549> 37<00:01:53.549> m<00:01:53.759> flops<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.790> we<00:01:56.790> can

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
get 36 almost 37 m flops and we can

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.330 
get 36 almost 37 m flops and we can
compare<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.750> top<00:01:57.990> devices<00:01:58.590> latest<00:01:58.950> runs<00:01:59.159> our

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
compare the top devices latest runs our

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.030 
compare the top devices latest runs our
top<00:01:59.520> 10<00:01:59.820> down<00:02:00.030> here<00:02:02.180> but<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.270> can't<00:02:03.509> really

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
top 10 down here but you can't really

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.819 
top 10 down here but you can't really
compare<00:02:05.040> very<00:02:05.430> easily<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:06.619> what<00:02:07.619> your

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
compare very easily with what your

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.110 
compare very easily with what your
device<00:02:08.129> got<00:02:08.399> with<00:02:08.640> what<00:02:08.849> others<00:02:09.119> got

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
device got with what others got

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.039 
device got with what others got
so<00:02:11.930> there<00:02:12.110> are<00:02:12.170> some<00:02:12.290> scores<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:12.890> see<00:02:13.220> them<00:02:13.370> all

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
so there are some scores to see them all

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:23.970 
so there are some scores to see them all

next<00:02:24.980> up<00:02:25.069> let's<00:02:25.250> see<00:02:25.400> how<00:02:25.730> websites<00:02:26.120> render

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
next up let's see how websites render

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.780 
next up let's see how websites render
how<00:02:27.019> quickly<00:02:27.319> they<00:02:27.620> were<00:02:27.739> in<00:02:27.799> there<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.640> this

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
how quickly they were in there so this

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.110 
how quickly they were in there so this
is<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.170> galaxy<00:02:30.170> s<00:02:30.260> 4g<00:02:30.590> over<00:02:30.980> here<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:34.190> i'm

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
is the galaxy s 4g over here and i'm

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.390 
is the galaxy s 4g over here and i'm
going<00:02:35.269> to<00:02:35.360> hit<00:02:35.569> them<00:02:35.810> both<00:02:35.989> at<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.230> same<00:02:36.290> time

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.510 

let's<00:02:42.909> try<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.360> with<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.659> desktop<00:02:44.200> version

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.310 

both<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.270> these<00:02:51.360> are<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.720> same<00:02:51.990> Wi-Fi

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
both of these are on the same Wi-Fi

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:03.740 
both of these are on the same Wi-Fi
connection<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:54.770> they<00:02:55.770> are<00:02:55.920> very<00:02:55.950> close<00:03:02.750> still

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
connection and they are very close still

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:17.370 
connection and they are very close still
downloading

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.120 

and<00:03:18.070> we<00:03:18.430> are

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.160 

there<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:23.850> go<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.750> let's<00:03:24.960> see

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
there we go so let's see

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:33.590 
there we go so let's see
performance-wise<00:03:26.150> zooming<00:03:27.150> in

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.520 

let's<00:03:34.110> try<00:03:34.290> that<00:03:34.440> again<00:03:35.930> okay<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.350> one

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
let's try that again okay that one

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.830 
let's try that again okay that one
really<00:03:38.280> slow

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.380 

multi-touch

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:05.370 

ok<00:03:53.140> it's<00:03:53.470> still<00:03:53.740> working

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.170 

okay<00:04:06.380> so<00:04:07.070> there<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:07.280> have<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.490> little<00:04:07.880> browser

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
okay so there you have a little browser

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:16.960 
okay so there you have a little browser
comparison<00:04:08.810> let's<00:04:09.410> also<00:04:09.710> try<00:04:10.540> with<00:04:13.210> HD<00:04:14.210> 7<00:04:15.970> so

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
comparison let's also try with HD 7 so

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.400 
comparison let's also try with HD 7 so
again<00:04:17.209> we're<00:04:17.359> going<00:04:17.480> to<00:04:17.540> do<00:04:17.630> this<00:04:17.780> it's

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
again we're going to do this it's

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.720 
again we're going to do this it's
probably<00:04:18.590> going<00:04:18.829> to<00:04:18.890> go<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.160> mobile<00:04:19.370> site

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
probably going to go to the mobile site

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:29.719 
probably going to go to the mobile site
so

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:37.200 

lge<00:04:30.629> went<00:04:30.870> over<00:04:31.050> very<00:04:31.080> quickly

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.340 

and<00:04:37.840> let's<00:04:38.050> see<00:04:38.229> the<00:04:38.319> desktop<00:04:38.740> site<00:04:39.990> LG<00:04:40.990> coming

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
and let's see the desktop site LG coming

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:57.010 
and let's see the desktop site LG coming
up<00:04:41.440> ahead

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:15.220 

hd7<00:04:58.020> taking<00:04:58.530> its<00:04:58.710> sweet<00:04:58.980> time

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.380 

and<00:05:15.740> then<00:05:16.190> we<00:05:16.310> finally<00:05:16.550> have<00:05:16.820> something<00:05:17.060> going

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
and then we finally have something going

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:25.030 
and then we finally have something going
on<00:05:17.540> over<00:05:17.930> here

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.340 

and<00:05:25.640> we<00:05:25.850> can<00:05:26.030> compare<00:05:26.210> some<00:05:26.720> responsiveness

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
and we can compare some responsiveness

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:38.570 
and we can compare some responsiveness
with<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:28.090> zooming

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.700 

see<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.300> lg's<00:05:39.599> a<00:05:39.629> little<00:05:39.930> bit<00:05:40.020> choppy<00:05:40.289> or<00:05:40.620> as

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
see the lg's a little bit choppy or as

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.659 
see the lg's a little bit choppy or as
this<00:05:40.830> is<00:05:41.039> going<00:05:41.310> pretty<00:05:41.430> smoothly<00:05:41.759> oh<00:05:42.060> hey

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669

this is going pretty smoothly oh hey
looks<00:05:44.669> like<00:05:44.759> the<00:05:44.879> browser<00:05:45.210> crashed<00:05:49.159> and<00:05:50.479> we

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
looks like the browser crashed and we

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.070 
looks like the browser crashed and we
lost<00:05:51.509> that<00:05:52.139> page<00:05:52.469> okay<00:05:53.810> well<00:05:54.810> you<00:05:54.930> get<00:05:55.050> the

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
picture next up I downloaded the NVIDIA

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.010 
picture next up I downloaded the NVIDIA
Tegra<00:06:01.800> zone<00:06:02.639> app<00:06:02.909> and<00:06:03.240> this<00:06:03.389> is<00:06:03.539> just<00:06:03.689> kind<00:06:03.990> of

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
Tegra zone app and this is just kind of

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.330 
Tegra zone app and this is just kind of

a little catalog of absolute designed to

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.510 
a little catalog of absolute designed to
take<00:06:08.340> advantage<00:06:08.400> of<00:06:08.849> the<00:06:08.969> Tegra<00:06:09.270> 2<00:06:09.300> processors

take advantage of the Tegra 2 processors

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:17.830 
take advantage of the Tegra 2 processors
so<00:06:11.520> and<00:06:11.940> let's<00:06:12.389> see<00:06:12.840> oops<00:06:15.080> if<00:06:16.080> I<00:06:16.319> go<00:06:16.500> here

so and let's see oops if I go here

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.809 
so and let's see oops if I go here
choose<00:06:18.840> available<00:06:19.440> because<00:06:19.830> it<00:06:20.039> lists<00:06:20.400> a<00:06:20.550> lot

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.020 
the Tegra 2 processor it's working

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.360 
the Tegra 2 processor it's working
pretty<00:07:50.140> nice<00:07:52.380> so<00:07:53.380> there's<00:07:53.530> your<00:07:53.590> speed<00:07:53.980> tests

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.370 
pretty nice so there's your speed tests

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.330 
pretty nice so there's your speed tests
of<00:07:54.490> the<00:07:54.610> optimus<00:07:55.150> 2x<00:07:55.860> this<00:07:56.860> device<00:07:57.130> is

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:57.340 
of the optimus 2x this device is

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.370 
of the optimus 2x this device is
available<00:07:57.700> from<00:07:57.880> negri<00:07:58.360> electronics<00:07:58.390> so

00:07:59.370 --> 00:07:59.380 
available from negri electronics so

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.890 
available from negri electronics so
check<00:07:59.770> that<00:07:59.800> out<00:08:00.130> if<00:08:00.310> you<00:08:00.700> think<00:08:01.450> about<00:08:01.540> buying
