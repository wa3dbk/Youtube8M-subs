they<00:01:03.100> get<00:01:03.249> a<00:01:03.280> hundred<00:01:03.489> mil

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.640 

as<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:08.490> result<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.150> mixing<00:01:09.479> too<00:01:09.690> much<00:01:09.870> oil<00:01:10.110> let's

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
as a result of mixing too much oil let's

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.880 
as a result of mixing too much oil let's
say<00:01:10.800> you<00:01:10.860> mix<00:01:11.100> 300<00:01:11.760> mil<00:01:11.940> per<00:01:12.390> 5<00:01:12.750> litres<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.770> will

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
say you mix 300 mil per 5 litres it will

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.740 
say you mix 300 mil per 5 litres it will
fill<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> sparkplug<00:01:15.030> making<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
fill up the sparkplug making it

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.780 
fill up the sparkplug making it
difficult<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.380> start<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.010> that<00:01:17.340> excess

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
difficult to start and that excess

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.790 
difficult to start and that excess
unburned<00:01:18.300> oil<00:01:18.600> will<00:01:19.020> drip<00:01:19.200> from<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> muffler

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
unburned oil will drip from the muffler

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.120 
unburned oil will drip from the muffler
causing<00:01:20.670> excessive<00:01:21.000> blue<00:01:21.600> smoke

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.550 

now<00:01:26.790> believe<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.360> not<00:01:27.510> you're<00:01:27.930> mixed<00:01:28.290> fuel

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
now believe it or not you're mixed fuel

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.080 
now believe it or not you're mixed fuel
is<00:01:28.710> not<00:01:28.950> going<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.189> last<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.580> forever

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
is not going to last you forever

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.149 
is not going to last you forever
so<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.540> should<00:01:30.750> only<00:01:30.840> mix<00:01:31.229> enough<00:01:31.530> fuel<00:01:31.860> it's

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
so you should only mix enough fuel it's

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.070 
so you should only mix enough fuel it's
going<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.490> consumed<00:01:32.970> within<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.869> two

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
going to be consumed within a one to two

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.800 
going to be consumed within a one to two
month<00:01:34.350> period<00:01:34.549> so<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.700> 10<00:01:35.909> litres<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.390> too<00:01:36.600> much

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
month period so if 10 litres is too much

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.880 
month period so if 10 litres is too much
try<00:01:37.619> 5<00:01:37.920> still<00:01:38.729> too<00:01:38.940> much<00:01:39.060> or<00:01:39.540> try<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.619> that's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
try 5 still too much or try to if that's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.830 
try 5 still too much or try to if that's
still<00:01:41.159> too<00:01:41.369> much<00:01:41.399> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.210> use<00:01:42.240> one<00:01:42.600> liter

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
still too much you can use one liter

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.080 
still too much you can use one liter
just<00:01:43.500> remember<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.580> need<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.940> reduce

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
just remember that you need to reduce

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.300 
just remember that you need to reduce
the<00:01:45.299> amount<00:01:45.690> of<00:01:45.780> oil<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.799> reduce<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the amount of oil as you reduce the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.670 
the amount of oil as you reduce the
amount<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.640> fuel<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.119> how<00:01:48.509> much<00:01:48.690> oil<00:01:48.899> well

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
amount of fuel and how much oil well

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.410 
amount of fuel and how much oil well
that's<00:01:49.799> simple<00:01:50.190> that's<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> operator's

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that's simple that's in the operator's

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.580 
that's simple that's in the operator's
manual

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
