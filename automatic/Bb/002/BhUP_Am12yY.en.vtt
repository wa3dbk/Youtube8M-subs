well<00:02:52.740> since<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.160> don't<00:02:53.400> know<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:53.970> fundamental

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
well since I don't know what fundamental

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.600 
well since I don't know what fundamental
transformation<00:02:54.930> is<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:56.250> what<00:02:56.430> this

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
transformation is and what this

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.400 
transformation is and what this
president<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.300> shooting<00:02:57.780> for<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.260> don't

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
president is shooting for and I don't

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.220 
president is shooting for and I don't
think<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.770> do<00:02:58.980> either<00:02:59.570> since<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.720> president

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
think you do either since the president

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.750 
think you do either since the president
has<00:03:01.380> said<00:03:01.650> in<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.920> past<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.550> the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
has said in the past that the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.980 
has said in the past that the
Constitution<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.740> fundamentally<00:03:04.740> flawed

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
Constitution is fundamentally flawed

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.420 
Constitution is fundamentally flawed
since<00:03:06.990> this<00:03:07.200> president<00:03:07.770> has<00:03:07.830> surrounded

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
since this president has surrounded

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.240 
since this president has surrounded
himself<00:03:08.490> without<00:03:09.150> an<00:03:09.540> out<00:03:09.660> radicals<00:03:10.410> some<00:03:11.130> of

communist<00:03:14.690> isn't<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.780> reasonable<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.560> ponder

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
communist isn't it reasonable to ponder

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.250 
communist isn't it reasonable to ponder
the<00:03:17.340> question<00:03:17.490> what<00:03:18.209> kind<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:18.720> transformation

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
the question what kind of transformation

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.480 
the question what kind of transformation
is<00:03:19.740> he<00:03:20.520> shooting<00:03:20.790> for<00:03:21.270> I<00:03:22.070> have<00:03:23.070> pondered<00:03:23.340> that
