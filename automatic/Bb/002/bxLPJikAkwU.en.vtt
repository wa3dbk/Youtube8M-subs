00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:36.040
 for cat that makes noise 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:40.329

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.190
 not done cinema shopping this no 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.559
 really small jacket this morning 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.149
 hot today luckily I made new 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.019
 there are simply shopping 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.730
 because I wanted sex while to get me 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.190
 a jacket for now that are not a 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.989
 sheath dress in leather and at the end I went out 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.390
 with anything but not much to see 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.370
 also a jacket for the pe for this 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.800
 period this is the time of year 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.929
 this period here along with autumn 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.360
 are the times of the year I hate why 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:12.789
 he doesn't know how to dress me and then generally 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.149
 against 3000 things and then every year I do not 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.619
 I find none of this purchased 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.700
 however we begin to see what he has 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.920
 purchased took a denim jacket 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.070
 this product 34 the 95 is as to the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.200
 I usually show you worn 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.799
 here we are, there is a very simple jacket 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.320
 of jeans 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.979
 I could have taken it smaller though 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.960
 bocedi shoulders it seems to me that it is perfect 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.340
 you see there is here the seam ends 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.780
 there's my shoulder so I think more 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.759
 small mind would have been too much 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.710
 I will turn this a little bit here 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.210
 so why did I set it up so long 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.640
 I really don't like it very much 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.549
 the rolled up sleeves goes well well 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.649
 simple denim jacket and there was one 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.159
 there were almost three types of colors 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.439
 of washes there was one lighter than 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.600
 this with clear clear light and one 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:06.310
 darker and now up to taken this here 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.700
 that the middle way is later also a 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.530
 however, there is no longer a denim jacket 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.359
 with the unicri it no longer ends quotas from 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.380
 when they were in fashion here gingrich dei 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.380
 very short jeans 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.030
 ok well short denim jacket 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.540
 then a very simple blouse also 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.040
 these liked I liked the colors 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.709
 blue pink celestino 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:37.330
 I liked the imagination this 9 95 po 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.239
 in short, then, for every day 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.560
 always 995 I got this shirt that 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.430
 I ain't nothing because 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.110
 objectively it is nothing of that 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.660
 below ends a little tighter 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.519
 fabric is soft those of mario very 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.109
 I don't know how to do it over transparent 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.780
 they call on these comes from discover 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.730
 energy title is killing the allergy 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.549
 however see if its simple 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.519
 simple this one 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:17.200
 9.51 we have so much excuse color but 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:18.760
 a sneeze that then struggles to 14 in 95 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.430
 I took this sweater that ends 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.500
 three-quarters in the sleeve in thread that you 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.880
 like to go crazy this agreement 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.709
 I am found that I fell in love 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.620
 I immediately said 14 95 so though if 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.260
 this too soft and I like it 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:40.030
 just a lot of beautiful garden 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:42.400
 clear light was also given to Cecina 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.739
 that is wandering here makes me the 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.030
 roundabout practically still of 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:53.590
 trampling it is of this world in chino 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.500
 here then at 19 95 then I took this maxi 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.510
 sweater that is not very heavy 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:06.160
 even if there is written also of what 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:07.750
 what is viscose cotton and polyamide but 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.480
 certainly among the thousand thousand languages ​​there 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.400
 it will also be the Italian mob and I took it 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.040
 deliberately an elle so so the 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.139
 great because i'm going to put it 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.440
 above the leggins then in the smooth 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.080
 without anything soft to put on 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.580
 even fantasy leggings 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.660
 I liked that I was already looking for it from a 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.510
 little 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:34.160
 to finish at 29 95 I took this 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.830
 corner in acqui that now I get 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.930
 right above it was born practically ho 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.060
 tried both this maria here and the 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.970
 bigger size the bigger size 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.080
 it was perfect, however, given that I am 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.970
 set the goal of losing some 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:55.460
 volumes on here so let's say so for 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:59.990
 the right summer we say so in anger a 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.460
 I set myself this goal and me 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.370
 I didn't take a size less then 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.350
 with the good omen that when it arrives 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.440
 in short, the time to wear it 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.270
 he would reach the weight I want 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.880
 reaching ancona that much weight e 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.340
 that should not be done has taken the form that is 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.760
 I don't have any weight, I don't care 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.410
 anything 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.880
 I look in the mirror or go to me 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.000
 I like it means that I reached the 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.900
 right weight however very pretty 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.610
 fluttering as much as lace 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:34.880
 n graceful and graceful little pickets 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.070
 graceful and this with acqui I don't know if you ve 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.060
 I've said it now I'm losing guilt 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:45.110
 today I'm at 3000 but for dolphy and this one 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.330
 thing here I paid 29 95 as usual 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.880
 I remain proud of my purchases from 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.440
 although practically the twins 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.910
 mirrors of and there are some 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.350
 unfortunately crafty for my taste in the 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.970
 way you always see them again streamlined the 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.160
 own elongated silhouette in which 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.190
 mirrors where they are set up right 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.620
 to make it look slimmer because of me 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.240
 I see there is really much more but those 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.410
 mirrors then get home I find myself there 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.690
 things about something that doesn't suit me is 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:20.740
 however, in short, those things do not 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:25.070
 they cost a lot of steam 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.830
 and so here with 100 euros you succeed in 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.020
 take more clothes than maybe with one 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.349
 brand 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.410
 yes you could take yes and no 1 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:37.180
 perfectly if we went with brands 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:40.690
 120 euros that I probably spent today 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.300
 I took a shirt and then here 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:46.120
 I prefer especially for summer 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.830
 I prefer to focus on brands of 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.509
 generally, however, that is all 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.310
 let me know which garment is there 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:53.770
 liked the most of this shopping 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.849
 today and nothing I send you a kiss 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.849
 we exceed next
