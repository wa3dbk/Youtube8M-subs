00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.750
 well let's change this touch of this 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.240
 student 120 and we will see that since 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.730
 we have already surrendered the sounds that 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.620
 have here by the back and 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.140
 retired by the uar and the back over 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.090
 chord to 30 times can be very simple 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.920
 we are going to 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.270
 single 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.270
 open the display 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.210
 and here it is 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.830
 the fifth 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.110
 so 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.220
 not much 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.220
 very smooth action 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.789
 from the selvage that is very 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.940
 he is very thin 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.890
 if we have heat station we can 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.020
 help a little bit to give it a little 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.479
 hot 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.479
 to make it much easier to work 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.830
 and if not then here 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.240
 soft the 30 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.170
 containing 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.170
 in racing 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:50.470
 you will remember the very usual martina 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.470
 the practice since it is very fragile 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.300
 and she that you 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.489
 our where I throw it 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.030
 and we finish with removing all this 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.030
 glue 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.510
 you have to remove all that so that we do not 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.130
 is going to be a part raised and leaves 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.340
 starting with easily we're going to 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.959
 change it and the other is simple what 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.180
 only we have to be careful 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.450
 of not going to start the little boat is very 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.450
 fragile 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.599
 if we do only lightly very very 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.599
 we are probably going to start 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.879
 [Music] 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:30.010
 the back over 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.010
 let's proceed in sound 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.990
 and if we want we can paste two lines 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.990
 high tape appointments 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.130
 [Applause] 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.660
 besides in between 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.110
 [Music] 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.079
 [Music] 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.509
 but yes 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.740
 we are making progress 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.550
 two 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.740
 and we have our exchange
