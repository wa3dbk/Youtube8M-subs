with a little bit thinned out rails from
here<00:00:34.030> more<00:00:34.330> true<00:00:34.630> surf<00:00:35.230> for<00:00:35.470> performance<00:00:36.040> and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
here more true surf for performance and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.420 
here more true surf for performance and
then<00:00:37.750> like<00:00:37.989> normal<00:00:38.590> sir<00:00:38.739> for<00:00:38.980> you<00:00:39.100> normal

surface break surfboards you know not a

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.950 
surface break surfboards you know not a
regular<00:00:42.070> basis<00:00:42.489> but<00:00:42.640> it<00:00:42.790> happens<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:43.420> it's

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
regular basis but it happens and it's

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.410 
regular basis but it happens and it's
gonna<00:00:44.110> be<00:00:44.379> kind<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.739> a<00:00:44.860> similar<00:00:45.420> similar

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
gonna be kind of a similar similar

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.110 
gonna be kind of a similar similar
durability<00:00:47.080> to<00:00:47.200> a<00:00:47.230> regular<00:00:47.559> short<00:00:47.830> form<00:00:48.120> but

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
durability to a regular short form but

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.410 
durability to a regular short form but
to<00:00:49.360> be<00:00:49.500> high-performance<00:00:50.500> topless<00:00:51.430> I<00:00:51.970> think

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
to be high-performance topless I think

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.520 
to be high-performance topless I think
that's<00:00:52.540> what<00:00:52.690> I'm<00:00:52.780> gonna<00:00:52.900> rap

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
that's what I'm gonna rap

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.130 
that's what I'm gonna rap
so<00:00:55.310> the<00:00:55.430> skater<00:00:55.670> this<00:00:55.910> year<00:00:56.180> still<00:00:56.600> no<00:00:56.810> straps

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
so the skater this year still no straps

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.470 
so the skater this year still no straps
with<00:00:57.410> it<00:00:57.590> but<00:00:58.130> we<00:00:58.310> come<00:00:58.580> with<00:00:58.760> front<00:00:59.090> pad<00:00:59.300> this

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
with it but we come with front pad this

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.030 
with it but we come with front pad this
year<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.260> it's<00:01:00.350> already<00:01:00.560> on<00:01:00.739> there<00:01:00.860> you<00:01:00.980> know

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
year so it's already on there you know

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.160 
year so it's already on there you know
worried<00:01:01.340> about<00:01:01.460> put<00:01:01.700> it<00:01:01.820> on<00:01:01.970> and<00:01:02.870> has<00:01:03.050> the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
worried about put it on and has the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.410 
worried about put it on and has the
inserts<00:01:03.559> you<00:01:03.800> want<00:01:03.980> to<00:01:04.070> go<00:01:04.160> that

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
inserts you want to go that

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.090 
inserts you want to go that
that<00:01:05.930> deep<00:01:06.080> stuff<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.439> rails<00:01:06.650> a<00:01:06.770> little<00:01:06.979> bit

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
that deep stuff the rails a little bit

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.740 
that deep stuff the rails a little bit
rounded<00:01:07.400> her<00:01:07.520> mouth<00:01:07.700> a<00:01:07.939> little<00:01:08.299> more<00:01:08.450> skating

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
rounded her mouth a little more skating

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.539 
rounded her mouth a little more skating
feel<00:01:09.080> they're<00:01:09.770> kind<00:01:09.979> of<00:01:10.070> bridges<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.520> gap

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
feel they're kind of bridges the gap

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.170 
feel they're kind of bridges the gap
between<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:11.299> custom<00:01:11.689> LV<00:01:11.990> and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
between the custom LV and

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.709 
between the custom LV and
standing<00:01:14.080> in<00:01:14.230> between<00:01:14.380> for<00:01:14.860> now

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:24.810 

thruster<00:01:18.469> setup

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.960 

so<00:01:25.390> no<00:01:25.630> last<00:01:26.140> year<00:01:26.350> skater<00:01:26.650> is<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:26.950> thruster<00:01:27.880> as

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
so no last year skater is a thruster as

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.120 
so no last year skater is a thruster as
well<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.540> then<00:01:28.720> this<00:01:28.900> year<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.440> global<00:01:29.650> is

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
well and then this year the global is

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.610 
well and then this year the global is
going<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.670> be<00:01:30.730> thruster<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.240> and<00:01:32.140> without<00:01:32.290> the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
going to be thruster to and without the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.530 
going to be thruster to and without the
without<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.220> option<00:01:33.730> so<00:01:33.910> last<00:01:34.090> year<00:01:34.300> we<00:01:34.390> had

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
without the option so last year we had

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.020 
without the option so last year we had
the<00:01:34.660> quad<00:01:34.900> set<00:01:35.230> up<00:01:35.380> with<00:01:35.620> a<00:01:35.680> fifth<00:01:35.920> option<00:01:36.460> to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
the quad set up with a fifth option to

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.060 
the quad set up with a fifth option to
make<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.330> roster<00:01:37.660> if<00:01:37.900> you<00:01:38.020> want<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.380> but<00:01:38.980> this

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
make the roster if you want it but this

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.170 
make the roster if you want it but this
year<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.400> whole<00:01:39.520> line<00:01:39.790> is<00:01:39.940> going<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.120> be

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
year the whole line is going to be

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.609 
year the whole line is going to be
crushed

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
crushed

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.289 
crushed
so<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:42.009> makes<00:01:42.159> my<00:01:42.340> job<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.640> little<00:01:42.729> bit<00:01:42.970> easier

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
so it makes my job a little bit easier

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.899 
so it makes my job a little bit easier
yeah<00:01:44.840> it's<00:01:45.439> a<00:01:45.530> Alford<00:01:45.950> away<00:01:46.189> everybody<00:01:46.729> else

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
yeah it's a Alford away everybody else

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.730 
yeah it's a Alford away everybody else
does<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.359> bit<00:01:47.509> blind<00:01:47.780> testing<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.320> Maui<00:01:48.500> they

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
does a bit blind testing to Maui they

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.349 
does a bit blind testing to Maui they
gave<00:01:48.890> everybody<00:01:49.130> quantum<00:01:49.729> thrusters<00:01:50.179> and

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
gave everybody quantum thrusters and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:51.819 
gave everybody quantum thrusters and
don't<00:01:50.570> look<00:01:50.750> come<00:01:51.079> back<00:01:51.229> tell<00:01:51.500> us<00:01:51.560> which<00:01:51.649> one

you like is that a hundred percent

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.459 
you like is that a hundred percent
across<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.299> board<00:01:53.420> everyone<00:01:53.840> was<00:01:54.110> about<00:01:54.350> that

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
across the board everyone was about that

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.940 
across the board everyone was about that
I<00:01:55.390> agreed<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:57.079> global<00:01:57.469> is<00:01:57.560> pretty<00:01:57.740> similar

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
I agreed to the global is pretty similar

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.160 
I agreed to the global is pretty similar
to<00:01:58.130> last<00:01:58.280> year<00:01:58.640> same<00:01:59.240> style<00:01:59.569> down<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.049> wave
