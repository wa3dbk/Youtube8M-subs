 existing for kingston customers 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.110
 in this video we will focus on the 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.270
 Dirham manufacturing process as 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.129
 council member of lleida kingston 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.450
 contributes to standard designs of the 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.000
 industry for memory modules 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.490
 kingston produces built memory 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.229
 according to industry standards 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.630
 also designs proprietary memory for 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.820
 devices that are not standard 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.630
 create memory solutions 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.750
 personalized learning from their 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.030
 customers all these designs start in 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.070
 the cut room where the engineers of 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.350
 kingston sketch each layer of the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.360
 printed circuit board once 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.979
 the design is completed and produced 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.590
 delivers a prototype to laboratories 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.329
 for compatibility tests here the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.880
 engineers test environments around the world 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.860
 real on motherboards systems 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.960
 with specific system classes that 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.659
 they must support them with the aim of 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.100
 confirm compatibility 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.259
 occasionally when systems or 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.149
 motherboards to test the technology 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.130
 of the future are not yet available 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.899
 kingston uses its advanced 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.789
 test platforms 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.009
 these testers simulate the parameters 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.170
 of future systems using software 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.399
 designed and programmed by engineers 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.259
 kingston test 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.360
 kingston also uses these 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.530
 test platforms to qualify 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.119
 new components such as say nand 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.819
 controllers registers and components 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.130
 passive once a design has been 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.440
 approved the plans are sent to the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.670
 production for the armed tests and 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.200

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.940
 Contractual audits 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.130
 periodic internal and external about their 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.980
 processes keeping them at the level of 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.329
 Highest standards in the industry 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.579
 let's follow the process carried out to 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.180
 a typical product of kingston in the first 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.920
 place 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.540
 kingston raises the raw materials 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.069
 including life in all 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.170
 configurations between 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.030
 leading semiconductors in the world 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.770
 Kingston products are assembled in 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.510
 the assembly technology lines 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.640
 superficial the first step is the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.620
 screen printer where the pasta 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.720
 drop is spread through a 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.760
 screen to have been transferring the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.160
 to printed circuit boards to 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.840
 then the motherboards go through 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.970
 an optical inspection station 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.560
 automated where the height and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.930
 Welding integrity are 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.090
 carefully examined the following 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.890
 step is the surface mount where the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.110
 first of two assembly machines 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.150
 places the passive components such 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.769
 as resistors and capacitors the 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.380
 Next surface mount machine 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.750
 place the primary components such 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.250
 like the amd chips after the 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.709
 chips are placed on the card 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.260
 for printed circuit pass through the furnace 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.420
 reflux where based on the design of the 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.580
 specific product are subject to a 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.280
 7 temperature cycle until you reach 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.989
 500 degrees fahrenheit solder paste 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.239
 is cured based on this profile 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.190
 after baking all the products 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.830
 they must undergo an optical inspection 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.540
 automated end after the end of the 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.070
 inspection must be removed on 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.969
 coating of the cards 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.459
 printed circuit 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.829
 kingston uses controlled routers 

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:35.479
 by computer to trim the excess 

00:04:33.829 --> 00:04:37.759
 of coating and separating 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.769
 devices of the most singular step in the 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.569
 Kingston process are the tests of 

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:43.639
 production the testing platform 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.349
 contains a complete series of environments 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.329
 test most of them 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.499
 automated and according to patented designs 

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:51.110
 by kingston 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.999
 kingston owns more than 29 patents for

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.899
 mother and try a thousand modules per hour 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.610
 In addition to the production tests 

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:33.889
 all memory products 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.589
 classified for server should 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.739
 undergo extreme-use tests the 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:41.779
 unique 2400 cate test cameras and 

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:44.269
 patented by kingston simulate three 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:46.279
 months of heavy use on server and they do 

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:47.709
 strive by heart beyond 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:50.059
 any environment typically 

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:52.129
 experienced in center 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:54.379
 data this is done to detect 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.029
 any marginal memory cell or 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:58.429
 bad with which they are reduced 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:00.800
 considerably the early failures to 

00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:02.659
 212 degrees fahrenheit 100 degrees 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.119
 centigrade each cell subjected to 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:06.889
 strict testing standards the norm of 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:09.199
 kingston quality dictates that the 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.569
 detection of a bad cell equals 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.539
 a faulty memory module and being 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:16.490
 so it does not leave the factory considering 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:19.789
 than a server memory module 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.769
 of 16 gigabytes can have more than 130 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.379
 billions of kingston memory cells 

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:25.969
