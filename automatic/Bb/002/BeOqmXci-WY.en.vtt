you<00:02:04.430> which<00:02:04.820> really<00:02:05.090> helps<00:02:05.480> because<00:02:05.570> she<00:02:05.840> has

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
you which really helps because she has

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.000 
you which really helps because she has
this<00:02:06.080> crazy<00:02:06.350> AOE<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:08.180> I<00:02:08.899> also<00:02:09.050> recommend<00:02:09.500> and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
this crazy AOE and I also recommend and

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.310 
this crazy AOE and I also recommend and
what<00:02:10.340> did<00:02:10.460> also<00:02:10.640> comes<00:02:10.970> with<00:02:11.000> rally<00:02:11.300> car<00:02:11.600> so

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
what did also comes with rally car so

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.570 
what did also comes with rally car so
once<00:02:12.500> everyone's<00:02:12.830> at<00:02:12.950> low<00:02:13.070> health<00:02:13.250> it

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
once everyone's at low health it

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.010 
once everyone's at low health it
regenerates<00:02:13.850> forty<00:02:14.300> percent<00:02:14.540> their<00:02:14.780> hit

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
regenerates forty percent their hit

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.020 
regenerates forty percent their hit
points<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.950> course<00:02:16.130> of<00:02:16.280> ten<00:02:16.460> seconds<00:02:16.850> plus

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
points and of course of ten seconds plus

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.670 
points and of course of ten seconds plus
increases<00:02:17.510> damage<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.020> crit<00:02:18.170> chance<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.590> all

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
increases damage and crit chance and all

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.310 
increases damage and crit chance and all
that<00:02:18.860> what<00:02:19.190> not<00:02:19.370> some<00:02:20.120> proves<00:02:20.390> overall<00:02:20.750> dps<00:02:20.930> as

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
that what not some proves overall dps as

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.620 
that what not some proves overall dps as
well

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.020 

and<00:02:25.020> she's<00:02:25.980> probably<00:02:26.250> about<00:02:26.610> three<00:02:26.880> percent

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
and she's probably about three percent

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.750 
and she's probably about three percent
health<00:02:28.670> she<00:02:29.670> had<00:02:29.820> me<00:02:29.850> 1,000<00:02:30.660> pounds<00:02:30.990> left<00:02:31.760> okay

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760
