for with method feeder fishing it's

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.530 
for with method feeder fishing it's
essential<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.250> sinking<00:01:14.250> line

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
essential that you have a sinking line

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.090 
essential that you have a sinking line
so<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.570> when<00:01:16.080> you're<00:01:16.229> fishing<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.619> islands

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
so that when you're fishing to islands

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.100 
so that when you're fishing to islands
in<00:01:17.220> shallow<00:01:17.490> water<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.630> doesn't<00:01:18.840> get
