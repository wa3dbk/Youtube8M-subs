the<00:00:28.260> main<00:00:28.439> problem<00:00:28.920> with<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.880> doesn't<00:00:30.119> have

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
the main problem with it it doesn't have

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.709 
the main problem with it it doesn't have
a<00:00:30.689> single<00:00:31.050> flat<00:00:31.700> surface<00:00:32.700> where<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.450> put<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
a single flat surface where I can put a

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.250 
a single flat surface where I can put a
camera<00:00:33.989> mount<00:00:37.879> either<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.149> top<00:00:39.390> not<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.870> sides

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
camera mount either on top not the sides

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.200 
camera mount either on top not the sides
whatever<00:00:40.620> last<00:00:41.489> time<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:43.280> went<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> Morocco<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
whatever last time I went to Morocco I

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.990 
whatever last time I went to Morocco I
was<00:00:45.719> using<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.230> contour<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.399> had<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.789> this

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
was using the contour and I had on this

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.360 
was using the contour and I had on this
side<00:00:48.270> half<00:00:49.050> way<00:00:49.289> during<00:00:49.620> day<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.309> just

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
side half way during day one it just

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.590 
side half way during day one it just
fell<00:00:50.760> out<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> had<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.350> use<00:00:52.969> sticky<00:00:53.969> tape<00:00:54.000> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
fell out so I had to use sticky tape a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.130 
fell out so I had to use sticky tape a
couple<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.440> zip<00:00:55.649> ties<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.600> I'll<00:00:57.600> put<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> video

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
couple of zip ties and I'll put a video

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.410 
couple of zip ties and I'll put a video
of<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.800> ruined<00:00:59.399> most<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
of it and it just ruined most of the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.770 
of it and it just ruined most of the
angle<00:01:01.050> for<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> rest<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> tour<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.600> this

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
angle for the rest of the tour so this

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.690 
angle for the rest of the tour so this
time<00:01:04.080> I'm<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> use<00:01:05.189> something

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
time I'm going to use something

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:34.870 
time I'm going to use something
innovative<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:07.040> hopefully<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.220> work

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.700 

the<00:01:35.880> material<00:01:36.390> I'm<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> use<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.680> called

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
the material I'm going to use is called

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.890 
the material I'm going to use is called
cero<00:01:39.050> rubber-like<00:01:40.050> material<00:01:40.190> like<00:01:41.190> play-doh

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
cero rubber-like material like play-doh

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.670 
cero rubber-like material like play-doh
shape<00:01:42.900> it<00:01:43.080> into<00:01:43.230> any<00:01:43.500> shape<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.610> its<00:01:44.820> main

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
shape it into any shape and its main

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.020 
shape it into any shape and its main
advantage<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.220> will<00:01:47.400> stick<00:01:47.670> anything

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
advantage is that it will stick anything

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:57.469 
advantage is that it will stick anything
to<00:01:48.420> anything<00:01:53.479> so<00:01:54.479> here<00:01:54.660> it<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:56.120> you<00:01:57.120> can<00:01:57.330> see

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
to anything so here it is you can see

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
to anything so here it is you can see
the<00:01:57.630> material<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:59.870> it<00:02:00.870> just<00:02:01.200> filled<00:02:01.680> out<00:02:01.860> all

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the material here it just filled out all

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.499 
the material here it just filled out all
these<00:02:02.670> gaps<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.440> is<00:02:04.620> so<00:02:04.890> strong<00:02:08.509> there's

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
these gaps and it is so strong there's

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.010 
these gaps and it is so strong there's
no<00:02:09.840> way<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:11.070> anywhere

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
no way that this is going anywhere

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.720 
no way that this is going anywhere
it<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.980> fantastic<00:02:14.720> material
