00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
like the warlord set I'm hoping this

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.830 
like the warlord set I'm hoping this
will<00:04:00.340> change<00:04:00.609> eventually<00:04:00.849> because<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.480> really

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
will change eventually because I really

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.089 
will change eventually because I really
missed<00:04:02.019> some<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.349> those<00:04:02.500> thoughts<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:03.040> I

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.680 
missed some of those thoughts and I
don't<00:04:03.310> see<00:04:03.489> why<00:04:03.639> we<00:04:03.819> shouldn't<00:04:04.120> be<00:04:04.329> able<00:04:04.389> to

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
don't see why we shouldn't be able to

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.180 
don't see why we shouldn't be able to
use<00:04:04.930> them

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
use them

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.220
