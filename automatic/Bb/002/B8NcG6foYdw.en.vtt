think came out in like 2002 or 2003 or

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.020

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.920 
so I mean it's kind of excusable for the
time<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.550> it<00:01:00.149> would<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.390> been<00:01:00.480> nice<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.660> see

you<00:01:57.899> know<00:01:57.960> when<00:01:58.170> was<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.469> constructed<00:01:59.299> that

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
you know when was it constructed that

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.870 
you know when was it constructed that
sort<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.600> thing<00:02:00.740> it's<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.100> anything

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
sort of a thing it's not really anything

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.999 
sort of a thing it's not really anything
great<00:02:03.180> because<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.320> animated<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.979> I

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
great because it's not animated and I

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.109 
great because it's not animated and I
think<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.430> picture<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> Mobile

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
think it's just a picture of the Mobile

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.550 
think it's just a picture of the Mobile
Suit<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.719> bunch<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.930> text<00:02:07.170> next<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.409> it

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
Suit and just a bunch of text next to it

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.669 
Suit and just a bunch of text next to it
so<00:02:07.879> it's<00:02:08.879> okay<00:02:09.149> for<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.420> time<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.200> don't

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
so it's okay for the time but I don't

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.120 
so it's okay for the time but I don't
know<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.770> was<00:02:11.039> really<00:02:11.220> necessary

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
know that was really necessary

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.120 
know that was really necessary
looking<00:02:13.760> at<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:13.940> inside<00:02:14.800> there's<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.950> disk

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
looking at the inside there's the disk

custom kind of beat up with all the
pilots<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.570> there<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:41.720> think<00:02:41.780> it's<00:02:41.960> pretty<00:02:42.170> cool

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
pilots on there I think it's pretty cool

pilots on there I think it's pretty cool
shot<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.130> then<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.490> have<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:44.800> list<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:45.950> all<00:02:46.100> the

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
shot and then you have a list of all the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.590 
shot and then you have a list of all the
different<00:02:46.460> chapters<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:48.020> first<00:02:49.270> set<00:02:50.270> is

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
different chapters and the first set is

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.110 
different chapters and the first set is
the<00:02:51.230> OVA<00:02:51.650> version<00:02:52.160> whereas<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.640> second<00:02:52.970> set

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
the OVA version whereas the second set

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.050

is<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.360> movie<00:02:53.570> version<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:55.190> know<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.310> don't

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
is the movie version so you know I don't

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.890 
is the movie version so you know I don't
think<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.240> was<00:02:56.390> really<00:02:56.570> necessary<00:02:56.660> to

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
think that was really necessary to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.600 
think that was really necessary to
include<00:02:57.170> both<00:02:57.320> of<00:02:57.380> them<00:02:57.680> but<00:02:57.830> you've<00:02:58.310> got<00:02:58.460> it

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610

include both of them but you've got it
there<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.420> then<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.900> back<00:03:00.290> side<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.680> just<00:03:00.800> a

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
there and then the back side is just a

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
there and then the back side is just a
bunch<00:03:02.210> of<00:03:02.300> advertisements<00:03:02.900> for<00:03:03.020> other<00:03:03.200> DVDs

chars<00:05:28.789> counter-attack<00:05:29.319> I<00:05:30.319> feel<00:05:30.770> like<00:05:30.919> it's<00:05:31.039> a

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
chars counter-attack I feel like it's a

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.879 
chars counter-attack I feel like it's a
lot<00:05:31.159> more<00:05:31.310> fluid<00:05:31.819> and<00:05:32.199> my<00:05:33.199> biggest<00:05:33.439> problem

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
lot more fluid and my biggest problem

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.469 
lot more fluid and my biggest problem
with<00:05:33.949> chars<00:05:34.159> counter<00:05:34.460> tag<00:05:34.610> is<00:05:34.819> that<00:05:35.089> I<00:05:35.210> feel

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
with chars counter tag is that I feel

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.149 
with chars counter tag is that I feel
like<00:05:35.719> they<00:05:35.839> rushed<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:36.349> second<00:05:36.770> half<00:05:36.979> it

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
like they rushed the second half it

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.110 
like they rushed the second half it
almost<00:05:37.310> seems<00:05:37.520> like<00:05:37.580> it<00:05:37.729> should<00:05:37.849> have<00:05:37.939> been<00:05:38.029> an

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
almost seems like it should have been an

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.100 
almost seems like it should have been an
OVA<00:05:39.159> like<00:05:40.210> obviously<00:05:41.210> not<00:05:41.330> as<00:05:41.449> long<00:05:41.689> as<00:05:41.899> worn

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
OVA like obviously not as long as worn

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.269 
OVA like obviously not as long as worn
the<00:05:42.199> pocket<00:05:42.439> but<00:05:42.560> maybe<00:05:42.680> make<00:05:42.919> a<00:05:42.949> three<00:05:43.219> or

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:43.279 
the pocket but maybe make a three or

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:47.409 
the pocket but maybe make a three or
four<00:05:43.399> episode<00:05:43.699> OVA<00:05:43.939> and<00:05:44.620> then<00:05:46.060> you<00:05:47.060> know<00:05:47.149> that

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
four episode OVA and then you know that

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:48.879 
four episode OVA and then you know that
would<00:05:47.509> have<00:05:47.599> extended<00:05:47.839> it<00:05:48.020> by<00:05:48.080> what<00:05:48.379> like<00:05:48.589> an

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
would have extended it by what like an

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.279 
would have extended it by what like an
hour<00:05:49.069> at<00:05:49.370> least<00:05:49.659> maybe<00:05:50.659> not<00:05:50.839> quite<00:05:50.930> that<00:05:51.050> long

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
hour at least maybe not quite that long

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.709 
hour at least maybe not quite that long
but<00:05:51.669> you<00:05:52.669> know<00:05:52.759> it<00:05:52.909> would<00:05:53.120> have<00:05:53.210> been<00:05:53.300> a<00:05:53.479> little

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:53.719 
but you know it would have been a little

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:54.490 
but you know it would have been a little
bit<00:05:53.810> more<00:05:53.839> time

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
bit more time

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.889 
bit more time
-<00:05:54.649> I<00:05:54.979> think<00:05:55.550> explain<00:05:56.089> things<00:05:56.300> because<00:05:56.479> there's

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:56.899 
- I think explain things because there's

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:58.119 
- I think explain things because there's
a<00:05:56.960> lot<00:05:57.080> of<00:05:57.110> jumping<00:05:57.439> around<00:05:57.560> in<00:05:57.830> the<00:05:57.889> second

00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:58.129 
a lot of jumping around in the second

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.149 
a lot of jumping around in the second
half<00:05:58.250> but<00:05:58.460> I<00:05:58.669> do<00:05:58.969> have<00:05:59.240> to<00:05:59.330> say<00:05:59.479> that<00:05:59.659> um<00:06:00.159> while

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
half but I do have to say that um while

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:02.320 
half but I do have to say that um while
some<00:06:01.339> people<00:06:01.520> some<00:06:01.729> people<00:06:01.939> I<00:06:01.969> know<00:06:02.029> don't

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
some people some people I know don't

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.659 
some people some people I know don't
like<00:06:02.539> the<00:06:02.750> English<00:06:03.439> voice<00:06:03.710> actors<00:06:04.129> I<00:06:04.310> think

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
like the English voice actors I think

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.100 
like the English voice actors I think
they<00:06:04.729> do<00:06:04.819> fantastic<00:06:05.029> jobs<00:06:05.509> in<00:06:05.659> both<00:06:05.750> films

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
they do fantastic jobs in both films

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.990 
they do fantastic jobs in both films
there's<00:06:07.099> only<00:06:07.219> a<00:06:07.339> couple<00:06:07.370> characters<00:06:07.849> where

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
there's only a couple characters where

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.369 
there's only a couple characters where
it's<00:06:08.120> like<00:06:08.270> okay<00:06:08.569> this<00:06:08.719> is<00:06:08.899> kind<00:06:09.139> of<00:06:09.169> silly

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:09.379 
it's like okay this is kind of silly

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:11.980 
it's like okay this is kind of silly
sounding<00:06:09.770> but<00:06:09.949> I<00:06:10.479> think<00:06:11.479> for<00:06:11.599> the<00:06:11.659> most<00:06:11.779> part

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
sounding but I think for the most part

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.869 
sounding but I think for the most part
they<00:06:12.050> did<00:06:12.139> a<00:06:12.199> good<00:06:12.289> job<00:06:12.349> there<00:06:12.680> the<00:06:13.399> animation

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:13.879 
they did a good job there the animation

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.059 
they did a good job there the animation
on<00:06:13.969> both<00:06:14.149> films<00:06:14.449> is<00:06:14.569> absolutely<00:06:15.349> fantastic<00:06:15.949> so

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:16.069 
on both films is absolutely fantastic so
