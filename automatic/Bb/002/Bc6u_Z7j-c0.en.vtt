you gotta solve the strum pattern I'm

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.880 
you gotta solve the strum pattern I'm
using<00:01:33.190> right<00:01:33.820> now<00:01:33.850> is<00:01:34.270> just<00:01:34.870> eighth<00:01:35.020> note<00:01:35.410> down

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
using right now is just eighth note down

nothing fancy just accenting the down
beats<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.220> two<00:01:47.780> three<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.140> four

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
beats one and two three and four

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.210 
beats one and two three and four
and<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.930> I'm<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.290> down<00:01:52.650> strumming

down beats are accented the other ones

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.800 
down beats are accented the other ones
are<00:02:00.900> unaccepted<00:02:01.830> meaning<00:02:02.340> they<00:02:02.520> are<00:02:03.330> quieter

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810
