00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.840
 let's talk about a very topic 

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:07.080
 interesting by the way and that refers to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.730

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.240
 time develops in the institute 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.740

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.730
 taste to the master Carlos Varela that such 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.650

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.320
 What is this initiative about? 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.329
 that started back in 2002, not the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.699
 important congress for educators 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.429

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.730
 congresses open to the entire community 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.399

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.739
 it was in the desire to from where 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.120
 crandon can make a contribution to the 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.970

 interesting their contributions and also not 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.290
 we wanted to put aside in this congress 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.380
 the subject of what technologies do 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.900
 true then we invite mariana

 plasticity of the brain that is going to give a 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.620
 very interesting conference about good 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.859
 the whole subject of the modifies the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.620
 modifiability of the brain and the subject 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:23.260
 of stress and that is a subject that is 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.760
 appearing already in children and as the 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.709
 stress can harm the processes 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.400
 of learning and it's also going to 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.400
 accompany 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.290
 mariah this mariana pércovich that is the 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.470
 Director of the National School of Art 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.090
 dramatic and this is going to be a contribution 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.250
 that we also find interesting a 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.530
 aspect that can not be left aside 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.409
 today the teachers what is it that makes the 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.129
 relationship with art and the formation of 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.409
 the citizens 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.359
 this is very interesting because the 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.829
 Institute takes the looks beyond 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.139
 the logical concern that can have 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.200
 by his students or his teachers is a 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:00.669
 contribution made to national education 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.859
 taking into account all the criticisms 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:04.959
 difficulties and bad results that 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.240
 have obtained in recent years if 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.170
 we have had 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.470
 luck in the five previous congresses 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:17.860
 that there are always more than 300 participants 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.640
 At this moment we are almost 250 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:24.430
 registered for the congress and have 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.800
 Teachers participated in practically 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.970
 all the departments of the country and of 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.300
 the different branches of education 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.910
 we have teacher training students 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.140
 we have primary school teachers 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.420
 high school teachers of the 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.300
 university on screen are the 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:44.530
 numbers to contact to register 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.570
 2 4 8 7 3 3 7 5 through the 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.000
 address congress at point crandon 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.910
 edu point uy and I guess if they go for 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.200
 this sixth edition should not have 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.970
 collected the previous good 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.400
 results that stimulate them to follow 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.080
 forward to continue generating this kind of 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.600
 This is not the case, they warn that 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.010
 those who participate are enriched 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.780
 as paraguay carlos after the a 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.820
 where students feel themselves 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.830
 and really we always make a 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.330
 evaluation with all the participants 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.099
 congressional 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.759
 we try to take into account the 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.840
 observations that are made and good the 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.090
 joy that we have is that there are people 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.490
 that years ago we accompany truth 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.009
 there are not some people who are 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.020
 they come for the first time to the congress but 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.789
 there are others who have accompanied us in 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.879
 different events because I think it's 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:34.000
 a good opportunity to face 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:37.120
 listen to a different voice to reflect 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.400
 about what we are doing not and I 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.620
 this one I really like an idea that 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.900
 has this doctor stanislao antelo who 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.849
 it was good that one always has to 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.949
 think that another education is possible 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.620
 true and that things can be done 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:53.919
 otherwise I think that's what 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.590
 we have to try to deepen in 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.659
 each one of us and know good that 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.659
 I can do otherwise so that 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:03.400
 things go better 7 and 8 June is the 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:06.310
 invitation then to participate in this 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.439
 congress organized by the institute 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.370
 creating teachers in the 21st century 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:11.080

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.479
 order to spread any kind of 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.110
 entrepreneurship these characteristics that 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.870
 they benefit us 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.230
 and we now go ahead with 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.230
