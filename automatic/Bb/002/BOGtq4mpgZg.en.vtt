and thus the latest each formation which

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.930 
and thus the latest each formation which
is<00:03:38.140> visible<00:03:38.500> in<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:39.250> fabric<00:03:39.670> at<00:03:39.850> these<00:03:40.240> points

is visible in the fabric at these points

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.050 
is visible in the fabric at these points
the<00:03:42.940> trickle<00:03:43.450> machine<00:03:43.840> has<00:03:44.650> an<00:03:45.250> angle<00:03:45.880> of

the trickle machine has an angle of

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.160 
the trickle machine has an angle of
about<00:03:46.680> 90<00:03:47.680> degree<00:03:48.130> between<00:03:48.760> fabric<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.540> warp

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
about 90 degree between fabric and warp

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.940 
about 90 degree between fabric and warp
yarns<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.730> resulting<00:03:52.420> forces<00:03:52.930> on<00:03:53.320> the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950

machine<00:03:57.600> therefore<00:03:58.600> other<00:03:58.720> fine<00:03:59.170> fabrics<00:03:59.830> are

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
machine therefore other fine fabrics are

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.030
