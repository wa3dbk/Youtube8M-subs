00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.250
 Hi everyone 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.280
 so if I wanted to give an idea for a 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.880
 light but tasty dish and in my opinion 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.060
 of effect then it is an extract in the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.730
 which I also include fruit 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.199
 precisely of oranges and apples 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 then here I have just your live of the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.470
 oranges these are all the oranges I have 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.739
 you pay in little pieces and I put them in the room 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.579
 pull the same thing I'm going to do with two 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.480
 small apples then sliced leo now 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:47.489
 the small sizes you have inserted 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:53.809
 together with oranges and make the pieces 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.809
 in short, a dimension you prefer 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.670
 here it is 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.439
 here 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.030
 I mix already a little bit so the apple does not 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.960
 defends the aim with the how here is 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.890
 then along with oranges and apples 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.280
 goes to add olives to keep that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.010
 I think they're fine 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.710
 together with this combination then a 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.650
 little black olives with their ho 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.690
 read these are small olives and 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.790
 Peanut jades really are 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:51.060

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:36.930

 it really amazes because in short there is not 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.700

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.769
 oil and salt may be pleasant in 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:51.380
