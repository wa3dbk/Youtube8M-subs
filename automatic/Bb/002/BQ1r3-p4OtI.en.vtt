there<00:01:04.589> are<00:01:04.769> EXO<00:01:05.430> suits<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.290> think<00:01:07.619> exosuits

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
there are EXO suits and I think exosuits

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.690 
there are EXO suits and I think exosuits
make<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.390> better<00:01:09.890> because<00:01:10.890> what<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.520> do

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
make it better because what you can do

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.960 
make it better because what you can do
is<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.420> your<00:01:12.570> exosuits<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.970> add

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
is you can up for your exosuits and add

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.149 
is you can up for your exosuits and add
new<00:01:15.390> abilities<00:01:15.930> by<00:01:16.259> new<00:01:16.439> abilities<00:01:16.950> for

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
new abilities by new abilities for

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.460 
new abilities by new abilities for
exosuit<00:01:17.640> throughout<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> game<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
exosuit throughout the game and it

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.980 
exosuit throughout the game and it
actually<00:01:19.619> makes<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:21.060> has<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.750> bit<00:01:21.930> of

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
actually makes it it has a little bit of

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
actually makes it it has a little bit of
replay<00:01:22.500> value<00:01:23.060> but<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.409> downfall<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:26.000> EXO

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
replay value but the downfall for EXO

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.899

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.979 
that's the only thing they really
improved<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.940> just<00:02:53.180> like<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.360> upgrading

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
improved is just like the upgrading

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.190 
improved is just like the upgrading
system<00:02:54.350> you<00:02:54.410> can<00:02:54.530> upgrade<00:02:54.769> things<00:02:55.430> now<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.200> I

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
system you can upgrade things now and I

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.080 
system you can upgrade things now and I

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.490 
really but with this you can upgrade
things<00:03:01.690> but<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.780> weapons<00:03:03.080> are<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.290> same

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
things but the weapons are the same

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.370 
things but the weapons are the same
buying<00:03:03.920> weapons<00:03:04.130> buying<00:03:04.580> attachments<00:03:05.420> all

those things buying ammo everything else

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.400 
those things buying ammo everything else
is<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.650> same<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:11.480> rounds<00:03:11.930> are<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.110> little

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
is the same and the rounds are a little

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.979 
is the same and the rounds are a little
bit<00:03:12.650> different<00:03:13.069> once<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.430> get<00:03:13.549> around<00:03:13.819> 25<00:03:14.690> it

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
bit different once you get around 25 it

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.340 
bit different once you get around 25 it
actually<00:03:15.880> resets<00:03:16.880> like<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.390> enemies<00:03:17.840> the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
actually resets like the enemies the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.979 
actually resets like the enemies the
enemies<00:03:18.380> that<00:03:18.890> were<00:03:19.070> on<00:03:19.310> wave<00:03:19.670> 1<00:03:20.000> will<00:03:20.660> be<00:03:20.810> on

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
enemies that were on wave 1 will be on

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.130 
enemies that were on wave 1 will be on
around<00:03:21.130> 26<00:03:22.130> it'll<00:03:22.459> just<00:03:22.489> say<00:03:22.850> it's<00:03:23.810> hard<00:03:24.019> to

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
around 26 it'll just say it's hard to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.569 
around 26 it'll just say it's hard to
it's<00:03:24.350> always<00:03:24.709> weird<00:03:24.829> really<00:03:25.010> weird<00:03:25.130> it<00:03:25.489> will

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
it's always weird really weird it will

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.819 
it's always weird really weird it will
it<00:03:25.940> will<00:03:25.970> go<00:03:26.269> from<00:03:26.420> 25<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.410> then<00:03:27.530> I'll<00:03:27.620> be<00:03:27.799> a

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
it will go from 25 and then I'll be a

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.270 
it will go from 25 and then I'll be a
one<00:03:28.160> with<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.750> right<00:03:30.410> above<00:03:30.620> it's<00:03:30.799> like<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:30.950> 1

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
one with a to right above it's like a 1

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.370 
one with a to right above it's like a 1
squared<00:03:31.820> right<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.359> if<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:32.840> beat<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.079> again

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
squared right and if you beat it again

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.319 
squared right and if you beat it again
and<00:03:33.500> I'll<00:03:33.590> have<00:03:33.799> a<00:03:33.829> one<00:03:34.160> with<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.489> 3<00:03:34.850> on<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.180> right

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
and I'll have a one with a 3 on it right

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.220 
and I'll have a one with a 3 on it right
so<00:03:35.540> just<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:36.590> really<00:03:36.680> weird<00:03:37.370> how<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.760> works

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
so just it's really weird how it works

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.599 
so just it's really weird how it works
but<00:03:39.230> they<00:03:39.350> have<00:03:39.470> changed<00:03:39.859> a<00:03:39.920> couple<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.340> things

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
but they have changed a couple of things

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.890 
but they have changed a couple of things
but<00:03:41.049> overall<00:03:42.049> guys<00:03:42.519> it<00:03:43.519> just<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:44.030> doesn't<00:03:44.420> have

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
but overall guys it just it doesn't have

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.900 
but overall guys it just it doesn't have
a<00:03:44.930> replay<00:03:45.560> value<00:03:45.739> there's<00:03:46.070> no<00:03:46.250> ranking<00:03:46.760> up

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
a replay value there's no ranking up

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.410 
a replay value there's no ranking up
system<00:03:47.390> in<00:03:47.540> here<00:03:47.900> I<00:03:48.190> just<00:03:49.190> I<00:03:49.459> think<00:03:49.730> it's

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
system in here I just I think it's

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.870 
system in here I just I think it's
actually<00:03:51.260> kind<00:03:51.530> of<00:03:51.590> stupid<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:52.310> then<00:03:52.790> you

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
actually kind of stupid and then you

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.300 
actually kind of stupid and then you
have<00:03:53.030> that<00:03:53.060> one<00:03:53.630> zombie<00:03:54.320> wave<00:03:54.530> which<00:03:54.859> is<00:03:55.040> for

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
have that one zombie wave which is for

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.700 
have that one zombie wave which is for
one<00:03:55.549> round<00:03:55.819> and<00:03:56.180> early

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
one round and early

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.310 
one round and early

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
I thought it would be XO survival is a

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.170 
I thought it would be XO survival is a
lot<00:04:08.380> better<00:04:08.650> than<00:04:08.860> I<00:04:08.950> thought<00:04:08.980> it<00:04:09.370> would<00:04:09.550> be<00:04:09.880> um

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
lot better than I thought it would be um

better<00:05:43.090> than<00:05:43.240> I<00:05:43.450> thought<00:05:43.810> it<00:05:43.990> was<00:05:44.140> but<00:05:44.500> the

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
better than I thought it was but the

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.900 
better than I thought it was but the
replay<00:05:45.910> value<00:05:46.180> just<00:05:46.750> isn't<00:05:47.350> there<00:05:47.620> and<00:05:47.910> that's

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
replay value just isn't there and that's

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.560 
replay value just isn't there and that's
why<00:05:49.240> EXO<00:05:49.870> survival<00:05:50.050> just<00:05:50.760> it's<00:05:51.760> not<00:05:52.030> good<00:05:52.360> it's
