00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
anyway but I was unbearably cold all the

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.000 
anyway but I was unbearably cold all the
time<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.400> would<00:00:59.760> wear<00:00:59.970> three<00:01:00.780> layers<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.560> sit

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
time I would wear three layers and sit

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.650 
time I would wear three layers and sit
in<00:01:02.100> front<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.310> the<00:01:02.370> fireplace<00:01:02.520> all<00:01:02.940> day<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.510> was

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
in front of the fireplace all day it was

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.920 
in front of the fireplace all day it was
really<00:01:04.439> bad<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.920> second<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> first<00:01:06.570> few

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
really bad and second for the first few

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.170 
really bad and second for the first few
days<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.500> eating<00:01:07.710> plant-based<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.369> was<00:01:08.549> really

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
days of eating plant-based I was really

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.080 
days of eating plant-based I was really
dizzy<00:01:09.689> all<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.259> time<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.829> I<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.939> was

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
dizzy all the time and I think it was

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.809 
dizzy all the time and I think it was
from<00:01:12.329> the<00:01:12.749> blood<00:01:13.079> sugar<00:01:13.350> spikes<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.280> drops

00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:14.819 
from the blood sugar spikes and drops

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:16.520 
from the blood sugar spikes and drops
and<00:01:15.240> my<00:01:15.509> body<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.749> wasn't<00:01:16.170> used<00:01:16.289> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and my body just wasn't used to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.760 
and my body just wasn't used to
digesting<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.729> much<00:01:18.030> sugar<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.869> time<00:01:19.350> so

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
digesting that much sugar at a time so

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.340 
digesting that much sugar at a time so
yeah<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.069> took<00:01:20.130> some<00:01:20.460> time<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.749> level<00:01:21.749> out<00:01:22.079> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
yeah it took some time to level out and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.620 
yeah it took some time to level out and
become<00:01:23.219> normalized<00:01:23.670> again<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.179> after<00:01:24.389> that

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
become normalized again but after that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.090 
become normalized again but after that
then<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.670> know<00:01:26.759> sugar<00:01:27.450> Peaks<00:01:27.899> started<00:01:28.889> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
then the you know sugar Peaks started to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.669 
then the you know sugar Peaks started to
stay<00:01:29.609> higher<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.630> longer<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.020> there<00:01:31.560> was

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
stay higher for longer and there was

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.069 
stay higher for longer and there was
less<00:01:31.889> of<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.189> draw<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.639> also<00:01:32.969> was<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:33.749> tired

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
less of a draw I also was really tired

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.590 
less of a draw I also was really tired
too<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.889> I<00:01:34.950> was<00:01:35.100> getting<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.490> ton<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.789> sleep<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
too and I was getting a ton of sleep and

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.840 
too and I was getting a ton of sleep and
I<00:01:37.560> wasn't<00:01:37.770> sure<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.100> was<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.399> on<00:01:38.549> I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
I wasn't sure what was going on I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.830 
I wasn't sure what was going on I
thought<00:01:38.999> I<00:01:39.060> should<00:01:39.149> be<00:01:39.359> getting<00:01:39.659> all<00:01:39.749> this

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
thought I should be getting all this

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.770 
thought I should be getting all this
energy<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.560> everyone's<00:01:40.979> saying<00:01:41.249> but<00:01:42.179> I<00:01:42.509> was

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
energy like everyone's saying but I was

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.599 
energy like everyone's saying but I was
tired<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.319> also<00:01:43.530> was<00:01:43.740> never<00:01:43.889> hungry<00:01:44.219> but<00:01:44.459> I

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
tired I also was never hungry but I

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.459 
tired I also was never hungry but I
don't<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:44.969> that<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.240> more<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.749> a<00:01:45.840> detox

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
don't know if that was more of a detox

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.849 
don't know if that was more of a detox
symptoms<00:01:47.420> no<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.659> don't<00:01:48.929> think<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.380> was<00:01:49.499> as<00:01:49.709> much

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
symptoms no I don't think it was as much

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.190 
symptoms no I don't think it was as much
of<00:01:50.039> a<00:01:50.100> detox<00:01:50.490> symptom<00:01:50.880> compared<00:01:51.359> to<00:01:51.569> just

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
of a detox symptom compared to just

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.469 
of a detox symptom compared to just
getting<00:01:52.889> used<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.399> being<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.670> full<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.450> the
