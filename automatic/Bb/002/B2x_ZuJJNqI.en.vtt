00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.810
 Hello everyone, do you watch the video ? 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.100
 fights and we're still at photokina 2014 on 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.020
 this time we charged on the stand a moment he 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.750
 Naturally the first camera to which we 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.790
 really wanted to see this d750 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.829
 which was presented literally two 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.190
 days ago new now on with us already in 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.710
 hands 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.420
 update 700 series waited a long six 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.750
 years old nikon fans 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.670
 After sex, a number of 10 700 cameras, well, nothing 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.890
 was not and now suddenly jumped right away 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:00.070
 and 710 720 730 and 740 and immediately made 750 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.960
 model she is ost of us sitting between herself 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.330
 junior full-frame SLR 610 d and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.640
 810 than she is good and how is it different 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.590
 from other cameras first she purposely 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.390
 almost steeper than all combined 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.729
 nikon full frame cameras 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.700
 there are 24 world pixel bi mos 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.920
 full-frame sensor sensor which in 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.310
 difference from all other new cameras 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.080
 nikon 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.970
 he has such an oah filter 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.009
 smoothing that's a little weird 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.780
 what about what was the trend when 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.090
 everyone refused to increase it 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.520
 detail further, but in nikon considered 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.500
 what is it really a workhorse that 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.209
 will buy a lot of people and they do not need 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.190
 problems with the mayor in any of his 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:41.679
 manifestation therefore decided to go this 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.890
 filter leave the module installed here 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:48.099
 autofocus multicam 3 502 versions then 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.500
 there is in contrast to the same d4s and d810 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:52.060
 which costs much more to him even 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.110
 cooler autofocus should be at 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.890
 at least tth 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.580
 how will she be 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.150
 it can be seen in real life 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.640
 stand 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.390
 do not see really well, ie it 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.860
 I'm tied a little so failed 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.530
 fully experience us as far as 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.590
 fox classes but even in this light 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.470
 take off one of the slicing okay well i 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.910
 I was satisfied to eat 50 51. autofocus 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.980
 15 of them are cruciform 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.840
 and there's a cool feature here 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.000
 this is a swiveling display he is a doctor 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.000
 funds for you so here up already 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.850
 why is it like this and down well to the very 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.920
 bottom we will not let him go why is he cool 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.660
 because this is the first rotary display 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.489
 Generally in full frame cameras Nikon 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.190
 responsibly for those who shoot video 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.780
 or a photo of the lowest angles is very 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.930
 cool 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.800
 its resolution is 720 by 480 diagonal 32 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.190
 inches they are three inches and it is built by 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.130
 rgbw stress pattern except blue 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.800
 green and red su pixels one 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.470
 pixel also forms an additional 4 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.450
 white pixel respectively when you 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.950
 need to show only beat information 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.320
 it only burns instead of 3 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.870
 naturally saves electricity and 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.280
 cameras live longer bones from threesome 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.290
 full-frame cameras besides 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.380
 professional d4s is the most 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.799
 long-lived from one charge to right 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.989
 of this 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.239
 in the bright sun there will be more 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.370
 maxim brightness than with classic rgb 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.799
 displays the basis of the apparatus magnesium 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.739
 alloy is collected on the hands and hands 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.989
 it feels about the same as d610 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:31.489
 They are d800 from the appstore and in size and by 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.440
 weight is also closer to gt 610 of 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.720
 ports here there is a microphone input 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.090
 headphone output remote control 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.400
 hdmi and usb in general, everything that can in general 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.130
 need a photographer and videographer and 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.549
 management here is also very similar 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.549
 d610 exactly the same there are the modes of those modes 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.440
 do some rings with a serial shot and 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.680
 everyone else is the same extra 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.510
 country display all the buttons that were 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.079
 there live view switching photos and videos 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.090
 regime 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.390
 here preserved but in general the camera 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.110
 convenient here there are two slots for sd 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.379
 cards 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.349
 they are compact flash and sd like some 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.480
 other cameras so I such a 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.810
 I generally like the approach, but that's not 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.479
 Liked it the most accurate minimum 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.580
 Fast shutter speed on a 4000 nick Well 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.280
 how so but in d610 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:26.289
 but somehow you can understand in df it was 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.090
 failure and everything would highly well, why in 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.250
 d750 which well really it would be 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.720
 very cool workhorse a 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.200
 in fact , the country is cool working 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.510
 a horse 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.400
 there will be a photographer for many, but that's just 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.919
 introduced such an effective restriction 1 4 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.419
 in person so that people buy in the end d810 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.250
 who need one 8000 on 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.090
 Well, who will shoot there with 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.860
 effective with dark 14 and everything in the sun is not 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.360
 close behind the 100 viewfinder here 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.360
 cool with one hundred percent coverage 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.039
 frames increase 07 exe further and and even 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.740
 oled panel to which shows 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.500
 alien information by the way she too 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.200
 saves electricity reached become 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.390
 I really liked it here at last 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.849
 That is, the built-in module Wi-Fi thanks 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.800
 finally you will not demand 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.690
 money for an optional module which 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.200
 no one buys it is not comfortable you need it 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.930
 separately 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.880
 cling to some port and one port 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.260
 correspondingly less now 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.450
 built-in wifi module can 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.960
 reset fotochek use smartphone 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.729
 as 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.370
 or which remote viewfinder in 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:29.260
 overall very cool and the last video 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:33.430
 The d750â€™s capabilities are very close to 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.669
 810 models because there is 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.070
 normal 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.320
 ability to control the diaphragm during 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.360
 video recording time and just when 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.820
 Like like you and not like others 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.070
 cameras need to turn it off 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.260
 change the diaphragm back close review 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.420
 and the video is written in pools here feels 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.240
 up to 60 frames per second and progressive 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.690
 sweep supported all sorts of comfortable 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.750
 features 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.490
 for videographers in general for video 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.520
 Really very convenient camera claimed 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.350
 price of carcass is 2 300 dollars and buy it 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.930
 it will be possible this month so 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.690
 save up money sell your 7 acres 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.670
 600 hee and buy this cool machine 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.080
 then watching it all you watched the video on 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.220
 site frame com at the exhibition photokina 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.220
 2014 bye
