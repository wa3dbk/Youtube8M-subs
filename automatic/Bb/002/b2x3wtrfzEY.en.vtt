00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.810 
kept them on the roads I think that's a
you<00:00:11.129> know<00:00:11.219> some<00:00:11.430> that<00:00:11.550> we've<00:00:11.670> been<00:00:11.760> talking

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.870 
about building on leads and keeping the
pressure<00:00:14.670> up<00:00:14.940> not<00:00:15.870> playing<00:00:16.460> not<00:00:17.460> dropping<00:00:17.670> our

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
pressure up not playing not dropping our

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.070 
pressure up not playing not dropping our
level<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.180> play<00:00:18.420> just<00:00:18.720> because<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
level of play just because the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.409
