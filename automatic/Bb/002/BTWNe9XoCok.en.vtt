another reason why I got this insane

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.439 
another reason why I got this insane
gameplay<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.699> we're<00:00:29.820> gonna<00:00:29.939> be<00:00:30.029> addressing

gameplay that we're gonna be addressing

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.810 
gameplay that we're gonna be addressing
is<00:00:30.750> map<00:00:31.170> awareness<00:00:31.619> now<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.340> lot<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.700> people

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
is map awareness now a lot of people

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.459 
is map awareness now a lot of people
don't<00:00:33.210> know<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.690> has<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.200> with<00:00:34.230> how

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
don't know that this has to do with how

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.350 
don't know that this has to do with how
many<00:00:34.530> good<00:00:34.890> game<00:00:35.070> plays<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.610> get<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.000> I

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
many good game plays you can get and I

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.880 
many good game plays you can get and I
really<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.050> probably<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
really think it's probably one of the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860 
really think it's probably one of the
most<00:00:38.010> vital<00:00:38.370> things<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
most vital things that you have to do to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.450 
most vital things that you have to do to
be<00:00:39.989> able<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.320> get<00:00:40.440> insane<00:00:40.770> game<00:00:41.010> plays<00:00:41.280> like

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
be able to get insane game plays like

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.700 
be able to get insane game plays like
this<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.540> need<00:00:42.750> map<00:00:42.960> awareness<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.649> if

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
this so you need map awareness and if

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.779 
this so you need map awareness and if
you<00:00:43.800> guys<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.129> know<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:44.309> map<00:00:44.489> awareness

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
you guys don't know what map awareness

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.310 
you guys don't know what map awareness
is<00:00:45.180> I'm<00:00:45.390> gonna<00:00:45.510> tell<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> guys<00:00:45.870> right<00:00:46.020> here

you can see in this game play I'm

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.250 
you can see in this game play I'm
running<00:00:48.120> around<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.539> submachine<00:00:48.899> gun

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
running around with the submachine gun

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.959 
running around with the submachine gun
and<00:00:49.440> score<00:00:50.070> streaks<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.430> I'm<00:00:50.550> using<00:00:50.730> for

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and score streaks that I'm using for

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.150 
and score streaks that I'm using for
today<00:00:51.210> are<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> orbital<00:00:51.960> vsat<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.469> k-9<00:00:52.890> unit

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
today are the orbital vsat the k-9 unit

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.529 
today are the orbital vsat the k-9 unit
in<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> swarm<00:00:53.610> which<00:00:53.730> also<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.420> with

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
in the swarm which also have to do with

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.420 
in the swarm which also have to do with
map<00:00:54.719> awareness<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> believe<00:00:55.739> me<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.340> you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
map awareness if you believe me so you

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.709 
map awareness if you believe me so you
don't<00:00:56.760> really<00:00:56.850> want<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> go<00:00:57.270> towards<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
don't really want to go towards the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.150 
don't really want to go towards the
middle<00:00:57.870> because<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> middle<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> just

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
middle because in the middle if you just

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.619 
middle because in the middle if you just
run<00:00:59.340> out<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.699> think<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.210> outgun

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
run out and you think you can outgun

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.049 
run out and you think you can outgun
everybody<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.350> an<00:01:01.440> SMG<00:01:01.770> knowing<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.820> you

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
everybody with an SMG knowing you you

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.149 
everybody with an SMG knowing you you
probably<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.989> i'm<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.409> taking<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> odds<00:01:04.949> i

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
probably can i'm just taking the odds i

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.440 
probably can i'm just taking the odds i
can't<00:01:05.519> do<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.909> you'll<00:01:06.030> probably<00:01:06.180> get

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
can't do that and you'll probably get

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.270 
can't do that and you'll probably get
shot<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> little<00:01:07.290> baby<00:01:07.350> buffalo<00:01:07.890> so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
shot up like a little baby buffalo so

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.100 
shot up like a little baby buffalo so
definitely<00:01:08.670> don't<00:01:08.880> go<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.240> try<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.780> so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
definitely don't go and try that and so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.510 
definitely don't go and try that and so
the<00:01:10.290> thing<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.680> has<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.130> my<00:01:11.220> score

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the thing that has to do with my score

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.160 
the thing that has to do with my score
streaks<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.909> reason<00:01:12.210> i<00:01:12.299> did<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.689> well<00:01:12.840> again

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
streaks of reason i did so well again

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.899 
streaks of reason i did so well again
was<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.890> i<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:14.070> able<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> shoot<00:01:14.700> enemies

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
was because i was able to shoot enemies

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.789 
was because i was able to shoot enemies
with<00:01:15.240> my<00:01:15.360> gun<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.750> whole<00:01:15.900> game<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.290> didn't<00:01:16.740> have

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
with my gun the whole game I didn't have

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.410 
with my gun the whole game I didn't have
to<00:01:16.950> control<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.490> kill<00:01:17.700> streak<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> lame

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to control one kill streak like the lame

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
to control one kill streak like the lame
old<00:01:18.570> lodestar<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> VTOL<00:01:19.619> warship<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.220> was<00:01:20.520> able

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
old lodestar the VTOL warship I was able

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.160 
old lodestar the VTOL warship I was able
to<00:01:20.820> run<00:01:20.970> around<00:01:21.090> running<00:01:21.509> gun<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.930> kill<00:01:22.049> all

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to run around running gun and kill all

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.020 
to run around running gun and kill all
the<00:01:22.290> enemies<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.710> possibly<00:01:23.159> could<00:01:23.369> because<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the enemies I possibly could because the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.999 
the enemies I possibly could because the
k-9<00:01:24.540> unit<00:01:24.810> controls<00:01:25.200> itself<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.770> does<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
k-9 unit controls itself so does the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.740 
k-9 unit controls itself so does the
orbital<00:01:26.340> vsat<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:26.880> does<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.150> swarm<00:01:27.390> so

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
orbital vsat and so does the swarm so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.060 
orbital vsat and so does the swarm so
they<00:01:27.869> work<00:01:28.049> together<00:01:28.229> really<00:01:28.560> well<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
they work together really well and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.859 
they work together really well and
that's<00:01:29.159> really<00:01:29.430> how<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.820> able<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.659> well

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
that's really how is able to do so well

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.539 
that's really how is able to do so well

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that I'm really really aware what's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.530 
that I'm really really aware what's
going<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.799> when<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.520> an<00:01:38.579> enemy<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:39.180> enemies

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
going on when I see an enemy for enemies

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.390 
going on when I see an enemy for enemies
coming<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:39.960> me<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.259> probably<00:01:40.710> won't<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.310> go

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
coming at me I probably won't just go

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.980 
coming at me I probably won't just go
head<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.970> try<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.180> outgun<00:01:42.570> all<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.869> them

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
head on and try and outgun all of them

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.660 
head on and try and outgun all of them
because<00:01:43.229> probably<00:01:43.470> i<00:01:43.860> don't<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> best

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
because probably i don't have the best

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.249 
because probably i don't have the best
guns<00:01:44.909> good<00:01:45.119> i<00:01:45.180> really<00:01:45.450> don't<00:01:45.689> i<00:01:45.869> personally

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
guns good i really don't i personally

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.780 
guns good i really don't i personally
don't<00:01:46.590> think<00:01:46.649> i<00:01:46.829> do<00:01:46.920> i<00:01:47.070> think<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
don't think i do i think one of the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.819 
don't think i do i think one of the
things<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.210> reason<00:01:48.540> why<00:01:48.689> i<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.200> well<00:01:49.380> why<00:01:49.799> I

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
things the reason why i do so well why I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.889 
things the reason why i do so well why I
can<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.130> consistently<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.000> well<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.360> because<00:01:51.420> I

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
can do consistently so well is because I

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.230 
can do consistently so well is because I
use<00:01:52.350> tactics<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.159> my<00:01:53.280> advantage<00:01:53.549> i'm<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.970> really

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240

use tactics to my advantage i'm a really
tactical<00:01:54.780> person<00:01:55.170> i<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.710> about<00:01:55.920> everything

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
tactical person i think about everything

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.950 
tactical person i think about everything
where<00:01:56.549> I'm<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:57.060> what<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.329> doing<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.780> type

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
where I'm going what I'm doing what type

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.510 
where I'm going what I'm doing what type
of<00:01:57.990> gun<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.469> what<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> enemies<00:01:59.189> are<00:01:59.219> like

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
of gun I have what the enemies are like

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.340 
of gun I have what the enemies are like
I<00:01:59.700> kind<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.119> learn<00:02:00.329> what<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.630> enemies<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.170> what

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
I kind of learn what the enemies do what

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.870 
I kind of learn what the enemies do what
kind<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.619> guns<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.979> enemies<00:02:02.280> use<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
kind of guns the enemies use what the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.550 
kind of guns the enemies use what the
score<00:02:03.119> streaks<00:02:03.390> still<00:02:03.450> running<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.259> overall

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
score streaks still running just overall

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.810 
score streaks still running just overall
how<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:04.920> play<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.610> basically

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
how they play and I can basically

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.940 
how they play and I can basically
counter<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.930> being<00:02:07.290> able<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.649> counter

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
counter that and being able to counter

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.350 
counter that and being able to counter
the<00:02:08.039> enemy's<00:02:08.369> strong<00:02:08.640> point<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.030> something

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
the enemy's strong point is something

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.969 
the enemy's strong point is something
that<00:02:09.479> really<00:02:09.750> works<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.229> real<00:02:10.410> life<00:02:10.560> too<00:02:10.770> if

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that really works in real life too if

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.650 
that really works in real life too if
somebody's<00:02:11.489> making<00:02:11.640> funny<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.239> can<00:02:12.360> probably

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
somebody's making funny you can probably

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.490 
somebody's making funny you can probably
counter<00:02:13.140> this

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
counter this

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.020 
counter this
point<00:02:13.860> maybe<00:02:14.040> they're<00:02:14.280> making<00:02:14.550> funnier<00:02:14.850> hair

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
point maybe they're making funnier hair

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.000 
point maybe they're making funnier hair
or<00:02:15.270> something<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.050> make<00:02:16.200> fun<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.440> them<00:02:16.650> of

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
or something you can make fun of them of

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.830 
or something you can make fun of them of
their<00:02:17.160> shoulders<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.640> don't<00:02:18.180> know<00:02:18.270> guys<00:02:18.450> I'm

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
their shoulders I don't know guys I'm

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.180 
their shoulders I don't know guys I'm
just<00:02:19.080> saying<00:02:19.230> something<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.710> can<00:02:19.860> counter

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
just saying something you can counter

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.620 
just saying something you can counter
that<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.490> real<00:02:20.670> life<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:21.030> can<00:02:21.150> also<00:02:21.270> counter

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
that in real life you can also counter

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.390 
that in real life you can also counter
anything<00:02:22.020> in<00:02:22.140> call<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.350> duty<00:02:22.470> it's<00:02:22.980> basically

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
anything in call of duty it's basically

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.920 
anything in call of duty it's basically
counter<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:23.940> everything<00:02:24.030> besides<00:02:24.510> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
counter to everything besides the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.510 
counter to everything besides the
orbital<00:02:25.290> vsat<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.800> mean<00:02:25.920> there's<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.250> counter

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
orbital vsat I mean there's the counter

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.700 
orbital vsat I mean there's the counter
UAV<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.300> not<00:02:27.480> many<00:02:27.840> people<00:02:28.170> run<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.410> counter

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
UAV but not many people run the counter

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.040 
UAV but not many people run the counter
UAV<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.730> good<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.090> all<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.660> really

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
UAV it's good and all but I really

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.690 
UAV it's good and all but I really
prefer<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.470> orbital<00:02:31.800> vsat<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.250> orbital<00:02:32.580> vsat

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
prefer the orbital vsat the orbital vsat

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.280 
prefer the orbital vsat the orbital vsat
is<00:02:32.970> absolutely<00:02:33.540> insane<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.990> tells<00:02:34.140> me<00:02:34.170> where

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
is absolutely insane it tells me where

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.660 
is absolutely insane it tells me where
every<00:02:34.620> single<00:02:34.860> one<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.100> enemies<00:02:35.430> are<00:02:35.459> at

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
every single one of the enemies are at

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.280 
every single one of the enemies are at
that's<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.090> huge<00:02:36.360> advantage<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:36.990> definitely

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
that's a huge advantage so definitely

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.350 
that's a huge advantage so definitely
definitely<00:02:37.500> definitely<00:02:37.740> definitely<00:02:38.330> have<00:02:39.330> a
