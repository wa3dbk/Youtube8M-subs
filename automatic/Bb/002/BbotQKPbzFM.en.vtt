00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
ending is to me so the first thing I

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.480 
ending is to me so the first thing I
should<00:01:56.410> probably<00:01:56.710> do<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.039> give<00:01:57.160> you<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.280> quick

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
should probably do is give you a quick

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.460

rundown<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.030> plot<00:01:58.270> now<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.869> series<00:01:59.200> is

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
rundown of the plot now the series is

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.770 
enough to actually get a date with show
all<00:04:51.550> of<00:04:51.760> this<00:04:51.850> happens<00:04:52.240> within<00:04:52.390> I<00:04:52.540> think<00:04:52.570> the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
all of this happens within I think the

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.410 
all of this happens within I think the
first<00:04:52.990> 15<00:04:53.320> chapters<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.790> plot<00:04:55.060> seems<00:04:55.300> to

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
first 15 chapters and the plot seems to

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.520 
first 15 chapters and the plot seems to
be<00:04:55.510> moving<00:04:55.720> around<00:04:55.810> really<00:04:56.050> quickly<00:04:56.440> because

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
be moving around really quickly because

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.710 
be moving around really quickly because
at<00:04:56.950> the<00:04:57.220> beginning<00:04:57.340> of<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.670> series<00:04:57.910> you're

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
at the beginning of the series you're

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.380 
at the beginning of the series you're
moving<00:04:59.260> toward<00:04:59.620> this<00:05:00.220> guy<00:05:00.490> wants<00:05:01.150> to<00:05:01.180> date

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
moving toward this guy wants to date

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.210 
moving toward this guy wants to date
this<00:05:01.540> girl<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.170> maybe<00:05:02.290> like<00:05:02.530> 15<00:05:02.860> chapters

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
this girl and maybe like 15 chapters

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.610 
this girl and maybe like 15 chapters
later<00:05:03.600> okay<00:05:04.600> there<00:05:04.810> you<00:05:04.840> go<00:05:04.930> plot<00:05:05.230> resolved

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
later okay there you go plot resolved

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.680 
later okay there you go plot resolved
then<00:05:05.860> I<00:05:05.920> read<00:05:06.130> that<00:05:06.310> I'm<00:05:06.430> just<00:05:06.580> like<00:05:06.610> how<00:05:07.180> does

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
then I read that I'm just like how does

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.300 
then I read that I'm just like how does
that<00:05:07.750> work<00:05:07.990> because<00:05:08.680> I<00:05:08.830> think<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.040> chapter

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
that work because I think the chapter

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.770 
that work because I think the chapter
like<00:05:09.430> this<00:05:09.580> series<00:05:09.790> will<00:05:09.910> be<00:05:09.970> 50<00:05:10.300> chapters<00:05:10.690> at

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
like this series will be 50 chapters at

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.140 
like this series will be 50 chapters at
this<00:05:10.900> point<00:05:11.140> I'm<00:05:11.290> like<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:11.980> progressed<00:05:12.940> rather

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
this point I'm like it progressed rather

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.090 
this point I'm like it progressed rather
quickly<00:05:13.480> or<00:05:13.780> rather<00:05:14.290> not<00:05:14.560> it<00:05:14.710> progressed

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
quickly or rather not it progressed

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.370 
quickly or rather not it progressed
rather<00:05:15.280> naturally<00:05:15.970> I<00:05:16.120> mean<00:05:16.570> honestly<00:05:16.930> if<00:05:17.200> the

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
rather naturally I mean honestly if the

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.070 
rather naturally I mean honestly if the
whole<00:05:17.560> plot<00:05:17.830> revolved<00:05:18.400> around<00:05:18.490> that<00:05:18.760> one

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
whole plot revolved around that one

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.360 
whole plot revolved around that one
situation<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.229> the<00:05:20.380> plot<00:05:20.860> was<00:05:21.040> still<00:05:21.220> going

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
situation and the plot was still going

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.090 
situation and the plot was still going
on<00:05:21.520> like<00:05:21.669> 140<00:05:22.150> chapters<00:05:22.630> later

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
on like 140 chapters later

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.830 
on like 140 chapters later
Wow<00:05:23.250> he<00:05:23.490> still<00:05:23.820> hasn't<00:05:24.180> gotten<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.540> date<00:05:24.720> with

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840

this<00:05:24.930> girl<00:05:25.080> 140<00:05:26.070> chapters<00:05:26.430> later<00:05:26.580> I'm<00:05:26.880> saying

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
this girl 140 chapters later I'm saying

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.900 
this girl 140 chapters later I'm saying
as<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.390> series<00:05:27.720> progresses<00:05:28.350> naturally<00:05:28.980> but

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
as the series progresses naturally but

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.580 
as the series progresses naturally but
anyway<00:05:30.210> as<00:05:30.420> I<00:05:30.720> was<00:05:30.750> saying<00:05:30.900> he<00:05:31.170> actually<00:05:31.440> gets

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
anyway as I was saying he actually gets

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.780 
anyway as I was saying he actually gets
a<00:05:31.650> day<00:05:31.770> with<00:05:31.950> her<00:05:32.070> but<00:05:32.250> through<00:05:32.370> a<00:05:32.430> series<00:05:32.730> of

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
a day with her but through a series of

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.270 
a day with her but through a series of
events<00:05:32.990> he<00:05:33.990> ends<00:05:34.200> up<00:05:34.260> actually<00:05:34.500> not<00:05:34.920> going<00:05:35.190> on

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
events he ends up actually not going on

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.830 
events he ends up actually not going on
the<00:05:35.370> date<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:35.610> looks<00:05:36.180> like<00:05:36.360> show's<00:05:36.570> going<00:05:36.750> to

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
the date and looks like show's going to

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.690 
the date and looks like show's going to
be<00:05:36.900> dating<00:05:37.140> somebody<00:05:37.470> else<00:05:37.620> instead<00:05:37.950> after<00:05:38.670> a

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
little bit of a depression

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.910 
little bit of a depression
Seiji<00:05:39.990> discovers<00:05:40.440> that<00:05:40.530> he<00:05:40.650> actually

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
Seiji discovers that he actually

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.430 
Seiji discovers that he actually
develops<00:05:41.250> feelings<00:05:41.400> for<00:05:41.610> Yuki<00:05:42.090> and<00:05:42.440> continued

develops feelings for Yuki and continued
and<00:05:43.650> pursues<00:05:44.250> that<00:05:44.460> goal<00:05:44.730> instead<00:05:45.000> which

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
and pursues that goal instead which

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.870 
and pursues that goal instead which
again<00:05:45.930> makes<00:05:46.200> sense<00:05:46.560> I<00:05:46.800> mean<00:05:46.830> this<00:05:47.370> girl<00:05:47.640> that

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
likely going to fall back on maybe the

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.790 
likely going to fall back on maybe the
girl<00:05:54.060> that<00:05:54.210> you<00:05:54.330> become<00:05:54.660> a<00:05:54.930> close<00:05:55.350> friend<00:05:55.710> with

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 
over the past few chapters and

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.820 
over the past few chapters and
discovered<00:05:57.840> that<00:05:57.960> you<00:05:58.140> know<00:05:58.170> she's<00:05:58.500> trying<00:05:58.740> to

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
before maybe that would make sense so

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.720 
before maybe that would make sense so
yeah<00:06:03.960> that's<00:06:04.140> the<00:06:04.230> basic<00:06:04.560> plot<00:06:04.890> in<00:06:05.160> a<00:06:05.340> you<00:06:05.640> know

thing like if you went to high school to
a<00:06:15.660> lesser<00:06:16.050> extent<00:06:16.080> because<00:06:16.680> some<00:06:16.890> of<00:06:16.920> these

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
a lesser extent because some of these
