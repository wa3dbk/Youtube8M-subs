00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.439
 the home 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.610
 from one side to the other of the people 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.460
 I came here for you and I 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.329
 It's time to draw 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:11.030
 Let's play together for this. 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.870
 cardboard 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.849
 and pen 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.119
 shame shame shame commented 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.520
 I want to come here. 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.460
 first let's make a circle what if it did not circulate 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.470
 a glove a star a joke 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.679
 not 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:28.890
 let's do it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.169
 a ride 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.999
 one more trip another twist in another round that separates sisu 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.240
 will a person 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.290
 can be a person 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.640
 maple 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.300
 the idea said 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.000
 was a person or not 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.040
 can be a person 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.580
 jumping rope 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.850
 but does a person jump rope 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.110
 Can a child cut me I do not know 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.240
 who knows this child 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.190
 do not be a child let's see what took the archaeologists think I was 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.580
 seriously the case follows the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.990
 to take another turn to the right of the other turn seems to want to take a 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.740
 right turn left 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.159
 Then I make one more turn that I lowered, I took one more turn 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.550
 another back here 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.840
 a whale's turn that the work in which a pane I worked said 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.210
 however that although the ball touched the ball silly ball 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.380
 we have a team work in another polemic below 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.490
 and I'd say it's a broadsword never there then another story here another 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.210
 time here again that what they want me to be here for another 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.060
 since here 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.259
 there are images of bells here another one that I bring here 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.500
 and again not here 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.550
 another one that matters here another here 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.500
 and another giggle here 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.690
 other than 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.690
 and one more star 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.540
 And what is this here? 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.820
 It's the dog biting an ice cream. 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.939
 give up 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:08.509
 we came back
