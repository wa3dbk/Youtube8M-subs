in information than with my eyes when I

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.339 
in information than with my eyes when I
draw<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.060> use<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> type<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.539> paint<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.050> leaves<00:00:31.230> a

very hands-on approach to painting that
I<00:00:35.520> feel<00:00:35.790> creates<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.300> much<00:00:36.480> stronger<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.140> more

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
to do when I do begin drawing what I'm

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.620 
to do when I do begin drawing what I'm
doing<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.220> creating<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.729> map<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.240> way<00:01:45.479> of

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
doing is creating a map a way of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.230 
doing is creating a map a way of
orienting<00:01:46.170> myself<00:01:46.200> later<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:47.790> when<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> begin

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
orienting myself later for when I begin

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.359 
orienting myself later for when I begin
to<00:01:48.299> paint<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.869> will<00:01:49.350> draw<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.680> areas<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
to paint I will draw in areas that I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.800 
to paint I will draw in areas that I
want<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:51.689> lightness<00:01:52.229> darkness<00:01:52.950> shadow

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
want to have lightness darkness shadow

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.209

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
areas where I want to blend just

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
quality oil paints I use oils because

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.140 
quality oil paints I use oils because
each<00:02:06.160> hue<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.610> made<00:02:06.790> from<00:02:06.970> different

different to the touch titanium white is

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.290 
different to the touch titanium white is

while ivory black is more runny like oil
also<00:02:16.930> there<00:02:17.860> are<00:02:17.950> many<00:02:18.100> different<00:02:18.490> mediums

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
also there are many different mediums

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.220 
also there are many different mediums
that<00:02:19.000> can<00:02:19.150> be<00:02:19.210> added<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.510> oil<00:02:19.810> paint<00:02:20.020> to

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
that can be added to oil paint to

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.600 
that can be added to oil paint to
further<00:02:20.470> enhance<00:02:20.710> these<00:02:21.070> textural

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
further enhance these textural

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.120 
further enhance these textural
differences<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:23.140> allows<00:02:23.440> me<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.710> tell<00:02:23.890> color

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
differences this allows me to tell color

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.550 
differences this allows me to tell color
by<00:02:24.340> touching<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.850> paint<00:02:25.090> if<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.960> want<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.230> mix<00:02:26.380> a

gray that is halfway between white and

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.300 
gray that is halfway between white and
black<00:02:28.240> then<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.200> mix<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.590> where<00:02:29.740> it<00:02:29.800> is<00:02:29.890> half<00:02:30.160> as

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
black then I mix it where it is half as

black then I mix it where it is half as
thick<00:02:30.550> as<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.850> white<00:02:31.030> paint<00:02:31.330> or<00:02:31.780> twice<00:02:32.080> as

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
generally while I'm painting I will feel

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.670 
generally while I'm painting I will feel
along<00:02:42.550> with<00:02:42.760> one<00:02:42.940> hand<00:02:43.210> while<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.200> hold<00:02:44.590> the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.390 
painting through many different layers
and<00:02:51.520> stages<00:02:52.500> since<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.680> have<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:53.980> fill<00:02:54.220> the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
painting to see it I will often have to

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.590 
painting to see it I will often have to
let<00:02:56.740> an<00:02:56.860> area<00:02:57.070> dry<00:02:57.370> before<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.850> can<00:02:58.030> go<00:02:58.180> back<00:02:58.390> and

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
let an area dry before I can go back and

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.280 
let an area dry before I can go back and
touch<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.170> see<00:02:59.650> how<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.860> painting<00:03:00.280> win

that I make of the people I paint are

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.190 
that I make of the people I paint are
structurally<00:03:33.489> true<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.879> form<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:34.959> feel

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
structurally true to form and I feel

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.420 
structurally true to form and I feel
that<00:03:35.349> the<00:03:35.470> colors<00:03:35.799> that<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:36.010> feel<00:03:36.250> these

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
that the colors that I feel these

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:46.160 
that the colors that I feel these
structures<00:03:36.849> with<00:03:37.060> should<00:03:37.420> be<00:03:37.480> just<00:03:37.750> as<00:03:37.959> clear

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.580

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
Braille in this painting reads give

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.800 
Braille in this painting reads give
light<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.670> darkness<00:03:57.000> shall<00:03:57.209> go<00:03:57.390> away<00:03:57.510> of

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
light and the darkness shall go away of

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.910 
light and the darkness shall go away of
itself<00:04:00.800> whenever<00:04:01.800> I<00:04:02.010> hear<00:04:02.340> music<00:04:02.580> I<00:04:03.000> see<00:04:03.360> color

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
itself whenever I hear music I see color

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.620
