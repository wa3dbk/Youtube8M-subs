00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
side of choice right there kind of just

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.869 
side of choice right there kind of just
comb<00:00:53.070> finger<00:00:53.850> comb<00:00:54.059> my<00:00:54.239> hair<00:00:54.270> back<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.760> that

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it's all just fine normally and

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.029 
it's all just fine normally and
naturally<00:01:00.440> let's<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:01.920> this

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
naturally let's see if I can do this

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.850 
naturally let's see if I can do this
without<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.370> mirror<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.820> think<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.180> probably<00:01:03.420> can

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
without a mirror I think I probably can

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.330 
without a mirror I think I probably can
okay<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> we're<00:01:06.270> gonna<00:01:06.360> start<00:01:07.010> here<00:01:08.010> at<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
okay so we're gonna start here at the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.550 
okay so we're gonna start here at the
corner<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.420> side<00:01:09.659> part<00:01:09.990> with<00:01:10.229> chukka

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
corner of this side part with chukka

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.870 
corner of this side part with chukka
hair<00:01:10.970> we'll<00:01:11.970> split<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.420> into<00:01:12.630> two<00:01:13.049> pieces<00:01:13.880> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
hair we'll split it into two pieces the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.700 
hair we'll split it into two pieces the
trick<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.420> twist<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.110> it's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
trick with this twist is that it's

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950 
trick with this twist is that it's
basically<00:01:17.460> like<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.790> French<00:01:18.180> braid<00:01:18.420> except

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
basically like a French braid except

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.990 
basically like a French braid except
that<00:01:19.259> you're<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:19.830> twisting<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.460> instead<00:01:20.880> of

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that you're just twisting it instead of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.670 
that you're just twisting it instead of
braiding<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.540> you're<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> divide<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
braiding it so you're going to divide it

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.310 
braiding it so you're going to divide it
into<00:01:22.770> two<00:01:22.979> pieces<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.210> then<00:01:25.049> we're

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
into two pieces like this and then we're

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.730 
into two pieces like this and then we're
gonna<00:01:25.409> add<00:01:25.710> some<00:01:26.990> hair<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:29.220> bottom<00:01:29.610> piece

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
gonna add some hair to the bottom piece

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.760 
gonna add some hair to the bottom piece
and<00:01:31.740> twist<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.820> upwards<00:01:36.500> then<00:01:37.500> we're<00:01:37.650> gonna

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and twist it upwards then we're gonna

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.929 
and twist it upwards then we're gonna
add<00:01:38.009> some<00:01:38.040> hair<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:39.110> bottom<00:01:40.110> piece<00:01:40.380> and

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
add some hair to this bottom piece and

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.749 
add some hair to this bottom piece and
twist<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.150> upwards<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:44.009> we'll<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.369> keep

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
twist it upwards so we'll just keep

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.450 
twist it upwards so we'll just keep
adding<00:01:45.090> hair<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.810> bottom<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.770> twisting

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
adding hair to the bottom and twisting

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.780 
adding hair to the bottom and twisting
in<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.180> same<00:01:51.390> direction<00:01:52.159> all<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.220> way<00:01:53.430> around

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
in the same direction all the way around

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.260 
in the same direction all the way around
the<00:01:53.939> head<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:56.899> try<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> go<00:01:58.340> slowly<00:01:59.340> with<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.909> so

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the head I try to go slowly with this so

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.940 
the head I try to go slowly with this so
that<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.130> see<00:02:02.340> what<00:02:02.460> I'm<00:02:02.579> doing

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
that you can really see what I'm doing

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.699 
that you can really see what I'm doing
so<00:02:04.950> I'm<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.579> adding<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.439> chunk<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.560> hair

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.660 

and<00:02:11.340> twisting<00:02:11.909> it<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:13.099> I'm<00:02:14.099> working<00:02:14.459> my<00:02:14.640> way

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
and twisting it in I'm working my way

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.559 
and twisting it in I'm working my way
around<00:02:15.260> my<00:02:16.260> head<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:18.439> this<00:02:19.439> part<00:02:20.120> just<00:02:21.120> getting

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
around my head so this part just getting

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.670 
around my head so this part just getting
getting<00:02:22.909> guiding<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.060> twist<00:02:24.360> around<00:02:24.599> takes<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
getting guiding the twist around takes a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.520 
getting guiding the twist around takes a
little<00:02:25.980> bit<00:02:26.099> of<00:02:26.189> practice<00:02:26.700> but<00:02:27.200> it's<00:02:28.200> pretty

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
little bit of practice but it's pretty

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.089 
little bit of practice but it's pretty
easy<00:02:28.739> once<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.220> get<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.609> you<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.180> kind<00:02:30.659> of

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
easy once you get it you just kind of

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.920 
easy once you get it you just kind of
you<00:02:32.099> move<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.700> twist<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.239> direction<00:02:33.810> that

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
you move the twist in the direction that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.220 
you move the twist in the direction that
you<00:02:34.079> want<00:02:34.109> it<00:02:34.379> to<00:02:34.530> go<00:02:35.569> so<00:02:36.569> what's<00:02:36.780> happening

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
you want it to go so what's happening

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:52.809 
you want it to go so what's happening

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.890 

don't<00:02:53.629> see<00:02:53.780> me<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:57.590> once<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:57.890> get<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.159> the<00:02:58.280> back
