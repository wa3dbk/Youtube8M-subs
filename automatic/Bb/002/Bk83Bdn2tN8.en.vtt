00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
is that boat and trailer in the back and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.380 
is that boat and trailer in the back and
what<00:00:36.840> I'd<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> see<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.940> go

what I'd like to see this do is to go

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.170 
what I'd like to see this do is to go
through<00:00:39.420> an<00:00:39.960> obstacle<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.829> water<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.550> ice<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
through an obstacle of water and ice and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.889 
through an obstacle of water and ice and
mud<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.760> make<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.030> way<00:00:45.149> through<00:00:45.539> then

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
mud and make it all the way through then

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.260 
mud and make it all the way through then
attach<00:00:46.289> itself<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.250> boat<00:00:47.579> trailer<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
attach itself to this boat trailer and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.709 
attach itself to this boat trailer and
then<00:00:48.719> pull<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.500> through<00:00:50.190> where<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:51.329> just

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
then pull that through where it just

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.779 
then pull that through where it just
came<00:00:51.930> down<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.260> get<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.699> be

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
came down to get it so it's going to be

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.520 
came down to get it so it's going to be
a<00:00:53.820> challenge<00:00:54.300> because<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.690> boat<00:00:54.870> has<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> long

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
a challenge because the boat has a long

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010 
a challenge because the boat has a long
rudder<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.370> back<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.030> trailer<00:00:57.750> does

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
rudder on the back but that trailer does

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.779 
rudder on the back but that trailer does
give<00:00:58.289> me<00:00:58.320> about<00:00:58.739> an<00:00:58.890> inch<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> half<00:00:59.399> of

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
give me about an inch and a half of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.389 
give me about an inch and a half of
clearance<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> hopefully<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> power<00:01:02.190> of

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
clearance so hopefully with the power of

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.810 
clearance so hopefully with the power of
a<00:01:02.730> three<00:01:03.059> cell<00:01:03.300> lipo<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.049> all<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.250> motors<00:01:05.610> and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
a three cell lipo and all the motors and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.480 
a three cell lipo and all the motors and
whatnot<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.930> rx-8<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.890> should<00:01:08.250> have

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
whatnot and the rx-8 it should have

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.580 
whatnot and the rx-8 it should have
enough<00:01:08.729> power<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.360> hope<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.810> least<00:01:10.140> it'll<00:01:10.350> throw

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
enough power I hope at least it'll throw

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.500 
enough power I hope at least it'll throw
a<00:01:10.680> lot<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.100> water<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.460> it'll<00:01:11.670> look<00:01:11.790> fun<00:01:12.060> let's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
a lot of water and it'll look fun let's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:45.480 
a lot of water and it'll look fun let's
do<00:01:12.689> it
