and<00:01:45.710> I<00:01:46.710> got<00:01:46.860> shot<00:01:47.070> out<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.460> shot<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.909> but<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.149> got<00:01:48.360> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and I got shot out a shot at but I got I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.120 
and I got shot out a shot at but I got I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
thought I got shot at the beginning like

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.770 
thought I got shot at the beginning like
in<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.340> middle<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.790> actually<00:01:51.270> got<00:01:51.540> shot<00:01:51.750> right

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
in the middle I actually got shot right

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.539 
in the middle I actually got shot right
there<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.200> laid<00:01:52.320> down<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.649> died<00:01:52.829> i<00:01:52.860> do<00:01:53.130> died

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
there and I laid down and died i do died

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.429 
there and I laid down and died i do died
a<00:01:53.579> few<00:01:53.790> times<00:01:53.850> i<00:01:54.210> think<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.540> nine<00:01:54.750> times<00:01:55.079> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
a few times i think like nine times and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.219 
a few times i think like nine times and
that's<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.460> too<00:01:56.700> good<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.020> too<00:01:58.200> bad

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
that's not too good but it's not too bad

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.620 
that's not too good but it's not too bad
i<00:01:58.409> guess<00:01:58.619> um<00:01:59.130> because<00:02:00.000> i<00:02:00.149> am<00:02:00.270> using<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
i guess um because i am using a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.840 
i guess um because i am using a
submachine<00:02:01.020> gun<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> big<00:02:01.710> map<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.250> some<00:02:02.729> of

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
submachine gun on a big map and some of

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.149 
submachine gun on a big map and some of
my<00:02:02.969> desk<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.360> i<00:02:03.450> could<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.780> avoid<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.100> I

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
my desk so i could not avoid that one I

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.620 
my desk so i could not avoid that one I
could<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.460> avoided<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:06.000> should<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.329> ran<00:02:06.479> at

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
could have avoided I should have ran at

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.779 
could have avoided I should have ran at
him<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.409> thought<00:02:07.950> I'd<00:02:08.190> be<00:02:08.429> able<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.610> switch

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
him but I thought I'd be able to switch

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.650 
him but I thought I'd be able to switch
my<00:02:08.910> gun<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.390> time<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.599> did<00:02:10.379> not<00:02:11.090> but<00:02:12.090> some<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.569> my

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
my gun in time I did not but some of my

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.880 
my gun in time I did not but some of my
desk<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.050> do<00:02:13.110> get<00:02:13.379> like

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
screwdriver by getting spawned in the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.910 
screwdriver by getting spawned in the
wrong<00:02:15.630> spot<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.110> all<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.290> stuff<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.770> I

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.160

hate<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.280> Swans<00:02:17.520> on<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:18.690> guess<00:02:19.020> they're

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
hate the Swans on this I guess they're

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.840

not<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.560> bad<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:20.010> they<00:02:20.310> could<00:02:20.520> be<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.670> lot

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
not that bad but they could be a lot

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.820 
not that bad but they could be a lot
better<00:02:21.030> as<00:02:21.569> you'll<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:21.810> later<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.380> spawns<00:02:22.650> me

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
better as you'll see later it spawns me

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.590

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
was killed by someone else I figured I'd

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.790

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
run back over here and get away from the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.500 
run back over here and get away from the
area<00:04:43.979> cuz<00:04:44.280> they're<00:04:44.400> gonna<00:04:44.520> come<00:04:44.789> after<00:04:44.820> me<00:04:45.270> and

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.230 
I don't like using the predator on
free-for-all<00:04:47.520> because<00:04:47.789> it<00:04:47.940> takes<00:04:48.090> that

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
free-for-all because it takes that

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.690 
free-for-all because it takes that
second<00:04:48.659> that<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:48.810> had<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:49.020> lay<00:04:49.140> down<00:04:49.169> and<00:04:49.560> not<00:04:49.740> do

make it harder for me to hear because

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.899 
make it harder for me to hear because
the<00:05:07.020> show<00:05:07.169> much<00:05:07.320> noise<00:05:07.560> and<00:05:07.979> so<00:05:08.310> you<00:05:08.370> guys<00:05:08.640> have

a double kill but i only got a single

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.210 
a double kill but i only got a single
because<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.419> guy<00:05:15.510> killed<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.900> other<00:05:16.020> guy<00:05:16.220> or

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
because the guy killed the other guy or

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.800 
because the guy killed the other guy or
my<00:05:17.550> hair<00:05:17.760> you're<00:05:17.909> killing<00:05:18.150> i'm<00:05:18.240> actually<00:05:18.390> and

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
my hair you're killing i'm actually and

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.230 
my hair you're killing i'm actually and
I<00:05:19.380> do<00:05:19.710> get<00:05:19.979> killed<00:05:20.250> by<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.430> predator<00:05:20.880> missile

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
I do get killed by the predator missile

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.300 
I do get killed by the predator missile
which<00:05:21.390> I<00:05:21.510> probably<00:05:21.750> couldn't<00:05:22.080> avoid<00:05:22.289> maybe<00:05:23.159> if

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
which I probably couldn't avoid maybe if

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.610 
which I probably couldn't avoid maybe if
I've<00:05:23.430> cold-blooded<00:05:24.000> on<00:05:24.090> but<00:05:24.360> um<00:05:24.510> I'm<00:05:24.840> Russian

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
I've cold-blooded on but um I'm Russian

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.290 
I've cold-blooded on but um I'm Russian
so<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:25.830> use<00:05:26.010> lightweight<00:05:26.250> so<00:05:26.669> I<00:05:26.760> can<00:05:26.940> shoot

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
so I use lightweight so I can shoot

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.480 
so I use lightweight so I can shoot
faster<00:05:27.690> and<00:05:27.900> again<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.680> guns<00:05:28.860> not<00:05:29.010> that<00:05:29.310> good

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
faster and again the guns not that good

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.550 
faster and again the guns not that good
for<00:05:29.700> a<00:05:29.729> faraway<00:05:30.210> so<00:05:30.630> I<00:05:30.659> try<00:05:31.020> not<00:05:31.169> to<00:05:31.320> shoot<00:05:31.470> a

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
for a faraway so I try not to shoot a

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.589 
for a faraway so I try not to shoot a
far<00:05:31.740> away<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:32.010> give<00:05:32.130> yourself<00:05:32.190> away<00:05:32.520> and<00:05:32.820> I

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
far away and give yourself away and I

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:34.790 
far away and give yourself away and I
don't<00:05:33.840> have<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.050> silencer<00:05:34.500> on<00:05:34.560> it<00:05:34.620> yet

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
don't have the silencer on it yet

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.700 
don't have the silencer on it yet
because<00:05:34.890> i<00:05:35.070> just<00:05:35.099> got<00:05:35.669> it<00:05:36.140> this<00:05:37.140> first<00:05:37.380> time<00:05:37.680> i

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
because i just got it this first time i

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.140 
because i just got it this first time i

that I saw up like the second but right
here<00:05:57.570> to<00:05:57.720> spawn<00:05:57.990> me<00:05:58.169> out<00:05:58.380> in<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:58.620> open<00:05:58.740> and<00:05:59.099> I

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
here to spawn me out in the open and I

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.550 
here to spawn me out in the open and I
ran<00:05:59.789> forward<00:06:00.270> just<00:06:00.450> because<00:06:00.930> I<00:06:00.960> had<00:06:01.289> a<00:06:01.320> habit

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
ran forward just because I had a habit

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.200 
ran forward just because I had a habit
when<00:06:01.860> I<00:06:01.890> spawn<00:06:02.220> and<00:06:02.430> I<00:06:02.460> got<00:06:02.610> shot<00:06:02.849> right<00:06:02.880> away

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
when I spawn and I got shot right away

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.270 
when I spawn and I got shot right away
and<00:06:03.390> then<00:06:03.450> I<00:06:03.539> died<00:06:03.810> so<00:06:04.140> there's<00:06:04.830> no<00:06:04.979> way<00:06:05.250> i

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
and then I died so there's no way i

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.339 
and then I died so there's no way i
could<00:06:05.580> probably<00:06:05.760> avoid<00:06:06.390> that<00:06:06.599> death<00:06:06.870> you

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
could probably avoid that death you

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:08.600 
could probably avoid that death you
might<00:06:07.530> say<00:06:07.680> I<00:06:07.740> could<00:06:07.979> have<00:06:08.130> but<00:06:08.310> I<00:06:08.370> don't<00:06:08.520> think

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
might say I could have but I don't think

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.460 
might say I could have but I don't think
it's<00:06:08.760> enough<00:06:08.880> and<00:06:09.240> as<00:06:09.810> you<00:06:10.050> can<00:06:10.169> see<00:06:10.200> even

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
it's enough and as you can see even

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.810 
it's enough and as you can see even
without<00:06:10.740> stopping<00:06:11.220> power<00:06:11.340> of<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.550> gun<00:06:11.700> is

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
without stopping power of the gun is

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.240 
without stopping power of the gun is
very<00:06:12.030> strong<00:06:12.300> I<00:06:12.539> need<00:06:13.320> two<00:06:13.500> more<00:06:13.680> kills<00:06:13.950> and
