00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.870
 lady what you are seeing on screen is 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:08.149
 they call spiders is an exercise based on 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.950
 the kind of animal or motion the chip is 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.750
 imitate animals and their 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.999
 natural movements so that we have 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.780
 better physical condition without needing 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:19.150
 appliances 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.150
 check animate motion wife anita 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.840
 the purpose is precisely to correct 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.230
 positions and strengthen muscles and 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.730
 activate them intelligently have 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.770
 to be aware that they do not need 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.750
 a gym and equipment to exercise your 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.000
 body is with the same weight of our 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.330
 muscles and it's like a dose of memory 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.519
 of how we moved before that's what 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.670
 can perform in any space 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.980
 one square meter 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.230
 we created my brother and I a class that 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.609
 call animals motion where you combine what 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.769
 what is natural gymnastics that what 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.360
 we just tried gymnastics 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.220
 animal simulate animal movements 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.799
 more not the foundations here comes a 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.690
 movement called frog gets the 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.460
 head between the arms inhales and with a 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.270
 jump forward bring your feet to 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.270
 side of your hands 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.950
 accurate now with three back jumps 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.300
 of frog supporting first the tip of the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.840
 edge with the sole and we will 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.580
 return our point of origin leaves 1 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.590
 2 lowering the buttocks 3 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.780
 I go back forward I go back to inhale 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.620
 generates momentum exhaled and I go to the front 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.660
 three jumps back 1-2-3 repeat it 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.660
 we're only going to make it 5 points 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.820
 from here comes the macaque come out now 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.179
 in the long arms it remains long only the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.670
 right flexes the left leg 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:03.420
 rotates the upper body accommodates the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.149
 hands rise to flex generates momentum 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.459
 in broken the left side 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.619
 there is simulate their movements when 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.780
 they are looking for food x we have 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.250
 at four points crawl back and 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.250
 climb on the wall there goes 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.330
 that is the macaque 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.930
 this exercise is called lady lizard 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.850
 try to exist be longer 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.010
 stuck to the ground 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.420
 that's like vidal and pretend that 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.160
 we walk like lizards we are going to 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.800
 try to make five of these 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.750
 perform 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.270
 I'm going to work with my right leg and 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.370
 left arm then I raise hand 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.080
 right leg and I'm going to flip 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.230
 to always see the knee that remains 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.980
 front 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.200
 I repeat, we can keep it up and 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.140
 If you are looking for a bigger challenge you can download and 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.620
 flex the arms release the air

 swing halo 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.430
 with the creator of animals motion of that 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.130
 it's about you exercising yourself 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.350
