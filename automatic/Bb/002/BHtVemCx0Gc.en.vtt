I<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.970> these<00:01:48.149> filters<00:01:48.570> because<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:49.200> are

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
I like these filters because they are

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.340 
I like these filters because they are
green<00:01:49.680> meaning<00:01:50.490> there's<00:01:51.210> no<00:01:51.299> plastic<00:01:52.229> to

dispose of ever even with filter changes

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.200 
dispose of ever even with filter changes
because<00:01:55.680> they<00:01:55.799> do<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:56.070> encase<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.850> filters

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
