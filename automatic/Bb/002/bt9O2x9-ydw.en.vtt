00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.609
 al urinary calculus is that this theme is 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.160
 quite widespread among us humans but 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.670
 Did you know that he can also undertake 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.440
 our feet is if you did not know 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.960
 you will now know with the information 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.640
 from adauto minatti veterinarian everything 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.840
 to win all good that again 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.300
 you're welcome 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.039
 Thank you for the invitation but once nothing. 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.189
 Tell us the way that disease 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.880
 comedy our good parts calculus if 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.369
 develops near us through 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.989
 racial genetic predisposition is not in 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.030
 a pre established in question 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.129
 certain race but there are some streets 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.290
 which are more pre-arranged buildings to have 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.329
 urinary stones also mainly 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.930
 feline felines have a high incidence 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.100
 urinary calculus now causes goes 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.969
 from diets 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.270
 this is urinary infections 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.550
 lll feed off your ration 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.800
 although the animal that feeds 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.410
 feed only can also develop 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.769
 urinary calculus and urine retention 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.770
 also causes the animal to have predisposition 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.810
 to animal urinary calculi that only 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.090
 I will not read it when they go for a walk 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.220
 so if you stay a long time retaining urine 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.700
 to expire the ride this can 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.280
 develop urinary calculi also 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.720
 It is us humans that question is 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.540
 very related to salt intake 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.850
 and you commented the question of the animal is 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.310
 feeding only with feed and also 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.979
 develop that is is it is 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.780
 predispositions is is it even food 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.240
 that sometimes the animal is eating 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.829
 certain feed but he has already where 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.710
 people enter racial predisposition 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.360
 then that balancing of the ration may 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.549
 also generate this so do not 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.159
 necessarily an animal that eats only 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.899
 as action and then do not go have yourself 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.939
 animal that only eats it can 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.700
 develop the calculations by 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.229
 urinary retention and some 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.399
 urine infections that can still 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.930
 unnoticed 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.850
 the question of age may be 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.040
 related to this phenomenon is the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.119
 lower calculation it can give from 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.690
 One year and over one year is six years and 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.760
 animals in this age group as well 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.580
 not animals many puppies normally 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.800
 is 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.140
 most rare from one year up to 6 years 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.540
 have a higher incidence than the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.760
 How can we diagnose the disease? 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.400
 good when on the agenda in clinical examination 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.340
 people stage the bladder if I have it full 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.920
 and the calculation was great is sometimes the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.360
 people in the population noticed the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.460
 presence of a calculation 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.050
 depending on size but more 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.930
 It is important to make the 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.080
 through urinalysis 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.540
 garlic x and ultrasound we will have one 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.360
 exact notion of the calculations you have 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.820
 of the size of the calculation and the treatment is 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.709
 basis of stone extraction is also 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.930
 depending on the size of the calculation 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.750
 occurs is the animal will not achieve this 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.430
 it many times in a year per person 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.620
 can also lose depending on the 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.050
 animals no longer because the 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.110
 which can cause a 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.000
 obstruction of the urethra and the very 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.160
 can not take most of the 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.880
 cases depending on the type of calculation 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.040
 also most surgical nails well 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.040
 are of fundamental importance. 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.110
 in the workout of a dog cut 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.340
 diagonally to the nail only a few 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.410
 few millimeters 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.760
 in case of doubt ask your veterinarian 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.760
 to do it for you
