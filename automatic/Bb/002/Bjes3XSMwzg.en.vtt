00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.949 
in and clean up and I feel that
initiation<00:01:51.799> is<00:01:52.219> a<00:01:52.429> role<00:01:52.759> that<00:01:52.789> is<00:01:53.329> not<00:01:53.509> valued

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
initiation is a role that is not valued

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.479 
initiation is a role that is not valued
as<00:01:54.170> highly<00:01:54.560> as<00:01:54.709> it<00:01:54.979> should<00:01:55.159> be<00:01:55.280> perhaps

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:55.489 
as highly as it should be perhaps

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:58.270 
as highly as it should be perhaps
because<00:01:56.349> people<00:01:57.349> don't<00:01:57.469> understand<00:01:57.950> just<00:01:58.219> how

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
because people don't understand just how

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.880 
because people don't understand just how
much<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:59.840> have<00:01:59.959> to<00:01:59.989> take<00:02:00.229> into<00:02:00.349> account<00:02:00.619> when

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
much you have to take into account when

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.380 
much you have to take into account when
you're<00:02:01.099> the<00:02:01.250> initiator<00:02:01.640> for<00:02:01.849> your<00:02:01.939> team<00:02:02.149> and

you're the initiator for your team and

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.109 
you're the initiator for your team and

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
thing that's actually really nice for us

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.090 
thing that's actually really nice for us
is<00:03:45.600> we're<00:03:45.750> starting<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.290> really<00:03:46.500> kind<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.770> put

is we're starting to really kind of put

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.370 
is we're starting to really kind of put
together<00:03:47.280> or<00:03:47.760> coalesce<00:03:48.360> are<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> central<00:03:49.350> theme

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
together or coalesce are a central theme

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.600 
together or coalesce are a central theme
which<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.610> crystals<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:52.610> backstory

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
which is the crystals and the backstory

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.640 
which is the crystals and the backstory
behind<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.480> tournament<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.170> why<00:03:55.380> all<00:03:55.560> these

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
behind the tournament and why all these

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.680 
behind the tournament and why all these
characters<00:03:56.100> are<00:03:56.220> here<00:03:56.459> fighting<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.090> think<00:03:57.540> the

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
characters are here fighting I think the

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.270 
characters are here fighting I think the
new<00:03:57.810> logo<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.380> course<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.770> has<00:03:58.890> crystals

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
new logo of course it has crystals

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.770 
new logo of course it has crystals
everywhere<00:03:59.430> we<00:03:59.820> have<00:03:59.940> these<00:04:00.030> new<00:04:00.239> creeps<00:04:00.570> we

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
everywhere we have these new creeps we

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.570 
everywhere we have these new creeps we
actually<00:04:01.080> have<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.230> story<00:04:01.560> behind<00:04:01.769> them<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:02.310> I

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
actually have a story behind them so I

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.340 
actually have a story behind them so I
think<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.090> guys<00:04:03.269> start<00:04:03.630> seeing<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.080> lot<00:04:04.320> more
