is great you know obviously one of the
major<00:00:28.470> reasons<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:29.070> doing<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.340> particular

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
major reasons to doing this particular

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.600 
major reasons to doing this particular
demo<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> Somali<00:00:30.750> player<00:00:31.050> demo<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.399> a

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
demo is a Somali player demo so it's a

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.790 
demo is a Somali player demo so it's a
small<00:00:33.300> part<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.690> big<00:00:33.870> final<00:00:34.260> game<00:00:34.559> which

small part of the big final game which

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.860 
small part of the big final game which
will<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> single<00:00:35.370> player<00:00:35.550> mode<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.390> big

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
will have a single player mode and a big

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.080 
will have a single player mode and a big
multiplayer<00:00:37.380> part<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.640> know<00:00:38.670> it's

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
multiplayer part of it but you know it's

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.060 
multiplayer part of it but you know it's
for<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> developers<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> test<00:00:40.290> how

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
for the developers to test how

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.479 
for the developers to test how
multiplayer<00:00:41.670> works<00:00:42.500> how<00:00:43.500> large<00:00:44.010> numbers<00:00:44.460> of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
multiplayer works how large numbers of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.250 
multiplayer works how large numbers of
people<00:00:44.700> operate<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> multiplayer

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
people operate on a multiplayer

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.770 
people operate on a multiplayer
environment<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.399> through<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> Xbox<00:00:48.570> Live

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
environment and through the Xbox Live

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.229 
environment and through the Xbox Live
services<00:00:49.260> work<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.980> know<00:00:50.070> how<00:00:50.460> they

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
services work out you know how they

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.209 
services work out you know how they
balance<00:00:51.780> certain<00:00:52.170> things<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.680> balanced<00:00:53.039> game

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
balance certain things and balanced game

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.430 
balance certain things and balanced game
planes<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.940> other<00:00:54.059> things<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
planes and other things like that so it

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.840 
planes and other things like that so it
really<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.770> very<00:00:55.860> much<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> test<00:00:56.520> at<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.760> point

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
really is very much a test at this point

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.849 
really is very much a test at this point
it's<00:00:57.180> not<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.570> final<00:00:57.930> games<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.500> final

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it's not the final games on the final

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.189 
it's not the final games on the final
multiplayer<00:00:59.280> game<00:00:59.520> but<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.600> will<00:01:00.750> give<00:01:00.899> people

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
multiplayer game but it will give people

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.110 
multiplayer game but it will give people
a<00:01:01.260> good<00:01:01.410> idea<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.859> kind<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.520> expect<00:01:02.910> in

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
a good idea of kind of what to expect in

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.329 
a good idea of kind of what to expect in
terms<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.510> look<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.930> feel<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.350> gameplay<00:01:04.830> so

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
terms of look and feel and gameplay so

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.830 
terms of look and feel and gameplay so
why<00:01:05.670> did<00:01:05.909> why<00:01:06.119> was<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> decision<00:01:06.479> made<00:01:06.689> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
why did why was the decision made to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.420 
why did why was the decision made to
restrict<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.799> kind<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.220> people

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
restrict it just to kind of the people

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.770 
restrict it just to kind of the people
that<00:01:08.549> bought<00:01:08.640> crackdown<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.210> people<00:01:09.540> signed

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
that bought crackdown and people signed

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.359 
that bought crackdown and people signed
up<00:01:09.960> how<00:01:10.260> come<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.650> wasn't<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> completely<00:01:11.340> open

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
up how come it wasn't a completely open

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.249 
up how come it wasn't a completely open
reason<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:13.200> think<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.810> honest<00:01:15.960> I'd<00:01:16.020> only<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
reason I think to be honest I'd only the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.810 
reason I think to be honest I'd only the
exact<00:01:16.560> answer<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.340> think<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
exact answer that but I think one of the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.370 
exact answer that but I think one of the
one<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> major<00:01:18.540> reasons<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.259> new

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
one of the major reasons is you new

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.630 
one of the major reasons is you new
always<00:01:19.500> need<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> vehicle<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.310> be<00:01:20.400> able<00:01:20.460> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
always need a vehicle to be able to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.060 
always need a vehicle to be able to
deliver<00:01:20.850> these<00:01:21.030> kind<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.360> things<00:01:21.530> you<00:01:22.530> need

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
deliver these kind of things you need

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
deliver these kind of things you need
some<00:01:23.400> kind<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.000> access<00:01:24.420> code<00:01:24.659> some<00:01:24.960> kind<00:01:25.170> of

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
some kind of access code some kind of

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.270 
some kind of access code some kind of
key<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.750> crackdown<00:01:27.829> is<00:01:28.829> probably

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
key to get on it crackdown is probably

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.069 
key to get on it crackdown is probably
the<00:01:29.400> main<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:30.000> people<00:01:30.299> will<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.540> through<00:01:30.900> on

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the main way people will get through on

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.450 
the main way people will get through on
to<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> multiplayer<00:01:31.740> beta<00:01:31.890> there<00:01:32.130> were<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> few

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
to the multiplayer beta there were a few

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.090 
to the multiplayer beta there were a few
codes<00:01:32.729> given<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.210> as<00:01:33.420> prizes<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.860> various

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
codes given out as prizes and in various

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.740 
codes given out as prizes and in various
territories<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:35.759> crackdowns<00:01:36.360> clear<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
territories but crackdowns clear the

the opportunity to get on the beta I
think<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.030> open<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.360> too<00:01:54.720> much<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.320> you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
think if you open up too much then you

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.350 
think if you open up too much then you
have<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> risk<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.790> been<00:01:56.969> confusing

from the whole book beta test as i said
i<00:02:16.850> don't<00:02:16.970> know<00:02:17.120> much<00:02:17.270> about<00:02:17.300> their<00:02:17.630> plans<00:02:17.900> but

i don't know much about their plans but

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.360 
i don't know much about their plans but
they're<00:02:18.260> starting<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.650> be<00:02:18.740> monitoring<00:02:19.160> the

live service very very very closely so

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.390

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
it'll be they'll be checking out i guess

it'll be they'll be checking out i guess
as<00:02:25.760> much<00:02:25.970> not<00:02:26.390> just<00:02:26.870> physically<00:02:27.770> how<00:02:27.950> many
