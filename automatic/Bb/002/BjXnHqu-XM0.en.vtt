mansion<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.790> guess<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.719> really<00:00:09.990> shouldn't<00:00:10.230> call

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
mansion I guess I really shouldn't call

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.629 
mansion I guess I really shouldn't call
the<00:00:10.530> hair<00:00:10.650> by<00:00:10.800> mansion<00:00:11.099> because<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.340> didn't<00:00:11.519> use

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
the hair by mansion because I didn't use

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.480 
the hair by mansion because I didn't use
it<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.769> this<00:00:13.769> rate<00:00:13.980> i<00:00:14.009> probably<00:00:14.250> won't

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
it to and this rate i probably won't

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.609 
it to and this rate i probably won't
using<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> three<00:00:15.059> either<00:00:15.269> because<00:00:15.630> honestly

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
using the three either because honestly

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.320 
using the three either because honestly
I<00:00:16.710> don't<00:00:16.920> really<00:00:17.100> want<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.580> make<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> three<00:00:18.150> in

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330

I don't really want to make a three in
fact<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.560> first<00:00:19.710> question<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.189> if<00:00:20.490> you're

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
fact the first question is if you're

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.040 
fact the first question is if you're
going<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.029> do<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:21.420> running<00:00:21.630> three<00:00:21.810> if<00:00:21.900> I'm

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
going to do here running three if I'm

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.259 
going to do here running three if I'm
going<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.380> do<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.910> really<00:00:23.910> I'm<00:00:24.029> leaning

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
going to do it and really I'm leaning

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.630 
going to do it and really I'm leaning
towards<00:00:24.539> more<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.080> no<00:00:25.350> see<00:00:26.160> when<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.340> first

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
towards more to a no see when the first

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.370 
towards more to a no see when the first
hairbrained<00:00:27.060> came<00:00:27.269> out<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.449> actually<00:00:27.779> didn't

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
hairbrained came out I actually didn't

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.099 
hairbrained came out I actually didn't
really<00:00:28.680> want<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.160> make<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:30.060> series<00:00:30.779> or

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
really want to make it a series or

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.200 
really want to make it a series or
anything<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.890> that's<00:00:32.730> why<00:00:32.910> there<00:00:33.059> was<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
anything and that's why there was a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.610 
anything and that's why there was a
question<00:00:33.420> mark<00:00:33.899> at<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.050> end<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> be

her buy when I hadn't thought of a

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.469 
her buy when I hadn't thought of a
sequel<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.650> that's<00:01:16.650> why<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:18.000> mean<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.140> don't<00:01:19.860> know
