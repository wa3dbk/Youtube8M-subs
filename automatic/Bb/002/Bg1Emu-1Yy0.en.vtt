that bad actually I would say not much
less<00:02:24.820> roomy<00:02:25.150> than<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.420> coupe<00:02:25.570> of<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.320> e92

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.110 

great<00:02:35.890> think<00:02:36.070> about<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.310> sport<00:02:36.520> transmission

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
great think about the sport transmission

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.670 
great think about the sport transmission
now<00:02:37.270> with<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.570> steptronic<00:02:37.870> s'<00:02:38.170> with<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.350> ZF

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
now with the steptronic s' with the ZF

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.070 
now with the steptronic s' with the ZF
transmission<00:02:38.830> it's<00:02:39.760> just<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.390> much<00:02:40.540> better<00:02:40.750> so

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
transmission it's just so much better so

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.380 
transmission it's just so much better so
much<00:02:41.230> smoother<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:42.010> much<00:02:42.220> more<00:02:42.640> when<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.090> want

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
much smoother so much more when you want

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.880 
much smoother so much more when you want
it<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.600> shift<00:02:43.780> when<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.140> need<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.650> shift

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
it to shift when you need it to shift

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.090 
it to shift when you need it to shift
it's<00:02:45.640> not<00:02:45.910> always<00:02:46.450> about<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.110> know<00:02:47.500> but<00:02:48.010> the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
it's not always about you know but the

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.770 
it's not always about you know but the
old<00:02:48.190> transmission<00:02:48.520> there<00:02:48.850> isn't<00:02:49.090> quite<00:02:49.239> quite

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
old transmission there isn't quite quite

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.210 
old transmission there isn't quite quite
a<00:02:49.810> bit<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:50.020> hesitation<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.709> if<00:02:50.890> you've<00:02:51.040> driven

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
a bit of hesitation and if you've driven

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.570 
a bit of hesitation and if you've driven
the<00:02:51.400> e46<00:02:51.820> 3<00:02:52.780> Series<00:02:52.810> with<00:02:53.230> steptronic<00:02:53.590> just<00:02:54.520> a

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
the e46 3 Series with steptronic just a

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.220 
the e46 3 Series with steptronic just a
little<00:02:54.760> bit<00:02:54.850> too<00:02:54.940> much<00:02:55.030> hesitation<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.840> you

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
little bit too much hesitation this you

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.600 
little bit too much hesitation this you
just<00:02:56.410> downshift<00:02:56.890> then<00:02:57.070> you<00:02:57.190> got<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.430> right

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
just downshift then you got it right

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.580 
just downshift then you got it right
there

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590
