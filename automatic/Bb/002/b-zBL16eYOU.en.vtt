00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.990 

often<00:00:01.230> when<00:00:01.410> we<00:00:01.530> consider<00:00:01.920> x-rays<00:00:02.370> we<00:00:02.790> think

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
often when we consider x-rays we think

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.110 
often when we consider x-rays we think
of<00:00:03.060> broken<00:00:03.480> bones<00:00:03.720> or<00:00:04.020> teeth<00:00:04.640> this<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.790> because

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
of broken bones or teeth this is because

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.030 
of broken bones or teeth this is because
they<00:00:06.299> are<00:00:06.330> dense<00:00:06.660> tissues<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.440> show<00:00:07.620> up<00:00:07.770> well

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
they are dense tissues and show up well

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.270 
they are dense tissues and show up well
on<00:00:08.069> x-ray<00:00:09.080> soft<00:00:10.080> tissues<00:00:10.530> do<00:00:10.740> not<00:00:10.920> absorb

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
on x-ray soft tissues do not absorb

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.089 
on x-ray soft tissues do not absorb
x-rays<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.599> t<00:00:12.809> signal<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.530> far<00:00:13.860> less

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
x-rays and so the t signal is far less

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.540 
x-rays and so the t signal is far less
attenuated<00:00:15.529> even<00:00:16.529> more<00:00:16.770> importantly<00:00:17.369> we

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
attenuated even more importantly we

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.220 
attenuated even more importantly we
cannot<00:00:17.850> differentiate<00:00:18.359> between<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
cannot differentiate between the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.849 
cannot differentiate between the
different<00:00:19.619> types<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.189> soft<00:00:20.490> tissue<00:00:21.260> if<00:00:22.260> we

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
different types of soft tissue if we

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.679 
different types of soft tissue if we
could<00:00:23.010> introduce<00:00:23.460> something<00:00:23.730> dense<00:00:24.210> this

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
could introduce something dense this

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.740 
could introduce something dense this
will<00:00:24.900> absorb<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.380> x-rays<00:00:26.390> metals<00:00:27.390> are<00:00:27.539> dense

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
will absorb the x-rays metals are dense

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.099 
will absorb the x-rays metals are dense
and<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.289> paid<00:00:28.680> two<00:00:28.949> x-rays<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:30.840> can

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
and so I paid two x-rays and so they can

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.900 
and so I paid two x-rays and so they can
be<00:00:31.230> used<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.740> add<00:00:31.890> contrast<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.120> image

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
be used to add contrast to the image

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.940 
be used to add contrast to the image
barium<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.360> such<00:00:36.660> metal<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.649> has<00:00:37.829> an

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
barium is one such metal it has an

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.400 
barium is one such metal it has an
atomic<00:00:38.190> mass<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.670> 56<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.870> very<00:00:40.079> dense

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
atomic mass of 56 and so is very dense

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.369 
atomic mass of 56 and so is very dense
compared<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.250> tissue<00:00:41.899> because<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> problem

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
compared to tissue because the problem

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.490 
compared to tissue because the problem
is<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.610> barium<00:00:44.610> ions<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.270> solution<00:00:45.500> are

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
is that barium ions in solution are

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.990 
is that barium ions in solution are
highly<00:00:47.100> toxic<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.700> very<00:00:48.180> reactive<00:00:50.000> however

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
highly toxic and very reactive however

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.930 
highly toxic and very reactive however
if<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.750> use<00:00:51.780> barium<00:00:52.379> sulfate<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.730> is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
if we use barium sulfate this is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.750 
if we use barium sulfate this is
extremely<00:00:54.539> insoluble<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.320> water<00:00:55.579> so<00:00:56.579> there

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
extremely insoluble in water so there

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.680 
extremely insoluble in water so there
are<00:00:56.910> no<00:00:57.090> free<00:00:57.420> ions<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> powder<00:00:59.690> this

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
are no free ions and it is a powder this

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.720 
are no free ions and it is a powder this
powder<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.469> given<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.039> slurry<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
powder can be given as a slurry in the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.440 
powder can be given as a slurry in the
water<00:01:02.969> which<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.260> swallowed<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.970> density

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
water which can be swallowed the density

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.390 
water which can be swallowed the density
of<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.689> mixture<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.380> achieve<00:01:07.770> four<00:01:08.100> point

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
of this mixture can achieve four point

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.899 
of this mixture can achieve four point
five<00:01:08.610> grams<00:01:08.909> per<00:01:09.420> milliliter<00:01:10.909> the

five grams per milliliter the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.760 
five grams per milliliter the
radiographer<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:12.869> takes<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.320> series<00:01:13.740> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
radiographer then takes a series of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920 
radiographer then takes a series of
images<00:01:14.150> using<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.420> technique<00:01:15.869> called

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
images using a technique called

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.280 
images using a technique called
fluoroscopy<00:01:17.150> this<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.330> done<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> patient

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
fluoroscopy this is done as the patient

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.450 
fluoroscopy this is done as the patient
drinks<00:01:19.740> or<00:01:19.920> swallows<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.700> slurry<00:01:22.220> here<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.340> an

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
drinks or swallows the slurry here is an

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.719 
drinks or swallows the slurry here is an
x-ray<00:01:23.790> before<00:01:24.299> starting<00:01:25.100> can<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.250> pick<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
x-ray before starting can you pick the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.850 
x-ray before starting can you pick the
esophagus<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.659> image<00:01:29.060> what<00:01:30.060> about<00:01:30.299> now

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
esophagus in this image what about now

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.069 
esophagus in this image what about now
you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.040> easily<00:01:32.310> see<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> esophagus<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
you can easily see the esophagus as the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.340 
you can easily see the esophagus as the
slurry<00:01:34.380> passes<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> stomach<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:36.450> there

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
slurry passes to the stomach if there

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.630 
slurry passes to the stomach if there
was<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> partial<00:01:37.770> obstruction<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
was a partial obstruction in the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.969 
was a partial obstruction in the
esophagus<00:01:39.000> or<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> leak<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.409> could<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:40.799> very

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
esophagus or a leak it could be very

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.670 
esophagus or a leak it could be very
easy<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.909> summary<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:46.170> barium

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
easy to see so in summary the barium

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.940 
easy to see so in summary the barium
absorbs<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.399> x-rays<00:01:48.350> this<00:01:49.350> means<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
absorbs the x-rays this means that the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.730 
absorbs the x-rays this means that the
signal<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.430> attenuated<00:01:51.259> so<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.439> image

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
signal is attenuated so the image

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.420 
signal is attenuated so the image
appears<00:01:53.189> dark<00:01:54.530> hopefully<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.710> can<00:01:55.860> now<00:01:55.920> see

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
appears dark hopefully you can now see

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.950 
appears dark hopefully you can now see
how<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:57.090> combine<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.810> different

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
how we can combine the different

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.560 
how we can combine the different
concepts<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:59.399> build<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.909> procedure<00:02:00.299> that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
concepts to build up a procedure that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.389 
concepts to build up a procedure that
can<00:02:00.810> provide<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.320> information<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
can provide the information that the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.030 
can provide the information that the
doctor<00:02:02.790> needs
