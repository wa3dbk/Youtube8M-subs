00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
happen well just as you were thinking

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.300 
happen well just as you were thinking
about<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.709> problem

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
about the problem

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.820 
about the problem
so<00:02:38.640> was<00:02:38.819> your<00:02:38.970> partner<00:02:39.420> he<00:02:40.230> was<00:02:40.260> wondering

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
so was your partner he was wondering

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.979 
so was your partner he was wondering
about<00:02:40.920> his<00:02:41.670> actions<00:02:42.090> relative<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.840> your

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
about his actions relative to your

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:43.960 
about his actions relative to your
decision

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
decision

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.190 
decision
he<00:02:44.970> thought<00:02:45.180> what<00:02:45.390> would<00:02:45.540> happen<00:02:45.900> if<00:02:46.050> you

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
he thought what would happen if you

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.400 
he thought what would happen if you
confess<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.209> he<00:02:48.209> had<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.450> choices<00:02:48.930> between

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
confess and he had the choices between

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.520 
confess and he had the choices between
staying<00:02:49.680> silent<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.280> confessing<00:02:51.530> he

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
staying silent and confessing he

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.960 
staying silent and confessing he
realized<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.250> was<00:02:53.370> better<00:02:53.580> for<00:02:53.700> him<00:02:53.940> to

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
realized that it was better for him to

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.620 
realized that it was better for him to
confess

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
confess

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.949 
confess
if<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.870> confess<00:02:55.760> now<00:02:56.760> if<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.060> stay<00:02:57.299> silent

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
if you confess now if you stay silent

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.809 
if you confess now if you stay silent
he<00:02:58.200> again<00:02:58.440> realized<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.459> it's<00:02:59.640> in<00:02:59.790> his

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
he again realized that it's in his

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.960 
he again realized that it's in his
interest<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.480> confess<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:02.040> he<00:03:02.280> has<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> dominant

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
interest to confess so he has a dominant

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.320 
interest to confess so he has a dominant
strategy<00:03:03.540> which<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.930> confess<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:06.060> far

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
strategy which is to confess so far

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.789 
strategy which is to confess so far
we've<00:03:06.510> been<00:03:06.540> thinking<00:03:07.049> about<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.350> game<00:03:07.500> from

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
we've been thinking about the game from

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.580 
we've been thinking about the game from
one<00:03:07.980> person's<00:03:08.459> perspective<00:03:08.760> at<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.239> time<00:03:09.590> but

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
one person's perspective at a time but

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.340 
one person's perspective at a time but
truly<00:03:11.040> we<00:03:11.220> should<00:03:11.400> be<00:03:11.489> thinking<00:03:11.670> about<00:03:11.910> it

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
truly we should be thinking about it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.140 
truly we should be thinking about it
together<00:03:13.350> as<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> whole<00:03:14.010> when<00:03:14.489> both<00:03:14.700> people<00:03:15.060> are

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
together as a whole when both people are

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.300 
together as a whole when both people are
making<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.569> decision<00:03:16.080> they<00:03:16.739> each<00:03:16.920> have<00:03:17.190> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
making the decision they each have the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.940 
making the decision they each have the
choice<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.549> say<00:03:18.030> silent<00:03:18.570> or<00:03:18.690> confess<00:03:19.109> and<00:03:19.410> that

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
choice to say silent or confess and that

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.710 
choice to say silent or confess and that
affects<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.370> outcome<00:03:20.609> for<00:03:21.000> each<00:03:21.120> person<00:03:21.630> in

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
affects the outcome for each person in

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.280 
affects the outcome for each person in
the<00:03:21.840> group<00:03:21.870> they<00:03:22.769> can<00:03:22.829> both<00:03:23.220> stay<00:03:23.519> silent<00:03:24.290> one

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
the group they can both stay silent one

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.960 
the group they can both stay silent one
person<00:03:25.709> can<00:03:25.859> stay<00:03:26.040> silent<00:03:26.549> while<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.700> other

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
person can stay silent while the other

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.960 
person can stay silent while the other
confesses<00:03:27.690> or<00:03:28.079> they<00:03:28.799> can<00:03:28.980> both<00:03:29.160> confess<00:03:31.970> now

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
confesses or they can both confess now

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.210 
confesses or they can both confess now
it<00:03:33.299> seems<00:03:33.900> best<00:03:34.230> for<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.709> group<00:03:34.980> if<00:03:35.160> they

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
it seems best for the group if they

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.340 
it seems best for the group if they
could<00:03:35.519> both<00:03:35.730> stay<00:03:36.030> silent<00:03:36.570> they'll<00:03:37.140> only

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
could both stay silent they'll only

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.289 
could both stay silent they'll only
serve<00:03:37.680> one<00:03:37.920> year<00:03:38.130> in<00:03:38.250> jail<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.760> that's<00:03:39.150> the

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
serve one year in jail and that's the

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.630 
serve one year in jail and that's the
best<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.720> they<00:03:39.870> could<00:03:40.049> do<00:03:40.170> as<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.350> whole<00:03:40.640> but

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
best that they could do as a whole but

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.240 
best that they could do as a whole but
as<00:03:41.760> we<00:03:41.940> showed<00:03:42.150> earlier<00:03:42.500> it's<00:03:43.500> better<00:03:43.769> for<00:03:44.070> you

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
as we showed earlier it's better for you

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.920 
as we showed earlier it's better for you
to<00:03:44.430> confess<00:03:44.790> no<00:03:45.030> matter<00:03:45.209> what<00:03:45.420> your<00:03:45.570> partner

yourself this situation is known as a

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
thing for the group you can't trust that

other<00:04:33.490> people<00:04:33.940> will<00:04:34.060> also<00:04:34.090> cooperate<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.080> do

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
other people will also cooperate and do

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.290 
other people will also cooperate and do
the<00:04:35.350> best<00:04:35.530> thing<00:04:35.770> for<00:04:35.800> society<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.120> have

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
the best thing for society so you have

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.610 
the best thing for society so you have
to<00:04:37.450> do<00:04:37.600> what's<00:04:37.810> best<00:04:37.870> for<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.380> individually

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
to do what's best for you individually

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.900 
to do what's best for you individually
and<00:04:39.220> that<00:04:39.280> ends<00:04:40.030> up<00:04:40.090> worse<00:04:40.300> for<00:04:40.570> everyone<00:04:41.910> the

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
and that ends up worse for everyone the

and that ends up worse for everyone the
