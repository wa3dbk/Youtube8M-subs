well I've got we finished putting the

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.440 
well I've got we finished putting the
drive<00:00:05.160> shafts<00:00:05.490> in<00:00:05.819> we've<00:00:06.000> got<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.270> vehicle

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
drive shafts in we've got the vehicle

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:31.490 
drive shafts in we've got the vehicle
back<00:00:07.170> down<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.620> wheels<00:00:30.199> there's<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.260> negative

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
back down on wheels there's a negative

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.630 
back down on wheels there's a negative
cable<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.250> goes<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:34.219> it's<00:00:35.219> right<00:00:35.399> down

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
cable that goes to it it's right down

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:47.240 
cable that goes to it it's right down
underneath<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.390> these<00:00:36.600> things<00:00:36.930> here<00:00:46.070> is<00:00:47.070> it

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
underneath all these things here is it

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.690 
underneath all these things here is it
there<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.050> right<00:00:49.050> there<00:00:49.110> there's<00:00:49.770> an<00:00:49.950> on

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
there it is right there there's an on

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.209 
there it is right there there's an on
this<00:00:50.969> one<00:00:51.239> there's<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.860> bolt<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.010> goes

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
this one there's a bolt that goes

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.260 
this one there's a bolt that goes
through<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.079> then<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> nut<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> backside

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
through and then a nut on the backside

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.069 
through and then a nut on the backside
and<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:59.010> there's<00:00:59.760> also<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.149> negative<00:01:00.600> cable

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and and there's also a negative cable

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.850 
and and there's also a negative cable
that<00:01:01.980> attaches<00:01:02.690> here<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:03.960> well<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.650> comes

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that attaches here as well that comes

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.219 
that attaches here as well that comes
from<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> battery<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:07.080> that's<00:01:08.780> not<00:01:09.780> sure<00:01:10.049> why

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
from the battery so that's not sure why

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
from the battery so that's not sure why
it's<00:01:10.470> hooked<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> guess<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
it's hooked up like that but I guess I

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.310 
it's hooked up like that but I guess I
needed<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.180> good<00:01:12.360> ground<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.900> battery

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
needed a good ground for the battery

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.940 
needed a good ground for the battery
that's<00:01:13.700> what<00:01:14.700> they<00:01:14.820> decided<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> use<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that's what they decided to use as the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.789 
that's what they decided to use as the
main<00:01:17.750> ground<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.380> there's<00:01:19.619> another

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
main ground and then there's another

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:28.850 
main ground and then there's another
bolt<00:01:21.290> which<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:24.439> down<00:01:25.439> below<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:27.680> just<00:01:28.680> in

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
bolt which is a down below here just in

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.999 
bolt which is a down below here just in
here<00:01:29.720> on<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> bottom<00:01:31.020> side<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.619> starter

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
here on the bottom side of the starter

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.370 
here on the bottom side of the starter
and<00:01:32.360> that<00:01:33.360> just<00:01:33.570> bolts<00:01:33.840> straight<00:01:34.079> into<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
and that just bolts straight into the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.330 
and that just bolts straight into the
housing<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:34.979> pretty<00:01:35.250> straightforward

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
housing so it's pretty straightforward

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.069 
housing so it's pretty straightforward
now<00:01:38.340> we've<00:01:38.640> got<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.930> distributor<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.770> place<00:01:41.369> I

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
now we've got the distributor in place I

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.889 
now we've got the distributor in place I
mark<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.380> timing<00:01:44.070> work<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:45.420> top<00:01:45.689> dead

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
mark the timing work that top dead

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:57.219 
mark the timing work that top dead
center<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:54.119> got<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> plugs<00:01:54.990> out<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.939> just

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
center I got the plugs out and just

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.300 
center I got the plugs out and just
sticking<00:01:58.229> a<00:02:00.350> coat<00:02:01.350> hanger<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.250> I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
sticking a coat hanger in there and I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.819 
sticking a coat hanger in there and I
can<00:02:02.540> feel<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.600> piston<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.259> know<00:02:04.409> I'm<00:02:04.530> at<00:02:04.649> top

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
can feel the piston so I know I'm at top

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.900 
can feel the piston so I know I'm at top
dead<00:02:05.009> center<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.399> my<00:02:05.579> marks<00:02:05.850> correct

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.620 

and<00:02:12.200> got<00:02:13.200> my<00:02:13.350> distributor<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.390> here's<00:02:15.390> my

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
and got my distributor in here's my

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.050 
and got my distributor in here's my
number<00:02:15.960> one<00:02:17.390> here's<00:02:18.390> my<00:02:18.660> number<00:02:18.990> one<00:02:19.140> lead<00:02:20.060> so

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
number one here's my number one lead so

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.900 
number one here's my number one lead so
it's<00:02:21.240> this<00:02:21.480> one<00:02:21.720> right<00:02:21.780> here<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:25.430> when<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.610> put

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
it's this one right here and when we put

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.010 
it's this one right here and when we put
the<00:02:27.000> cap<00:02:27.210> on<00:02:28.010> we<00:02:29.010> can<00:02:29.250> see<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.210> our<00:02:33.390> number

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
the cap on we can see this is our number

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.970 
the cap on we can see this is our number
one<00:02:34.290> lead<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.870> rotor<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.410> lining<00:02:40.860> up

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
one lead and the rotor is lining up

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.850 
one lead and the rotor is lining up
pretty<00:02:41.250> accurate<00:02:41.850> with<00:02:42.230> where<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.440> needs<00:02:43.620> to

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
pretty accurate with where that needs to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.610 
pretty accurate with where that needs to
be<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.490> think<00:02:44.670> I'm<00:02:44.850> pretty<00:02:45.060> close<00:02:45.320> as<00:02:46.320> far<00:02:46.500> as

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
be so I think I'm pretty close as far as

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.210 
be so I think I'm pretty close as far as
the<00:02:46.740> timing<00:02:46.980> goes<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:52.230> I'm<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.620> gonna<00:02:52.770> have

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
the timing goes so I'm just gonna have

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.760 
the timing goes so I'm just gonna have
to<00:02:53.340> finish<00:02:53.990> there's<00:02:54.990> three<00:02:55.260> bolts<00:02:55.590> on<00:02:55.710> the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
to finish there's three bolts on the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.610 
to finish there's three bolts on the
distributor<00:02:56.130> there's<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.720> longer<00:02:57.720> one<00:02:57.900> here<00:02:58.470> on

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
distributor there's a longer one here on

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
distributor there's a longer one here on
the<00:02:58.740> back<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.820> then<00:03:00.890> there's<00:03:01.890> two<00:03:02.130> shorter

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
the back and then there's two shorter

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.860 
the back and then there's two shorter
ones<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.680> longer<00:03:05.070> one<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.390> on<00:03:06.390> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
ones so the longer one is on the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.960 
ones so the longer one is on the
backside<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.770> distributor<00:03:08.250> here<00:03:08.580> and

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
backside of the distributor here and

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.590 
backside of the distributor here and
then<00:03:09.510> there's<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.750> shorter<00:03:09.780> one<00:03:10.550> which<00:03:11.550> is<00:03:11.790> just

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
then there's a shorter one which is just

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.720 
then there's a shorter one which is just
down<00:03:12.660> here<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.200> can<00:03:13.410> see<00:03:13.489> see<00:03:14.489> right

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
down here that you can see see right

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.229 
down here that you can see see right
here<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.209> then<00:03:15.330> there's<00:03:15.420> another<00:03:15.630> one

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
here and then there's another one

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.380 
here and then there's another one
somewhere<00:03:18.350> on<00:03:19.350> there<00:03:19.910> where<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.060> it

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
somewhere on there where is it

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.199 
somewhere on there where is it
one<00:03:21.540> oh<00:03:21.780> down<00:03:22.110> on<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.320> very<00:03:22.530> bottom<00:03:23.030> down<00:03:24.030> on

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
one oh down on the very bottom down on

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.920 
one oh down on the very bottom down on
the<00:03:24.890> direct<00:03:25.890> six<00:03:26.190> o'clock<00:03:26.660> directly<00:03:27.660> six

there's<00:03:38.730> also<00:03:38.970> another<00:03:39.239> nut<00:03:40.080> here<00:03:42.620> that<00:03:45.950> has

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
there's also another nut here that has

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.340 
there's also another nut here that has
some<00:03:46.980> wires<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.790> are<00:03:47.850> grounding<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:49.320> the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
some wires that are grounding to the

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.190 
some wires that are grounding to the

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
bottom of the distributor there so I'll

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.550 
bottom of the distributor there so I'll
have<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.590> attach<00:03:52.830> those<00:03:53.130> as<00:03:53.370> well<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:54.560> think
