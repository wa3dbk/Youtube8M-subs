00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
here I've got the drive set pretty high

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.210 
here I've got the drive set pretty high
base<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.290> turned<00:01:13.530> off<00:01:13.650> quite<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> bit<00:01:13.950> there

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
base is turned off quite a bit there

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.289 
base is turned off quite a bit there
then<00:01:14.430> there's<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.700> lot<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.939> meds

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
then there's a lot of meds

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.109 
then there's a lot of meds
what<00:01:15.810> treble<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.439> presents<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.000> would

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
what treble not presents so that would

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.390 
what treble not presents so that would
give<00:01:18.270> us<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.509> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> more<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.369> kind<00:01:20.369> of

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
give us a kind of more of a kind of

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.670 
give us a kind of more of a kind of
rocky<00:01:20.820> or<00:01:20.909> sown<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.900> guitar<00:01:22.140> this

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
rocky or sown so with this guitar this

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:33.930 
rocky or sown so with this guitar this
is<00:01:22.799> sort<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.100> told<00:01:23.490> him<00:01:23.610> again

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.340 

guess<00:01:34.940> it's<00:01:35.150> a<00:01:35.240> good<00:01:35.270> sort<00:01:35.690> of<00:01:35.720> standard<00:01:36.140> sort

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
guess it's a good sort of standard sort

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.290 
guess it's a good sort of standard sort

actually what I'm doing and you can see
up<00:01:40.580> under<00:01:40.970> them<00:01:41.120> the<00:01:41.720> amp<00:01:41.930> course<00:01:42.350> mate<00:01:42.590> what

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
up under them the amp course mate what

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.830 
up under them the amp course mate what
he<00:01:43.070> used<00:01:43.280> as<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.520> condenser<00:01:43.850> make<00:01:44.240> here<00:01:46.840> that's

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
he used as a condenser make here that's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.250 
he used as a condenser make here that's
a<00:01:47.960> though<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:49.310> dental<00:01:49.610> MOOC<00:01:49.870> which<00:01:50.870> is<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.050> rode

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
a though in dental MOOC which is a rode

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.430 
a though in dental MOOC which is a rode
nt1<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:53.510> that's<00:01:53.660> why<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.810> use<00:01:53.900> just<00:01:54.350> to

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
nt1 and so that's why you use just to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.930 
nt1 and so that's why you use just to
kind<00:01:54.620> of<00:01:54.680> get<00:01:54.830> an<00:01:54.950> onion<00:01:55.220> makes<00:01:55.460> obviously
