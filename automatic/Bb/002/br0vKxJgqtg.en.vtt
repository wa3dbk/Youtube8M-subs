of<00:02:34.630> energy<00:02:35.050> bending<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.800> was<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.190> lion

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
of energy bending it was this lion

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.130 
of energy bending it was this lion
turtle<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.150> in<00:02:37.269> part<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.720> knowledge<00:02:37.900> of

still think this theory holds a lot of
