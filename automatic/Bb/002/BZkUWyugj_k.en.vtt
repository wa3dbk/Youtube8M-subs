00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.610 

anyway<00:00:04.529> but<00:00:04.740> he's<00:00:04.920> definitely<00:00:05.370> trying<00:00:06.029> to

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:06.620 
anyway but he's definitely trying to

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.100 
anyway but he's definitely trying to
spawn<00:00:07.620> two<00:00:07.980> females<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:09.420> he's<00:00:09.540> got<00:00:09.840> one

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
spawn two females and he's got one

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.640 
spawn two females and he's got one
successfully<00:00:10.920> holding<00:00:11.250> eggs<00:00:11.460> already

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
successfully holding eggs already

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.800 
successfully holding eggs already
that's<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.830> beta<00:00:14.040> male<00:00:15.890> and<00:00:17.600> that's<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
that's the beta male and that's the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.120 
that's the beta male and that's the
alpha<00:00:19.199> male<00:00:19.580> he's<00:00:20.580> over<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.230> he's<00:00:22.230> trying<00:00:22.949> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
alpha male he's over here he's trying to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.089 
alpha male he's over here he's trying to
make<00:00:23.279> up<00:00:23.460> for<00:00:23.609> lost<00:00:23.730> time<00:00:24.740> because<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> beta

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
make up for lost time because the beta

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.870 
make up for lost time because the beta
male<00:00:26.340> right<00:00:26.660> here<00:00:28.160> has<00:00:29.160> already<00:00:29.429> schooled

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
male right here has already schooled

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.060 
male right here has already schooled
them<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.240> two<00:00:30.480> females<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.320> guess<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.920> means

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
them on two females I guess that means

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.970 
them on two females I guess that means
he<00:00:32.279> made<00:00:32.780> in<00:00:33.780> theory<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.260> guess<00:00:34.350> either<00:00:34.950> alpha

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
he made in theory I guess either alpha

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.319 
he made in theory I guess either alpha
just<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> other<00:00:38.250> ones<00:00:38.460> more<00:00:38.670> aggressive<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
just the other ones more aggressive and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.160 
just the other ones more aggressive and
bigger<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> assumed<00:00:42.390> he<00:00:42.629> would<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> main

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
bigger so I assumed he would be the main

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.049 
bigger so I assumed he would be the main
breeder<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.040> little<00:00:44.219> guy<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.789> a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
breeder but this little guy is just a

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.310 
breeder but this little guy is just a
champ

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.619 

maybe<00:00:49.320> he<00:00:49.530> knows<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.149> much

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
maybe he knows to just not do so much

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.540 
maybe he knows to just not do so much
fighting<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.260> aggression<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.309> stick

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
fighting and aggression and just stick

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.880 
fighting and aggression and just stick
to<00:00:53.670> business<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.930> other<00:00:58.050> male<00:00:58.320> spends<00:00:58.739> too

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
to business the other male spends too

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.920 
to business the other male spends too
much<00:00:58.920> time<00:00:59.070> chasing<00:00:59.550> everybody<00:01:00.030> off<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.690> guy
