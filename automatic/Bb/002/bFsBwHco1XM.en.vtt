last ones a secret achievements so I

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.169 
last ones a secret achievements so I
think<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.159> about<00:00:50.249> moving<00:00:50.519> it<00:00:50.760> may<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:51.120> be

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
think it's about moving it may not be

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.880 
think it's about moving it may not be
could<00:00:51.929> be<00:00:51.960> about<00:00:52.260> any<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.679> other<00:00:54.559> maps<00:00:55.559> on

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
could be about any of the other maps on

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.930 
could be about any of the other maps on
the<00:00:55.949> map<00:00:56.280> pack<00:00:56.749> but<00:00:57.749> the<00:00:57.809> first<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.140> is

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
the map pack but the first one is

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
but basically this blog walked up with

but basically this blog walked up with
this<00:01:42.659> hacking<00:01:43.020> device<00:01:43.289> to<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:44.359> mp5k<00:01:45.359> hacked<00:01:46.350> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
this hacking device to a mp5k hacked it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.669 
this hacking device to a mp5k hacked it
and<00:01:46.799> their<00:01:46.950> gun<00:01:47.310> turned<00:01:47.960> upside<00:01:48.960> down<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.500> the

the one of the original maps the name of

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.060 
the one of the original maps the name of
which<00:05:15.630> escapes<00:05:16.199> me<00:05:16.410> at<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:16.530> moment<00:05:16.590> but<00:05:16.979> i

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
which escapes me at the moment but i

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.230 
which escapes me at the moment but i
will<00:05:17.100> think<00:05:17.370> of<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:17.639> and<00:05:19.820> i'll<00:05:20.820> get<00:05:20.970> back<00:05:21.030> to

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
will think of it and i'll get back to

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.089 
will think of it and i'll get back to
that<00:05:21.270> one<00:05:21.449> but<00:05:21.810> yeah<00:05:21.930> basically<00:05:22.080> it<00:05:22.800> just<00:05:22.830> goes

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
that one but yeah basically it just goes

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:24.589 
that one but yeah basically it just goes
down<00:05:23.280> to<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:23.460> ground<00:05:23.610> digs<00:05:24.180> up<00:05:24.300> a<00:05:24.360> bunch<00:05:24.539> of

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
down to the ground digs up a bunch of

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.830 
down to the ground digs up a bunch of
dirt<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:24.810> comes<00:05:25.139> back<00:05:25.320> up<00:05:25.470> so<00:05:26.190> i'm<00:05:26.280> assuming

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
dirt and comes back up so i'm assuming

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.300 
dirt and comes back up so i'm assuming
that<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:28.349> can<00:05:29.930> blow<00:05:30.930> up<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.500> bottom<00:05:31.889> of<00:05:32.039> them

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
that you can blow up the bottom of them

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.100 
that you can blow up the bottom of them
and<00:05:32.759> make<00:05:33.270> them<00:05:33.539> not<00:05:35.300> excavate<00:05:36.300> or<00:05:36.479> something

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
and make them not excavate or something

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.409 
and make them not excavate or something
like<00:05:37.229> that<00:05:37.289> not<00:05:38.130> entirely<00:05:38.430> sure<00:05:38.580> I<00:05:38.729> suppose<00:05:38.849> as

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
like that not entirely sure I suppose as

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.480 
like that not entirely sure I suppose as
I<00:05:39.539> said<00:05:39.599> we'll<00:05:39.870> see<00:05:39.900> in<00:05:40.169> about<00:05:40.260> an<00:05:40.500> hour<00:05:40.650> rady
