00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
Katie coil this is an apocalyptic novel

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.000 
Katie coil this is an apocalyptic novel
I<00:00:32.219> mean<00:00:32.940> most<00:00:33.180> apocalyptic<00:00:33.960> novels<00:00:34.380> end<00:00:34.710> up

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
I mean most apocalyptic novels end up

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.650 
I mean most apocalyptic novels end up
with<00:00:35.160> characters<00:00:35.730> herself<00:00:36.329> more<00:00:36.450> out<00:00:36.630> of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
with characters herself more out of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.319 
with characters herself more out of
their<00:00:36.989> element<00:00:37.219> by<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.280> sheer<00:00:38.760> nature<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
their element by the sheer nature of the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.840 
their element by the sheer nature of the
story<00:00:39.629> but<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.140> think<00:00:40.530> Vivian<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.250> such<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> shy

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
story but I think Vivian is such a shy

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.400 
story but I think Vivian is such a shy
girl<00:00:42.120> who<00:00:42.360> likes<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.690> kind<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.899> stand<00:00:43.140> back

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
girl who likes to kind of stand back

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.650 
girl who likes to kind of stand back
from<00:00:43.590> things<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.309> doesn't<00:00:44.850> feel<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.480> she

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
from things and doesn't feel like she

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.290 
from things and doesn't feel like she
has<00:00:45.690> much<00:00:46.050> confidence<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> think<00:00:47.300> however

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
has much confidence so I think however

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.630 
has much confidence so I think however
being<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.140> lead<00:00:49.320> character<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.280> novel

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
being the lead character of this novel

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.250 
being the lead character of this novel
is<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:50.969> great<00:00:51.270> fun<00:00:51.539> because<00:00:51.899> she<00:00:51.989> really<00:00:52.230> has

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
is just great fun because she really has

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.130 
is just great fun because she really has
to<00:00:52.469> come<00:00:52.649> out<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.800> her<00:00:53.010> shell<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.520> react<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:55.110> a
