 the door man 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.470
 the back round 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.470
 in a near 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.650

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.450
 the Hungarians Wednesday

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.500
 there is a new trainer for that 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.949
 as if it was a gift to travel ahead to the pact and their mutual 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:12.329
 confrontations 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.329

 jerney kaagman 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.259
 in place eleven particularly impressed by the ds 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:32.199
 if you read his text, it is really as if you are standing naked 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.699
 for riders along the two very small vocal cords 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.799
 the girl who does this way 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.839
 and it is also great i was there in france last week 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:47.390
 a fair held the biggest music fair in the world an idea and 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.540
 and there I was approached by various people to the Dutch 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.999
 music publishers managers 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:58.409
 young rushes you ahead because they follow me all to win for free 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.799
 she did not know that it depends on many factors 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.799
 but in any case all ingredients are present 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.229
 I just have animal diseases immediately 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.629
 that year 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:31.029
 yes that didn't happen at all that I got so emotional on someone 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:36.610
 those so and so many martine songs that sing and then also the modesty 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.699
 has to wonder if 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.699
 whether to sing in dutch is nothing 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:51.029
 the man a driving ban 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:56.019

 because this is ready and ready 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.659
 yes it is very strange to say but 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:06.789
 the final is within reach and with the performances that I have last week 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.919

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.449
 put on a song like a jacket 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.750
 and what you do is you do not know what you are doing and you are sort of 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:55.550
 Kevin you fly with it to the stars is incredible what gets you out of hand with it 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.979
