00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.580
 hi hi now i will show how i am 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:18.390
 I do the lens down on the example of this 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:25.560
 here is a wedge. quite a while cut it 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:32.590
 fast cut clarabel which means here already 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:36.960
 I made the descent down the usual flat 5 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:40.360
 I have them here 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:46.239
 this is enough to do 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.040
 lens let's get down we need 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:54.129
 here is such 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:01:06.010
 coarse pebble down from 15 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:12.050
 degrees we take a stone and make a knife here 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:14.740
 such movements can and on themselves 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.740
 and forward 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.650
 this angle is not visible now I'll turn 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:33.840
 the camera 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:36.979
 on the side it went to smooth out in this 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.979
 the place is visible 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:51.220
 Well, start on a rough stone first 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.950
 we stroke this hard transition just 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:59.050
 here and so on the water 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:04.600
 here is the angle observing and this angle is 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:13.200
 I have to lay down the descent but not just here 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:13.200
 this edge slightly smoothed 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.410
 Well, for 10 minutes, 3 nye pebble 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.120
 I already loom here are such forms 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.120
 that is, this bump is smoothed out 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:46.370
 this way he left was originally a 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:50.569
 Here on this side is now gone from here then 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:57.739
 there is a smooth shape formed with this 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:59.450
 the sides already look like a pebble lens 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:12.560
 it will be more convenient to take help under 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:15.550
 slope now they can move on 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.550
 smaller stone 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:41.030
 now at the end 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:43.390
 make it smaller this angle more 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.390
 smoothly 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:04:22.490
 and already when we just finish 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:27.010
 dunk some water well that's formed 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:31.540
 such a smooth smooth lens 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.540
 I think technology is not so difficult 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.250
 this on the lens 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:53.760
 So I handled the tip here is that part of the 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:58.870
 there is time here you can see this transition 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:03.190
 here already on the tip there is of course this is not 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:08.040
 the last treatment still needs a stone 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.040
 The smaller here is the sandpaper at the end 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:21.529
