00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.780
 they are made in the first positions there 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.140
 we are tomorrow of the thread carefully and 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.009
 graphics 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.009
 scoreboard and belletti 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.890

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.320
 yes no 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:59.800
 the robots pay attention to her 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.800
 anyone wants 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.840
 then davide cimolai that sprinted that 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.270
 emotion 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.369
 finally what has arrived 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.350
 I had been waiting for a long time after all 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.780
 years of sacrifices available to my parents 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.370
 captains today I finally managed to 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.170
 to collect 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.070
 a beautiful victory in a race that is me 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.810
 always liked since a long time 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.740
 it was a tactic perhaps it is already decided i 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.480
 your teammates like 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.970
 rightly pointed out earlier they have 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.530
 worked a lot then already from this one 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.090
 morning david cimolai was the man of the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.130
 lampre deserves 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.340
 as I said I knew I still had 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.490
 a good condition and therefore in the end 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.620
 also the path did did 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.600
 selection in the last tear 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.090
 we looked at each other nothing 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.900
 I was the only one left from her 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.030
 team and so I have to thank in 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.710
 primis for the work he has done and then 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.480
 all the other comrades because in short 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.750
 we have shown that we have run 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.340
 well, winning was the least I could 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.530
 do for everyone 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.840
 an important victory in a classic 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.280
 important as this now allows you 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.010
 to look with great optimism at 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.650
 upcoming events but definitely gives 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.940
 moral for those who are next 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.720
 appointments and therefore not better than that 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.900
 he could go 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.120
 as it was a way also to thank 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.340
 in short, the lampre team that loves me 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.380
 welcomed here is this the fourth year with 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.550
 them and I think I have them 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.550
 thanked in the best possible way 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.239
 thanks to worst for belletti 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.420
