sports and daily activities when you

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.089 
sports and daily activities when you
consider<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.199> anatomy<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> midsection

consider the anatomy of the midsection

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.820 
consider the anatomy of the midsection
there's<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.029> lot<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.390> muscles<00:00:30.779> involved<00:00:31.320> so

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
there's a lot of muscles involved so

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.790 
there's a lot of muscles involved so
let's<00:00:32.009> take<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> closer<00:00:32.610> look<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:34.350> muscles

muscles to work all of these muscles it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.780 
muscles to work all of these muscles it
could<00:01:45.630> take<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.990> very<00:01:46.020> long<00:01:46.350> time<00:01:46.860> doing

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
could take you a very long time doing

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.090 
could take you a very long time doing
exercises<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.990> crunches<00:01:50.180> side<00:01:51.180> bends

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100

twists and core exercises like the plank

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.520 
twists and core exercises like the plank
however<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.759> great<00:01:57.060> exercise<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:58.110> combines

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
however a great exercise that combines

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.039 
however a great exercise that combines
flexing<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.250> spine<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.880> twisting<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.899> as

well as strengthening the core and

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.719 
well as strengthening the core and
hitting<00:02:04.500> all<00:02:04.710> four<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.340> midsection

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
hitting all four of the midsection

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.900 
hitting all four of the midsection
muscles<00:02:06.329> discussed<00:02:06.869> as<00:02:07.799> an<00:02:08.039> exercise<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.580> I

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
muscles discussed as an exercise that I

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.330 
muscles discussed as an exercise that I
call<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.690> bell<00:02:09.929> tower<00:02:10.200> crunch

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
call the bell tower crunch

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.759 
call the bell tower crunch
this<00:02:11.879> because<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.330> exercise<00:02:12.690> mimics<00:02:13.379> ringing

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
this because the exercise mimics ringing

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.119 
this because the exercise mimics ringing
a<00:02:13.890> bell<00:02:14.069> in<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.370> bell<00:02:14.550> tower<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:16.590> do<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.950> bell
