00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.900

 to break with five days 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.300
 consecutive losing and the realsociety 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.130
 to get closer to the athletic club of 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.500
 bilbao that occupies league seat 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.420
 champions and that the real society is 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.000
 put ahead on the scoreboard in the 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.070
 8 minute race to the right of 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.260
 Carlos sail that launches the counterattack and 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.120
 the Mexican finishes delivering the ball 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.280
 for the Chori Castro 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.250
 that for the ball with the leg 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.550
 left and with the same solves before 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.370
 the goalkeeper andrés fernández 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.240
 spectacular sailing race 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.750
 the rod and the delivery 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.700
 to the chori that would mark his second goal in 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.770
 this league the first one I already write it before 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.860
 osasuna in the first round and we saw 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.690
 to the technician osasunista fadi gracia seeing 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.020
 the match from one of the boxes from 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.910
 one of the booths in the grandstand 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.770
 stadium of the sadar preferred to see the 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.650
 from above and had alfredo 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.560
 sanchez to his second 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.020
 down osasuna I try after that 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.910
 0 to 1 with oriol laugh of protagonist and 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.530
 to set pieces this one that we just saw 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.540
 it was the first one of oriol laughed then 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.240
 I would get the real one before 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.780
 society in the first period has this 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.880
 clarísima de agirretxe in the 25th minute 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.730
 to put the 0 to 2 excellent the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.670
 performance of Andre Fernandez avoiding 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.660
 that second second consecutive goal of 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.240
 oriol riera 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.280
 Alvaro again on set pieces and a 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.810
 ball that comes from the right does not 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.390
 I could believe 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.270
 Oriol laughed those he had already had in 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.650
 the match to get equal the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.340
 shock 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.220
 still in the first half it would be 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.790
 damage in this play armenteros and of 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.490
 fact retreated from the party on the cutting edge 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.750
 of rest would enter to replace him 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.750
 of the caves 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.920
 a match that had many cards 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.019
 yellow and in fact many 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.030
 interruptions despite being a 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.280
 I find very competitive and this is the 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.310
 action in which armenteros sees the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.349
 yellow cardboard and immediately 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.530
 it ends up being replaced by the 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.530
 caves 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.780
 and ricaunes differential in the ejerÁS 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.450
 starter zurutuza from first to point 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.240
 is to mark the 0 to 2 second 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.770
 opportunity for the team from San Sebastian 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.960
 to earn a significant advantage already in 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.200
 the match and see almost from ground of 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.510
 own game overcame the divide 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.480
 spectacular the shot of iñigo martínez 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.090
 that ends up hitting the crossbar 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.880
 luxury opportunity one more for the real 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.970
 to put the 0-2 but from there 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.330
 it was osasuna the team that sought 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.360
 clearly the goal he found in 14 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.250
 with the 11 of oriol laughed and then 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.860
 It was also the team that came better 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.470
 end of match to the point of view 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.960
 more or less close to mark that second 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.930
 goal to the fourth was the win for 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.750
 Oriol laughed in another action 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.180
 with a stopped ball and from the right shot 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.459
 within the small area to match the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.629
 party was more than half an hour and as 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.700
 we said pinko team was encouraged to 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.290
 had some opportunities like this in 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.830
 which bravo has to get the ball 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.220
 before the arrival of the cat silva 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.720
 a chucho osasuna also had some 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.570
 option in the real society to the 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.450
 counterattack but greater dominion already in the 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.940
 final section of the set match 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.190
 of javi gracia in a very 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.950
 disputed and in which carlos martínez 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.610
 he had to leave the game because 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.610
 this shock 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.590
 Markel Bergara with her partner 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.840
 supposed 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.980
 a terrible swelling in the eye and had 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.980
 to leave the meeting 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.900
 would enter the ansotegi match on the straight 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.480
 end of the match with a draw at 1 and with 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.610
 a non-conformist osasuna in fact 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.950
 I was looking for the victory to get out of 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.520
 descent and was about to get it 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:39.550
 see the one of lovato as it takes it out 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.910
 iñigo martínez in the last breath of the 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.650
 match was very close osasuna's 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.960
 get the victory is true that the 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.780
 real society had forgiven the 0-2 in 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.060
 several times and the corner with which 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.860
 the game was almost closed and 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.440
 with which osasuna still had time 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.520
 of disturbing the goal once more 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.990
 txuri urdin here picks up the ball 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.569
 roberto Torres and ends up sending the ball 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.460
 finally the supporters party 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.710
 very intense and disputed until the 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.409
 last sigh with tie to one with 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:17.280
 tables on the scoreboard at the end in the 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:17.280
 sadar osasuna 1 real partnership 1
