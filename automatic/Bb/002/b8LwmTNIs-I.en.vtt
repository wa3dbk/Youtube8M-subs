hello Andrew Scott on this video we're

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.180 
hello Andrew Scott on this video we're
going<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.660> be<00:00:09.750> doing<00:00:09.929> some<00:00:10.290> code<00:00:10.590> checking<00:00:11.040> on

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
going to be doing some code checking on

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.890 
going to be doing some code checking on
a<00:00:11.929> 2004<00:00:12.929> Subaru<00:00:13.920> Outback<00:00:14.130> with<00:00:14.790> an<00:00:14.940> h6<00:00:15.420> engine

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
a 2004 Subaru Outback with an h6 engine

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.769 
a 2004 Subaru Outback with an h6 engine
this<00:00:16.619> particular<00:00:17.119> vehicle<00:00:18.119> right<00:00:18.270> now<00:00:18.300> store

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
this particular vehicle right now store

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.779 
this particular vehicle right now store
in<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> couple<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.289> codes<00:00:19.529> one<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.400> an<00:00:20.520> engine

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
in a couple of codes one is an engine

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.840 
in a couple of codes one is an engine
fault<00:00:21.029> light<00:00:21.210> code<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.230> other<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.560> ABS<00:00:23.100> so

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
fault light code and the other is ABS so

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.070 
fault light code and the other is ABS so
we're<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.180> check<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.600> both<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.960> those

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
we're going to check in to both of those

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960 
we're going to check in to both of those
and<00:00:25.439> I'll<00:00:25.949> show<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.160> here<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.519> second<00:00:26.849> how

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
and I'll show you here in a second how

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.970 
and I'll show you here in a second how
to<00:00:27.000> connect<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.480> up<00:00:27.570> okay<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.560> you're<00:00:28.830> going<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
to connect it up okay so you're going to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.120 
to connect it up okay so you're going to
take<00:00:29.099> your<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.730> obd<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.630> scan<00:00:31.289> tool<00:00:31.560> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
take your can obd to scan tool and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.920 
take your can obd to scan tool and
you're<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.910> plug<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.270> over<00:00:33.510> here<00:00:33.780> on

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
you're going to plug it in over here on

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.709 
you're going to plug it in over here on
the<00:00:34.200> driver's<00:00:34.590> side<00:00:34.620> left<00:00:35.100> side<00:00:35.360> right<00:00:36.360> under

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the driver's side left side right under

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.200 
the driver's side left side right under
where<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.930> hood<00:00:37.260> latch<00:00:37.440> release<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
where the hood latch release is and it

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.780 
where the hood latch release is and it
plugs<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.750> there<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> ignition

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
plugs in there and you have the ignition

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.940 
plugs in there and you have the ignition
off<00:00:42.140> so<00:00:43.140> what<00:00:43.290> we're<00:00:43.379> going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.770> turn

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
off so what we're going to do is turn

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.650 
off so what we're going to do is turn
the<00:00:44.129> ignition<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.550> but<00:00:44.789> not<00:00:44.910> start<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.360> engine

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the ignition on but not start the engine

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.990 
the ignition on but not start the engine
and<00:00:45.780> then<00:00:46.079> we're<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.379> read<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> codes

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
and then we're going to read the codes

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.220 
and then we're going to read the codes
so<00:00:48.000> we're<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> we'll<00:00:49.110> be

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
so we're going to do that and we'll be

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.770 
so we're going to do that and we'll be
right<00:00:49.379> back<00:00:49.559> once<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.640> plug<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.449> device

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
right back once you plug in this device

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.720 
right back once you plug in this device
and<00:00:52.079> then<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.289> turn<00:00:52.530> your<00:00:52.710> ignition<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
and then you turn your ignition to the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.850 
and then you turn your ignition to the
on<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.360> start<00:00:54.809> position<00:00:55.289> all<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.559> way<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
on but not start position all the way to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.889 
on but not start position all the way to
the<00:00:56.129> ignition<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.760> you're<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> push

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the ignition on you're going to push

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.660 
the ignition on you're going to push
enter<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.980> going<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.160> go<00:00:59.280> through<00:00:59.489> all

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
enter and it's going to go through all

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.939 
enter and it's going to go through all
of<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.170> it's<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> make<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> handshake

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
of the it's going to make a handshake

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.490 
of the it's going to make a handshake
with<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.340> vehicle<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.030> then<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
with the vehicle and then it's going to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.080 
with the vehicle and then it's going to
read<00:01:04.949> all<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> faults<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:05.939> it

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
read all the faults and right now it

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.660 
read all the faults and right now it
shows<00:01:06.270> one<00:01:06.689> fault<00:01:07.020> code<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:08.130> we'll<00:01:08.310> read<00:01:08.520> that

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
shows one fault code so we'll read that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.039 
shows one fault code so we'll read that
code<00:01:08.880> well<00:01:09.119> write<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.390> down<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.659> go<00:01:09.750> look<00:01:09.930> it

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
code well write it down and go look it

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.780 
code well write it down and go look it
up<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.220> we'll<00:01:11.310> tell<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:11.610> that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
up and so then we'll tell you what that

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.850 
up and so then we'll tell you what that
is<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.750> fault<00:01:12.930> code<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.260> read<00:01:13.439> was<00:01:13.650> an<00:01:13.770> O

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
is so the fault code we read was an O

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.149 
is so the fault code we read was an O
400<00:01:14.460> which<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.000> an<00:01:15.119> EGR<00:01:15.450> valve<00:01:15.840> issue<00:01:16.170> are<00:01:16.710> just

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
400 which is an EGR valve issue are just

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.640 
400 which is an EGR valve issue are just
exhaust<00:01:17.729> gas<00:01:17.970> recirculation<00:01:18.509> issue<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.470> don't

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
exhaust gas recirculation issue we don't

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.560 
exhaust gas recirculation issue we don't
yet<00:01:19.830> know<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:21.180> some<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
yet know what it is but some of the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.179 
yet know what it is but some of the
possibilities<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> most<00:01:22.799> likely

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
possibilities and the most likely

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.969 
possibilities and the most likely
possibility<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.540> EGR<00:01:25.409> solenoid<00:01:25.950> has

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
possibility is that the EGR solenoid has

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.190 
possibility is that the EGR solenoid has
failed<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.030> we're<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> try<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> ohm<00:01:28.049> it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
failed so we're going to try to ohm it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.319 
failed so we're going to try to ohm it
out<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:29.189> at<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> same<00:01:29.610> time<00:01:29.820> we'll<00:01:30.060> look<00:01:30.180> at

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
out but at the same time we'll look at

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.690 
out but at the same time we'll look at
some<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.659> rubber<00:01:31.259> piping<00:01:32.159> that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
some of the rubber piping that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.030 
some of the rubber piping that
supposedly<00:01:33.210> goes<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.990> haven't<00:01:34.200> seen<00:01:34.500> it

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
supposedly goes to it I haven't seen it

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.060 
supposedly goes to it I haven't seen it
so<00:01:35.220> I'll<00:01:35.369> look<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.530> see<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.770> needs<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.040> be

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
so I'll look and see if that needs to be

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.569 
so I'll look and see if that needs to be
replaced<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.659> I'll<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.619> so

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
replaced and if so I'll do that and so

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.560 
replaced and if so I'll do that and so
right<00:01:41.790> now<00:01:41.820> I'm<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> use<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> 10

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
right now I'm going to use a 10

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.069 
right now I'm going to use a 10
millimeter<00:01:42.990> socket<00:01:44.390> six-point<00:01:45.390> socket<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
millimeter socket six-point socket and

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.710 
millimeter socket six-point socket and
remove<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.189> cover<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.759> we'll<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:48.600> we

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
remove this cover and we'll see what we

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.499 
remove this cover and we'll see what we
can<00:01:48.810> find<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.710> I'll<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.220> back<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:51.329> this

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
can find so I'll be right back at this

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.120 
can find so I'll be right back at this
point<00:01:51.780> we've<00:01:52.020> pulled<00:01:52.320> off<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.619> cover<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
point we've pulled off the cover and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.280 
point we've pulled off the cover and
we're<00:01:53.670> looking<00:01:54.180> around<00:01:54.450> inside<00:01:54.840> here<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.229> we

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
we're looking around inside here and we

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.170 
we're looking around inside here and we
found<00:01:55.500> something<00:01:55.950> interesting<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.820> found<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
found something interesting we found a

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.660 
found something interesting we found a
Frey<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.600> wiring<00:01:57.869> harness<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.130> get<00:01:59.549> to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
Frey and the wiring harness so to get to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.520 
Frey and the wiring harness so to get to
that<00:01:59.820> we're<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.990> pull<00:02:01.229> this

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
that we're going to have to pull this

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.880 
that we're going to have to pull this
box<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.600> I've<00:02:03.719> unplugged<00:02:04.259> what<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> think

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
box out so I've unplugged what I think

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.330 
box out so I've unplugged what I think
is<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> mass<00:02:05.340> flow<00:02:05.640> sensor<00:02:06.149> here<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:07.340> we've

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
is the mass flow sensor here and we've

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.919 
is the mass flow sensor here and we've
taken<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.759> two<00:02:08.910> bolts<00:02:09.179> out<00:02:09.360> these<00:02:09.629> are<00:02:09.750> 10

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
taken the two bolts out these are 10

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.960 
taken the two bolts out these are 10
millimeter<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.530> we've<00:02:11.280> taken<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.700> loose

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
millimeter and we've taken this loose

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.820 
millimeter and we've taken this loose
I'm<00:02:12.209> going<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.390> try<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.510> pull<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:12.989> box<00:02:13.379> off

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
I'm going to try to pull this box off

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.030 
I'm going to try to pull this box off
and<00:02:14.690> off<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.930> take<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.200> off<00:02:16.350> loose<00:02:16.650> here<00:02:16.920> as

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and off to take it off loose here as

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.160 
and off to take it off loose here as
well<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.550> see<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.060> we'll<00:02:18.690> take<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.020> out

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
well I can see and we'll take that out

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.630 
well I can see and we'll take that out
and<00:02:19.200> we'll<00:02:19.560> that'll<00:02:19.950> give<00:02:20.070> us<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.280> chance<00:02:20.310> to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
and we'll that'll give us a chance to

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.580 
and we'll that'll give us a chance to
get<00:02:20.730> underneath<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.390> see<00:02:21.960> what's<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.440> on

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
get underneath and see what's going on

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.010 
get underneath and see what's going on
and<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:23.250> we'll<00:02:23.640> come<00:02:23.880> back<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.060> tell<00:02:24.960> you

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
and then we'll come back and tell you

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.700 
and then we'll come back and tell you
what<00:02:25.140> we<00:02:25.260> found

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
what we found

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.710 
what we found
okay<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.430> at<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.700> point<00:02:26.970> we've<00:02:27.210> taken<00:02:27.480> off

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
okay so at this point we've taken off

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.940 
okay so at this point we've taken off
the<00:02:28.250> intake<00:02:29.250> plenum<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:30.410> we're<00:02:31.410> now<00:02:31.590> able<00:02:31.770> to

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
the intake plenum and we're now able to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.740 
the intake plenum and we're now able to
see<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.310> wiring<00:02:32.520> harness<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:33.180> we<00:02:33.300> noticed

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
see this wiring harness that we noticed

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.200 
see this wiring harness that we noticed
was<00:02:33.810> damaged<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:35.280> may<00:02:35.550> very<00:02:35.850> well<00:02:36.030> be

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
was damaged and this may very well be

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.210 
was damaged and this may very well be
the<00:02:36.360> reason<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.720> we're<00:02:36.960> having<00:02:37.140> EGR<00:02:37.920> fault

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
the reason that we're having EGR fault

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.250 
the reason that we're having EGR fault
codes<00:02:38.490> we<00:02:39.240> definitely<00:02:39.630> have<00:02:39.720> at<00:02:39.840> least<00:02:39.960> one

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
codes we definitely have at least one

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260 
codes we definitely have at least one
cut<00:02:40.560> or<00:02:40.740> broken<00:02:41.040> wire<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.580> then<00:02:41.730> one<00:02:41.970> frayed

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
cut or broken wire and then one frayed

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.210 
cut or broken wire and then one frayed
wire<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:43.140> I'm<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.470> make<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> repair<00:02:44.040> to

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
wire so I'm going to make a repair to

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.740 
wire so I'm going to make a repair to
this<00:02:44.310> harness<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:45.270> I'll<00:02:45.360> show<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.570> how

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
this harness and I'll show you how

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.900 
this harness and I'll show you how
that's<00:02:46.230> going<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.500> look<00:02:46.650> when<00:02:46.770> I'm<00:02:46.890> done<00:02:47.070> also

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
that's going to look when I'm done also

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.700 
that's going to look when I'm done also
wanted<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.150> make<00:02:48.300> note<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.810> each<00:02:49.170> plug<00:02:49.560> I

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
wanted to make note that each plug I

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.290 
wanted to make note that each plug I
pulled<00:02:49.980> off<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.310> get<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:50.580> thing<00:02:50.850> loose<00:02:51.060> I

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
pulled off to get this thing loose I

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.350 
pulled off to get this thing loose I
marked<00:02:51.630> with<00:02:51.810> marks<00:02:52.620> such<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.400> can<00:02:53.700> go

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
marked with marks such that we can go

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.050 
marked with marks such that we can go
back<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.600> find<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.260> appropriate<00:02:56.060> connector

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
back and find the appropriate connector

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.570 
back and find the appropriate connector
that<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.300> goes<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.080> we're<00:02:59.070> going<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.220> repair

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
that it goes to so we're going to repair

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.770 
that it goes to so we're going to repair
it<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.820> I'll<00:03:00.030> be<00:03:00.180> right<00:03:00.330> back

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
it and I'll be right back

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.630 
it and I'll be right back
at<00:03:01.320> this<00:03:01.470> point<00:03:01.770> what<00:03:02.010> I've<00:03:02.130> done<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.459> I've

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
at this point what I've done is I've

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.480 
at this point what I've done is I've
spliced<00:03:03.180> wires<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.410> have<00:03:04.560> put<00:03:05.010> heat<00:03:05.220> shrink

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
spliced wires and I have put heat shrink

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.490 
spliced wires and I have put heat shrink
on<00:03:05.580> them<00:03:05.730> where<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:05.910> could<00:03:06.270> really<00:03:06.959> difficult

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
on them where I could really difficult

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.070 
on them where I could really difficult
to<00:03:07.620> work<00:03:07.800> in<00:03:07.980> here<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.490> particular

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
to work in here on this particular

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.290 
to work in here on this particular
application<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.200> then<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.130> took<00:03:11.190> some<00:03:11.370> high

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
application and then I took some high

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.000 
application and then I took some high
very<00:03:12.750> high<00:03:12.870> temperature<00:03:13.260> RTV<00:03:13.770> room

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.759 
with cloth tape this is good for high
temperature<00:03:21.600> not<00:03:21.959> real<00:03:22.200> high<00:03:22.290> temperature

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
temperature not real high temperature

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.910 
temperature not real high temperature
but<00:03:22.950> it's<00:03:23.100> some<00:03:23.340> good<00:03:24.239> old<00:03:24.420> Volkswagen<00:03:24.920> cloth

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
but it's some good old Volkswagen cloth

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.949 
but it's some good old Volkswagen cloth
tape<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:27.000> should<00:03:27.180> be<00:03:27.209> able<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.450> sustain<00:03:27.630> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
tape so it should be able to sustain the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.150 
tape so it should be able to sustain the
temperatures<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.530> we're<00:03:28.650> going<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.800> see<00:03:29.040> in

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
temperatures that we're going to see in

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.560 
temperatures that we're going to see in
this<00:03:29.250> part<00:03:29.519> of<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.640> engine<00:03:29.940> compartment<00:03:30.420> and

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
this part of the engine compartment and

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.410 
this part of the engine compartment and
we'll<00:03:31.470> put<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.680> back<00:03:31.800> together<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.400> we'll<00:03:33.090> see

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
we'll put it back together and we'll see

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.810 
we'll put it back together and we'll see
what<00:03:33.570> happens<00:03:34.040> at<00:03:35.040> this<00:03:35.220> point<00:03:35.430> we<00:03:35.610> put

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
what happens at this point we put

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.060 
what happens at this point we put
everything<00:03:36.000> back<00:03:36.300> together<00:03:36.480> wires<00:03:37.470> all<00:03:37.860> been

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
everything back together wires all been

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.250 
everything back together wires all been
taped<00:03:38.459> up<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:39.150> whole<00:03:39.330> harness<00:03:39.660> with<00:03:39.900> cloth

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
taped up the whole harness with cloth

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.800 
taped up the whole harness with cloth
tape<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.830> we<00:03:41.640> actually<00:03:41.820> put<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.180> wire<00:03:42.420> tie<00:03:42.660> on

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
tape and we actually put a wire tie on

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.660 
tape and we actually put a wire tie on
it<00:03:42.840> also<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.410> further<00:03:44.040> secure<00:03:44.340> it

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
start the engine and see if it runs so

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.810 
start the engine and see if it runs so
I'll<00:03:52.500> be<00:03:52.620> right<00:03:52.739> back<00:03:52.890> once<00:03:53.340> we<00:03:53.459> get<00:03:53.580> into<00:03:53.730> the

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.599 

well<00:03:59.459> at<00:03:59.670> least<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.969> started<00:04:00.390> that's<00:04:00.659> good<00:04:01.609> so

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
we'll give it a test drive and see if

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.559 
we'll give it a test drive and see if
that<00:04:04.400> fixed<00:04:05.400> or<00:04:05.519> did<00:04:05.640> not<00:04:05.670> fix<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.209> EGR

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569
