I found Muppets cars I think this is the
first<00:00:26.490> wave<00:00:26.849> because<00:00:27.390> there's<00:00:27.570> only<00:00:27.720> three

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
first wave because there's only three

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.490 
first wave because there's only three
but<00:00:29.490> we've<00:00:30.359> seen<00:00:30.779> these<00:00:31.080> Muppets<00:00:31.619> cars<00:00:32.009> before
