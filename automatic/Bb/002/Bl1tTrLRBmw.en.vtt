00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:07.870
 Ishihara is one of the very much 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.040
 Yes it is raining today 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.820
 Reason to take outside even if my brother is at home just because it's raining 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.970
 I can only take pictures outside but yes 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.170
 Well that's better than outside 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.760
 This time 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.720
 I can not explain in ipad for a while 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:31.019
 To hit to become lucky 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:34.740
 I think I'm going to introduce it I heard that after all the car passes that sound me 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.290
 It is also subtle whether or not the voice of 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:43.690
 I coat rack it was through the rack I do not say the street 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:46.420
 I have my voice in the day car world by the way the track passes and near 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:52.450
 There are places where I'm a little worried 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:54.340
 Well technology news to me this time Yes Let's integration was worrisome to the 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.660
 Tinplate 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:02.350
 Now there is Princess Pretty, but the fourth one is 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.860
 In the twenty-two episode in immigration in the fact that appeared in 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.400
 Well sure 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.570
 Did What was cool if there is atmosphere 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.860
 usually 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:17.659
 Because é®­ 48 does not remember a little well so 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:23.359
 Certainly there isn't about 4 cool , so let's make it a halfway point and finally 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:26.810
 The fourth person appeared Well I did not think that I ended up with three people as it is 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:28.230
 From that early member 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.550
 What 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.890
 Road 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:42.040
 Pretty is like a pattern to join and also one person at a time 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:49.270
 Not only Kuriki percentage than some of the pre-cure if 4 of special effects Toka there, et al sides 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:55.780
 There is a lot of cost costing, but with the technique to keep the region from getting tired 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:57.050
 I think there are some, but I guess it will also increase the variation of the technique for that amount 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:03.440
 that 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.220
 How to keep audiences likely to leave audience ratings that are likely to go away 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.490
 I suppose 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.300
 Yes 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.710
 I agree 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.710
 Well, for now 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.840
 I go likely 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.020
 It sounds too good to be 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.170
 now 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.990
 what 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.810
 I am my own 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.319
 I'd have taken any 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:30.220
 It's a room, but I'm taking it at my own apartment 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:33.840
 Pedestrian traffic is now ready You're Amina's quite dark and many 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.980
 It would be nice if I could hit my face on that day 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:42.510
 If you point the camera at the machine for the day, your face will be brighter 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:47.040
 I 'm a little sorry or a, but I also like amateurs and I do not know 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.560
 It's kind of normal, I think it's a bit rushed today because people went through for a while 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.849
 It's like standing up and it's like a single word 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.440
 I'm a strange person, and I could take a story in a unified way when I looked around from that 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.670
 Hey! 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.200
 Well in Well it became a fellow this time 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.520
 I wonder if that booklet or good people are aware of it 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.740
 Yes 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.740
 That original 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:19.160
 It's a dark lease without green, so I've got a lot of head shots recently so much 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.960
 Memory is, but I'm thin 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.080
 Yes 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.760
 Nezawashiro Miyuki is the second generation 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.630
 Yes you You have devoted a voice 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.100
 That 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:34.480
 That 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:39.910
 Twilight did not open after that, there was a door to my younger sister 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.660
 It is about the seduced is to tempted been in enemy had moved have 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.350
 How is this time 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:49.450
 That's why I raised it and converted it. 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.960
 It seems that you say yes and became a friend a 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.770
 And my friend's name is cure 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.990

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:01.280
 It is a link 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:04.490
 I think there is a place to play with the main character a little 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.670
 I think for a moment 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.000
 And that day Scarlett 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.850

 It enters with something like an old boy 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:32.830
 That's right, did that data come in? 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:34.810
 There are some subtleties, but even pre-machines are children for that generation 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:40.480
 And that 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.470
 Also adults of more than 20 generations from the adult of it seems to be to target it to the official is 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.570

 There is a guard something 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:16.200

 What does the end look like ? 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:49.020
 There is a place to be worried about 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:53.699
 Well yes Even if you upload videos while worrying about no more attention to the principal of the talk power 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:57.120
 Because I think that I wonder if not it does not lead so much I want to end with around here 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:02.560
 Well then uh- I went to school this time also appeared 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:06.320
 The following learning book umbrella Tenshibo appearance and Kato enzyme have the same words too 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.240
 It is often a mistake had very 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.849
 How was that 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.790

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:19.240
 one along li 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:22.510
 Well this is pretty well going to be damaged 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.180
 But it's really interesting 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:32.040
 Say Tsutaero the fun 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:38.580
 When the little Well I do I do not fully convey the extreme clumsiness of Ndea but Well some man 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:42.009
 I think also that it is quite important to try to continue that you have seen until the end not like 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:45.580
 I hear I also that much 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:50.750
 I don't really like that kind of acting , but I say this 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:56.630
 It is really apologetic to all of you, but that collection of surrounding sword squadron Ninninger 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:57.770
 It has a little luck more of if You're a little acting and plays voice is ne of red cherry red 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.850

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:17.380
 Yes it is important to continue Continuity is a power 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:21.340
 Will it force Nari you do not have that but or continue not it important 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:25.600
 I wonder the other was a little when something like a post this every day of my 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.980
 When I used myself, it looked like a castle, and it was in a good shape. 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.150
 It is not such a thing 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.729

 I think that it will be a post from the room because next time it is the floor on Monday byte no longer 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.590
 I do not think if you look at it It is good
