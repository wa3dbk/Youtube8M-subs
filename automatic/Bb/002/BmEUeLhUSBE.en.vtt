00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
to a department and I think after today

it'll be a little bit easier in my mind

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.309 
it'll be a little bit easier in my mind
because<00:03:55.450> I<00:03:55.630> don't<00:03:55.870> have<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.080> worry<00:03:56.230> about

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
because I don't have to worry about
