00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
this it won't be online with just like

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.700 
this it won't be online with just like
it<00:00:51.000> when<00:00:51.210> grand<00:00:51.449> theft<00:00:51.600> auto<00:00:51.750> 6<00:00:52.199> comes<00:00:52.500> out

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.810 
yeah I'm assuming that grand theft auto
just<00:00:55.469> moves<00:00:55.680> along<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.489> whatever

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
just moves along with it like whatever

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.610 
just moves along with it like whatever
city<00:00:57.210> six<00:00:57.660> introduces<00:00:58.260> yeah

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
city six introduces yeah

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.439 
city six introduces yeah
grand<00:00:58.859> theft<00:00:58.980> auto<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.609> adds<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.059> city

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
grand theft auto it just adds that city

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.240 
grand theft auto it just adds that city
yeah<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.260> will<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.649> able<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> hop<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
yeah so you will be able to hop in a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.850 
yeah so you will be able to hop in a
plane<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.789> fly<00:01:03.030> from<00:01:03.300> Los<00:01:03.449> Santos<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.619> new

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
plane and fly from Los Santos to the new
