an<00:00:30.210> excellent<00:00:30.660> job<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.590> capturing<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
an excellent job of capturing the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.870 
an excellent job of capturing the
likeness<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.690> they<00:00:34.290> had<00:00:34.530> from<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> cartoon

um<00:00:38.030> he<00:00:39.030> has<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.390> same<00:00:39.660> hair<00:00:40.079> which<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.890> don't

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
um he has the same hair which I don't

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.819 
um he has the same hair which I don't
know<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.940> kind<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.360> reminds<00:00:42.690> me<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:43.140> something

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
know it kind of reminds me of something

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.690 
know it kind of reminds me of something
like<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.960> Joker's<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> Z<00:00:47.370> from

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
like one of the Joker's with a Z from

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.229 
like one of the Joker's with a Z from
Batman<00:00:48.059> Beyond<00:00:48.360> would<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.840> or<00:00:49.079> something<00:00:49.500> um

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
Batman Beyond would have or something um

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.720 
Batman Beyond would have or something um
it<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.449> doesn't<00:00:52.170> scream<00:00:52.590> traditional<00:00:53.399> Joker

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it just doesn't scream traditional Joker

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.790 
it just doesn't scream traditional Joker
but<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.510> guess<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.050> whole<00:00:55.440> idea<00:00:55.469> of

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
but I guess I was the whole idea of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
but I guess I was the whole idea of
redesigning<00:00:56.460> them<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.879> guess<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> when<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.420> keep

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
redesigning them I guess I when I keep

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.180 
redesigning them I guess I when I keep
him<00:00:57.899> fresh<00:00:58.289> mix<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.160> up<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.430> bit<00:00:59.460> um<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.980> guess

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
him fresh mix it up a bit um so I guess

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.450 
him fresh mix it up a bit um so I guess
it's<00:01:02.340> ok<00:01:02.879> um<00:01:03.260> one<00:01:04.260> thing<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:04.830> about<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it's ok um one thing I do like about the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.730 
it's ok um one thing I do like about the
redesign<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> mouth<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:07.470> really

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
redesign is the mouth they really

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.630 
redesign is the mouth they really
captured<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.920> craziness<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
captured like the craziness in it I

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.200

actually<00:03:52.650> let's<00:03:53.099> do<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.310> little<00:03:53.580> comparison

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
actually let's do a little comparison

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.740 
actually let's do a little comparison
between<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.410> Joker<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.250> Batman<00:03:56.819> Joker

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
between the Joker and the Batman Joker

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.380 
between the Joker and the Batman Joker
is<00:03:59.239> definitely<00:04:00.239> shorter<00:04:00.780> than<00:04:00.959> Batman<00:04:01.530> um

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
is definitely shorter than Batman um

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.720 
is definitely shorter than Batman um
that's<00:04:03.390> probably<00:04:04.019> accurate<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.160> cartoon

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
that's probably accurate to the cartoon
