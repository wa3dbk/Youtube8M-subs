00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
light strips concluded which is good but

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.010 
light strips concluded which is good but
like<00:02:09.009> I<00:02:09.130> said<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.580> more<00:02:09.819> exciting<00:02:10.450> part<00:02:10.720> is

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
like I said the more exciting part is

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.740

an<00:02:15.580> hour<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:19.200> guess<00:02:20.430> some<00:02:21.430> kind<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.700> ok

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
an hour this is I guess some kind of ok

an hour this is I guess some kind of ok
remote<00:02:23.110> controller<00:02:23.530> right<00:02:23.740> here<00:02:23.800> infrared<00:02:24.670> so

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
remote controller right here infrared so

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.600 
remote controller right here infrared so
this<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.690> how<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.340> communicates<00:02:27.340> with<00:02:27.430> your

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
this is how it communicates with your

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.210 
this is how it communicates with your
remotes<00:02:27.940> as<00:02:28.180> well<00:02:28.450> as<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:29.080> guess<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.010> lights

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
remotes as well as I guess the lights

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.479 
remotes as well as I guess the lights
plug<00:02:30.520> in<00:02:30.670> here<00:02:31.030> it's<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.569> power<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.310> all

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
plug in here it's the power this is all

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.890 
plug in here it's the power this is all
new<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.760> me<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.090> I'm<00:02:34.300> going<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.510> learn<00:02:34.600> as<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:34.870> go

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
guess for the animation and of course

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.199 
guess for the animation and of course
the<00:03:28.780> power<00:03:28.989> button<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.350> shut<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.739> on<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:31.000> off

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209
