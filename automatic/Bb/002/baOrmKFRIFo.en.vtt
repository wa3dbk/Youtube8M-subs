00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.760
 today we are going to talk about what nephrology is 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.460
 nephrology is the medical specialty 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.679
 that studies the anatomy of the kidneys and 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.599
 the functions that these have have 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.610
 as a field the prevention diagnosis 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.340
 and the treatment of diseases of the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.580
 kidney and its consequences that in summary 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.740
 is the arterial hypertension the appearance 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.720
 of blood in the urine and proteins in 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.699
 urine urine infections 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.500
 diseases that produce stones in the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.040
 kidney diseases that produce 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.210
 inflammation in the kidney or nephritis 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.489
 diseases in other organs and in the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.800
 immunity and the treatments that affect 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.210
 also to the kidneys treatment of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.270
 consequences of renal function 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.730
 altered anemia lack of carbonate 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.309
 phosphorus increase tracking the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.020
 chronic kidney disease treatment 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.809
 with dialysis both in its modality of 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.300
 peritoneal dialysis as hemodialysis 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.770
 immediate and immediate prior attention 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.170
 of the kidney transplant tract 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.850
 the nutrition of the renal solution the 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.110
 performing kidney biopsy for the 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.199
 diagnosis of kidney diseases 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.020
 and the realization of accesses in veins 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.420
 for performing hemodialysis and for 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.430
 last special techniques for the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.500
 Blood purification is a 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.990
 specialty that covers a wide field 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.390
 of the medicine he demands in the prologue 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.700
 extensive and solid training not only in 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.740
 which it is typical of his specialty but 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.900
 also of all those specialties 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.290
 with which those relationships 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.160
 tightly 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.650
 cardiology and digestive endocrinology 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.240
 etcetera on the other hand hypertension 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.190
 part of the day to day in the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.950
 prologue occupy an important part of 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.810
 his care activity for it in the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.330
 most of the hospitals the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.590
 hypertension units are found 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.329
 within the nephrology services 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.039
 nephrology is a specialty 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.979
 perfectly differentiated from neurology 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.840
 which is a surgical specialty and that 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.219
 encompasses all aspects surgical 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.859
 of the kidney and genital tract 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.210
 masculine we can say that there are only two 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.100
 diseases in which there may be 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.590
 overlap with are the infections of 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.110
 urine and the field of lithiasis 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.450
 urinary 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.149
 the nephrology of the san pedro hospital 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.130
 we can say that following the implementation 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.660
 march of the kidney transplant program 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.400
 in April 2011 has managed to cover all 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.760
 the service portfolio of the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.460
 specialty is also the service of 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.410
 reference nephrology of the community 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.290
 autonomous with assistance 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.959
 during the 24 hours a day is 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.240
 organized in health care areas like 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.520

 in patients seen by others 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.570
 specialties and that require the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.340
 assessment by a nephrologist and 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.680
 the area of kidney transplantation where 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.690
 find the specific rooms 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.569
 for the operation of transplants 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.219
 kidney 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.200
 there is also the consultation area 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.629
 external services where the 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.359

 autoimmune disease consultation 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.400
 advanced chronic kidney where he attends 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.579
 to patients with kidney disease 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.500
 chronic to prepare them for their 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.719
 future entry into dialysis and the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.299
 as much as you can in the third is 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:24.769
 entry into dialysis but more possible and 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.780
 the waiting list query and 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.760
 kidney transplant where the 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.139
 assessment of patients to be 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.180
 included in the waiting list of

 transplant and perform the control 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.099
 newspaper of transplanted patients 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.470
 Finally, it contains the dialysis area 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.659
 for both outpatient and
