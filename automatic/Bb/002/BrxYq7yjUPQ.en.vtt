00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.340
 hello everyone welcome to my kitchen with 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.710
 help from the christine compaño I'm going to 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.260
 teach how to make a master recipe 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.530
 super traditional a good terrine of 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.150
 foie gras here we have a good foie gras 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.730
 we want with him very simple to me 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.470
 personally I like to put it in a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.990
 water with the same salinity as water 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.689
 Sea ie 8% 80 grams of salt 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.060
 per liter of water because to introduce 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.440
 the piece 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.930
 maybe even for a little ice 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.600
 we can directly 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.920
 cut it into pieces align it cook it and 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.650
 It will be just as rich that blood 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.450
 it merely has an aesthetic question 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.250
 this is the big lobe we can 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.110
 use it to finish too but it's 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.080
 the typical the typical part of the foie gras 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.340
 which is used to roast I go to 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.170
 use this part because right now 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.630
 is the least to have to give and will be 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.060
 easier to wait good to cut it like 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.340
 when we are cutting some potatoes 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.200
 for a homemade stew, we'll do what 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.250
 same if we do it this way 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.570
 those arteries will appear and we can 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.290
 remove them comfortably but as you 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.270
 I say if you have no mania if it is for home 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.060
 to the mess 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.130
 we will break in these pieces the kisses and 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.000
 so we do this purge in seawater in 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.220
 salt water 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.540
 when we leave the piece will be important 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.060
 keep it in mind because we will already have 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.920
 started to salt the piece what 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.930
 we pepper the outside 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.470
 and we will add the pepper as I have 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.350
 said 12 grams per kilo of salt and about 2 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.360
 of pepper and 1 down because already by 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.729
 custom asks the dot so 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.090
 minus my dot and we'll add peppers 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.280
 but until here is perfect we have a 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.039
 mold type cloak mold teeny monda 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.689
 of terrine we will put a double layer must 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.700
 have film this transparent paper of 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.759
 kitchen that holds cooking and 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.490
 we will arrange the outside by pressing it against 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.850
 the edges is a filter temperature 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.850
 slowly 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.590
 and reached that temperature with the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.320
 Heart of the product block the 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.170
 temperature to cool and let stand is 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.260
 It ends now that I will introduce 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.350
 my kitchen erbol will take about 15-20 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.040
 minutes in cooking and once cooked 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.240
 Look at the cold, leave it at least six hours 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.710
 as I tell you we stopped the machine 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.710
 put 700 milliliters 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.269
 I have placed 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.900
 so we can separate the water 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.840
 of micro with the place up 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.530
 we will place 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.530
 the lid 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:50.020
 and we will mark again the beginning 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.420
 steam cooking program 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.420
 it already marks us 100 degrees 20 minutes 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.520
 we have the rash and we will send it to 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.140
 cold 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.410
 finished the melting of our fusion 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.640
 companion we just have to stop and 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.640
 we will take our terrine 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.200
 very carefully 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.030
 let's say and we'll see if the cooking is 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:20.010
 precise and here we would take it to the cold 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.989
 logically it will take about four or five 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.120
 or six hours at this party and yesterday 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.310
 prepare one so you can see the result 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.920
 final we have done with this pedro 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.650
 simple ximénez give a little 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.659
 heat 40 50 degrees maintained so that 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.000
 the alcohol evaporates and we have 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.769
 approached a saucepan with a little 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.629
 this powder that is agar agar agar agar is 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.730
 an algae sure many already know 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:45.030
 with which gelatins are obtained 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.069
 hot to boil 90 or 100 degrees 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.510
 and pass it to a mold like this and 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:54.980
 we will obtain a jelly at the good time 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.370
 very interesting with all the flavor 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.520
 del pedro ximénez what can we cut 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.730
 and how is it that we will have this jelly 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.370
 to taste it as simple as I think 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.920
 that there's nothing better than toast 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.950
 freshly made does not crush me directly 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:19.320
 between the terrine I'm going to break it and 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:21.350
 over the bread without more scruples is 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.990
 the type of elaboration that there is 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.470
 enjoy it with agar agar de pedro 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:32.670
 ximénez we can cut perfect dice 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.930
 with all the flavor of pedro ximénez so 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.529
 simple as cutting a few small 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.709
 dice 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:41.610
 that will accompany these terrine cakes 

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:44.250
 foie good salt flakes 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.199
 of a current pumpkin that will give you a 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.759
 sweet spot there are products that are expensive 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.009
 because they are scarce because we do not know 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.080
 elaborate it if often if we have a 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.400
 good grade a good raw material with 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.710
 a kitchen robbery like this is so 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.389
 simple to make a great product of the 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.819
 gastronomy as is the terrine of outside 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:03.840
 without any difficulty with same and with 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:06.650
 a result you already see perfect 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.650
 and 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.509
 and 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.059
 with a minimum of dedication and help 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:34.460
 of the course in escort moulinex 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:38.259
