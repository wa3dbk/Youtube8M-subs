gram maybe a 5 gram or even a 3 gram
serving<00:01:36.180> size<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:38.450> why<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.509> mine<00:01:39.890> 26.5<00:01:40.890> grams

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
serving size so why is mine 26.5 grams

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.190 
serving size so why is mine 26.5 grams
and<00:01:41.640> there's<00:01:42.479> six<00:01:43.259> grams<00:01:43.770> or<00:01:44.009> 5<00:01:44.220> grams<00:01:45.200> well

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
and there's six grams or 5 grams well

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.840 
and there's six grams or 5 grams well
they're<00:01:46.799> trying<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.220> tell<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.729> it's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
they're trying to tell you that it's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.749 
they're trying to tell you that it's
because<00:01:48.149> their<00:01:48.560> formulas<00:01:49.560> are<00:01:50.340> what<00:01:50.640> they

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
because their formulas are what they

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.280 
because their formulas are what they
call<00:01:50.960> concentrates<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:53.720> what<00:01:54.720> they<00:01:54.869> mean<00:01:55.110> by

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
call concentrates and what they mean by

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.030 
call concentrates and what they mean by
concentrate<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.189> somehow<00:01:57.020> they've

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
concentrate is that somehow they've

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.149 
concentrate is that somehow they've
magically<00:01:59.540> magically<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.680> don't<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:02.009> any

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
magically magically and I don't know any

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.490 
magically magically and I don't know any
science<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.880> would<00:02:03.030> allow<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.509> as<00:02:04.409> a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
science that would allow this as a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.730 
science that would allow this as a

scientist but they've magically somehow

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.070 
scientist but they've magically somehow
taken<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> equivalent<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.300> my<00:02:09.479> twenty<00:02:09.840> six

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
taken the equivalent of my twenty six

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.280 
taken the equivalent of my twenty six
point<00:02:10.259> five<00:02:10.440> grams<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.550> shrunk<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.300> down<00:02:12.330> into

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
point five grams and shrunk it down into

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.559 
point five grams and shrunk it down into
six<00:02:13.890> grams<00:02:14.280> serving<00:02:14.760> size<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.330> does<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
six grams serving size and it does the

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.250 
six grams serving size and it does the
same<00:02:15.750> thing

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
same thing

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.030 
same thing
well<00:02:16.379> no<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.220> does<00:02:17.819> that's<00:02:18.180> why<00:02:18.680> most<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.920> you

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
well no it does that's why most of you

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.649 
well no it does that's why most of you
find<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.579> when<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.819> take<00:02:20.970> these<00:02:21.180> products

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
find that when you take these products

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.220 
find that when you take these products
you<00:02:22.260> have<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.620> take<00:02:22.799> two<00:02:23.099> even<00:02:23.849> three<00:02:24.230> servings

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
you have to take two even three servings

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.390 
you have to take two even three servings
to<00:02:26.129> get<00:02:26.310> any<00:02:26.489> real<00:02:26.730> results<00:02:26.939> and<00:02:27.480> even<00:02:27.629> then

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
to get any real results and even then
