00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello how are you all this is a video 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:08.559
 tutorial where are we going to see how we can 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.110
 apply the effect to our photographs 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.970
 of aguirre that consists simply of 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.689
 blur the edges of our 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.759
 photographs I've also applied three 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.730
 effects as an example so you can see 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:23.289
 the first is a superposition of 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.710
 colors a whole color as they can 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.079
 observe is a dark blue we can 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.419
 also apply what is degraded by 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.509
 example I'm going to deactivate and right here what 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.000
 come 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.520
 and finally to add what is 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.250
 an overlay of motives 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.680
 in yes the steps are very simple this 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.150
 it's a remake to what is a 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.760
 video tutorial that I did a long time ago 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.840
 time but at that time I was with the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.520
 cs2 version so I also wanted 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.250
 answer many questions that I 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.350
 they did by messages where they tell me how 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.530
 is that we can apply this effect to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.210
 the current versions then it is very 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.210
 simple so let's start 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.820
 comes the first step is to unlock 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.340
 our layer that is obviously our 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:24.100
 photography we are going to use move to give 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.210
 double click just on this padlock and 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.210
 let's put photography 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.420
 let's see ok perfect unlocked 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.180
 well right here in the box 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.580
 create new layer let's press control 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.710
 we create new layer and this new layer 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.570
 empty will be created below the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.270
 Photography 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:52.270
 or we can create new layer we go down 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:54.850
 and we're going to put a name in background 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.939
 and we deactivate our photography by 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.270
 a few seconds and fill with the boat 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.020
 paint our background black 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.450
 we activate 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.039
 now we are located in the tool 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.039
 rectangular frame 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.879
 here we have a box where we 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.730
 announces the value of pixels for what 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:21.440
 it's the fading we're going to 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:25.380
 apply then 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.910
 we will quickly create a framework 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.180
 let's go to the selection invest 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.379
 we suppress 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.319
 and we have the edges not blurred what 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.900
 which is not good 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:47.450
 ok then let's go to 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.450
 and increase the value of pixels maybe 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.750
 120 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.150
 let's create a framework again 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.540
 in square shape 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.870
 from size by pressing shift higher 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.890
 let's have our exact square 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.860
 all right 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.890
 ok as you can see the corners it 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.850
 they have turned something curved which we 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:20.540
 indicates that we are on track and the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.850
 edges are going to blur ok for a 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.240
 free handling of our selection let's 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.400
 to locate us in selection menu selection 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.490
 transform the selection in this way 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.190
 we are as I say driving 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:39.810
 freely our selection 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:44.070
 that we have drawn in this way more or 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.730
 except there I would see it right there 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.849
 okay 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:54.400
 let's select investing we suppress 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.170
 even there we have it we have our 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.319
 blurred border that is what we are 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.230
 looking obviously 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.079
 we press control to select 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.349
 we are located in the background we do double 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.349
 click 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.990
 ok in the layer style we are going to 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.230
 locate us either in the overlay of 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:18.310
 colors maybe we want a whole color 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:20.230
 that it is therefore the edges which remains 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.980
 very good yes 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:27.010
 or maybe the gradient proposition 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:31.210
 we can here give degraded to our 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.490
 taste or you can create yours maybe 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.690
 and as you can see it gives life to our 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.479
 photography well we can apply a 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.280
 degraded anyone or if they are not 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.310
 convinced they are going to superimpose 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.930
 reason and then a motive is applied 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.620
 anyone in this case I already have one 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.199
 defined and this sevilla what remains 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.590
 very well how can you observe then 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:58.810
 more value of pixels for what is the 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.960
 fading the edges are going to 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.560
 blur even more then I will do 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:09.780
 a setback to this because I want 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.780
 apply over another image I will place 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:17.449
 just this place 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:22.080
 ok then I know that you have to validate 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:24.300
 this and right stylize layer ready 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.150
 well we can also use here I 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.229
 I forgot what the framework tool is 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.560
 elliptical we are going to give a value of 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.090
 hundred 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:40.410
 30 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:42.600
 we make a path like that you already know for a 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.009
 free handling of our selection and not 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:49.480
 selection transform selection 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:53.630
 Right click we can even deform 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:56.420
 that simple, great, but in this case 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:01.730
 I'll leave it like this then we'll pick 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:04.820
 invest we suppress and equal there what 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:08.480
 we have to select control of it 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:11.300
 They know and ready then and I repeat to 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.730
 more value of pixels for what is the 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.920
 fading the edges are going to 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.510
 blur even more and in this way we can 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.900
 create an effect or something abstract 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:24.370
 functional images and so on then 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:28.139
 I hope I have solved your doubts 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.139
 and play a little with this effect 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:34.689
 how could they have noticed the steps are very 

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:37.329
 simple and well that would be all up 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:39.459
 the next with more tutorial videos there 

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:42.599
 they were commenting punctuate and that 

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:42.599
 it would be all goodbye
