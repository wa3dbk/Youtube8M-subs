00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.070
 here I just arrived at the cellar of turckheim remains to know who will win 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.730
 claude makélélé suspended 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.980
 the barrel feet of the quality of holder 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.230
 normal all the pleasure is for us it's a good opportunity to do 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.920
 discover in its structure thank you for not presenting its doors 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.670
 to discover the structure 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.150
 she accounted for less can quote kate were studying 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.880
 these stories are activated 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.140
 so if a rider who has acquired m the youngest card of Aquitaine more 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.130
 with whom they years 70 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.480
 and also the most dynamic 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.310
 more than coffee site which by these decreases of the last years has 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.840
 made today a unified cold of 220 but the vise 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.760
 and therefore to the largest before these of France 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.180
 so the sector is composed of 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.009
 the 500 car years 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.189
 day before yesterday even more when we party all the north gironde 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.420
 for me up to acts 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.250
 I turn in charente-maritime hunting will learn% and pessac for the famous 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.100
 mouse as long as members are spread pretty much on leaving them 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.140
 especially that this surface 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.150
 and these structures is composed of five different unification sites so different 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.090
 players 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.220
 auroux viticulturists input on these sites for peace that are for me 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.490
 we are really close we join so explain me a little principles 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.840
 dr 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.400
 the cooperative is several winemakers who has pooled 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.190
 so in fact 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.770
 the principle of cooperation is a man a voice 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.500
 so this is the basic principle or so all its members since a 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.540
 cooperative cd members or deputies to social all members 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.270
 are even entitled to the cozy decision for all decisions are made in 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.460
 common and for that allows us to have meetings for us seeing your and 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.890
 500 beds to 500 people who have banded together to have the means to 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.499
 efficient wine making to have powerful commercial means 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.929
 it's all human technique 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:20.999
 in the momentum 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.719
 performance technicians that the case in point that it's important also for 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.129
 innovation research 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.659
 and she knows the ways that the winegrower man alone can not have 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.199
 and it's unbecoming a member once this summer 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.219
 indeed a small winemaker has as much importance at the game level 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.719
 serious case decision making such as this is today on on the 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.249
 cooperation 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:43.509
 in this small or big c 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.779
 if a voice that counts so shortly before speaking is the rest level 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.739
 votes the 500 people 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.209
 but also and it is the majority that matters most 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.420
 the european surface contours the lack of social capital more than a cooperation 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.780
 if the share capital of an amount including these different levels is 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.439
 a company that has shareholders there it's really the 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.139
 the owners who are adherents of the preparation that 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.460
 make the decisions can you make us laugh 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.119
 more in detail 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:10.899
 opening the cuvée excellence quality first is the 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:14.839
 conviviality it is a major contribution in bottle generally it is for 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:16.429
 have a good time it's nice 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:21.019
 we are at the bottom of this blow there in this area there command room such a 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.230
 experience to do this 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.339
 no statistics 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:27.469
 it's a good way for the blogger who gets out of the bottle by the way it's a 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:28.479
 unforgettable moment 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.149
 This is where the complexion goes 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.149
 which goes very well since it is an acquired and fruity but not panic 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.309
 as long as it allows 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:41.729
 rogers amanpour for women who prefer fruity wines and 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:45.319
 insolvency because it is an asset that stands out 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:49.139
 he digs the bus of white wine spring and humus and who rather prefer 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.439
 the matais that a little bit harder like so much excess will pass enough 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:53.279
 aged in casks 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:56.239
 percent in the housing channel that stood out 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.569
 and it's going to calm down a bit for apple all the way through the meal 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.429
 go for percent and entry to cheese dessert so that's a plan 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:05.589
 who goes everywhere 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.669
 kim who hires is very nice 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.129
 because we catch the ball respected like that and not in the name of a flower in 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.519
 see boris second behind the camera these great greenhouse 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.150

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.760
 in the cooperative cellar cac 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.559
 unlike pebbles a voice 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:34.699
 and the big ones 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.330
