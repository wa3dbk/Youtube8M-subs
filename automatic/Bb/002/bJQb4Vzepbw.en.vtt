 five years 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.840

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.579
 Hey Brenda, and we would like us to 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.790

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:59.390

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.670
 the time so criticized aha for all 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.650
 social networks that those of us know 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.739
 up close we know the person who is a 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.780

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.230

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.540
 their 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.430
 they do not touch me or they say something to me and I 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.620
 I'm the one who turned me on instead of him 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.709
 what my character is more volatile and have 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.320
