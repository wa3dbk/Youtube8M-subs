 expressly wrong was losing the puck there 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:16.320
 accounted for this dangerous lag was from 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.150
 the top is not extremely unpleasant for sometimes 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.070
 panda would return its movement to the cake 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.320

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.920
 one 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.480
 myself 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.400
 one more throw 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.890
 from the position of the left back to pick up from 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.519
 hitters this is daniel soup of three else 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.490

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.400
 21 for the most part in his first match 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.980
 continental hockey league 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:15.840
 different wright ober 24 toronto number 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:20.060
 Maple Leafs and now this episode 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.060
 Looks like day Byrd is still 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:30.990
 and probably overdid it on companies 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:37.860
 will be recorded a year before our company I 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:41.430
 hit ktap 11 l and then the gate and the operas in 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.580
 previous season played for Toronto as well 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.580
 of course 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.910
 anyway 21 well here's the second half 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.979
 match turns out more efficiently and 1 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.650
 goal and we waited almost two periods here in 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:05:01.560

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:04.380
 Well, here are the emotions here and everything in 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.449
 the full staff is a little smaller 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.080
 ten minutes they have 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:12.120
 to level the score in the Fran match 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.550
 pushes casts as soon as enters 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.210
 zone and three throws in a row and third 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:23.759
 finally the lion still scores this one 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:26.580
 Mashka removed his army along the left 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:31.789

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:35.689
