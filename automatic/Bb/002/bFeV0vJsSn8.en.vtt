ps3<00:00:32.610> controller<00:00:33.710> decided<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> feel

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
ps3 controller decided I like the feel

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.819 
ps3 controller decided I like the feel
of<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.180> 360<00:00:36.690> controller<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.559> well-made

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
of the 360 controller it's a well-made

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.500 
of the 360 controller it's a well-made
controller<00:00:40.340> solve<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.520> come<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> ad

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
controller solve this come up on the ad

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.630 
controller solve this come up on the ad
on<00:00:43.170> Amazon<00:00:45.410> it<00:00:46.410> wasn't<00:00:46.770> best<00:00:46.980> by<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> time<00:00:47.489> so

aspects<00:00:55.670> mainly<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:57.000> its<00:00:57.149> design<00:00:57.680> yeah<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
aspects mainly for its design yeah the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.389 
aspects mainly for its design yeah the
360<00:00:59.520> designs<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.180> not<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.920> designs<00:01:01.920> for

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
360 designs but not for that designs for

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.830 
360 designs but not for that designs for
that<00:01:02.760> triggers<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:05.210> tributes<00:01:06.210> are<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:06.600> like

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
that triggers the tributes are not like

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.679 
that triggers the tributes are not like
360<00:01:07.700> two<00:01:08.700> spaced-apart<00:01:09.470> okay<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.920> r1<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.790> r2

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
360 two spaced-apart okay the r1 and r2

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.620 
360 two spaced-apart okay the r1 and r2
will<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:14.549> trigger<00:01:14.850> buttons<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.420> two

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
will do trigger buttons are just two

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.499 
will do trigger buttons are just two
spaced-apart<00:01:16.850> uncomfortable<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.330> hard

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
spaced-apart uncomfortable and it's hard

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.090 
spaced-apart uncomfortable and it's hard
to<00:01:18.720> switch<00:01:19.290> between<00:01:19.470> them<00:01:21.500> these<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.680> noisy

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
to switch between them these are noisy

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.760 
to switch between them these are noisy
and<00:01:23.490> unresponsive<00:01:26.540> they<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.689> no<00:01:27.900> play<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and unresponsive they have no play the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.850 
and unresponsive they have no play the
plane<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.579> ridiculously<00:01:30.409> loose<00:01:31.409> it's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
plane just like ridiculously loose it's

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.020 
plane just like ridiculously loose it's
mushy<00:01:32.250> these<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.960> top<00:01:34.170> ones<00:01:34.439> are<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.030> don't

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
mushy these the top ones are just don't

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.310 
mushy these the top ones are just don't
even<00:01:36.210> call<00:01:36.360> buttons<00:01:36.750> because<00:01:36.930> they're<00:01:37.170> just

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
even call buttons because they're just

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.140 
even call buttons because they're just
mush<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.579> don't<00:01:38.759> feel<00:01:38.850> like<00:01:38.909> you're

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
mush and you don't feel like you're

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.300 
mush and you don't feel like you're
pushing<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.509> button<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> that's<00:01:44.040> where<00:01:44.250> it

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
pushing a button so that's where it

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.359 
pushing a button so that's where it
feels<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.670> design<00:01:44.990> quality<00:01:48.680> is<00:01:49.680> these<00:01:50.100> trigger

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
feels on design quality is these trigger

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.969 
feels on design quality is these trigger
buttons<00:01:50.759> especially<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.799> out<00:01:52.950> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
buttons especially this one right out of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.670 
buttons especially this one right out of
the<00:01:53.130> box<00:01:53.570> good<00:01:54.570> top<00:01:54.840> button<00:01:55.229> works<00:01:55.409> your

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
the box good top button works your

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.200 
the box good top button works your
better<00:01:55.860> works<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.640> soon<00:01:56.820> as<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.030> push

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
better works but as soon as you push

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.410 
better works but as soon as you push
forward<00:01:57.649> it<00:01:58.649> doesn't<00:01:58.950> work<00:01:59.100> so<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.240> an

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
forward it doesn't work so it's like an

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.359 
forward it doesn't work so it's like an
old<00:02:00.540> controller<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.229> used<00:02:01.619> for<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.860> lot<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
old controller that used for a lot and

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.730 
old controller that used for a lot and
the<00:02:02.880> sales<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.200> comes<00:02:04.350> right<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:04.619> of

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
the sales this one comes right out of

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.419 
the sales this one comes right out of
the<00:02:04.829> box<00:02:05.009> family<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:06.320> did<00:02:07.320> only<00:02:07.439> buy<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:08.009> it

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the box family I did only buy one it

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.809 
the box family I did only buy one it
could<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.819> d<00:02:09.000> think<00:02:09.270> so

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
could be a d think so

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.170 
could be a d think so
not<00:02:10.539> going<00:02:10.689> to<00:02:10.749> be<00:02:10.810> as<00:02:10.899> harsh<00:02:11.109> on<00:02:11.319> this<00:02:11.499> but<00:02:15.180> so

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
not going to be as harsh on this but so

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.429 
not going to be as harsh on this but so

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
buttons to push down a run sprint Nelly

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.229 
buttons to push down a run sprint Nelly
everything<00:02:22.719> so<00:02:25.079> also<00:02:26.519> this<00:02:27.519> is<00:02:27.730> not<00:02:27.879> too<00:02:28.030> bad

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
everything so also this is not too bad

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.929 
everything so also this is not too bad
because<00:02:28.950> your<00:02:29.950> directional<00:02:30.340> times<00:02:30.579> because

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
because your directional times because

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.750 
because your directional times because
it's<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.150> little<00:02:31.389> bit<00:02:31.510> better<00:02:31.689> than<00:02:31.840> 360<00:02:32.760> but

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
it's a little bit better than 360 but

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.750 
it's a little bit better than 360 but
that's<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.359> feature<00:02:34.930> that's<00:02:35.139> that's<00:02:36.069> about

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
that's a feature that's that's about

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.369 
that's a feature that's that's about
positive<00:02:37.239> than<00:02:37.389> anything<00:02:39.569> I'd<00:02:40.569> say<00:02:40.959> the

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
positive than anything I'd say the

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.759 
positive than anything I'd say the
casein<00:02:41.889> is<00:02:42.280> horrible<00:02:43.269> because<00:02:43.599> it's<00:02:44.230> not<00:02:44.530> like

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
casein is horrible because it's not like

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.429 
casein is horrible because it's not like
