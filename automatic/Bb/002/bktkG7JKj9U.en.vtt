00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.600
 is to arrive at that hour 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.849
 speculate to know what will happen to 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.800
 and we will talk here about 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.080
 the teams on the teams that will be 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.360
 on the sides of the civil war tony's team 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.289
 stark and steve rogers captain team 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.760
 America 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.320
 Look, we have an algorithm for people. 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.850
 has a whole history of analysis that the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.230
 people make people take google to 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.090
 The google tool we use is 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.949
 time to have the guesses and the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.470
 people have been competing here on the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.789
 civil war compositions who are from 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.009
 side of captain america who is from 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.440
 The man's side of faith is obvious that you have 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.440
 the side of the hotel captain america in 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.270
 the other side you have the iron man right 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 the side of captain america you already know 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.350
 who will be the winter soldier the man 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.059
 ant because it was established from the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 of the movie the ant man and also missing 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.059
 the falcon and the hawk that are the faces are 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.300
 the brothers 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.420
 hawk is yours I have blogs as your 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.309
 great idol and such and has already established that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.079
 He has a very very close relationship. 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.600
 It's curious that on the other side you have 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.309
 also has a friend who is the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.350
 combat and have the beginners have a man 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.659
 ant on one side of captain america and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.610
 I think we can have a newbie. 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.799
 Iron man's side can be a mere 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.570
 Oh well, they should get something from the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.799
 gas according to the comics I do not think 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.689
 secret identity is 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.009
 important but in the comics you know 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.990
 that the spider man walks there pro 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.850
 side of the Iron Man and Tony makes a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.650
 clothes all I own technological 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.840
 I think they can take advantage of this. 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.119
 in this movie taking dodo rumor that the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.140
 His clothes will be homemade and I think so. 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.790
 that they will create a uniform 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.960
 especially to differentiate between 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.549
 other spider man movies 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.460
 they will create a new uniform for him 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.009
 and then otoni and the spider man we will have 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.270
 closer relationship even 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.310
 are talking is that it will appear in the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.680
 Spider- Man Only Movie That He Can 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.200
 to fix the pro-boy stage she does not 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.369
 is here then it has an all approach 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.320
 of the two that I think will influence 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.229
 in grace and then we have the spies 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.930
 archer hawk and black widow to where 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.219
 they go to which side you think 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.270
 It will be that the widow goes to the 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.979
 Captain for at least looks at the end 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.840
 it looks like she's going to be 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.460
 side of the dragon she from that one 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.079
 public statement telling you 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.770
 do not meddle in the things that we do 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.209
 the players 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.760
 dependent as if she speaks a business 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.650
 that is it assumes that she'll be the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.180
 side of the record she will stay 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.670
 side of the superheroes but she has a 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.250
 business and the release of the secrets 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.900
 Talks there at the end of the winter soldier is 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.510
 that the secrets of china are exposed 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.150
 Her secret may also come may come 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.280
 then I imagine that the government 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.049
 may have a way of controlling widow 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.910
 and put it what it would be 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.410
 interesting to note more balanced 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.610
 is also so balanced that it will not 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.379
 get everyone there will captain 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.000
 no one left over there with the tender man 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.500
 spider in one and a remarkable combat command 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.239
 do nothing because it is because of these 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.739
 problems that she has with the past is 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.700
 likely to be on the side of the 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.410
 Tony Stark 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.060
 another woman who should not be left 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.040
 tony stark's side problems would not do 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.540
 sense is the scarlet sorceress 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.329
 because it has a past also of 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.709
 problems with it and you put in a 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.970
 woman on each side that it is obvious that 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.349
 guys think so can not stay 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.090
 all right, right? 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.799
 but they are not the only ones because 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.870
 emily vancamp is confirmed in the film 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.569
 She'll make us 13 of her shield. 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.040
 returns and people assume that it can 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.540
 stay there on the captain america 's side is 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.329
 that they have a love story despite 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.280
 in civil war she makes a deal there 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.750
 in the comics against him and such but they 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.150
 That's why it 's even more interesting. 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.709
 they put there near him 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.630
 I think she has to stay close to him. 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.340
 to establish the romantic relationship and 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.980
 she stays on the other side will be very 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.780
 to get weird, a very 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.579
 separated I think she should stay 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.870
 so on their side is because it is one of 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.389
 balance this balance 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.400
 in her is what the black widow with her 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.650
 against the widow there you have or the other 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.709
 side so the hawk flying car against 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.870
 vision vision certainty the side of tony 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.389
 final stark to consider jarvis then 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.650
 You may have slight imbalance of power I 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.720
 I think the Tony Stark side is 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.819
 interesting because if they should be 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.989
 same as bookmarking 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.639
 this move of the imbalance of powers 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.260
 interesting because, for example, 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.730
 people are going to share the spies 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.130
 the archer hawk he will stand on the side 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.510
 of the captain to oppose the widow and you 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.090
 stay on this side here with all the 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.260
 have a Tony has vision has a 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.060
 Spiderman we can not forget 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.709
 of the black panther that can be associated 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.060
 also everyone is listening to say one time the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.069
 black panther would have its own 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.290
 motivations and such but I've already heard 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.540
 Also different things he would 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.850
 on the doctor's side to be here then already 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.410
 It's hard to know exactly what's going on. 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.090
 happen to him I think I would do more 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.889
 you sense it their 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.530
 motivations geographically in the 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.000
 graphically this is instead of detonating the 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.729
 bic is that it will stand on the side of the 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.710
 captain instead of doing them as we 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.389
 comics he stays there he knows if 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.669
 abstaining from conflict 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.620
 he could get involved both sides right 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.330
 left in the hand with the captain came out in hand 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.350
 with Tony Stark is also a 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.270
 possibility 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.979
 now have two other components quit 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.910
 of the avengers that will not appear 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.810
 in this film that's why we do not 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.419
 told me here 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.979
 the touch went to the water and probably the 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.900
 People are going to know something about the tower. 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.580
 agbar ok we said at the end of the 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.740
 avenger was another mistake that was 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.180
 sent there inside a ship knows there 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.310
 God, where no one knows who's in the 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.930
 Earth sit in space and it really is 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.360
 stay out of this moment when it would be 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.860
 a fucking imbalance stay then 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.690
 To recap, we should have more 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.080
 people fighting on the side of captain america 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.690
 because they are less powerful and less expensive 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.669
 on the side of the iron man who are more 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.289
 powerful but it's interesting because 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.970
 the most powerful they are half the law 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.010
 they are the force they have to 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.020
 exercise their strength and then the guys who are 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.650
 they may be majority but they are more 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.050
 they need to be the medicine they have 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.639
 in terms of type you twist to the 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.370
 captain america after all calls 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.430
 captain america civil war and not the 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.760
 iron man 4 civil war 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.979
 So you're going to have to cheer on the side of the 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.720
 captain america pev side the guys who 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.940
 they are telling me they are understood 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.139
 in this situation, imagine the tone is there 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.490
 at the same time the participation of man 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.260
 spider I think it will be more discreet 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.789
 because it was a teenager who is not 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.830
 pepac different from the grace of 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.510
 comics that is a guy who is already adult 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.610
 already makes its decisions and such 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.200
 This kid knows I do not think he 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.030
 will weigh so much in the civil war 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.620
 because then it's a teenager I still 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.120
 I think that more Tony Stark is going to have 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.789
 he will have that figure of 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.650
 technology knows much of what 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.810
 we saw that the child was a soldier 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.400
 Winter and Captain America had 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.680
 that confrontation then I think that tone 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.240
 will be repeated in the civil war that 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.760
 people will see the captain's team with a 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.950
 A more manual thing 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.260
 knows a close fight and tony stark 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.090
 but if she sends his drones 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.500
 maybe so I think it's going to be a 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.240
 Technology clash against 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.810
 sorry but no more drone also 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.060
 People want to see guys there on their hands there. 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.680
 the German will not they will get out on the hand that I 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.490
 I do not think I 'll have it or I do not think it will. 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.230
 to be banked would give but the guys with 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.600
 much more features and the guys with less 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.880
 resources because he looks as if he
