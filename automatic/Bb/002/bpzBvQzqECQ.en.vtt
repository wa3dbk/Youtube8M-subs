00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.429
 good morning to all today I present a 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.620
 pocket gentleman produced by the company 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.509
 Italian 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:19.880
 fantoni that produces since 1980 with 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:24.390
 very high quality standards 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.119
 the knife in question the duel 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.470
 we start as usual from the packaging 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.410
 knife that comes in a small one 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.809
 cardboard box where they come from 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:40.620
 given the name of the knife contained 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:46.440
 and the company logo on the part 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:50.100
 found side indicated the type of 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.930
 wood used for the sleeve my in 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.149
 reality i co.co.co bolo 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.730
 here is a small mistake that I had 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.730
 was however reported by the seller 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:09.240
 then inside the box 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:18.570
 we find the knife we ​​are going to 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:28.110
 to see a poor man in leather very soon 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:33.810
 nice and a little certificate that 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:41.570
 contains notes on the inside 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:46.610
 warranty is in the back 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.610
 shows the knife specifications 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.930
 the sheath is well built 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.130
 the finishes are good 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:12.220
 shows the logo on the front 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:16.320
 company in the back 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:21.520
 instead we find the writing made in italy 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:25.450
 that given the times I would say it does not hurt the 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.840
 knife is well considered inside 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.230
 of the sheath there is no risk does not give the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:37.660
 feeling that it can come out 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:40.810
 accidentally it is a typical small farm with 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.720
 a vocation typically gentleman from 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.510
 be able to carry in the back pocket of the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:51.430
 pants or even better in the pocket 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.010
 of your jacket well done and much 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:00.640
 my cute as you see already shaped 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:05.410
 since I have already used it we come to the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:16.209
 knife that is a very small object 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:19.810
 interesting has been drawn on a 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.540
 other model the 9 city designed by 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.810
 bob log eles and produced for several years 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:31.630
 and still from the ghosts this one 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.730
 represents an Italian interpretation 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.269
 with a vocation a little more gentleman if 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.329
 we want as I said mine and handle of 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:45.900
 kokopolo I like a lot and darken me 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.900
 so I chose this material here 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.390
 are also produced with tour sleeve e 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.380
 olive wood in snake food or wood 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.380
 of snake 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:07.080
 and in briar on the back you see the two 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:11.800
 wooden concepts the two folders 8 born 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:19.989
 and a steel guard that also serves 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:25.900
 from a contrast spring the opening like a 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:29.190
 gentleman who respects himself in the most 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:37.540
 classic of traditions and with two hands 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:48.430
 with a stop halfway the knife 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:54.310
 open and a total of 16 cm long 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:59.880
 2.3 mm blade has a profile like 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:02.980
 see foot chips on one side 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:08.020
 reported the company name 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:14.040
 producer fantoni indeed be found 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.040
 even a small one falling for the opening 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:23.290
 on the other side the type of steel 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.950
 used which in this case is 19 c 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.950
 27 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.240
 see on the handle this was created 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:44.449
 small ledge that stabs open 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:47.750
 acts as a guard and closed knife goes to 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.970
 hide the blade heel that 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.520
 often results in these types of knives 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:56.810
 and it is an interesting solution because 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:06:00.070
 gives a nice aesthetic impact 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:03.699
 at least I particularly liked it 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.699
 this small detail 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:13.789
 another thing I point out to you is that 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:19.000
 stopping at mid-race in closing 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:21.770
 clearly prevents there being any 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.389
 accidental closure by the blade 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:30.889
 is favored by a small dentinho in the 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:34.690
 which but to fit the spring that 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.690
 I hope you can see it here 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:55.930
 very nice and well gentleman knife 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:55.930
 sharp too 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:10.130
 I hope you enjoyed the review 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.130
 see you soon with the next video
