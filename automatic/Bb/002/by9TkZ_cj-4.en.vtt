00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.279
 hi loves how are you waiting 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.560
 you are living a super nice days 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.330
 and today I bring you a video in which you 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.610
 I'm going to teach you how to do something super super 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.560
 economic because this is what most 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.420
 you have asked for the only thing I have had 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.720
 what to buy is this kinder egg on 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.700
 rest already had the materials at home 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.620
 you are going to have to use a little note 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.990
 to live someone that you 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.600
 You wish , and that is how we will get you 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.410
 I'm going to show you what you need 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.449
 first of all these are the materials 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.100
 I have taken two knives but at 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.990
 final I used more this you are 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.200
 watching a little note 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:44.050
 the egg of course and then I have 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.770
 used a lighter this is larguito 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.830
 so I do not stay long and then a tape 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.540
 to decorate this is always optional 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.030
 cotton I had at home that later 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.580
 I've done it in tiny circles 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.210
 as you are seeing there and a little bag of 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.880
 plastic you're going to start undoing what 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.370
 which is the envelope that carries the go 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.410
 kinder egg and this so you're going to have 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.350
 have a lot of patience so that 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.180
 then you look good at the time of later 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.950
 put everything back in its place for 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.770
 that you do not notice much that we have 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.770
 altered a little bit and well there I am 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.630
 well with a lot of patience trying 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.990
 separate the edges there I have it already 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.150
 separated and then what we have 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.610
 what to do is put the egg on a 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.729
 hard surface because we're going to start 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.220
 passing a sharp knife has to 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.680
 be of this type do not use those of 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.730
 saw teeth because you can 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.740
 load a little bit or the bow kinder 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.150
 nothing then from this brand or from 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.980
 any other what happens that I have caught 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.120
 this is because I like it most and yes 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.340
 that my boy also likes 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.280
 very much then so I take advantage for 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.190
 give him something 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.860
 and nothing with a lot of patience you go 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.470
 passing the little knife by the edges that 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.229
 if you do not begin to clarify it because I 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.320
 you are going to load but slowly it goes 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.929
 is sliding and so all the time up 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.870
 that in the end he will access the solo and 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.390
 will open as you are seeing clean 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.280
 a little bit the edges with the works of 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.490
 chocolate 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.730
 and nothing we open next our 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.070
 our name is the piece is for 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.230
 save the toys that led to that 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.170
 now I have forgotten what it is called and 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.600
 we take out the toys that he carries or he 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.690
 we leave them inside and nothing we put the 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.850
 little card that is romantic yes that if 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.240
 are you going to use for valentine or something 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.460
 special and then what are you going to 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.820
 need is like I said the lighter 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.190
 and bring the flame a little bit but never 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.450
 stuck to the chocolate because then it 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.580
 is going to is retirement 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.060
 whole chocolate and it's going to stay very 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.700
 ugly we only want that the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.470
 edges that in a tad melted to 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.200
 that are going to stick with the other piece 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.420
 of chocolate we are only going to spend the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.810
 lighter for a while for one of the fingers 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.599
 I do not know how to say one of the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.140
 sides of the chocolate as you see not both 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:21.540
 of the egg and we put them together and 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.410
 we tighten a little so they are 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.560
 well and then immediately stick it 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.920
 only you are going to have to do is 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.640
 take your covers and put inside the 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.830
 egg and start again to join them this 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.500
 it's super easy and super simple but what 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.660
 you have to do with a lot of patience 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.510
 so that it stays well I have decided 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.069
 this is super optional decorate it with the 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.180
 these balls that you are seeing from 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.310
 cotton and inside the bag I put 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.010
 also the egg so that it is in the middle 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.769
 and on the sides so that it stays 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.019
 in the middle as I said method some 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.940
 cotton balls I think there is more 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:08.220
 nice I give nothing and simply not 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.459
 inside you can put what you give the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.370
 win to me is that I did not like it very much 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.960
 this to give some texture and such and 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.690
 I have decided to use them 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.880
 it's cotton but they're always ideas and 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.520
 all this can be modified the way 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.610
 that you like most of course 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.120
 used a little of these for a gift 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.980
 I used the red color of course 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.250
 since we are on some dates like this very 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:38.100
 romantic and also because it matches with 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.460
 the great google kinder yes I 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.940
 I used some scissors to give it a 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.820
 little bit of shape and then to have 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.070
 also a little more strip I've 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.990
 match one of good the two to this 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.130
 split in half as you are seeing 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.380
 to a cut and already shot of them you already know 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.290
 there are two on each side is super easy 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.900
 nothing this is the result I hope that you 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.480
 like you see I bring you something very very 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.140
 economic and see you in the next 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.950
 video with a lot of ease pass it 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.950
 well chao
