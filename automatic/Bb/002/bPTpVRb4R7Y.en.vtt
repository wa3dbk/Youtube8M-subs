that reading a novel can transport you

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.290 
specifically they saw long-term changes
in<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.810> bilateral<00:02:31.520> somatosensory<00:02:32.520> cortex

thinking<00:02:37.830> about<00:02:37.980> jumping<00:02:38.220> can<00:02:38.819> cause<00:02:39.000> the

thinking about jumping can cause the

thinking about jumping can cause the

same neural activity as actually jumping
it's<00:02:41.489> almost<00:02:41.850> like<00:02:42.150> their<00:02:42.360> brains<00:02:42.630> were

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
it's almost like their brains were

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.570 
it's almost like their brains were
living<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.350> actions<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.010> lead<00:02:44.160> character

living the actions of the lead character

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.699 
living the actions of the lead character
but<00:02:44.820> Mike<00:02:45.000> does<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.660> mean<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:45.870> if<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.260> read

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
but Mike does this mean that if I read

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.020 
but Mike does this mean that if I read
about<00:02:46.860> someone<00:02:47.370> doing<00:02:47.580> something<00:02:48.000> like

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
about someone doing something like

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.780 
about someone doing something like
shooting<00:02:48.870> arrows<00:02:49.200> or<00:02:49.410> doing<00:02:49.620> kung<00:02:49.830> fu<00:02:49.860> then

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
shooting arrows or doing kung fu then

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.520 
shooting arrows or doing kung fu then
would<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:50.970> be<00:02:51.150> better<00:02:51.390> prepared<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:52.080> do<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.410> in

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
would I be better prepared to do it in

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.530 
would I be better prepared to do it in
real<00:02:52.739> life<00:02:52.800> just<00:02:53.040> by<00:02:53.430> reading<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.910> possibly

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
real life just by reading it possibly

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.490 
real life just by reading it possibly
hmm

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
hmm

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.229 
hmm
so<00:02:55.800> in<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.950> movie<00:02:56.160> The<00:02:56.250> Matrix<00:02:56.280> when<00:02:56.790> neo<00:02:56.970> goes

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
so in the movie The Matrix when neo goes

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.330 
so in the movie The Matrix when neo goes
into<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.569> simulated<00:02:58.080> training<00:02:58.470> system<00:02:58.830> he

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
into that simulated training system he

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.699 
into that simulated training system he
was<00:02:59.459> really<00:02:59.850> just<00:02:59.930> stimulating<00:03:00.930> his<00:03:01.050> mind

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
was really just stimulating his mind

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.770 
was really just stimulating his mind
I<00:03:01.800> guess<00:03:02.190> his<00:03:02.819> mind<00:03:03.239> could<00:03:03.540> have<00:03:03.660> been

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
I guess his mind could have been

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.080 
I guess his mind could have been
preparing<00:03:04.230> his<00:03:04.500> body<00:03:04.739> as<00:03:04.980> well<00:03:05.160> that's<00:03:05.880> pretty

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
preparing his body as well that's pretty

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.500 
preparing his body as well that's pretty
cool

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
cool

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.460 
cool
