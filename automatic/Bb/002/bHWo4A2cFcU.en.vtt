00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:08.120
 I believe we can say that the proof 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.400
 of the labyrinth has been completed e 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.910
 too early to say but could 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.000
 be the key to everything we can give 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.260
 start at phase two 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.260
 welcome to the burned area 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.290
 the outside world is held together by a 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.590
 very thin thread 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.240
 beyond this door yours will begin 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.230
 new lives 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.720
 there is not only the won 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.600
 what do you remember about memories I remember that 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.149
 they sent me to the labyrinths I saw 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.250
 die friends in front of my eyes and 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.550
 you don't want to understand what it is from 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.440
 understand why it happened I need to 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.120
 know which side you're on 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.150
 they are hiding something like you do 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.190
 to know if they lied we are never 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.089
 fled was all part of the plan 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.089
 what they want from us 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.380
 hamas you do n't like in the maze not 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.040

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.040
 day out there 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.990
 what the hell 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.620
 the choices you make will determine the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.620
 course of a humanity 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.770

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.460
 I would say that now we are giving cinematography 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.080
 for granted that it will be an action and kind 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.119
 that the actor will be looking for someone 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.220

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.760
