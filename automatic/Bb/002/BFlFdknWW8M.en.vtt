multi-role<00:02:21.300> tech<00:02:21.540> demonstrator<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
multi-role tech demonstrator is the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.110 
multi-role tech demonstrator is the
Science<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:22.860> Technology<00:02:22.950> phase<00:02:23.580> that's

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
Science and Technology phase that's

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.300 
Science and Technology phase that's
going<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.540> inform<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.500> requirements<00:02:26.070> for<00:02:26.190> the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
going to inform the requirements for the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.280 
going to inform the requirements for the
future<00:02:26.580> vertical<00:02:26.730> lift<00:02:27.090> program<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:28.110> when<00:02:28.230> you

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
future vertical lift program so when you

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.450 
future vertical lift program so when you
look<00:02:28.410> at<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.590> medium<00:02:28.890> class<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.310> aircraft

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
look at that medium class of aircraft

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.520 
look at that medium class of aircraft
you<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:30.210> utility<00:02:30.780> aircraft<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.380> our

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
you have utility aircraft like our

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.440 
you have utility aircraft like our
demonstrator<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:32.970> also<00:02:33.150> have<00:02:33.330> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
demonstrator is we also have the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.690 
demonstrator is we also have the
potential<00:02:33.810> for<00:02:33.990> attack<00:02:34.470> aircraft<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.370> meirin

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
potential for attack aircraft and meirin

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.270 
potential for attack aircraft and meirin
eyes<00:02:35.790> dare<00:02:36.030> craft<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.250> 1/12<00:02:38.250> scale

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
eyes dare craft so this is a 1/12 scale
