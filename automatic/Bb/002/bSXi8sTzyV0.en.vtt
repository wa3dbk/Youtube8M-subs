the multi-layer technology that we'll
see<00:00:48.500> a<00:00:48.530> little<00:00:48.710> bit<00:00:48.860> more<00:00:48.920> when<00:00:49.100> I<00:00:49.160> hit<00:00:49.280> some

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
see a little bit more when I hit some

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.400 
see a little bit more when I hit some
drivers<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:49.940> some<00:00:50.150> some<00:00:50.660> ions<00:00:50.930> but<00:00:51.320> you've

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
drivers and some some ions but you've

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.530 
drivers and some some ions but you've
got<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.650> earthing<00:00:51.980> cover<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.790> you<00:00:53.239> see<00:00:53.420> with

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
got the earthing cover that you see with

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.939 
got the earthing cover that you see with
the<00:00:53.600> pro<00:00:53.780> B<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.019> I'm<00:00:54.080> gonna<00:00:54.199> hit<00:00:54.320> a<00:00:54.379> few<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.650> few

the pro B so I'm gonna hit a few a few

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.119 
the pro B so I'm gonna hit a few a few
six-footers<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.059> just<00:00:56.510> sell<00:00:56.720> it<00:00:56.900> feels<00:00:57.170> I<00:00:57.500> may

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
six-footers and just sell it feels I may

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.920 
six-footers and just sell it feels I may
have<00:00:58.220> been<00:00:58.309> about<00:00:58.610> left<00:00:59.150> edge<00:00:59.390> on<00:00:59.629> this<00:00:59.750> one

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
have been about left edge on this one

how it sounds but that feels don't feel
clicky<00:01:10.580> or<00:01:10.700> hard<00:01:10.940> it<00:01:11.090> just<00:01:11.119> feels<00:01:11.509> feels<00:01:11.869> soft

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
clicky or hard it just feels feels soft

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.930 
clicky or hard it just feels feels soft
feels<00:01:12.470> like<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:12.890> pro<00:01:13.250> V<00:01:13.460> some<00:01:14.210> another<00:01:14.420> one<00:01:15.940> see

feels like a pro V some another one see

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.980 
feels like a pro V some another one see
if<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:17.090> can<00:01:17.210> get<00:01:17.330> three<00:01:17.600> out<00:01:17.720> of<00:01:17.750> three<00:01:18.050> that's

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.690 

not<00:01:23.990> bad<00:01:24.140> that's<00:01:24.289> three<00:01:24.560> out<00:01:24.679> of<00:01:24.710> three<00:01:25.009> feel

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
not bad that's three out of three feel

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.639 
not bad that's three out of three feel
soft<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.270> doesn't<00:01:26.300> feel<00:01:26.750> hard<00:01:27.050> doesn't<00:01:27.500> feel

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.010 
soft it doesn't feel hard doesn't feel
clicky<00:01:28.039> just<00:01:28.490> very<00:01:28.789> much<00:01:28.940> like<00:01:29.149> a<00:01:29.179> pro<00:01:29.539> V<00:01:29.690> so

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
clicky just very much like a pro V so

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.779 
clicky just very much like a pro V so
I've<00:01:30.110> given<00:01:30.320> myself<00:01:30.410> about<00:01:30.800> a<00:01:30.830> 30-yard<00:01:31.460> pitch

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
I've given myself about a 30-yard pitch

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:32.889 
I've given myself about a 30-yard pitch
and<00:01:31.970> I'm<00:01:32.030> actually<00:01:32.149> gonna<00:01:32.360> use<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.630> lob<00:01:32.869> wedge

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
and I'm actually gonna use a lob wedge

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.840 
and I'm actually gonna use a lob wedge
as<00:01:33.259> well<00:01:33.440> just<00:01:33.890> writing<00:01:34.100> it<00:01:34.399> a<00:01:34.460> little<00:01:34.700> bit

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
as well just writing it a little bit

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.490 
as well just writing it a little bit
harder<00:01:35.149> than<00:01:35.240> what<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:35.450> would<00:01:35.570> do<00:01:35.869> normally<00:01:36.110> a

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
harder than what I would do normally a

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.290 
harder than what I would do normally a
green<00:01:37.070> these<00:01:37.250> are<00:01:37.399> quite<00:01:37.610> soft<00:01:37.970> we've<00:01:38.179> got

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
green these are quite soft we've got

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.940 
green these are quite soft we've got
quite<00:01:38.509> a<00:01:38.569> damp<00:01:38.810> day<00:01:39.020> as<00:01:39.170> well<00:01:39.349> so<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.740> am

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
quite a damp day as well so I am

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.669 
quite a damp day as well so I am
expecting<00:01:40.580> it<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.789> stop<00:01:41.000> fairly<00:01:41.539> quick<00:01:41.869> let's

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
expecting it to stop fairly quick let's

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.990 
expecting it to stop fairly quick let's
see<00:01:42.860> how<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.039> performs<00:01:43.429> or<00:01:43.729> so<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.030> feels

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.460 

ripped<00:01:50.000> into<00:01:50.209> that<00:01:50.479> one<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.750> pitched<00:01:51.050> full

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
ripped into that one it pitched full

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.589 
ripped into that one it pitched full
pitch<00:01:51.830> about<00:01:52.039> a<00:01:52.099> foot<00:01:52.399> past<00:01:52.700> pulled<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.539> a

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
pitch about a foot past pulled it a

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.109 
pitch about a foot past pulled it a
little<00:01:53.780> bit<00:01:53.989> and<00:01:54.140> it's<00:01:54.259> finished<00:01:54.560> about<00:01:55.119> on

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
little bit and it's finished about on

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.639 
little bit and it's finished about on
that<00:01:56.420> line<00:01:56.690> it's<00:01:56.959> finished<00:01:57.259> probably<00:01:57.560> about

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
that line it's finished probably about

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.460 
that line it's finished probably about
three<00:01:58.220> feet<00:01:58.459> further<00:01:58.729> on<00:01:59.060> them<00:01:59.239> there<00:01:59.539> the

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
three feet further on them there the

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.229 
three feet further on them there the
weight<00:02:00.679> pitched<00:02:01.039> but<00:02:01.550> I<00:02:01.610> did<00:02:01.759> ports<00:02:02.060> like

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:02.239

let's<00:02:02.479> try<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:02.869> hit<00:02:03.319> a<00:02:03.349> slightly<00:02:03.830> better

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
let's try and hit a slightly better

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.510 
let's try and hit a slightly better
pitch<00:02:05.030> let's<00:02:05.300> try<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.539> get<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.660> decent<00:02:06.020> lie

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
pitch let's try and get a decent lie

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.910 
pitch let's try and get a decent lie
I'll<00:02:07.520> boot<00:02:07.700> alright<00:02:08.590> trying<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.649> one<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:09.830> bit

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
I'll boot alright trying that one a bit

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.949 
I'll boot alright trying that one a bit
more<00:02:10.250> on<00:02:10.429> there<00:02:10.759> online<00:02:13.450> again<00:02:14.450> drove<00:02:14.720> into

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
more on there online again drove into

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.540 
more on there online again drove into
that<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.410> as<00:02:15.530> well<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:15.739> I<00:02:15.980> tried<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.250> play<00:02:16.520> it

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
that one as well so I tried to play it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.949 
that one as well so I tried to play it
with<00:02:16.670> plenty<00:02:16.879> of<00:02:17.030> speed<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.450> was<00:02:17.569> a<00:02:17.629> good<00:02:17.810> one

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
with plenty of speed that was a good one

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.750 
with plenty of speed that was a good one
I'll<00:02:18.349> show<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.920> reasons<00:02:19.250> as<00:02:19.400> well<00:02:19.550> in<00:02:19.700> a

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
I'll show you the reasons as well in a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.309 
I'll show you the reasons as well in a
second<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.270> one<00:02:20.390> was<00:02:20.480> quite<00:02:20.690> close<00:02:20.989> its

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
second that one was quite close its

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.500 
second that one was quite close its
finished<00:02:21.650> about<00:02:21.890> right<00:02:22.700> Eric<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.180> picture

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
finished about right Eric and it picture

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.240 
finished about right Eric and it picture
about<00:02:23.660> two<00:02:23.900> foot<00:02:24.140> short<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.650> it's<00:02:24.770> finished

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
about two foot short and it's finished

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.790 
about two foot short and it's finished
probably<00:02:25.760> about<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:25.970> foot<00:02:26.060> past<00:02:26.510> as<00:02:27.319> well<00:02:27.530> so

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
probably about a foot past as well so

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.640 
probably about a foot past as well so
try<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.520> fight<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:29.030> try<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.330> find<00:02:29.480> another

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
try and fight to try and find another

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.070 
try and fight to try and find another
decent<00:02:30.650> light<00:02:31.420> trying<00:02:32.420> at<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:32.629> third<00:02:32.870> one

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
decent light trying at this third one

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.070 
decent light trying at this third one
close<00:02:33.379> as<00:02:33.650> well<00:02:36.310> straight<00:02:37.310> up<00:02:37.459> in<00:02:37.610> Oh<00:02:37.989> hit<00:02:38.989> the

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
close as well straight up in Oh hit the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.710 
close as well straight up in Oh hit the
pin<00:02:39.260> as<00:02:39.379> well<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:39.770> I'll<00:02:39.890> just<00:02:40.040> show<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.280> those

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
pin as well so I'll just show you those

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.070 
pin as well so I'll just show you those
I'll<00:02:42.050> try<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.410> zoom<00:02:42.680> in<00:02:42.890> as<00:02:43.010> well<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:47.080> feel

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
I'll try and zoom in as well so feel

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.960 
I'll try and zoom in as well so feel
wise<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.560> did<00:02:48.770> actually<00:02:48.920> feel<00:02:49.280> good<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.730> felt

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
wise it did actually feel good it felt

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.540 
wise it did actually feel good it felt
soft<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:50.540> also<00:02:51.020> felt<00:02:51.500> quite<00:02:51.710> solid<00:02:52.250> as<00:02:52.370> well<00:02:52.460> at

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
soft it also felt quite solid as well at

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.710 
soft it also felt quite solid as well at
the<00:02:52.610> same<00:02:52.760> time<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:53.090> didn't<00:02:53.240> feel<00:02:53.390> clicky

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
the same time we didn't feel clicky

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.090 
the same time we didn't feel clicky
right<00:02:54.290> let's<00:02:54.440> have<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.590> go<00:02:54.710> with<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:54.920> driver

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
right let's have a go with the driver

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.860 
right let's have a go with the driver
this<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.790> one<00:02:56.000> that<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.180> wanted<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.540> see

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
this is the one that I wanted to see

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.480 
this is the one that I wanted to see
when<00:02:57.320> I'm<00:02:57.440> hitting<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.710> with<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.860> driver<00:02:58.220> let's

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
when I'm hitting it with a driver let's

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.890 
when I'm hitting it with a driver let's
see<00:02:58.670> how<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.820> performs<00:02:59.300> I've<00:02:59.420> got<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.660> flight

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
see how it performs I've got the flight

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.660 
see how it performs I've got the flight
scope<00:03:00.260> switched<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:01.010> I'll<00:03:01.100> display<00:03:01.460> the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
scope switched on so I'll display the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.030 
scope switched on so I'll display the
readings<00:03:02.060> once<00:03:02.780> I've<00:03:02.990> hit<00:03:03.170> them<00:03:03.350> let's<00:03:03.860> try

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
readings once I've hit them let's try

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.220 
readings once I've hit them let's try
this<00:03:04.100> first<00:03:04.460> one<00:03:04.730> let's<00:03:04.880> see<00:03:05.000> how<00:03:05.090> it<00:03:05.210> feels

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.720 

good<00:03:09.230> strike<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.560> bit<00:03:09.770> some<00:03:10.070> probably<00:03:10.340> tell<00:03:10.550> by

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
good strike a bit some probably tell by

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.780 
good strike a bit some probably tell by
the<00:03:10.960> microphone<00:03:11.960> it<00:03:12.080> felt<00:03:12.320> it<00:03:12.950> sounded<00:03:13.460> so<00:03:13.670> it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
the microphone it felt it sounded so it

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.250 
the microphone it felt it sounded so it
it<00:03:13.910> felt<00:03:14.210> solid<00:03:14.660> as<00:03:14.750> well<00:03:14.870> I<00:03:14.930> didn't<00:03:15.140> feel

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
it felt solid as well I didn't feel

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.630 
it felt solid as well I didn't feel
clicky<00:03:15.620> though<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:15.920> did<00:03:16.160> it<00:03:16.250> did<00:03:16.400> feel<00:03:16.610> just

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
clicky though I did it did feel just

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.330 
clicky though I did it did feel just
quite<00:03:17.390> a<00:03:17.420> solid<00:03:18.230> strike<00:03:18.740> a<00:03:18.770> little<00:03:19.070> bit<00:03:19.190> like

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
quite a solid strike a little bit like

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.160 
quite a solid strike a little bit like
with<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:19.670> chip<00:03:19.970> let's<00:03:20.240> try<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.480> second<00:03:21.020> one

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
with the chip let's try the second one

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.660 
with the chip let's try the second one
again<00:03:26.620> that's<00:03:27.620> two<00:03:27.860> out<00:03:27.980> of<00:03:28.010> two<00:03:28.250> pretty<00:03:28.490> much

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
again that's two out of two pretty much

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.210 
again that's two out of two pretty much
down<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.090> same<00:03:29.300> line<00:03:29.600> feel<00:03:30.320> wise<00:03:30.560> definitely

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
down the same line feel wise definitely

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.480 
down the same line feel wise definitely
feel<00:03:31.430> solid<00:03:31.850> feels<00:03:32.420> like<00:03:32.660> if<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:33.320> can<00:03:33.560> control

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
feel solid feels like if you can control

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.160 
feel solid feels like if you can control
it<00:03:34.730> really<00:03:35.000> doesn't<00:03:35.240> feel<00:03:35.300> clicky<00:03:35.930> when<00:03:36.050> you

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
it really doesn't feel clicky when you

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.990 
it really doesn't feel clicky when you
hit<00:03:36.320> it<00:03:36.350> as<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:37.010> can<00:03:37.160> see<00:03:37.340> with<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:37.580> drive<00:03:37.850> and

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
hit it as you can see with the drive and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.580 
hit it as you can see with the drive and
the<00:03:38.060> spin<00:03:38.300> rate<00:03:38.480> is<00:03:38.600> quite<00:03:38.780> low<00:03:38.900> for<00:03:39.140> me<00:03:39.440> what

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
the spin rate is quite low for me what

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.770 
the spin rate is quite low for me what
is<00:03:39.650> inside<00:03:39.980> my<00:03:40.220> spin<00:03:40.580> tolerance<00:03:41.120> there's<00:03:41.630> some

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
is inside my spin tolerance there's some

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.810 
is inside my spin tolerance there's some
girl<00:03:41.990> with<00:03:42.170> a<00:03:42.200> 6-iron<00:03:42.680> let's<00:03:42.950> see<00:03:43.100> how<00:03:43.640> much

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
girl with a 6-iron let's see how much

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:51.820 
girl with a 6-iron let's see how much
spin<00:03:44.150> I<00:03:44.240> can<00:03:44.390> create<00:03:44.630> with<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:50.500> just<00:03:51.500> dug<00:03:51.680> it

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
spin I can create with this just dug it

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.740 
spin I can create with this just dug it
out<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:51.950> little<00:03:52.250> bit<00:03:52.550> just<00:03:52.760> pushed<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.209> slightly

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
out a little bit just pushed it slightly

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.720

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
I'm looking for straight down the target

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.960 
I'm looking for straight down the target
a<00:04:11.390> nice<00:04:12.380> strike<00:04:12.770> as<00:04:12.980> well<00:04:13.190> so<00:04:13.340> from<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:13.730> tee

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
a nice strike as well so from the tee

a nice strike as well so from the tee
and<00:04:14.150> on<00:04:14.300> for<00:04:14.840> me<00:04:14.959> 6-iron<00:04:15.470> shots<00:04:15.770> and<00:04:15.950> around

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
and on for me 6-iron shots and around

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.229 
and on for me 6-iron shots and around
the<00:04:16.220> green<00:04:16.370> it's<00:04:16.549> felt<00:04:16.730> solid

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
the green it's felt solid

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.270 
the green it's felt solid
it's<00:04:17.780> fairway<00:04:18.109> can<00:04:18.380> control<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:19.040> though<00:04:19.160> and

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
it's fairway can control it though and

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.159 
it's fairway can control it though and
on<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.520> green<00:04:19.700> it's<00:04:19.880> felt<00:04:20.120> soft<00:04:20.480> so<00:04:20.750> it's

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
on the green it's felt soft so it's

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.800 
on the green it's felt soft so it's
definitely<00:04:21.560> a<00:04:21.700> contender<00:04:22.700> for<00:04:22.970> that<00:04:23.120> better

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810
