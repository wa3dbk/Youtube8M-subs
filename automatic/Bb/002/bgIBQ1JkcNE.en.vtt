in his past only age because it seemed

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.499 
in his past only age because it seemed
the<00:01:19.470> zone<00:01:19.680> there<00:01:20.580> was<00:01:20.670> nothing<00:01:21.030> around<00:01:21.150> then

an<00:01:25.560> old<00:01:25.740> copper<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.250> could<00:01:26.400> see<00:01:26.580> there<00:01:26.820> you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
an old copper we could see there you

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.850 
an old copper we could see there you
know<00:01:27.090> he<00:01:27.299> was<00:01:27.540> even<00:01:27.840> lying

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
know he was even lying

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.440 
know he was even lying
it<00:01:29.009> looked<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.369> force<00:01:29.729> that's<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.150> he<00:01:30.299> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it looked like a force that's a he you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.760 
it looked like a force that's a he you
might<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.720> touched<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> wheel<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.500> think

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
might have touched the wheel but I think

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.069 
might have touched the wheel but I think

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
we can see quite clearly there that he

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.760 
we can see quite clearly there that he
just<00:01:34.340> slide<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> steel<00:01:36.000> manhole<00:01:36.420> cover

in his past on the edge because it

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.330 
in his past on the edge because it

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
on the way yes I think he's loaded on a

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.000 
on the way yes I think he's loaded on a
st<00:04:23.450> of<00:04:23.510> manhole<00:04:23.870> cover<00:04:24.140> we<00:04:24.440> could<00:04:24.590> see<00:04:24.770> there

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
st of manhole cover we could see there

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.040 
st of manhole cover we could see there
you<00:04:25.220> know<00:04:25.310> he<00:04:25.520> was<00:04:25.730> even<00:04:26.030> lying

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
you know he was even lying

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.660 
you know he was even lying
it<00:04:27.200> looked<00:04:27.380> like<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.680> force<00:04:27.950> that's<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.340> he<00:04:28.490> you

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
it looked like a force that's a he you

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.950 
it looked like a force that's a he you
might<00:04:28.820> have<00:04:28.940> touched<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.210> wheel<00:04:29.360> but<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.690> think

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
might have touched a wheel but I think

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.260 
might have touched a wheel but I think
we<00:04:30.380> can<00:04:30.560> see<00:04:30.710> quite<00:04:30.920> clearly<00:04:31.040> there<00:04:31.640> that<00:04:31.850> he

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
we can see quite clearly there that he

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.950 
we can see quite clearly there that he
just<00:04:32.540> slide<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.710> on<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:33.980> steel<00:04:34.190> manhole<00:04:34.610> cover
