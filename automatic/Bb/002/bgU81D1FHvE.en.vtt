 facebook as a school of instructors 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.730
 I issue we invite you to be part of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.380
 the new generation of instructors hello 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.609
 companions of the national school of 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.460
 instructors are going to get in this 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.829
 occasion the butt for all of you the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.810
 such as sending shaped cornet 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.540
 but on the inside as 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.460
 clean it internally and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.250
 we know how to polish by the part of 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.320
 we already saw the engine video but 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.690
 Now what I want to show you is how 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.660
 he sent our cornet a cornet 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.770
 when the one used for some time arrives 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.020
 a moment when you get to feel 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.810
 Honduras as if it were like 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.940
 cover is really not for what happens 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.520
 is that it is dirty is inside full 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.660
 of mucus because because when we 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.300
 we blow 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.250
 we ask for steam and saliva this 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.830
 generates bacteria in the internal part of 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.840
 the one from the correct one and it fills up so 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.000
 which makes the metal quite rigid 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.240
 what we are going to use to clean it 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.539
 is a guide a metal wire guide 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.179
 let's use a piece of piola 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.119
 Macrame larger than cornet 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.679
 we remember that it measures above one meter and 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.810
 at the end of which we are now going to have 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.759
 a cloth well now what I'm going to do 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.770
 is to clean it internally 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.770
 this I will introduce the guide by the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.539
 side of the tunnel and I'm going to take it out 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.789
 flag we have to do it with a lot 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.789
 careful to avoid that the guide is left 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.330
 I 'm going to introduce him a little bit the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.330
 experiment 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.119
 Well, the guide has already come out 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.599
 flag is right now for all the 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.230
 body of the cornet there is inside 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.319
 a wire a wire guide 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.530
 what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:22.049
 to introduce the other end and I'm going 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.730
 to do for photos then about what 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.159
 what I'm going to do in this extreme is that 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.250
 I'm going to tie a piola then the 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.470
 moor one by one the small one a city 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.000
 thin better known as macramé well 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.170
 we met her here in the city of mexico 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.980
 and what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.830
 what is 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.040
 the guide that is introduced with the 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.379
 goal that between the viola with the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.209
 guide ejects any type of object 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.370
 that existed inside either a pen 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.530
 Sharpener gum whatever 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.790
 anything I'm going to do is 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.980
 clean it with the viola the thing wants 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.080
 put it 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.959
 and put it in without it going to stay 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.049
 stuck well then then I already 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.970
 introduced the guide already passed all the 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.489
 storm the guide now we are 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.510
 introducing the stone can follow 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.510
 taking out the guides 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.989
 until 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.989
 here on this end it already came out 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.980
 the viola 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.050
 inside our cornet when 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.970
 we blow 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.970
 we play our instrument 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:45.040
 they stay inside they stay steam 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:47.260
 steam we installed saliva and this creates 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.240
 a mojo 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.340
 in bacteria 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.950
 and comments where these are not created 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.960
 bacteria fast enough is 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.720
 the copper copper by its nature the 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.780
 destroys but the brass and the alpaca is 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.280
 very bad for bacteria 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.910
 then our cornet becomes infected 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.770
 so what I'm going to do 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.200
 is to give a good cleaning inside 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.030
 this goes 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.410
 and make our cornet 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.410
 stop being hard 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.430
 very good since you perform this action step 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.850
 to the following they will remember first what 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.180
 what we did because we introduce a guide 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.730
 through the tunnel area and the little guide to 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.430
 little was going through until it came out 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.280
 the flag part of the pavilion 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.580
 we started pulling the guide until the 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.450
 tip of the guide allowed us to tie a 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:02.240
 fiol piece of very thin the anagram 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:05.550
 which is productive and served us 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.530
 internal cleaning 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.010
 Now what we are going to do is that you praise 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.620
 now to the last part of the piola you 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.200
 we are going to tie a piece of cloth 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.570
 cotton preference in this case this 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.910
 is what I have and what we are going to 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.670
 do this let's go pulling 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.610
 our action the biggest 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.910
 here is where the hard part 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:33.720
 where the knot enters and little by little 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:38.650
 to go through both the knot and the fabric 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:44.180
 I was going to clean the whole part 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:46.610
 internal is that fabric is a little harder 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.870
 to pass because they are sending 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.870
 practically everything 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.740
 of which I have approximately 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:06:01.310
 10 centimeters I usually get one 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.110
 of this size but it can be up to 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.850
 long enough to see how 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.850
 He left the debris still 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.280
 and nothing to see 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.699
 the cornet is already light and it's already 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.990
 we can see how clean the lip 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:23.979
 Lean mind is terribly dirty 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:26.110
 filled with many eyes and bacteria that 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:29.650
 generate within a form in size that 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:33.099
 is used and well, it connects me and 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.860
 is clean and ready to go 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:38.080
 touch and nothing else I will polish it for 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.400
 next Monday in the honors if 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.469
 have any doubt do not forget 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.229
