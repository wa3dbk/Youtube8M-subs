know<00:00:12.580> is<00:00:12.820> this<00:00:13.059> shape<00:00:13.330> and<00:00:13.690> when<00:00:14.290> you<00:00:14.350> put<00:00:14.500> it

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
know is this shape and when you put it

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.560 
know is this shape and when you put it
on<00:00:14.680> your<00:00:14.860> cutting<00:00:15.040> board<00:00:15.160> it<00:00:15.519> has<00:00:15.910> a<00:00:15.940> tendency

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
on your cutting board it has a tendency

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.200 
on your cutting board it has a tendency
to<00:00:16.689> roll<00:00:16.900> and<00:00:17.230> wiggle<00:00:17.590> that's<00:00:18.220> a<00:00:18.369> really<00:00:18.670> scary

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
to roll and wiggle that's a really scary

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.109 
to roll and wiggle that's a really scary
thing<00:00:19.540> to<00:00:19.750> try<00:00:19.960> to<00:00:20.020> cut<00:00:20.320> things<00:00:20.830> that<00:00:21.099> move<00:00:21.369> we

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
thing to try to cut things that move we

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.819 
thing to try to cut things that move we
don't<00:00:22.300> really<00:00:22.540> want<00:00:22.689> that<00:00:22.750> to<00:00:22.960> happen<00:00:23.110> so<00:00:23.439> to

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:23.829 
don't really want that to happen so to

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.010 
don't really want that to happen so to
julienne<00:00:24.489> the<00:00:24.669> zucchini<00:00:25.060> we<00:00:25.390> want<00:00:25.630> to<00:00:25.720> get<00:00:25.869> a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
julienne the zucchini we want to get a

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.170 
julienne the zucchini we want to get a
flat<00:00:26.349> surface<00:00:26.739> so<00:00:27.099> the<00:00:27.310> first<00:00:27.520> thing<00:00:27.759> we<00:00:27.880> do<00:00:28.029> is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
flat surface so the first thing we do is

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.940 
flat surface so the first thing we do is
we<00:00:28.329> cut<00:00:28.509> off<00:00:28.689> the<00:00:28.840> blossom<00:00:29.320> end<00:00:29.500> of<00:00:29.800> the

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
we cut off the blossom end of the

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.609 
we cut off the blossom end of the
zucchini<00:00:30.130> and<00:00:30.759> we<00:00:31.390> cut<00:00:31.599> a<00:00:31.630> chunk<00:00:32.050> of<00:00:32.230> zucchini

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
zucchini and we cut a chunk of zucchini

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.610 
zucchini and we cut a chunk of zucchini
about<00:00:33.010> two<00:00:33.250> inches<00:00:33.700> in<00:00:33.910> length<00:00:34.510> that's<00:00:35.410> about

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
about two inches in length that's about

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.430 
about two inches in length that's about
two<00:00:35.800> inches<00:00:36.100> there<00:00:36.370> and<00:00:36.579> then<00:00:37.540> we<00:00:37.780> square<00:00:38.410> it

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
two inches there and then we square it

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.770 
two inches there and then we square it
off<00:00:38.710> just<00:00:39.699> by<00:00:39.850> cutting<00:00:40.120> off<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.420> edges

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
off just by cutting off the edges

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.610 
off just by cutting off the edges
straight<00:00:41.649> down<00:00:41.980> very<00:00:42.340> easy<00:00:42.760> cut<00:00:43.620> straight

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
straight down very easy cut straight

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.360 
straight down very easy cut straight
down<00:00:44.820> keep<00:00:45.820> going<00:00:46.179> all<00:00:46.359> the<00:00:46.390> way<00:00:46.539> around<00:00:47.019> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
down keep going all the way around and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.220 
down keep going all the way around and
now<00:00:48.370> I<00:00:48.670> have<00:00:49.000> something<00:00:49.239> that's<00:00:49.570> squared<00:00:49.960> that

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
now I have something that's squared that

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.349 
now I have something that's squared that
won't<00:00:50.440> roll<00:00:50.649> around<00:00:50.829> so<00:00:51.730> I<00:00:51.760> get<00:00:51.999> rid<00:00:52.149> of<00:00:52.210> the

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
won't roll around so I get rid of the

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.119 
won't roll around so I get rid of the
stuff<00:00:52.570> I<00:00:52.690> don't<00:00:52.749> want<00:00:52.929> and<00:00:53.350> I'm<00:00:53.769> just<00:00:53.920> going<00:00:54.100> to

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
stuff I don't want and I'm just going to

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.930 
stuff I don't want and I'm just going to
cut<00:00:54.309> thin<00:00:54.670> slices<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:57.070> zucchini<00:00:57.280> about<00:00:57.909> a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
cut thin slices of the zucchini about a

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.729 
cut thin slices of the zucchini about a
quarter<00:00:58.329> of<00:00:58.359> an<00:00:58.539> inch<00:00:58.629> thick<00:00:58.809> I<00:00:59.260> use<00:00:59.499> my

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
quarter of an inch thick I use my

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.069 
quarter of an inch thick I use my
knuckles<00:00:59.920> as<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.309> guide<00:01:00.429> against<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.179> knife<00:01:01.359> so

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
knuckles as a guide against the knife so

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.619 
knuckles as a guide against the knife so
I<00:01:02.140> can<00:01:02.409> control<00:01:02.769> the<00:01:03.070> thickness<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.760> I<00:01:04.390> make

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
I can control the thickness and I make

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.470 
I can control the thickness and I make
some<00:01:04.839> slices<00:01:05.190> once<00:01:06.190> I've<00:01:06.370> got<00:01:06.550> some<00:01:06.760> slices<00:01:07.270> I

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
some slices once I've got some slices I

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.210 
some slices once I've got some slices I
can<00:01:07.930> then<00:01:08.230> cut<00:01:08.530> this<00:01:08.680> up<00:01:08.890> into<00:01:09.060> 1/4<00:01:10.060> inch<00:01:10.270> thick

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
can then cut this up into 1/4 inch thick

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.130 
can then cut this up into 1/4 inch thick
matchstick<00:01:12.220> pieces<00:01:12.880> just<00:01:13.509> keep<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.840> tip<00:01:14.020> of

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
matchstick pieces just keep the tip of

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.929 
matchstick pieces just keep the tip of
the<00:01:14.200> knife<00:01:14.380> on<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.590> cutting<00:01:14.799> board<00:01:15.189> and<00:01:15.610> up

brunoise<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:12.160> is<00:02:12.340> julienne<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.170> then<00:02:14.170> this

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
brunoise this is julienne and then this

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.620 
brunoise this is julienne and then this
is<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.680> brunoise<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:15.850> if<00:02:16.060> you're<00:02:16.210> in<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> big
