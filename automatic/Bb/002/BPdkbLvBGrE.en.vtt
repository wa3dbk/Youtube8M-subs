guys Steve here with Heather we're the

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.360 
guys Steve here with Heather we're the
middle<00:00:03.210> of<00:00:03.300> nowhere<00:00:03.480> we<00:00:04.470> wanted<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.859> test<00:00:05.069> out

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
middle of nowhere we wanted to test out

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.839 
middle of nowhere we wanted to test out
the<00:00:06.230> binary<00:00:07.230> rifle<00:00:07.500> targets<00:00:08.099> that<00:00:08.790> are

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
the binary rifle targets that are

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:18.769 
the binary rifle targets that are
designed<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.750> explode<00:00:16.010> these<00:00:17.010> work<00:00:17.660> so<00:00:18.660> I'm

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
designed to explode these work so I'm

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.769 
designed to explode these work so I'm
taking<00:00:18.930> one<00:00:19.170> out<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:20.070> open<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.550> up<00:00:20.779> according

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
taking one out and open it up according

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.980 
taking one out and open it up according
to<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> instructions<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:23.039> says<00:00:23.689> break<00:00:24.689> seal

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
to the instructions it says break seal

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.750 
to the instructions it says break seal
take<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> little<00:00:28.289> packet<00:00:28.650> out<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.980> mix<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.609> with

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
take a little packet out and mix it with

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:42.590 
take a little packet out and mix it with
the<00:00:29.849> beads<00:00:30.170> this<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.560> looks<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:41.600> so

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
the beads this is what it looks like so

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.180 
the beads this is what it looks like so
there's<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> little<00:00:43.170> gray<00:00:43.440> powder<00:00:43.739> inside

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
there's like a little gray powder inside

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.529 
there's like a little gray powder inside
of<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> container<00:00:45.200> it<00:00:46.200> looks<00:00:46.800> almost<00:00:47.700> moist<00:00:48.270> I

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
of the container it looks almost moist I

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.520 
of the container it looks almost moist I
don't<00:00:48.719> think<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:50.899> it's<00:00:51.899> almost<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.320> lead

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
don't think it is it's almost like lead

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.770 
don't think it is it's almost like lead
dust<00:00:52.829> coming<00:00:53.760> closer<00:00:54.030> Heather<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.510> show<00:00:54.660> them

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
dust coming closer Heather and show them

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.639 
dust coming closer Heather and show them
what<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> stuff<00:00:55.170> looks<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:57.199> so<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.620> a

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
what the stuff looks like so it's a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.619 
what the stuff looks like so it's a
bunch<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.920> tiny<00:00:59.160> little<00:00:59.309> beads<00:00:59.550> I've<00:01:00.300> got<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
bunch of tiny little beads I've got the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.560 
bunch of tiny little beads I've got the
silver<00:01:01.590> gray<00:01:01.770> powder<00:01:02.219> I'm<00:01:02.699> gonna<00:01:02.879> put<00:01:03.149> inside

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
silver gray powder I'm gonna put inside

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.410 
silver gray powder I'm gonna put inside
of<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:05.360> it's<00:01:06.360> about<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> according<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
of it it's about it so according to the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.030 
of it it's about it so according to the
instructions<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.049> put<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> lid<00:01:10.650> back<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.920> and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
instructions you put the lid back on and

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.310 
instructions you put the lid back on and
you<00:01:14.040> gently<00:01:15.030> shake<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.630> roll<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> container

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
you gently shake and roll the container

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.880 
you gently shake and roll the container
until<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.759> evenly<00:01:18.060> distributed<00:01:18.689> okay<00:01:19.320> cool

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
until it's evenly distributed okay cool

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:39.350 
until it's evenly distributed okay cool
let's<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.260 

so<00:01:39.990> we've<00:01:40.170> been<00:01:40.290> mixing<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.160> about<00:01:41.270> 30

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so we've been mixing it now for about 30

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.940 
so we've been mixing it now for about 30
seconds<00:01:42.810> 45<00:01:42.960> seconds<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> didn't<00:01:43.800> take<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
seconds 45 seconds it didn't take that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.850 
seconds 45 seconds it didn't take that
long<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:45.030> instructions<00:01:45.570> say<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.350> stop<00:01:46.650> when

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
long the instructions say to stop when

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.040 
long the instructions say to stop when
it's<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.070> uniform<00:01:47.610> gray<00:01:47.880> color<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.780> when<00:01:48.960> all

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
it's a uniform gray color so when all

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.960 
it's a uniform gray color so when all
the<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.350> beads<00:01:49.740> go<00:01:50.130> from<00:01:50.430> white<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.820> gray

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.480 

so<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.330> started<00:01:57.720> off<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:58.050> white<00:01:58.350> now<00:01:59.160> it<00:01:59.370> is

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
so it started off all white now it is

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.310 
so it started off all white now it is
all<00:01:59.760> gray<00:02:00.120> that<00:02:00.510> means<00:02:00.720> that<00:02:00.870> we<00:02:00.960> mix<00:02:01.140> it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
all gray that means that we mix it

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.180 
all gray that means that we mix it
correctly<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.780> instructions<00:02:04.260> say<00:02:04.410> that<00:02:04.650> you

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
correctly the instructions say that you

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.490 
correctly the instructions say that you
can<00:02:05.340> shoot<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.820> bottle<00:02:06.210> as<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> target<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
can shoot this bottle as a target and

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.219 
can shoot this bottle as a target and
this<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.130> what<00:02:08.340> explodes<00:02:08.899> we<00:02:09.899> thought<00:02:10.110> that

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
this is what explodes we thought that

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.280 
this is what explodes we thought that
was<00:02:10.320> a<00:02:10.350> little<00:02:10.440> boring<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:16.020> little

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
was a little boring so of this little

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.920 
was a little boring so of this little
army<00:02:16.560> truck<00:02:16.910> because<00:02:17.910> our<00:02:18.090> boss<00:02:18.300> man<00:02:18.600> has<00:02:18.810> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
army truck because our boss man has the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.320 
army truck because our boss man has the
exact<00:02:19.230> same<00:02:19.440> one<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.580> we're<00:02:20.970> actually<00:02:21.090> going

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
exact same one and we're actually going

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:43.280 
exact same one and we're actually going
to<00:02:21.390> pour<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.780> into<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.350> army<00:02:22.680> truck<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:42.480> it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
to pour it into the army truck so it

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.960 
to pour it into the army truck so it
also<00:02:43.440> says<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:43.920> should<00:02:44.070> be<00:02:44.100> about<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.790> hundred

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
also says you should be about a hundred

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.250 
also says you should be about a hundred
yards<00:02:45.330> away<00:02:45.420> from<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.750> target<00:02:45.930> when<00:02:46.170> you

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
yards away from the target when you

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.310 
yards away from the target when you
shoot<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.209> we'll<00:02:48.209> salt<00:02:48.480> stop<00:02:48.870> kill<00:02:49.080> me<00:02:49.200> for

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
shoot it so we'll salt stop kill me for

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.570 
shoot it so we'll salt stop kill me for
a<00:02:49.380> bit<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.680> can<00:02:49.920> run<00:02:50.070> out<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.310> put<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
a bit so I can run out and put the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.070 
a bit so I can run out and put the
target<00:02:50.880> out<00:02:50.970> there<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.390> then<00:02:51.540> we'll<00:02:51.959> get

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
target out there and then we'll get

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.860 
target out there and then we'll get
behind<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.380> rifle<00:02:52.650> shooting<00:02:53.330> ok<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.750> our

here<00:03:03.420> on<00:03:03.600> this<00:03:03.780> little<00:03:03.989> log<00:03:04.350> just<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.950> keep<00:03:05.100> it

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
here on this little log just to keep it

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.520 
here on this little log just to keep it
off<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.430> ground<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.840> away<00:03:07.019> from<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.350> grass

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
off the ground and away from the grass

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.710 
off the ground and away from the grass
and<00:03:07.769> bushes<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.070> stuff<00:03:08.330> we've<00:03:09.330> been<00:03:09.510> told

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
and bushes and stuff we've been told

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.750 
and bushes and stuff we've been told
that<00:03:09.870> there's<00:03:10.470> no<00:03:10.650> soil<00:03:10.890> sort<00:03:11.519> of<00:03:11.580> heat

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
that there's no soil sort of heat

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.729 
that there's no soil sort of heat
signatures<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:12.540> we<00:03:13.140> shouldn't<00:03:13.440> have<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.620> worry

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
signatures so we shouldn't have to worry

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.620 
signatures so we shouldn't have to worry
about<00:03:13.890> fires<00:03:14.550> or<00:03:14.880> anything<00:03:15.060> like<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.269> but

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
about fires or anything like that but

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.229 
about fires or anything like that but
we're<00:03:16.290> gonna<00:03:16.410> play<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.680> safe<00:03:16.709> anyway<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.820> I'm

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
we're gonna play it safe anyway so I'm

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.550 
we're gonna play it safe anyway so I'm
gonna<00:03:18.390> run<00:03:18.570> back<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.989> where<00:03:19.110> we're<00:03:19.260> shooting

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
gonna run back to where we're shooting

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:41.080 
gonna run back to where we're shooting
and<00:03:19.709> we'll<00:03:20.220> film<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.700> explosion<00:03:21.060> so

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.759 

hopefully<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.120> can<00:03:42.150> set<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.570> thing<00:03:42.750> off<00:03:42.900> one

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
hopefully I can set this thing off one

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.289 
hopefully I can set this thing off one
bullet<00:03:44.010> without<00:03:44.310> missing<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.730> target<00:03:44.910> I

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
bullet without missing the target I

00:03:45.299 --> 00:04:09.000 
bullet without missing the target I
guess<00:03:45.540> we'll<00:03:45.870> see

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.150 

it<00:04:10.010> went<00:04:10.250> off<00:04:10.400> as<00:04:11.000> expected<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.840> was<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:12.560> pretty

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
it went off as expected it was a pretty

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.960 
it went off as expected it was a pretty
big<00:04:13.280> explosion

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
big explosion

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.690 
big explosion
it's<00:04:14.360> louder<00:04:14.630> than<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:14.990> thought<00:04:15.140> it<00:04:15.290> would<00:04:15.380> be

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
it's louder than I thought it would be

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.009 
it's louder than I thought it would be
I'm<00:04:16.700> just<00:04:16.940> kind<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.120> trying<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:17.630> search<00:04:17.840> for

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
I'm just kind of trying to search for

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.509 
I'm just kind of trying to search for
the<00:04:18.109> truck<00:04:18.410> right<00:04:18.590> now<00:04:18.650> so<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.070> can<00:04:19.250> show<00:04:19.430> you

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
the truck right now so I can show you

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.580 
the truck right now so I can show you
what<00:04:19.670> it<00:04:19.790> looks<00:04:20.000> like<00:04:20.209> but<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:20.989> guess<00:04:21.410> it

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
what it looks like but I guess it

00:04:21.590 --> 00:05:06.000 
what it looks like but I guess it
disappeared

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.430 

we<00:05:07.010> found<00:05:07.280> our<00:05:07.400> target<00:05:07.720> about<00:05:08.720> 50<00:05:09.110> feet<00:05:09.320> away

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
we found our target about 50 feet away

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.540 
we found our target about 50 feet away
from<00:05:09.560> where<00:05:10.220> it<00:05:10.850> was<00:05:11.060> when<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.270> shot<00:05:11.630> it

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
from where it was when I shot it

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.770 
from where it was when I shot it
he<00:05:13.550> is<00:05:13.910> blown<00:05:14.480> up<00:05:14.510> pretty<00:05:15.110> good<00:05:16.540> the<00:05:17.540> stuff

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
he is blown up pretty good the stuff

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.530 
he is blown up pretty good the stuff
works<00:05:18.050> it's<00:05:18.320> fun
