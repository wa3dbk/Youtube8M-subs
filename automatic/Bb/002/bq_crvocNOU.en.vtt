00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.420
 well now I'm going to show you the 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.720
 difference 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.320
 in reading 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.900
 to look at how the light works 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.100
 background that I have the same book we're going to 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.610
 open it 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.520
 good 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.600
 what did he say these are lists 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.600
 to choose the book 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.180
 this is that same book however if 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.680
 in the paper way we want to see the list 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:40.420
 we can see it in list view and we're going 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.760
 to have that view but we can see 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.900
 the cover view and we're going to have the 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.830
 cover of the book there 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.830
 we enter this book 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.200
 to 100% 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.230
 campus location and there we have the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.229
 two on the same page 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.250
 and we can see that they are synchronized 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:14.960
 the underlining we've done 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:18.080
 even the annotations also ok here 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.240
 let's look at how you use it from the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.759
 backlight maybe 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.759
 in the maximum we can download it 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.450
 the light 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.280
 and we can upload it 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.320
 and we can see more or less how it changes and 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.549
 you can see a little the difference between 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.969
 read with this and with the previous kingdom 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.969
 town 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.789
 effectively 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.829
 in total darkness we could read with the 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.670
 paper why no problem but it is not 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.850
 possible with history 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.010
 and the rest of the functions are ready 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.270
 being basically the same 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.209
 the way to enlarge 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.629
 and changing the size of the letter is the 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.629
 same 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.069
 simply 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.720
 and that we're going to have the advantage of the 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.720
 the one in the backlight 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.420
 in terms of speed I would say that 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.420
 They are equal 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.310
 a little more 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.050
 the white paper 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.050
 I'm a little slower 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.819
 possible that it has become manuel de 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.689
 work look 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.689
 the e3 similar 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.250
 apparently the paper why is a bit more 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:11.790
 slow to turn the pages however 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.790
 I could not assure you with total certainty 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.790
 okay 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.090
 at the beginning 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:32.610
 and Well there you have paper Kingdom 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.610
 white with amazon backgrounds light 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.409
 good device me any fifth no 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.400
 it seems to me a very important tool 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.540
 for reading and for 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.760
 entertainment 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.780
 this new version then good comes with 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.819
 the backlight and also with 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.569
 up to eight weeks of 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.730
 battery those are almost two months 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.159
 could allow us 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.310
 eternal in a farm without energy during 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.650
 two months and can continue reading 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.680
 I hope you liked the video that 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.340
 subscribe to the channel and see you 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.340
 in the next
