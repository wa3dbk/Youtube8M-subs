00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
how did you come up with this concept

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.180 
how did you come up with this concept
well<00:01:03.260> when<00:01:03.380> you<00:01:03.470> told<00:01:03.590> me<00:01:03.739> it<00:01:03.770> was<00:01:03.920> gonna<00:01:04.040> be

well when you told me it was gonna be

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.560 
well when you told me it was gonna be
for<00:01:04.370> the<00:01:04.460> may<00:01:04.580> cover<00:01:04.820> I<00:01:05.000> wanted<00:01:05.330> to<00:01:05.449> do

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
for the may cover I wanted to do

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.230 
for the may cover I wanted to do
something<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.230> little<00:01:06.770> bit<00:01:06.920> more<00:01:06.950> fun<00:01:07.760> for<00:01:08.150> the

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
something a little bit more fun for the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.000 
something a little bit more fun for the
for<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.840> new<00:01:08.960> start<00:01:09.230> of<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.380> season<00:01:09.590> in<00:01:09.890> the

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
for the new start of the season in the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.190 
for the new start of the season in the
spring<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.700> I<00:01:11.210> thought<00:01:11.450> about<00:01:11.630> a<00:01:11.780> rainbow

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
spring and I thought about a rainbow

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.530 
spring and I thought about a rainbow
design<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:12.950> with<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.640> glass<00:01:13.820> gels<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.300> can

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
design and with the glass gels you can

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.900 
design and with the glass gels you can
really<00:01:14.780> get<00:01:14.990> a<00:01:15.260> beautiful<00:01:15.740> effect<00:01:16.220> with<00:01:16.880> all

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
really get a beautiful effect with all

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.640 
really get a beautiful effect with all
the<00:01:17.180> different<00:01:17.360> colors<00:01:17.750> of<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.930> rainbow<00:01:17.990> and

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
the different colors of the rainbow and

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.620 
the different colors of the rainbow and
these<00:01:19.340> gels<00:01:19.580> are<00:01:19.700> different<00:01:19.970> than<00:01:20.060> color<00:01:20.270> gels

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
these gels are different than color gels

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.390 
these gels are different than color gels
because<00:01:21.050> they<00:01:21.470> offer<00:01:21.650> a<00:01:21.860> sort<00:01:22.100> of<00:01:22.250> a

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
because they offer a sort of a

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.490 
because they offer a sort of a
stained-glass<00:01:23.090> effect<00:01:23.420> they're<00:01:24.020> not<00:01:24.170> so

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
stained-glass effect they're not so

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.380 
stained-glass effect they're not so
heavily<00:01:24.740> pigmented<00:01:25.190> exactly<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:26.270> they're

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
heavily pigmented exactly and they're

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.749 
heavily pigmented exactly and they're
actually<00:01:26.570> extremely<00:01:27.440> clear<00:01:28.190> and<00:01:28.490> transparent

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
actually extremely clear and transparent

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.240 
actually extremely clear and transparent
so<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.420> can<00:01:29.630> see<00:01:29.840> right<00:01:29.990> through<00:01:30.320> them<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:31.160> how

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
so you can see right through them so how

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.830 
so you can see right through them so how
did<00:01:31.400> you<00:01:31.490> begin<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:32.000> actually<00:01:32.420> extended<00:01:32.810> the

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
did you begin I actually extended the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.780 
did you begin I actually extended the
whole<00:01:33.050> nail<00:01:33.259> with<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.650> glass<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.280> all<00:01:34.640> the

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
whole nail with the glass and all the

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.249 
whole nail with the glass and all the
different<00:01:34.940> colors<00:01:35.210> of<00:01:35.540> six<00:01:35.750> colors<00:01:36.050> of<00:01:36.200> the

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
different colors of six colors of the

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:36.640 
different colors of six colors of the
rainbow

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
rainbow

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.280 
rainbow
I<00:01:36.910> didn't<00:01:37.910> some<00:01:38.300> of<00:01:38.450> them<00:01:38.570> needed<00:01:38.780> about<00:01:38.960> two

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
I didn't some of them needed about two

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.130 
I didn't some of them needed about two
coats<00:01:39.500> on<00:01:39.770> there<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.280> it's<00:01:41.210> still<00:01:41.509> like<00:01:41.810> like

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
coats on there and it's still like like

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.870 
coats on there and it's still like like
you<00:01:42.259> can<00:01:42.410> see<00:01:42.619> it<00:01:42.800> definitely<00:01:43.280> kept<00:01:43.700> its

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
you can see it definitely kept its

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.580 
you can see it definitely kept its
transparency<00:01:44.690> you<00:01:45.050> use<00:01:45.229> two<00:01:45.470> different

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
transparency you use two different

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.100 
transparency you use two different
colors<00:01:46.040> on<00:01:46.220> each<00:01:46.250> nail<00:01:46.729> did<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:47.270> have<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.660> cure

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
colors on each nail did you have to cure

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.969 
colors on each nail did you have to cure
in<00:01:48.290> between<00:01:48.560> each<00:01:48.710> one

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
in between each one

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.580 
in between each one
I<00:01:49.220> actually<00:01:49.880> didn't<00:01:50.360> that<00:01:50.840> just<00:01:50.869> holds<00:01:51.500> up

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
I actually didn't that just holds up

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.080 
I actually didn't that just holds up
pretty<00:01:51.800> good<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.220> definitely<00:01:52.399> melts<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.060> little

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
pretty good it definitely melts a little

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.690 
pretty good it definitely melts a little
bit<00:01:53.420> together<00:01:53.600> but<00:01:54.140> I<00:01:54.470> like<00:01:54.649> that<00:01:54.830> effect<00:01:55.220> and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
bit together but I like that effect and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.790 
bit together but I like that effect and
it<00:01:55.789> looks<00:01:56.030> like<00:01:56.179> it<00:01:56.330> blends<00:01:56.780> into<00:01:57.229> each<00:01:57.560> other

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
it looks like it blends into each other

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.370 
it looks like it blends into each other
I<00:01:58.069> also<00:01:58.729> remember<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.300> mentioning<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.200> room

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
I also remember you mentioning the room

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.200 
I also remember you mentioning the room
was<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.560> little<00:02:00.800> bit<00:02:00.920> warm<00:02:01.160> and<00:02:01.429> so<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:02.000> product

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
was a little bit warm and so the product

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.910 
was a little bit warm and so the product
was<00:02:02.539> running<00:02:02.899> it's<00:02:03.380> not<00:02:03.500> something<00:02:03.800> you<00:02:03.860> have

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
was running it's not something you have

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.279 
was running it's not something you have
to<00:02:04.069> be<00:02:04.160> careful<00:02:04.490> with<00:02:04.660> it<00:02:05.660> can<00:02:05.960> definitely

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
to be careful with it can definitely

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.370 
to be careful with it can definitely
gels<00:02:07.069> in<00:02:07.429> a<00:02:07.970> warmer<00:02:08.300> temperature<00:02:08.810> they<00:02:09.200> will

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
gels in a warmer temperature they will

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.040 
gels in a warmer temperature they will
become<00:02:09.740> more<00:02:09.920> runny<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:11.390> be<00:02:11.540> careful<00:02:11.930> to

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
become more runny so to be careful to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.840 
become more runny so to be careful to
use<00:02:12.080> smaller<00:02:12.740> amounts<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.190> product<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.730> then

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
use smaller amounts of product and then

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.880 
use smaller amounts of product and then
maybe<00:02:14.060> doing<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.480> second<00:02:14.840> coat<00:02:15.020> yeah<00:02:15.680> that

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
maybe doing a second coat yeah that

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.110 
maybe doing a second coat yeah that
actually<00:02:16.250> helps<00:02:16.520> especially<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:17.030> the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
actually helps especially in the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.610 
actually helps especially in the
beginning<00:02:17.209> when<00:02:17.720> you're<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.900> beginner<00:02:18.230> on<00:02:18.319> it

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
beginning when you're a beginner on it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.650 
beginning when you're a beginner on it
it's<00:02:19.040> definitely<00:02:19.520> better<00:02:19.670> just<00:02:20.000> do<00:02:20.180> two<00:02:20.390> coats

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
it's definitely better just do two coats

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.900 
it's definitely better just do two coats
that<00:02:21.110> way<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.350> doesn't<00:02:21.530> run<00:02:21.770> as<00:02:21.920> much<00:02:22.130> after

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
that way it doesn't run as much after

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.520 
that way it doesn't run as much after
you<00:02:23.180> cured<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.569> glass<00:02:23.750> gels<00:02:24.080> then<00:02:24.319> you<00:02:24.410> went

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
you cured the glass gels then you went

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.800 
you cured the glass gels then you went
in<00:02:24.650> with<00:02:24.770> glitter<00:02:24.980> yes<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:26.150> actually<00:02:26.300> applied

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
in with glitter yes I actually applied

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.540 
in with glitter yes I actually applied
the<00:02:26.959> glitter<00:02:27.140> right<00:02:27.350> over<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.770> glass<00:02:27.950> gel<00:02:28.280> and

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
the glitter right over the glass gel and

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.910 
the glitter right over the glass gel and
some<00:02:28.819> of<00:02:28.910> them<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.120> even<00:02:29.390> mixed<00:02:29.540> into<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.170> that

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
some of them I even mixed into it that

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.770 
some of them I even mixed into it that
way<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.280> kind<00:02:31.520> of<00:02:31.550> hides<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.240> camouflages

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
way it kind of hides and camouflages

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.360 
way it kind of hides and camouflages
where<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.290> natural<00:02:33.650> nail<00:02:33.800> grows<00:02:34.069> out

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
where the natural nail grows out

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.100 
where the natural nail grows out
sometimes<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.209> little<00:02:35.330> natural<00:02:35.600> free<00:02:35.990> edge

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
sometimes that little natural free edge

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.870 
sometimes that little natural free edge
you<00:02:36.319> can<00:02:36.440> see<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.800> popping<00:02:37.040> through<00:02:37.400> and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
you can see it popping through and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.390 
you can see it popping through and
because<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.600> gels<00:02:38.959> are<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:39.560> transparent<00:02:40.280> with

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
because the gels are so transparent with

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.160 
because the gels are so transparent with
just<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.670> hint<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:41.000> color<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.480> think<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.050> the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
just a hint of color I think that the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.170 
just a hint of color I think that the
glitter<00:02:42.380> in<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:43.130> same<00:02:43.370> color<00:02:43.670> tone<00:02:43.940> actually

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
glitter in the same color tone actually

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.990 
glitter in the same color tone actually
enhances<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.800> gel<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.280> absolutely<00:02:46.760> does

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
enhances the gel it absolutely does

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.580 
enhances the gel it absolutely does
because<00:02:47.270> sometimes<00:02:47.569> it<00:02:47.720> gets<00:02:47.870> lost<00:02:48.110> in<00:02:48.470> the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
because sometimes it gets lost in the

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.290 
because sometimes it gets lost in the
color<00:02:48.770> that<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.160> is<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:49.610> with<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.940> with<00:02:50.209> the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
color that it is so with the with the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.210 
color that it is so with the with the
glitter<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.720> really<00:02:51.020> it<00:02:51.500> makes<00:02:51.770> that<00:02:52.010> color

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
glitter it really it makes that color

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.040 
glitter it really it makes that color
pop<00:02:52.520> now<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.240> did<00:02:53.450> all<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.660> this<00:02:53.780> on<00:02:54.020> the

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
pop now you did all of this on the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.020 
pop now you did all of this on the
extension<00:02:54.709> edge<00:02:54.860> but<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.400> still<00:02:55.610> haven't<00:02:55.760> put

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
extension edge but you still haven't put

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.080 
extension edge but you still haven't put
anything<00:02:56.240> on<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:57.110> nail<00:02:57.260> plate<00:02:57.850> exactly<00:02:58.850> we

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
anything on the nail plate exactly we

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.030 
anything on the nail plate exactly we
wanted<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.450> build<00:02:59.660> the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
wanted to build the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.899 
wanted to build the
first<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:01.000> then<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:02.290> put<00:03:02.739> clear<00:03:03.219> the<00:03:03.549> crystal

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
first and then you put clear the crystal

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.940 
first and then you put clear the crystal
clear<00:03:04.090> over<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.510> entire<00:03:04.870> nail<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.620> actually

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
clear over the entire nail to actually

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.920 
clear over the entire nail to actually
build<00:03:06.159> it<00:03:06.280> out<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.430> give<00:03:06.609> it<00:03:06.760> some<00:03:07.000> body<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.780> it

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
build it out and give it some body to it

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.569 
build it out and give it some body to it
because<00:03:08.590> these<00:03:08.769> gels<00:03:09.010> are<00:03:09.159> so<00:03:09.310> transparent

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
because these gels are so transparent

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.220 
because these gels are so transparent
can<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.209> use<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.540> on<00:03:10.689> the<00:03:10.810> nail<00:03:10.959> plate

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
can you use it on the nail plate

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.410 
can you use it on the nail plate
you<00:03:12.010> actually<00:03:12.250> can<00:03:12.730> what<00:03:12.909> it<00:03:13.030> would<00:03:13.150> do<00:03:13.269> is

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
you actually can what it would do is

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.240 
you actually can what it would do is
just<00:03:13.689> kind<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.200> would<00:03:14.319> just<00:03:14.560> make<00:03:15.099> it

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
just kind of it would just make it

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.339 
just kind of it would just make it
almost<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:15.549> a<00:03:15.670> pastel<00:03:16.180> look<00:03:16.510> similar<00:03:17.200> to

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
almost like a pastel look similar to

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.899 
almost like a pastel look similar to
like<00:03:17.590> when<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:17.890> was<00:03:17.980> on<00:03:18.129> the<00:03:18.250> forum<00:03:18.519> and<00:03:18.730> that

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
like when it was on the forum and that

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.759 
like when it was on the forum and that
dark<00:03:19.209> it's<00:03:19.450> hard<00:03:19.659> to<00:03:19.780> see<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.109> but<00:03:20.530> on<00:03:20.620> an

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
dark it's hard to see it but on an

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.110 
dark it's hard to see it but on an
actual<00:03:21.040> natural<00:03:21.310> nail<00:03:21.670> but<00:03:21.879> it<00:03:21.970> will<00:03:22.060> just

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
actual natural nail but it will just

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.149 
actual natural nail but it will just
make<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.659> a<00:03:22.780> little<00:03:22.930> bit<00:03:23.170> kind<00:03:23.950> of<00:03:23.980> like<00:03:24.040> a

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
make it a little bit kind of like a

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.789 
make it a little bit kind of like a
pastel<00:03:24.730> color<00:03:25.060> but<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.109> really<00:03:26.409> they're<00:03:26.560> meant

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
pastel color but so really they're meant

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.250 
pastel color but so really they're meant
for<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.280> extension<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:28.359> get<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.629> true<00:03:28.840> effect

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
for the extension to get the true effect

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.349 
for the extension to get the true effect
of<00:03:29.439> them<00:03:29.620> yes<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.159> definitely<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.819> extension

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
of them yes you definitely the extension

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.149 
of them yes you definitely the extension
is<00:03:31.510> really<00:03:31.750> where<00:03:31.930> it's<00:03:32.139> most<00:03:32.319> important<00:03:32.799> and

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
is really where it's most important and

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:34.500 
is really where it's most important and
if<00:03:33.340> you're<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:33.519> beginner<00:03:33.849> at<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.239> you<00:03:34.329> might

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
if you're a beginner at it you might

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.720 
if you're a beginner at it you might
want<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.750> try<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:34.989> use<00:03:35.200> clear<00:03:35.590> forms<00:03:36.040> that<00:03:36.579> way

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
want to try to use clear forms that way

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.670 
want to try to use clear forms that way
you<00:03:36.790> can<00:03:37.030> really<00:03:37.180> see<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.599> color<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.470> where

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
you can really see the color and where

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.170 
you can really see the color and where
it's<00:03:38.829> being<00:03:38.980> applied<00:03:39.129> where<00:03:39.430> it's<00:03:39.549> exactly

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
it's being applied where it's exactly

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.210 
it's being applied where it's exactly
used<00:03:40.840> an<00:03:40.989> electric<00:03:41.349> file<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:41.829> this<00:03:42.010> with<00:03:42.189> a

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
used an electric file on this with a

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.589 
used an electric file on this with a
sanding<00:03:42.579> bit<00:03:42.730> is<00:03:42.970> that<00:03:43.090> what<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.329> recommend

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
sanding bit is that what you recommend

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.119 
sanding bit is that what you recommend
whenever<00:03:44.079> you're<00:03:44.230> in<00:03:44.349> working<00:03:44.590> with<00:03:44.620> gels<00:03:44.980> I

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
whenever you're in working with gels I

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.860 
whenever you're in working with gels I
do<00:03:45.340> actually<00:03:45.819> recommend<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.329> sanding<00:03:46.689> bit

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
do actually recommend the sanding bit

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.020 
do actually recommend the sanding bit
over<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.260> diamond<00:03:47.859> bare<00:03:48.010> carbide<00:03:48.609> bit<00:03:48.849> when

over a diamond bare carbide bit when

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.729 
over a diamond bare carbide bit when
you're<00:03:49.120> when<00:03:49.480> you're<00:03:49.599> dealing<00:03:49.750> with<00:03:49.900> gels<00:03:50.260> the

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
you're when you're dealing with gels the

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:51.990 
you're when you're dealing with gels the
what<00:03:50.859> happens<00:03:51.159> with<00:03:51.280> gel<00:03:51.489> is<00:03:51.579> that<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.819> gets

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
what happens with gel is that it gets

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.839 
what happens with gel is that it gets
very<00:03:52.200> powdery<00:03:53.200> so<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.799> gets<00:03:54.010> stuck<00:03:54.280> into<00:03:54.579> the

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
very powdery so it gets stuck into the

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.909 
very powdery so it gets stuck into the
bits<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.540> after<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.260> electric<00:03:56.560> file<00:03:56.739> you

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
bits and after the electric file you

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.460 
bits and after the electric file you
went<00:03:57.069> in<00:03:57.189> with<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.489> buffer<00:03:57.939> yeah<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:58.930> actually<00:03:59.109> do

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
went in with a buffer yeah I actually do

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.929 
went in with a buffer yeah I actually do
most<00:03:59.739> of<00:03:59.859> my<00:03:59.919> finishing<00:04:00.370> work<00:04:00.489> with<00:04:00.639> a<00:04:00.669> hand

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
most of my finishing work with a hand

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.940 
most of my finishing work with a hand
file<00:04:01.209> and<00:04:01.569> then<00:04:01.689> I<00:04:01.780> buff<00:04:01.989> it<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.409> get<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:02.709> dust

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
file and then I buff it to get that dust

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.099 
file and then I buff it to get that dust
off<00:04:03.250> once<00:04:03.909> the<00:04:04.030> nails<00:04:04.209> were<00:04:04.389> filed<00:04:04.629> and<00:04:04.900> buffed

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
off once the nails were filed and buffed

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.439 
off once the nails were filed and buffed
into<00:04:05.349> shape<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:06.190> coated<00:04:06.879> it<00:04:06.970> with<00:04:07.000> a<00:04:07.090> sealant

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
into shape you coated it with a sealant

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.420 
into shape you coated it with a sealant
I<00:04:07.629> did<00:04:08.319> I<00:04:08.379> applied<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.829> sealant<00:04:09.159> over<00:04:09.220> the

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
I did I applied the sealant over the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.580 
I did I applied the sealant over the
entire<00:04:09.760> nail<00:04:10.120> once<00:04:10.569> it's<00:04:10.780> buffed<00:04:11.049> and<00:04:11.260> cleaned

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
entire nail once it's buffed and cleaned

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.939 
entire nail once it's buffed and cleaned
and<00:04:11.919> that<00:04:12.729> way<00:04:12.909> it's<00:04:13.629> the<00:04:13.840> final<00:04:14.199> stuff<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.769> any

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
and that way it's the final stuff to any

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:16.920 
and that way it's the final stuff to any
gel<00:04:15.220> nail<00:04:15.489> whose<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.940> sealant<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:16.599> it<00:04:16.750> really

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
gel nail whose the sealant and it really

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.689 
gel nail whose the sealant and it really
brought<00:04:17.199> out<00:04:17.409> the<00:04:17.440> color<00:04:17.859> from<00:04:18.250> this<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.609> the

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
brought out the color from this and the

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.120 
brought out the color from this and the
