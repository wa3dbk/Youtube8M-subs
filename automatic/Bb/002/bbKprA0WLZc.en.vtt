00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
socket am3+ 95 wats now I really wanted

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.660 
socket am3+ 95 wats now I really wanted
to<00:00:15.150> try<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.389> fit<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.839> FX<00:00:16.199> 8350<00:00:16.770> into<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> build

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
to try to fit in FX 8350 into the build

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.880 
to try to fit in FX 8350 into the build
but<00:00:18.270> that's<00:00:18.600> about<00:00:18.900> two<00:00:19.109> hundred<00:00:19.230> dollars<00:00:19.710> and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
but that's about two hundred dollars and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.290 
but that's about two hundred dollars and
you<00:00:19.949> really<00:00:20.220> can't<00:00:20.430> do<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.699> since<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.029> wanted

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
you really can't do that since I wanted

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.540 
you really can't do that since I wanted
to<00:00:21.390> get<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.539> decent<00:00:21.779> GPU<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:23.160> want<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.460> get

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
to get a decent GPU and I want to get

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.310 
to get a decent GPU and I want to get
some<00:00:23.609> other<00:00:23.789> stuff<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> build<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.050> had

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
some other stuff in the build so I had

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.439 
some other stuff in the build so I had
to<00:00:25.350> go<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.830> FX<00:00:26.160> 6300<00:00:26.760> instead<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
to go with the FX 6300 instead of the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.710 
to go with the FX 6300 instead of the
8350<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> sixth<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.580> 6300<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.510> still<00:00:30.689> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
8350 but the sixth the 6300 is still a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.600 
8350 but the sixth the 6300 is still a
very<00:00:30.929> capable<00:00:31.230> CPU<00:00:31.859> at<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> hundred<00:00:32.279> twenty

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
very capable CPU at a hundred twenty

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.370 
very capable CPU at a hundred twenty
dollars<00:00:32.940> keep<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.570> mind<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
dollars keep in mind that that is the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.470 
dollars keep in mind that that is the
same<00:00:34.590> price<00:00:34.860> as<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.070> i3<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:36.300> goes

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
same price as the i3 so that just goes

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.080 
same price as the i3 so that just goes
to<00:00:36.510> show<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.530> r3<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.160> dual<00:00:38.460> core<00:00:38.820> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
to show that the r3 is a dual core and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.110 
to show that the r3 is a dual core and
the<00:00:39.120> AMD<00:00:39.780> FX<00:00:40.170> 6300<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> 6-core<00:00:41.550> now<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> know

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the AMD FX 6300 is a 6-core now I know

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.270 
the AMD FX 6300 is a 6-core now I know
you<00:00:42.300> can't<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> core<00:00:43.079> four<00:00:43.290> core<00:00:43.500> comparison

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
you can't do a core four core comparison

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.790 
you can't do a core four core comparison
when<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.910> cpu<00:00:45.539> comparison<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.379> but

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
when you do cpu comparison like that but

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.950 
when you do cpu comparison like that but
that<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.070> kind<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.399> funny<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.090> FX<00:00:48.390> 6300

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
that is kind of funny that the FX 6300

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.529 
that is kind of funny that the FX 6300
is<00:00:49.469> actually<00:00:49.829> cheaper<00:00:50.219> than<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.399> i3<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
is actually cheaper than the i3 and the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.830 
is actually cheaper than the i3 and the
660<00:00:52.379> 300<00:00:52.620> outperforms<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.550> r3<00:00:53.969> by<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> lot<00:00:54.449> so

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
660 300 outperforms the r3 by a lot so

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.380 
660 300 outperforms the r3 by a lot so
this<00:00:55.410> cpu<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.520> damn<00:00:56.730> good<00:00:56.760> deal<00:00:57.149> at<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
this cpu is a really damn good deal at a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.150 
this cpu is a really damn good deal at a
hundred<00:00:57.629> twenty<00:00:57.989> dollars<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.800> has<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> very

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
hundred twenty dollars and it has a very

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.610 
hundred twenty dollars and it has a very
hot<00:00:59.399> cooperate<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.109> being<00:01:01.140> six

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
hot cooperate and with it being six

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.290 
hot cooperate and with it being six
course<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.430> fairly<00:01:02.609> decent<00:01:03.149> for

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
course it's actually fairly decent for

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.060 
course it's actually fairly decent for
video<00:01:03.570> editing<00:01:03.719> live<00:01:04.260> streaming<00:01:04.710> which<00:01:04.949> I

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
video editing live streaming which I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.649 
video editing live streaming which I
know<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.220> lot<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.489> people<00:01:05.610> are<00:01:05.909> getting<00:01:06.090> into<00:01:06.479> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
know a lot of people are getting into I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.080 
know a lot of people are getting into I
no<00:01:06.960> games<00:01:07.350> today<00:01:07.680> only<00:01:08.040> use<00:01:08.280> for<00:01:08.549> course<00:01:08.850> but

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
no games today only use for course but

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.850 
no games today only use for course but
with<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> move<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.810> next<00:01:09.960> generation<00:01:10.650> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
with the move to next generation and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.490 
with the move to next generation and

core<00:01:13.890> cpus<00:01:14.369> i<00:01:14.520> believe<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
core cpus i believe it is it's not the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.270 
core cpus i believe it is it's not the
best<00:01:15.780> eight<00:01:16.020> core<00:01:16.229> cpu<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.740> keep<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.009> mind<00:01:17.040> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
best eight core cpu but keep in mind it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.700 
best eight core cpu but keep in mind it
is<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.549> core<00:01:17.790> cpus<00:01:18.240> developers<00:01:19.170> are<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
is a core cpus developers are going to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.499 
is a core cpus developers are going to
more<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.040> more<00:01:20.130> utilize<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.060> eight<00:01:21.210> core

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
more and more utilize the eight core

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.300 
more and more utilize the eight core
technology<00:01:22.140> because<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.920> guys<00:01:22.979> got<00:01:23.220> to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
technology because you guys got to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.859 
technology because you guys got to
remember<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.729> developers<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.540> squeeze

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
remember that developers have to squeeze

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.840 
remember that developers have to squeeze
these<00:01:25.110> games<00:01:25.409> down<00:01:25.710> onto<00:01:26.130> consoles<00:01:26.670> so

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
these games down onto consoles so

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.060 
these games down onto consoles so
they're<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.479> being<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.680> their<00:01:28.710> up

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
they're really not being up to their up

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.620 
they're really not being up to their up
to<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> par<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.850> they<00:01:29.939> could<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.509> now

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
to the par that they could be but now

is<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.650> competitor<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.850> gtx<00:03:12.390> 760<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.170> they

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
is a competitor to the gtx 760 and they

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.140 
is a competitor to the gtx 760 and they
kind<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.650> go<00:03:13.740> back<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.040> forth<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.640> how<00:03:14.880> good

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
kind of go back and forth on how good

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.600 
kind of go back and forth on how good
each<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.540> them<00:03:15.660> do<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.200> know<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.920> 760<00:03:17.460> does

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
each of them do you know the 760 does

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.370 
each of them do you know the 760 does
better<00:03:17.820> than<00:03:17.910> some<00:03:18.150> games<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.450> 7950<00:03:19.260> does

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
better than some games that 7950 does

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.530 
better than some games that 7950 does
better<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.680> some<00:03:19.890> games<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.280> put<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.150> 70<00:03:21.450> are

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
better in some games and put the 70 are

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.110 
better in some games and put the 70 are
the<00:03:21.570> 760<00:03:22.380> is<00:03:22.470> about<00:03:22.710> forty<00:03:23.100> dollars<00:03:23.430> she<00:03:23.760> a

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
the 760 is about forty dollars she a

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.170 
the 760 is about forty dollars she a
more<00:03:24.450> expensive<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.320> this<00:03:25.950> 7950<00:03:26.790> really

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
more expensive so this 7950 really

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.090 
more expensive so this 7950 really
coming<00:03:27.480> down<00:03:27.630> in<00:03:27.780> price<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:28.170> think<00:03:28.200> sooner<00:03:28.980> or

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
coming down in price I think sooner or

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.130 
coming down in price I think sooner or
later<00:03:29.220> it's<00:03:29.460> gonna<00:03:29.550> go<00:03:30.090> down<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.480> ah<00:03:30.720> two

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
later it's gonna go down that ah two

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.660 
later it's gonna go down that ah two
hundred-dollar<00:03:31.170> mark<00:03:31.950> its<00:03:32.130> gonna<00:03:32.310> be<00:03:32.460> like

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
hundred-dollar mark its gonna be like

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.810 
hundred-dollar mark its gonna be like
that<00:03:33.200> 7870<00:03:34.200> was<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:34.530> really<00:03:34.860> go<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.100> card<00:03:35.580> for

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
that 7870 was that really go to card for

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.450 
that 7870 was that really go to card for
a<00:03:35.850> mid-range<00:03:36.420> build<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.020> think<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.470> 7950<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.430> a

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
a mid-range build I think the 7950 and a

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.910 
a mid-range build I think the 7950 and a
couple<00:03:38.790> months<00:03:38.910> might<00:03:39.330> be<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.720> card<00:03:40.110> right

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
couple months might be that card right

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.080 
couple months might be that card right
now<00:03:41.100> it's<00:03:41.280> two<00:03:41.340> hundred<00:03:41.670> twenty<00:03:41.730> dollars

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
now it's two hundred twenty dollars

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.690 
now it's two hundred twenty dollars
which<00:03:42.240> is<00:03:42.270> still<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.600> fairly<00:03:42.960> decent<00:03:43.110> deal

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
which is still a fairly decent deal

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.740 
which is still a fairly decent deal

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
decent again a 7950 isn't that powerful

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.800 
decent again a 7950 isn't that powerful

that resolution it can actually run them
fairly<00:04:07.590> decent<00:04:08.220> so<00:04:08.400> keep<00:04:08.940> that<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.150> mind<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.510> 3
