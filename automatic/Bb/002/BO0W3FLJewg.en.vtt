00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.399 
at me it was looking at looking at the
brochure<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.659> he<00:02:00.750> looks<00:02:00.930> up<00:02:01.049> at<00:02:01.170> me<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.290> he

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
brochure and he looks up at me and he

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.840 
brochure and he looks up at me and he
says<00:02:02.360> we're<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.570> same<00:02:03.719> line<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.140> work<00:02:04.850> he

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
says we're in the same line of work he

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.889 
says we're in the same line of work he
said<00:02:06.060> we<00:02:06.180> r<00:02:06.210> peacemakers<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.789> I<00:02:08.789> said<00:02:09.300> yes<00:02:09.599> and

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
said we r peacemakers and I said yes and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.260 
said we r peacemakers and I said yes and
so<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:11.009> other<00:02:11.160> thing<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.459> goes<00:02:11.910> along<00:02:12.120> with

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
so the other thing that goes along with

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.820 
so the other thing that goes along with
that<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.690> my<00:02:12.780> thinking<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:13.319> I'm<00:02:13.440> putting<00:02:13.680> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
that and my thinking is I'm putting the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.660 
that and my thinking is I'm putting the
pieces<00:02:14.190> together<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.120> people<00:02:15.930> tell<00:02:16.200> us

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
pieces together is that people tell us

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.400 
pieces together is that people tell us
internationally<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.850> locally<00:02:18.410> after

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
internationally and locally after

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.750 
internationally and locally after
they've<00:02:19.560> been<00:02:19.710> through<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.010> emotional<00:02:20.400> CPR

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
they've been through the emotional CPR

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.480 
they've been through the emotional CPR
training<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:22.440> helps<00:02:22.890> them<00:02:23.070> in<00:02:23.250> all<00:02:23.460> their

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
training that it helps them in all their

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.910 
training that it helps them in all their
relationships<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:25.080> even<00:02:25.320> though<00:02:25.410> we<00:02:25.440> develop

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
relationships so even though we develop

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.860 
relationships so even though we develop
this<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.430> teach<00:02:26.850> people<00:02:26.880> skills<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.750> help

giving someone my full attention so it's

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.720 
giving someone my full attention so it's
very<00:03:51.900> validating<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.739> in<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.310> space<00:03:54.590> as

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
very validating and in that space as

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.729 
very validating and in that space as
we're<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.760> lot<00:03:56.940> of<00:03:57.030> healing<00:03:57.209> occurs<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:58.590> know

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
we're a lot of healing occurs you know

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.150 
we're a lot of healing occurs you know
where<00:03:58.890> people<00:03:59.220> feel<00:03:59.989> empowered<00:04:00.989> they<00:04:01.860> start

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
where people feel empowered they start

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.729 
where people feel empowered they start
thinking<00:04:02.670> clearer<00:04:03.540> because<00:04:04.260> they're<00:04:04.620> not

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
thinking clearer because they're not

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.190 
thinking clearer because they're not
alone<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.280> someone's<00:04:06.090> there<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:06.930> when<00:04:07.170> I

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
alone that someone's there so when I

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.940 
alone that someone's there so when I
think<00:04:07.500> about<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.950> most<00:04:08.220> important<00:04:09.950> systems

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
think about the most important systems

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.830 
think about the most important systems
change<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.610> we<00:04:11.730> need<00:04:11.959> to<00:04:13.250> engage<00:04:14.450> people<00:04:15.450> in

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
change that we need to engage people in

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.590 
change that we need to engage people in
the<00:04:16.109> process<00:04:16.260> whether<00:04:17.040> its<00:04:17.220> treatment

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
the process whether its treatment

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.469 
the process whether its treatment
supports<00:04:18.600> services<00:04:19.500> is<00:04:19.850> really<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:21.090> think

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
supports services is really I think

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.210 
supports services is really I think
we're<00:04:21.900> really<00:04:22.020> talking<00:04:22.229> about<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.560> new<00:04:22.800> social

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
we're really talking about a new social

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.410 
we're really talking about a new social
inclusion<00:04:23.760> paradigm<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:25.770> my<00:04:26.520> vision<00:04:26.820> is

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
inclusion paradigm so my vision is

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.630 
inclusion paradigm so my vision is
folding<00:04:27.690> in<00:04:27.870> America<00:04:28.800> where<00:04:29.280> everyone's

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
folding in America where everyone's

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.790 
folding in America where everyone's
included<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:30.660> in<00:04:30.780> every<00:04:31.050> community<00:04:31.410> in

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
included so in every community in

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.720 
included so in every community in
America<00:04:31.890> we<00:04:32.490> have<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.820> place<00:04:34.130> within<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.520> few

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
America we have a place within a few

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.780 
America we have a place within a few
blocks<00:04:35.790> perhaps<00:04:36.540> where<00:04:37.260> someone<00:04:37.830> in<00:04:38.340> distress

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
blocks perhaps where someone in distress

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.180 
blocks perhaps where someone in distress
and<00:04:39.300> emotional<00:04:39.660> crisis<00:04:40.020> can<00:04:40.230> go<00:04:40.500> because<00:04:41.010> they

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
and emotional crisis can go because they

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.550 
and emotional crisis can go because they
see<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.520> as<00:04:41.730> a<00:04:41.760> safe<00:04:42.060> place<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.570> they<00:04:43.140> can<00:04:43.320> go

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
see it as a safe place and they can go

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.950 
see it as a safe place and they can go
and<00:04:43.950> be<00:04:44.370> with<00:04:44.400> people<00:04:44.550> either<00:04:45.300> other<00:04:45.630> people

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
and be with people either other people

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.770 
and be with people either other people
who've<00:04:46.110> been<00:04:46.290> through<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.980> experience<00:04:47.100> and

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
who've been through the experience and

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.050 
who've been through the experience and
have<00:04:48.780> gained<00:04:48.990> wisdom<00:04:49.230> through<00:04:50.100> through

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
have gained wisdom through through

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.850 
have gained wisdom through through
emotional<00:04:51.450> crisis<00:04:51.810> seeing<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.680> as<00:04:52.770> an

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
emotional crisis seeing it as an

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.140 
emotional crisis seeing it as an
opportunity<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.460> learn<00:04:53.640> and<00:04:53.700> grow<00:04:53.970> I

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
opportunity to learn and grow I

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.580 
opportunity to learn and grow I
certainly<00:04:54.600> have<00:04:54.810> learned<00:04:54.840> an<00:04:55.320> incredible

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
certainly have learned an incredible

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.200 
certainly have learned an incredible
amount<00:04:56.840> by<00:04:57.840> coming<00:04:58.620> to<00:04:58.710> better<00:04:58.860> understand<00:04:59.580> my

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
amount by coming to better understand my

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.310 
amount by coming to better understand my
crisis<00:05:01.080> so<00:05:01.830> if<00:05:01.950> we<00:05:02.010> can<00:05:02.750> have<00:05:03.750> those<00:05:03.960> kinds<00:05:04.260> of

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
crisis so if we can have those kinds of

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.830 
crisis so if we can have those kinds of
programs<00:05:04.710> in<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.950> community<00:05:05.300> they<00:05:06.300> work<00:05:06.510> the
