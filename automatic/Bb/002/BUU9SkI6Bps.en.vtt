00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
system is pretty cool how it works you

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.260 
system is pretty cool how it works you
don't<00:03:58.200> actually<00:03:58.500> lose<00:03:59.220> your<00:03:59.250> point<00:03:59.910> streaks

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
don't actually lose your point streaks

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.630 
don't actually lose your point streaks
if<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.660> die<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.650> let's<00:04:01.890> say<00:04:02.070> you're<00:04:02.250> using<00:04:02.490> a

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
if you die so let's say you're using a

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.980 
if you die so let's say you're using a
UAV<00:04:03.210> a<00:04:03.780> counter<00:04:04.230> UAV<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:05.150> advanced<00:04:06.150> UAV<00:04:06.300> which

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
UAV a counter UAV and advanced UAV which

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.340 
UAV a counter UAV and advanced UAV which
is<00:04:07.200> acting<00:04:07.800> like<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.070> same<00:04:08.280> as<00:04:08.460> an<00:04:08.550> sr-71<00:04:09.350> so

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
is acting like the same as an sr-71 so

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.180 
is acting like the same as an sr-71 so
you're<00:04:10.680> running<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.160> 3<00:04:11.640> 4<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.560> 12<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.860> think<00:04:14.100> it

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
you're running a 3 4 and 12 I think it

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.550 
you're running a 3 4 and 12 I think it
is<00:04:14.220> for<00:04:14.760> porn<00:04:15.000> shrieks<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:15.510> let's<00:04:16.350> say<00:04:16.500> you

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
is for porn shrieks and let's say you

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.380 
is for porn shrieks and let's say you
get<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.859> kill<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.310> then<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.640> die<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:18.090> then<00:04:18.330> you

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
get a kill and then you die and then you

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.300 
get a kill and then you die and then you
get<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.540> kill<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:18.989> then<00:04:19.260> you<00:04:19.320> die<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.799> then<00:04:20.250> you

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
get a kill and then you die and then you

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.159 
get a kill and then you die and then you
get<00:04:20.459> another<00:04:20.489> kill<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.479> would<00:04:21.600> actually<00:04:21.989> get

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
get another kill you would actually get

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.310 
get another kill you would actually get
your<00:04:22.350> UAV<00:04:22.620> even<00:04:23.460> though<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:23.669> only<00:04:24.320> even

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
your UAV even though you only even

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.010 
your UAV even though you only even
though<00:04:25.410> you<00:04:25.470> got<00:04:25.740> three<00:04:26.040> kills

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
but you got two deaths along the way

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.960 
but you got two deaths along the way
your<00:04:29.690> points<00:04:30.229> get<00:04:30.440> carried<00:04:30.800> over<00:04:31.009> to<00:04:31.430> your

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970
