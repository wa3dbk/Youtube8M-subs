this<00:00:00.149> video<00:00:00.450> I'm<00:00:00.630> going<00:00:00.810> to<00:00:00.900> demonstrate<00:00:01.110> how

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
this video I'm going to demonstrate how

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.789 
this video I'm going to demonstrate how
to<00:00:01.620> install<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:03.200> connecting<00:00:04.200> rod<00:00:04.230> onto<00:00:04.650> a

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
to install a connecting rod onto a

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.059 
to install a connecting rod onto a
piston<00:00:05.220> or<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.370> piston<00:00:05.670> onto<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:05.910> connecting<00:00:06.299> rod

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
piston or a piston onto a connecting rod

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.280 
piston or a piston onto a connecting rod
using<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.160> heater<00:00:08.370> I'm<00:00:09.240> using<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.660> used<00:00:09.900> piston

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
using a heater I'm using a used piston

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.080 
using a heater I'm using a used piston
for<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.559> example<00:00:10.920> but<00:00:11.340> normally<00:00:11.820> normally

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
for this example but normally normally

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.030 
for this example but normally normally
either<00:00:12.719> have<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> cleaned<00:00:13.410> up<00:00:13.530> piston<00:00:13.889> or<00:00:14.009> a

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
either have a cleaned up piston or a

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.189 
either have a cleaned up piston or a
brand<00:00:14.370> new<00:00:14.519> piston<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.599> first<00:00:15.780> thing<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.049> do

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
brand new piston the first thing you do

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.920 
brand new piston the first thing you do
is<00:00:16.379> bring<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.650> over<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.600> this<00:00:18.600> fitting

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
is bring this over to this this fitting

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.370 
is bring this over to this this fitting
here<00:00:19.340> and<00:00:20.340> it's<00:00:20.580> got<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.730> stopper<00:00:21.240> what's<00:00:22.170> going

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
here and it's got a stopper what's going

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.259 
here and it's got a stopper what's going
to<00:00:22.439> happen<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.890> when<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:23.100> slide<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.580> risk<00:00:24.090> pin

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
to happen is when we slide this risk pin

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.490 
to happen is when we slide this risk pin
in<00:00:25.039> it<00:00:26.039> will<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.189> centered<00:00:26.960> but<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.289> push

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
in it will be centered but if you push

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.849 
in it will be centered but if you push
this<00:00:28.650> back<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> connecting<00:00:30.269> rod<00:00:30.420> is

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
this back and the connecting rod is

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.170 
this back and the connecting rod is
pushed<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.040> back<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> piston<00:00:32.700> Law<00:00:32.790> Center

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
pushed the back of the piston Law Center

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.459 
pushed the back of the piston Law Center
it'll<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.600> off-center<00:00:34.050> when<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.230> come<00:00:34.350> back

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it'll be off-center when you come back

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.920 
it'll be off-center when you come back
to<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> middle<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.930> Center

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
to the middle so what we do is we Center

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.020 
to the middle so what we do is we Center
the<00:00:36.960> risk<00:00:37.230> pin<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.590> piston<00:00:37.950> Center<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the risk pin in the piston Center the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.330 
the risk pin in the piston Center the
connecting<00:00:39.540> rod<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> wrist<00:00:40.140> pin<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> then

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
connecting rod on the wrist pin and then

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.450 
connecting rod on the wrist pin and then
slide<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.030> back<00:00:42.950> slide<00:00:43.950> them<00:00:44.100> back<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
slide it back slide them back in the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.930 
slide it back slide them back in the
unit<00:00:45.289> like<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:47.789> bit

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
unit like that so it's a little bit

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.729 
unit like that so it's a little bit
off-center<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:49.010> we'll<00:00:50.010> set<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.430> stopper

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:07.840 

so<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.920> will<00:00:56.039> stop<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.430> at<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:57.300> position

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.280 

set<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.210> height<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> depth

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
set this for the height and the depth

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:27.200 
set this for the height and the depth
here<00:01:23.000> now<00:01:24.000> while<00:01:24.210> I'm<00:01:24.330> setting<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:26.210> I'm

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
here now while I'm setting this up I'm

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.360 
here now while I'm setting this up I'm
just<00:01:27.390> going<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.690> careful<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:31.370> tighten

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
just going to be careful here tighten

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.500 
just going to be careful here tighten
the<00:01:32.520> setscrew<00:01:33.920> now<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.190> this<00:01:35.790> wrist<00:01:36.360> can

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
the setscrew now this this wrist can

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.760 
the setscrew now this this wrist can
will<00:01:36.630> come<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.990> stop<00:01:37.170> right<00:01:37.380> there<00:01:37.560> every

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
will come in and stop right there every

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.440 
will come in and stop right there every
time<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> same<00:01:38.310> things<00:01:38.520> that's<00:01:39.150> what<00:01:39.270> that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
time the same things that's what that

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.140 
time the same things that's what that
was<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.840> I've<00:01:40.620> got<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> piston<00:01:41.130> security<00:01:41.580> now

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
was for I've got the piston security now

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.030 
was for I've got the piston security now
also<00:01:42.450> something<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.290> very<00:01:43.470> careful<00:01:43.920> about

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
also something to be very careful about

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.980 
also something to be very careful about
here<00:01:44.220> when<00:01:44.370> I<00:01:44.400> set<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.030> piston<00:01:45.510> in<00:01:45.780> this

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
here when I set this piston in this

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.900 
here when I set this piston in this
fitting<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.590> looked<00:01:47.340> at<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> top<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
fitting I looked at the top of the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.580 
fitting I looked at the top of the
piston<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.479> made<00:01:48.630> sure<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.200> front<00:01:49.500> of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
piston and made sure that the front of

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.160 
piston and made sure that the front of
the<00:01:49.710> piston<00:01:49.920> was<00:01:50.580> pointed<00:01:50.940> towards<00:01:51.270> me<00:01:51.420> that's

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the piston was pointed towards me that's

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.420 
the piston was pointed towards me that's
very<00:01:52.560> important<00:01:53.010> if<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.130> put<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.369> on

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
very important if you put it on

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.920 
very important if you put it on
backwards<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:54.119> may<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.420> get<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.600> second

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
backwards you may not get a second

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.109 
backwards you may not get a second
chance<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.890> fact<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.280> whole<00:01:56.400> operation<00:01:57.000> has

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
chance in fact this whole operation has

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.570 
chance in fact this whole operation has
to<00:01:57.150> be<00:01:57.240> done<00:01:57.300> perfectly<00:01:58.100> or<00:01:59.100> else<00:01:59.220> you<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.400> to

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
to be done perfectly or else you have to

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.130 
to be done perfectly or else you have to
press<00:01:59.820> them<00:01:59.940> apart<00:02:00.060> again<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.810> often

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
press them apart again and that often

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.430 
press them apart again and that often
ruins<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:01.530> piston<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.460> really

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
ruins the piston so you really really

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.410 
ruins the piston so you really really
get<00:02:04.440> one<00:02:04.680> chance<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.220> sure<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.360> you

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
get one chance for sure on this and you

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.340 
get one chance for sure on this and you
want<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.660> make<00:02:06.750> sure<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.050> you<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.320> right

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
want to make sure that you do it right

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.850 
want to make sure that you do it right
now<00:02:08.340> we'll<00:02:08.459> place<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.970> connecting<00:02:09.540> rod<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
now we'll place a connecting rod in the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.440 
now we'll place a connecting rod in the
heater<00:02:11.040> over<00:02:11.220> here<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.670> want<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.300> make<00:02:12.420> sure

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
heater over here I want to make sure

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.520 
heater over here I want to make sure
that<00:02:12.690> I've<00:02:12.840> got<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.110> front<00:02:13.350> of<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that I've got the front of the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.570 
that I've got the front of the
connecting<00:02:13.920> rod<00:02:14.480> facing<00:02:15.480> towards<00:02:15.810> me<00:02:16.550> so<00:02:17.550> I

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
connecting rod facing towards me so I

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.250 
connecting rod facing towards me so I
look<00:02:18.090> for<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.300> marks<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.600> I've<00:02:18.780> made<00:02:18.989> that

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
look for the marks that I've made that

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.420 
look for the marks that I've made that
show<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.739> front<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.100> connecting

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
show this is the front of the connecting

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.300 
show this is the front of the connecting
rod<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.360> when<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.480> put<00:02:21.720> them<00:02:21.840> together

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
rod so that when I put them together

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.420 
rod so that when I put them together
everything<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.370> perfect<00:02:23.870> now<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.430> whole

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
everything is perfect now this whole

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.570 
everything is perfect now this whole
operation<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.959> whole<00:02:31.110> operation<00:02:31.560> has<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.489> be

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
operation this whole operation has to be

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.790 
operation this whole operation has to be
done<00:02:32.730> in<00:02:32.850> about<00:02:32.940> three<00:02:33.420> seconds<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:34.590> heat<00:02:34.769> up

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
done in about three seconds we heat up

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.259 
done in about three seconds we heat up
the<00:02:34.980> connecting<00:02:35.370> rod<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.910> it's<00:02:36.030> bigger

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
the connecting rod so that it's bigger

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.750 
the connecting rod so that it's bigger
than<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> wrist<00:02:36.750> pin<00:02:37.310> once<00:02:38.310> they're<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.580> same

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
than the wrist pin once they're the same

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.310 
than the wrist pin once they're the same
temperature<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.630> pin<00:02:39.840> actually<00:02:40.200> is

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
temperature that this pin actually is

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.840 
temperature that this pin actually is
bigger<00:02:40.530> than<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.980> hole<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.459> connecting

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
bigger than the hole in the connecting

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.300 
bigger than the hole in the connecting
rod<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:43.170> we<00:02:43.380> heat<00:02:43.530> up<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.650> connecting<00:02:44.010> rod<00:02:44.130> so

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
rod so we heat up the connecting rod so

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.290 
rod so we heat up the connecting rod so
that<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.519> bowler<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.850> little<00:02:45.000> bit<00:02:45.090> bigger

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
that the bowler is a little bit bigger

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.979 
that the bowler is a little bit bigger
and<00:02:46.160> this<00:02:47.160> will<00:02:47.310> slide<00:02:47.519> right<00:02:47.700> through

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
and this will slide right through

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.390 
and this will slide right through
through<00:02:48.989> watch<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.380> timer<00:02:49.650> when<00:02:50.040> we<00:02:50.100> put<00:02:50.280> this

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
through watch the timer when we put this

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.979 
through watch the timer when we put this
in<00:02:50.459> we<00:02:50.820> we've<00:02:51.269> been<00:02:51.420> going<00:02:51.630> for<00:02:51.780> about<00:02:51.870> a

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
in we we've been going for about a

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.470 
in we we've been going for about a
minute<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.709> watch<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.010> timer<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.640> you

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
minute you watch the timer and you

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.699 
minute you watch the timer and you
usually<00:02:54.600> leave<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.050> in<00:02:55.140> there<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.470> two

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
usually leave it in there for two

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.820 
usually leave it in there for two
minutes<00:02:57.050> if<00:02:58.050> you<00:02:58.170> don't<00:02:58.200> leave<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.680> long

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
minutes if you don't leave it in long

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.560 
minutes if you don't leave it in long
enough<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:59.280> won't<00:02:59.459> work<00:02:59.640> you<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.299> leave<00:03:00.450> it

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
enough this won't work you can leave it

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.800 
enough this won't work you can leave it
in<00:03:00.630> too<00:03:00.959> long<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:03.030> connecting<00:03:03.390> rod<00:03:03.540> gets

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
in too long the connecting rod gets

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.810 
in too long the connecting rod gets
red-hot<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.620> changes<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:04.980> properties

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
red-hot and that changes the properties

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.270 
red-hot and that changes the properties
of<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.000> metal<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:07.590> probably<00:03:07.950> don't<00:03:08.160> want

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
of the metal and you probably don't want

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.680 
of the metal and you probably don't want
to<00:03:08.310> use<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.459> connecting<00:03:09.000> rod<00:03:09.150> anymore

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
to use that connecting rod anymore

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.410 
to use that connecting rod anymore
you<00:03:09.930> throw<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.320> away<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.590> get<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.739> new<00:03:10.890> one<00:03:11.070> so

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
you throw it away and get a new one so

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
you throw it away and get a new one so
we<00:03:12.420> have<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.660> make<00:03:12.780> sure<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:12.990> doesn't<00:03:13.140> stay<00:03:13.350> in

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
we have to make sure it doesn't stay in

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.020 
we have to make sure it doesn't stay in
there<00:03:13.560> too

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
there too

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.140 
there too
and<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.120> way<00:03:16.240> to<00:03:16.300> until<00:03:16.780> it's<00:03:16.990> hot<00:03:17.170> enough<00:03:17.560> is

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
and the way to until it's hot enough is

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.580 
and the way to until it's hot enough is
that<00:03:19.150> when<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.750> pull<00:03:19.960> this<00:03:20.110> connecting<00:03:20.560> rod

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
that when you pull this connecting rod

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.740 
that when you pull this connecting rod
out<00:03:20.860> of<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.010> heater<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.640> end<00:03:22.210> of<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:22.420> will<00:03:22.570> be

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
out of the heater the end of it will be

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.930 
out of the heater the end of it will be
blue<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:24.010> see<00:03:24.040> they're<00:03:24.340> starting<00:03:24.520> to<00:03:24.790> turn

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
blue you see they're starting to turn

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.790 
blue you see they're starting to turn
slightly<00:03:25.240> blue<00:03:25.690> your<00:03:26.470> temperature<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:27.040> right

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
slightly blue your temperature is right

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:43.390 
slightly blue your temperature is right
and<00:03:29.800> so<00:03:29.980> we'll<00:03:30.100> get<00:03:30.310> ready<00:03:30.460> here

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.059 

almost<00:03:44.400> there

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.110 

and<00:03:50.069> again<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.549> pretty<00:03:50.790> intense

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
and again this is a pretty intense

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.880 
and again this is a pretty intense
operation<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.870> have<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.409> have<00:03:52.530> one<00:03:52.680> chance

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
operation you have you have one chance

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.259 
operation you have you have one chance
to<00:03:53.129> get<00:03:53.250> it<00:03:53.340> right<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.819> owe<00:03:53.849> me<00:03:53.909> I've<00:03:54.090> got

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
to get it right and you owe me I've got

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.910 
to get it right and you owe me I've got
three<00:03:54.420> seconds<00:03:54.719> to<00:03:54.810> get<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:55.049> right<00:03:55.200> but<00:03:55.829> you

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
three seconds to get it right but you

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.380 
three seconds to get it right but you
don't<00:03:56.099> want<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.340> get<00:03:56.459> too<00:03:56.609> jittery<00:03:56.849> or<00:03:57.209> you

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
don't want to get too jittery or you

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.229 
don't want to get too jittery or you
will<00:03:57.569> mess<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:57.930> up<00:03:58.549> we<00:03:59.549> did<00:03:59.700> also<00:03:59.879> make<00:04:00.209> sure

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
will mess it up we did also make sure

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.149 
will mess it up we did also make sure
before<00:04:00.540> we<00:04:00.780> before<00:04:01.379> we<00:04:01.409> started<00:04:01.829> we<00:04:01.950> made<00:04:02.129> sure

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
before we before we started we made sure

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.679 
before we before we started we made sure
that<00:04:02.519> this<00:04:02.670> wrist<00:04:03.359> pin<00:04:03.659> could<00:04:04.079> slide<00:04:04.379> smoothly

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
that this wrist pin could slide smoothly

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.809 
that this wrist pin could slide smoothly
into<00:04:06.689> the<00:04:06.780> piston<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.319> we<00:04:07.980> check<00:04:08.250> this<00:04:08.459> the

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
into the piston and we check this the

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.459 
into the piston and we check this the
bore<00:04:09.030> on<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.389> connecting<00:04:09.840> rod<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.170> make<00:04:10.319> sure

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:10.469 
bore on the connecting rod to make sure

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:13.460 
bore on the connecting rod to make sure
they<00:04:10.560> didn't<00:04:10.799> have<00:04:10.920> any<00:04:11.099> version<00:04:11.609> it<00:04:12.470> there

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
they didn't have any version it there

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.240 
they didn't have any version it there
any<00:04:13.620> burrs<00:04:13.799> this<00:04:14.040> won't<00:04:14.250> work<00:04:14.370> either<00:04:16.250> okay

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
any burrs this won't work either okay

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.120 
any burrs this won't work either okay
but<00:04:17.609> see<00:04:17.840> Dad<00:04:18.840> see<00:04:19.199> how<00:04:19.259> the<00:04:19.320> Enders<00:04:19.680> has<00:04:19.919> got<00:04:20.099> a

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
but see Dad see how the Enders has got a

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.060 
but see Dad see how the Enders has got a
blue<00:04:20.310> color<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.759> it<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:21.449> means<00:04:21.599> it's<00:04:21.780> ready

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
blue color to it that means it's ready

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.589 
blue color to it that means it's ready
so<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.099> need<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.490> get<00:04:23.820> prepared<00:04:23.910> I've<00:04:24.300> got<00:04:24.479> this

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
so I need to get prepared I've got this

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.240 
so I need to get prepared I've got this
bolt<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.080> I'm<00:04:25.169> going<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.410> use<00:04:25.590> as<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.770> tool<00:04:26.039> to

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
bolt that I'm going to use as a tool to

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.200 
bolt that I'm going to use as a tool to
install<00:04:26.370> it<00:04:28.280> pull<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.460> connecting<00:04:29.849> rod<00:04:30.000> out

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
install it pull the connecting rod out

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.610 
install it pull the connecting rod out
I've<00:04:30.419> got<00:04:30.570> about<00:04:30.630> three<00:04:30.870> seconds<00:04:31.289> to<00:04:31.410> get<00:04:31.500> it

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
I've got about three seconds to get it

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.270 
I've got about three seconds to get it
in<00:04:31.710> place<00:04:33.199> push<00:04:34.199> it<00:04:34.349> in<00:04:34.440> just<00:04:34.620> like<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:34.770> and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
in place push it in just like that and

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.310 
in place push it in just like that and
while<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.490> do<00:04:35.580> this<00:04:36.979> it<00:04:37.979> went<00:04:38.160> perfectly<00:04:39.320> after

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
while I do this it went perfectly after

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.570 
while I do this it went perfectly after
make<00:04:40.470> sure<00:04:40.560> that<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.860> risk<00:04:41.009> in<00:04:41.280> went<00:04:41.460> all<00:04:41.550> the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
make sure that the risk in went all the

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.100 
make sure that the risk in went all the
way<00:04:41.729> in<00:04:41.849> and<00:04:41.970> hit<00:04:42.090> that<00:04:42.210> stopper<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:42.930> also

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
way in and hit that stopper and I also

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.689 
way in and hit that stopper and I also
have<00:04:43.349> to<00:04:43.440> make<00:04:43.590> sure<00:04:43.800> that<00:04:44.009> the<00:04:44.190> connecting

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
have to make sure that the connecting

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.520 
have to make sure that the connecting
rod<00:04:44.910> slid<00:04:45.570> all<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.720> way<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.110> back<00:04:46.289> of<00:04:46.470> the

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
rod slid all the way to the back of the

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.310 
rod slid all the way to the back of the
piston<00:04:46.919> because<00:04:47.220> that's<00:04:47.460> how<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:47.669> set<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.060> out

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
piston because that's how I set it out

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.450 
piston because that's how I set it out
now<00:04:49.320> while<00:04:49.560> it's<00:04:49.710> hot<00:04:49.919> I'll<00:04:50.070> take<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.280> little

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
now while it's hot I'll take a little

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.899 
now while it's hot I'll take a little
bit<00:04:50.580> of<00:04:50.699> assembly<00:04:50.970> lube<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:53.460> drip<00:04:53.610> it<00:04:53.729> into

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
bit of assembly lube and drip it into

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:58.310 
bit of assembly lube and drip it into
each<00:04:54.030> side<00:04:54.330> there<00:04:56.690> that'll<00:04:57.690> help<00:04:57.720> to<00:04:57.930> cool<00:04:58.139> it

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
each side there that'll help to cool it

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.010 
each side there that'll help to cool it
help<00:04:58.650> it<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.860> seize<00:04:59.070> and<00:04:59.400> you'll<00:04:59.520> see<00:04:59.699> how<00:05:00.020> how

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
help it to seize and you'll see how how

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.860 
help it to seize and you'll see how how
that<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:02.520> capillary<00:05:03.000> action<00:05:03.180> just<00:05:03.570> causes

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
that the capillary action just causes

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.390 
that the capillary action just causes
that<00:05:03.990> assembly<00:05:04.349> to<00:05:04.590> wick<00:05:04.770> into<00:05:04.979> the<00:05:05.159> piston

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
that assembly to wick into the piston

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.120 
that assembly to wick into the piston
and<00:05:05.840> you'll<00:05:06.840> see<00:05:06.990> how<00:05:07.110> nicely<00:05:07.380> that<00:05:07.680> turns<00:05:07.979> you

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
and you'll see how nicely that turns you

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.170 
and you'll see how nicely that turns you
double-check<00:05:11.130> that<00:05:11.159> we<00:05:11.430> set<00:05:11.970> it<00:05:12.060> up<00:05:12.150> correctly

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
double-check that we set it up correctly

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.939 
double-check that we set it up correctly
with<00:05:12.659> the<00:05:12.900> arrow<00:05:13.080> on<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.409> piston<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:13.860> the

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
with the arrow on the piston and the

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:15.529 
with the arrow on the piston and the
direction<00:05:14.729> of<00:05:14.820> the<00:05:14.880> connecting<00:05:15.210> rod<00:05:15.360> but

direction of the connecting rod but

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.139 
direction of the connecting rod but
that's<00:05:15.750> how<00:05:15.900> you<00:05:15.960> do<00:05:16.110> it
