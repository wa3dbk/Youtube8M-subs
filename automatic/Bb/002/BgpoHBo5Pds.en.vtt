00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.430
 Grab a pass with only five books 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.580
 Udon-mo-cha-hara: Well, I said that I got the first 5 books to get a pass. 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.230
 but 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:26.199
 There is a book called Checkers How is it? Akahon Death 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:30.189
 Garn is you were already Yu Mentai face in addition to the red-me each Honshu in Well'm past question collection of past questions Collection 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:37.150
 There is true or not, but this time we will use red book for the time being 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:39.129
 It's this red book , but there is a way of using it. 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.220
 There are three of these 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.280
 Mi 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.640
 It is san and some do three to one 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.420
 Well this time I will use this red book 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.380
 I would like to talk about how to grasp the sky 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.730
 First one eye first one of you is but it and say something 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:02.489
 It is a place cancer that put the Akahon 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:07.170
 Please put in the place where the most I'd Do not Let's place of Akahon 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:11.250
 The most visible where there is bookshelf degree of his room Toka your own room in the house 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.840
 Near it is shot and a bite minute where the most prominent 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.720
 Oh it was who is and say or why you put in place that stands out 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.930
 yeah returned 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.620
 Fortune trying to do a little and I'll had a book open in try to open the same and the package wrote me Tokyo withdrawal 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.930
 Or 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:32.470
 Embarrassment to those of a corner without it I think you will feel that say well or I'll do study 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.710
 If you put it so, there is no motivation anna 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.740
 It is noticeable that the motivation is the highest 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.670
 Where is Red Book 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:45.710
 It is a state of whether or not there is a certain goal 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:50.600
 It is difficult even cramp motivation Taka 2 minutes of the exam students motivation study to 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:54.170
 The most prominent place in the accompanying obtained of I'm difficult Akahon rooms 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:59.780
 This alone leads to increased motivation 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.650
 So let's aim for the room in the red room Let's aim at the room Zone and place in the most prominent place of Honda 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.100
 Let's go 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:11.200
 It's a second up two, but I 'm going to open someone with a chilly weather, and I should open the red book first 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:15.010
 It's about saying questions tendencies 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:23.290
 It is a tendency to celebrate with homework type high profit 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:28.959
 For example, I Ah University of Tokyo there Kyoto University is Ukaun shop like a sound if it is Eisaku and quickly taking 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:31.190
 Voluntary service problem until about a long sentence model article I also up series chloride and the University of Tokyo 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.180
 It seems like it's no good if you ca n't read a word 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.810
 There is the Tteyuu second five degrees of questions tend to say 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.820
 I guess I have a typhoon of pride Tsu put out the problem that way 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:50.180
 If you're a teenager If you're a brother looking for multiple English skills Basic 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:51.210
 A university that is found to receive about and a perpetrator sound , and in fact is looking for a cutting edge 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.350
 Celebration by 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:59.530
 I have a say I Cape 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.130
 Students is I have a mouth if so can the problems tailored to later go this shipment 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.970
 Ne 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:11.830
 Why, for example, if you receive the University of Tokyo 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:13.340
 diffning and long sentences are about and a perpetual sword flow If you can finally get a problem grammar problem 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.519
 That is 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.890
 For example, if free English composition has not appeared 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.959
 g 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:27.220
 Studying in line does not have it in a second I think that naturally there was no first problem naturally 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:32.590
 I should not study a PC if the wave height problem does not appear in Kyoto University 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.360
 That way to that say what is not, one should not out of the leaves, but leave my Tokorokita what comes out 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:41.290
 I know properly 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:42.940
 In the altar, it 's a way to learn about the problem, so it's a waste 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.180
 In order to Do not study 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:52.310
 I think it very important to know the 10th floor trend 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.569
 Furthermore, if I understand the homework tendency, I have one more job to do , but 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.480
 Staring 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:01.450
 It is a manager of the number of chains 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:06.519
 Sense inclination Te but I know what selfishness say talk in the number of economy is it the number of geisha 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:09.090
 For example, brothers' teaching materials are translated into Japanese 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.230
 Is about 100 points 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:16.290
 Life is 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.549
 It is to say if I'm a 50-point that I study of 500 should not and doubled not of Nagasaku 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.419
 I understand 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:27.060
 It is better cost performance if you lose your study of about 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:30.249
 However only take not do 50 points where I studied swimming work But soon you study the 100 points 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.299
 This problem Fu say take up to 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:38.169
 The score is assigned to the cancer for the homework of 

00:04:34.299 --> 00:04:43.899
 It is necessary to know the manager of such a score 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:50.240
 For example, in the center test front end test, only 2 points of Grammar Unkai are opened. 

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:53.389
 But if there were only one question and six points in the text, it would be better if those who earned the decree points of the long sentence problem 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:59.090
 I'm good provisions is After taking one question 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:04.310
 Even though you can get 6 strings , you have to correct Ms. if it is a grammar problem to take the same 6 points 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:09.770
 Cost performance is better if you do a lot of study of the text when it becomes 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:13.970
 Trying to focus on study attached to this because the arm in this Yes shop in some of such 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:17.510
 It is good to know how the variables are measured 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.960
 Efficiency it well will be able to pass 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:24.090
 Well-styled homework trend 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:29.759
 If it is understood in Oma, it is easy for the development landscape scrivener label, but I regret it for the place to be published 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:35.250
 Its because where you do not have exchange is doing that and prep from Tteyuu somehow University if 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:37.560
 Preparatory school placement This is from being published to the public by rotating the nostrils 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:42.540
 Can be a guide for generations 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:47.400
 In so say good high of the Scoring Tteyuu line and the challenges of university I mean know the other Scoring 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.760
 It's a phiten that I have researched and researched the university well 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.240
 The 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:55.800
 It's almost all about using various information sources to know the manager of the background of variables 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.580
 I think it is important to keep 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:03.009
 Well this time about red book 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.930
 I said that but in Red Book, it is the goal of the exam 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:05.830
 The 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:11.770
 Hey it's goals 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:15.030
 There's a call here. If you get 60% on this problem, you can somehow get into a position 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:21.240
 It is most important to think like that 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:24.480
 Well what after that's marathon in'll ne marathon you Yes and bought the marathon at school 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:29.550
 If you run into terrorism, you will probably understand the goal 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:35.020
 It 's almost decided that the goal is 3 kilos hard and the card is 5 kilos 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:40.509
 You can run wonder if're saying up and the ball Datteko with ether Nennyo 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:42.400
 If you were planning I do not know whether the ball 6 of After running what kilometers after not'm so if I 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:46.040
 I can not do it 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:50.720
 If you don't understand the ball 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:53.510
 But I know the goal I know I can do that much 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:59.690
 I think if there is a sense of motivation 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:07:01.730
 This motivation has been shown as one of the tips to keep studying motivation 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:05.450
 I think there is something 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.030
 Someone book at all because it is the goal itself 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:11.670
 things like this 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:13.260
 Clearly that Tteyuu this there'm go up I will do it from this Oh I examined 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.440
 I think I want you to let 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:21.470
 Sound is how to use effective how to use Ina 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:26.210
 Three listed Was this video Thank you for your viewing it is more than this 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:31.910
 I talked about raising the red book three points this time 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:37.730
 Is I think that I want you to keep in examining the Tteyuu availabe homework before you buy another opened up to 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:38.570
 For example, if you were brothers science in it Once the family of the chestnut is received in Volume 1 it Center test is what I 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.490
 That 's fine 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:47.220
 Or put out even I'm not two or total below 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:50.639
 Not good at physics and field science of me today Oaza hidden side is built in you I'm Hanarekatsu way I think it was useless 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:57.990
 I should have had to score a point with something different or something 

00:07:50.639 --> 00:08:01.480
 I'm studying what Korea say Datte no good and not take a hand to study this subject and so on 

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:05.560
 Do I have to take a law exam for any flower ? 

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:10.030
 About the Internet before you buy a baby 

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:11.260
 Properly and after I Toka Admissions Guidelines put out the university in such a place Toka University Homepage 

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.790
 Please check 

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.790
 There will be another next time
