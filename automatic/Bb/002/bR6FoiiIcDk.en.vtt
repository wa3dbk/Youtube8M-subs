 hello everyone today we will learn 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.760
 Cook 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.849
 rather cook wheat porridge for 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:19.980
 cooking we need wheat 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:24.210
 cereal and water are all ingredients here's how 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.800
 I cook this porridge for one volume of cereal 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:34.790
 I take two volumes of water here from me 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:38.610
 270 grams of wheat cereal 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:43.140
 for example, for 5 servings and 650 milliliters 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:52.010
 water all this i put in the dishes with 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.010
 turn on the fire with a thick bottom 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.960
 now on high fire we bring to 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.270
 boiling add salt to taste 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.610
 Please note that when you 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.979
 sample 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.110
 cereal should not be enough stalin 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.860
 It should not be delivered a bit and 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.060
 when the water evaporates it comes to 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.500
 normal taste but after 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:27.320
 porridge boils my cover with a lid and 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.320
 make the most minimal fire 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:35.100
 and so the water we boiled I the whole thing 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:38.860

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.940
