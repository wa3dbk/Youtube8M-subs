 minus my mother's tortilla and I'm 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.340
 salivating to see that you have touched the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.050
 award that has won the award and I 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.449
 like to try then I said have

 how can I send it and two I got my 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.229
 laboratory in my kitchen besides in my 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.980
 restaurant in the part after boosting to 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.930
 to work 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.790
 a few months I was doing tests and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.470
 tests and a thousand tests and a thousand tests all 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.710
 it went wrong everything went wrong and the moment 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.090
 that began to see the light one day in 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.800
 my restaurant already when there was a believer 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.510
 in the formula magic to the client that goes 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.690
 every day in the morning to eat their 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.890
 tortilla skewers 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.710
 I put the frozen tortilla 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.750
 the result with his coffee with milk such 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.650
 me there in the kitchen 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.900
 Looking and I left I said maybe it's very 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.090
 good as they always say you took off 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.680
 this is this is from there everything 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.020
 started I started to see how I could manufacture 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.700
 many of it's still a manual job 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.050
 but make a lot to be able to reach 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.580
 all over the world we are here in madrid 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.250

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.009
 but that I here 10 days that is a 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.630
 authentic past because people are 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.520
 excites not only the Spanish that 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.070
 comes here but there is the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.810
 tortilla vueling but also the tourist 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.810

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.670
 omelette but do not know what 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.700
 is an omelette and the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.220
 test does not flip repeat what a wonder 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.899
 but then your tortilla is the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.120
 distributes is frozen has a 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.470
 top sell by Internet 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.090
 truth is a packet of 5 so that the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.459
 to balance it you put a page 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.840

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.040

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.370
 dissemination and now what has happened here 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.200
 in this market that is an authentic 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.450
 wonder and now we are going to explain 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.569
 how is the process of doing it already in your 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.510
 house no 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.730

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.290
 from in the senén mini kitchen 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.939
 to explain how it is done once 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.780
 you've brought the tortilla from here first 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:46.870
 like the tortilla knife if we passed him 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.870
 as if it were a plan and we do not press 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.329
 and we will see how the omelet takes off 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.220
 perfectly but we have a pan in 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.400
 yes it would be induction or glass ceramic in 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.879
 a house at number 5 we drop a droplet 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.879
 of oil 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.129
 We waited 45 minutes turns to 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.860
 the return and at 3 or 4 minutes to 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.890
