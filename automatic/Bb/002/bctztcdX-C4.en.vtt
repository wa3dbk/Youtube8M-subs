00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.230
 hello I think it's the fourth or fifth 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.150
 salad I prepare and I do not think 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.309
 this is the best version but if it's the 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.090
 only with chicken to see what you think 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.370
 we started peeling the potato 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.680
 and we put it in a big pot if not 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.570
 you have a kettle to heat the water 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.610
 you put water boil and then add the 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.189
 peeled potato and carrot too 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.650
 peeled if you have to heat the water 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.860
 you add it and then add plenty 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.860
 Salt 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.390
 we put them on the fire and we leave it until 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.400
 that the vegetables are tender while 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.410
 separate the breast fillet 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.040
 chicken we open it a little and the 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.040
 we pepper 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.600
 ah 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.880
 and we are going to take advantage of that we have water to 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.830
 boil to cook the breast we're going to 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.620
 leave there about 5 minutes while 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.730
 we make mayonnaise as always a 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.730
 egg lemon juice 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.899
 a pinch of salt 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.899
 and oil 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.759
 we beat if we want it thicker 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.759
 we add more oil 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.220
 and we reserve it 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.380
 as you can see the breast is already and we're going 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.380
 to chop 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.550
 and once well chopped we put it in a 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.860
 large bowl 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.810
 and we add the potato and the carrot that 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.760
 Once cooked, we cut it into pieces 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.110
 I can pass it through the mill that I 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.120
 I like that the salad has more 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.480
 bitten instead of mashing the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.480
 atrocious 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.060
 and we incorporate mayonnaise 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.600
 and we remove it well 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.100
 It's a good time to try salt 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.170
 you can also mix the hard egg 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.880
 grated or add it to the end as I do 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.610
 now you could add many other things 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.980
 like pickles olive black pepper 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.420
 red and this is already good I hope that you 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.420
 I liked a hug until then
