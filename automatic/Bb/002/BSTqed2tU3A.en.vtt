00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
people laughed and then hopefully they

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.680 
people laughed and then hopefully they
laugh<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> bit<00:03:02.550> less<00:03:02.880> when<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.239> look<00:03:03.450> gets

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
laugh a bit less when the look gets

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.380 
laugh a bit less when the look gets
slightly<00:03:03.930> stronger<00:03:04.890> in<00:03:05.100> your<00:03:05.280> eye<00:03:05.390> basically

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
slightly stronger in your eye basically

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.080 
slightly stronger in your eye basically
