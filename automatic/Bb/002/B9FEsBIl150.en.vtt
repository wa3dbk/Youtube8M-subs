full-scale heli it was really cool to

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.210 
full-scale heli it was really cool to
see<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.870> dynamic<00:00:57.320> between<00:00:57.470> James<00:00:57.920> D'Arcy

designed<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.479> know<00:01:08.540> James<00:01:08.810> even<00:01:09.140> knew<00:01:09.290> stuff

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
designed you know James even knew stuff

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.620 
designed you know James even knew stuff
that<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.040> full-scale<00:01:10.400> heli<00:01:10.640> had<00:01:10.880> that<00:01:11.420> truck

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
that the full-scale heli had that truck

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.270 
that the full-scale heli had that truck
was<00:01:11.750> actually<00:01:11.869> surprises<00:01:12.619> because<00:01:12.770> James<00:01:13.130> is

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
was actually surprises because James is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.130 
was actually surprises because James is
so<00:01:13.400> in<00:01:13.549> tune<00:01:13.580> with<00:01:13.850> RC<00:01:14.330> helis<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:14.780> believe<00:01:15.080> it

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
so in tune with RC helis and believe it

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.840 
so in tune with RC helis and believe it
or<00:01:15.200> not<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.470> lot<00:01:15.500> of<00:01:15.830> it<00:01:15.920> carries<00:01:16.280> over<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:16.729> then

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
or not a lot of it carries over and then

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.899 
or not a lot of it carries over and then
a<00:01:16.880> lot<00:01:17.060> of<00:01:17.149> it<00:01:17.270> is<00:01:17.359> different<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:18.850> once<00:01:19.850> they

a lot of it is different and once they
did<00:01:19.999> their<00:01:20.149> walk-around<00:01:20.630> actually<00:01:21.229> before
