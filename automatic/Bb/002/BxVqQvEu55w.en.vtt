00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
believe because he was such a prevalent

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.749 
believe because he was such a prevalent
villain<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.600> first<00:01:42.869> game<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.640> wanna<00:01:44.640> know

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
on here because i think that there is a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.450 
on here because i think that there is a
high<00:01:59.610> high<00:02:00.000> high<00:02:00.479> chance<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:02.219> actually

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
high high high chance of this actually

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.880 
high high high chance of this actually
being<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.180> possibility<00:02:03.990> but<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.560> i<00:02:04.649> said<00:02:04.680> i

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
definitely think that this is an

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.000 
definitely think that this is an
interesting<00:03:21.480> discussion<00:03:22.110> even<00:03:22.709> though<00:03:22.920> it's

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
interesting discussion even though it's

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.500 
interesting discussion even though it's
a<00:03:23.040> little<00:03:23.310> bit<00:03:23.430> weird<00:03:23.760> compared<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.329> what<00:03:24.450> i

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
it's a little bit weird um maybe I guess

it's a little bit weird um maybe I guess
I<00:04:41.340> me<00:04:41.460> know<00:04:41.520> what<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:41.700> guys<00:04:41.790> think<00:04:42.030> he<00:04:42.210> looks

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
I me know what you guys think he looks

I me know what you guys think he looks
pretty<00:04:42.510> cool<00:04:42.810> but<00:04:43.590> I<00:04:43.620> definitely<00:04:43.830> expect<00:04:44.370> to

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
pretty cool but I definitely expect to

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.800 
pretty cool but I definitely expect to
see<00:04:44.550> this<00:04:44.640> in<00:04:44.700> the<00:04:44.730> universe<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.060> not<00:04:45.480> say<00:04:45.690> it's

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
see this in the universe to not say it's

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.030 
see this in the universe to not say it's
going<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.990> happen<00:04:46.110> but<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.710> is<00:04:46.800> a<00:04:46.830> high

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
going to happen but it is a high

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.530 
going to happen but it is a high
possibility<00:04:47.250> I<00:04:47.730> would<00:04:47.820> assume<00:04:48.180> because<00:04:48.390> it

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
possibility I would assume because it

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.450 
possibility I would assume because it
was<00:04:48.660> such<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.840> prevalent<00:04:49.110> character<00:04:49.680> in<00:04:50.100> that

was such a prevalent character in that

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.830 
was such a prevalent character in that
story<00:04:50.820> but<00:04:51.270> I've<00:04:51.360> been<00:04:51.420> stretching<00:04:51.720> this

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
story but I've been stretching this
