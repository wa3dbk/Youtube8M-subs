the Pacific Crest Trail which starts in
California<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.220> goes<00:00:26.400> all<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.789> way<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.060> think

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
California and goes all the way I think

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.390 
California and goes all the way I think
it<00:00:27.599> goes<00:00:27.750> all<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.930> way<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> Canada<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:29.189> she

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
it goes all the way to Canada but she

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.849 
it goes all the way to Canada but she
hiked<00:00:29.609> adjust<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.689> Washington<00:00:31.470> border

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
hiked adjust to the Washington border

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.670 
hiked adjust to the Washington border
and<00:00:32.040> when<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.189> say<00:00:32.520> just<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.300> don't<00:00:34.140> mean<00:00:34.380> just

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
and when I say just I don't mean just

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.729 
and when I say just I don't mean just
because<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.820> long<00:00:36.059> hike<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:37.200> serious

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
because the long hike and very serious

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.830 
because the long hike and very serious
and<00:00:38.129> took<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.610> lot<00:00:38.820> she<00:00:39.239> was<00:00:39.360> dealing<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
and took a lot she was dealing with the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.479 
and took a lot she was dealing with the
devastation<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.530> her<00:00:40.620> mother's<00:00:40.920> deaths<00:00:41.219> and

devastation of her mother's deaths and

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.880 
devastation of her mother's deaths and
basically<00:00:41.850> her<00:00:42.450> family<00:00:42.960> fell<00:00:43.200> apart<00:00:43.530> after

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
basically her family fell apart after

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.029 
basically her family fell apart after
that<00:00:44.219> point<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.850> she<00:00:44.910> was<00:00:45.239> an<00:00:45.660> orphan<00:00:45.899> at<00:00:46.410> 22

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
that point so she was an orphan at 22

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.799 
that point so she was an orphan at 22
but<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.610> know<00:00:47.730> didn't<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> family

love<00:01:39.000> stories<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.570> people<00:01:39.840> deciding<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.439> do

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
love stories of people deciding to do

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
when people tell them it doesn't make

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.780 
when people tell them it doesn't make
sense<00:01:45.270> or<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.470> should<00:01:46.710> train<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.430> several

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
sense or you should train for several

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.670 
sense or you should train for several
years<00:01:48.030> first<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:48.659> whatever<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.140> mean<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.500> that

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
I like people putting themselves in

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.969 
I like people putting themselves in
terrible<00:01:51.420> danger<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:52.320> they<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:52.770> people

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
terrible danger but they like people

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.100 
terrible danger but they like people
deciding<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.729> do<00:01:53.880> big<00:01:54.119> things<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.750> then<00:01:54.899> doing

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
deciding to do big things and then doing

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.350 
deciding to do big things and then doing
them<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.649> subtitle<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.250> wild<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.850> from<00:01:57.090> lost

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360

to found on the Pacific Crest Trail

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.950 
to found on the Pacific Crest Trail
which<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.880> so<00:01:59.969> interesting<00:02:00.509> because<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
which is so interesting because it's a

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.690 
which is so interesting because it's a
point<00:02:01.229> that's<00:02:01.439> made<00:02:01.530> often<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> book

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
point that's made often in the book

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.609 
point that's made often in the book
which<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.270> when<00:02:03.810> you're<00:02:03.960> taking<00:02:04.380> on

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
which is that when you're taking on

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.740 
which is that when you're taking on
something<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:06.030> hiking<00:02:06.570> this

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
something like this like hiking this

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.889 
something like this like hiking this
trail<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.950> actually<00:02:08.520> cannot<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.450> think

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
trail you actually cannot really think

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.950 
trail you actually cannot really think
beyond<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.830> basic<00:02:11.400> parts<00:02:11.730> of

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
beyond the basic parts of

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.770 
beyond the basic parts of
survival<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:13.130> one<00:02:13.730> step<00:02:14.090> in<00:02:14.300> front<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.660> the

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
survival and one step in front of the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.780 
survival and one step in front of the
other<00:02:14.990> you<00:02:15.650> don't<00:02:15.800> really<00:02:16.070> get<00:02:16.250> these<00:02:16.490> moments

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
other you don't really get these moments

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.820 
other you don't really get these moments
of<00:02:17.150> deep<00:02:17.450> reflection<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.410> kind<00:02:18.740> of

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
of deep reflection that you kind of

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.000 
of deep reflection that you kind of
expect<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:20.060> then<00:02:20.240> at<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.660> end<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:21.380> find<00:02:21.650> that

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
expect but then at the end you find that

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.830 
expect but then at the end you find that
you're<00:02:22.130> not<00:02:22.310> where<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.670> started<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.390> took<00:02:23.720> this

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
you're not where you started I took this

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.930 
you're not where you started I took this
solo<00:02:24.110> trip<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.530> Germany<00:02:24.890> last<00:02:25.130> year<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.760> I

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
solo trip to Germany last year and I

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.610 
solo trip to Germany last year and I
thought<00:02:26.270> oh<00:02:26.540> well<00:02:26.720> have<00:02:26.990> all<00:02:27.110> this<00:02:27.260> time<00:02:27.560> to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
thought oh well have all this time to

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.300 
thought oh well have all this time to
read<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.640> reflect<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.900> think<00:02:29.930> about<00:02:30.920> you

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
read and reflect and think about you

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.460 
read and reflect and think about you
know<00:02:31.460> what's<00:02:31.880> going<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.660> everything<00:02:32.930> and

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
know what's going on and everything and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.800 
know what's going on and everything and
I<00:02:33.590> discovered<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.160> when<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.460> was<00:02:34.700> there<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.270> was

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
I discovered that when I was there I was

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.020 
I discovered that when I was there I was
just<00:02:36.080> there<00:02:36.290> like<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.830> didn't<00:02:37.160> have<00:02:37.460> all<00:02:37.910> of

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
just there like I didn't have all of

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.580 
just there like I didn't have all of
this<00:02:38.120> other<00:02:38.300> stuff<00:02:38.390> with<00:02:38.870> me<00:02:39.020> I<00:02:39.050> didn't<00:02:39.440> I

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
this other stuff with me I didn't I

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.830 
this other stuff with me I didn't I
didn't<00:02:40.370> feel<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:40.700> introspective<00:02:41.450> really

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
didn't feel that introspective really

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.360 
didn't feel that introspective really
even<00:02:42.080> though<00:02:42.170> I<00:02:42.200> expected<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.100> did

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
even though I expected to and I did

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.280 
even though I expected to and I did
write<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.640> lot<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.240> did<00:02:44.510> read<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> lot<00:02:44.930> but<00:02:45.230> you

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
write a lot and I did read a lot but you

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.320 
write a lot and I did read a lot but you
expect<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.710> have<00:02:45.860> these<00:02:46.040> profound<00:02:46.610> moments

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
expect to have these profound moments

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.880 
expect to have these profound moments
and<00:02:47.540> instead<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.050> find<00:02:48.200> yourself<00:02:48.620> standing

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
and instead you find yourself standing

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.560 
and instead you find yourself standing
in<00:02:49.160> front<00:02:49.250> of<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.490> castle<00:02:49.910> just<00:02:50.090> thinking<00:02:50.450> like

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
in front of a castle just thinking like

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.330 
in front of a castle just thinking like
what<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.960> beautiful<00:02:51.200> castle<00:02:51.710> then<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.160> come

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
what a beautiful castle then you come

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.130 
what a beautiful castle then you come
home<00:02:52.490> and<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:52.790> find<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.480> did<00:02:53.750> change

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
home and you find that you did change

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.630 
home and you find that you did change
even<00:02:54.500> if<00:02:54.710> you<00:02:54.800> didn't<00:02:55.070> have<00:02:55.190> these<00:02:55.340> big

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
even if you didn't have these big

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.550 
even if you didn't have these big
sweeping<00:02:56.090> moments<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:56.750> expected<00:02:57.320> to

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
sweeping moments that you expected to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.470 
sweeping moments that you expected to
the<00:02:58.040> experience<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.880> had<00:02:59.030> really<00:02:59.330> did

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
the experience that you had really did

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.210 
the experience that you had really did
change<00:02:59.510> you<00:03:00.020> every<00:03:00.470> friend<00:03:00.680> that<00:03:00.800> I<00:03:00.830> had<00:03:01.040> who

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
it I forced to read after I read it and
