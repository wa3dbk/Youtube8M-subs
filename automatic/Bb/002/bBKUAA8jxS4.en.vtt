example in the summer and the pond can

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.289 
example in the summer and the pond can
literally<00:01:55.320> invert<00:01:55.770> or<00:01:55.950> flip<00:01:56.189> over<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.759> when

literally invert or flip over and when
it<00:01:57.420> does<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.079> whole<00:01:58.259> pond<00:01:58.500> will<00:01:58.649> turn<00:01:58.829> black

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
it does the whole pond will turn black

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.670 
it does the whole pond will turn black
the<00:01:59.759> oxygen<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.750> pulled<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> water

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
the oxygen is is pulled out of the water

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.850 
the oxygen is is pulled out of the water
rapidly<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:03.000> quite<00:02:03.840> amazing<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:04.680> any

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
rapidly and it's quite amazing if any

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.999 
rapidly and it's quite amazing if any
fish<00:02:05.130> survives<00:02:05.579> that's<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.090> there<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.479> so

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
fish survives that's in there and so

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.309 
fish survives that's in there and so
muck<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.629> primary<00:02:09.629> reason<00:02:09.989> why<00:02:10.110> that's

that and it's good if it stays trapped

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.180 
that and it's good if it stays trapped

but if it's ever you know agitated and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.680 
but if it's ever you know agitated and
released<00:02:23.550> then<00:02:23.970> you've<00:02:24.090> got<00:02:24.270> some<00:02:24.510> major

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
released then you've got some major

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.530 
released then you've got some major
problems<00:02:25.610> small<00:02:26.610> pots<00:02:26.880> can<00:02:27.120> run<00:02:27.300> into<00:02:27.510> a

and<00:02:29.730> although<00:02:30.240> fish<00:02:30.600> are<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.840> major<00:02:31.110> factor<00:02:31.470> I

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
and although fish are a major factor I

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.380 
and although fish are a major factor I
think<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.250> lot<00:02:32.460> of<00:02:32.490> issues<00:02:32.910> with<00:02:33.090> small

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390

these<00:02:56.790> are<00:02:57.000> problems<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.450> most<00:02:57.720> people

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
these are problems that most people

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
really don't want to go through so you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.830

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
evaluating it if it has any age or if it

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.920 
evaluating it if it has any age or if it
hasn't<00:03:11.310> been<00:03:11.370> cleaned<00:03:11.550> in<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.940> while<00:03:12.150> there's<00:03:12.810> a

at is aeration and this has been a

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.759 
at is aeration and this has been a
summer<00:04:15.060> where<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.810> probably<00:04:16.200> talked<00:04:16.530> about

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
summer where I probably talked about

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.940 
summer where I probably talked about
aeration<00:04:17.180> more<00:04:18.180> than<00:04:18.510> any<00:04:18.750> other<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.169> usually

aeration more than any other I usually

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.500 
aeration more than any other I usually
do<00:04:20.100> every<00:04:20.400> summer<00:04:20.640> but<00:04:20.940> this<00:04:21.120> year<00:04:21.330> has<00:04:21.450> been

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
do every summer but this year has been

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.560 
do every summer but this year has been
so<00:04:21.930> hot<00:04:22.200> so<00:04:22.919> stifling<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:24.180> we've<00:04:24.330> talked

about<00:04:24.690> aeration<00:04:25.110> at<00:04:25.410> length<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.890> I'll

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
about aeration at length and I'll

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.690 
about aeration at length and I'll
continue<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.460> do<00:04:26.700> so

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
continue to do so

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.420
