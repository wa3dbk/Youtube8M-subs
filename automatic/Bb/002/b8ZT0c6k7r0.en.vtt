there we're also going to need on the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.450 
there we're also going to need on the
first<00:01:43.820> step<00:01:44.360> we're<00:01:45.350> going<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.770> need<00:01:45.979> part

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
first step we're going to need part

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.749 
first step we're going to need part
number<00:01:46.820> 85<00:01:47.920> for<00:01:48.920> 1<00:01:49.159> 4<00:01:49.579> -<00:01:49.909> 4<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:51.579> if<00:01:52.579> you'll

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
number 85 for 1 4 - 4 and if you'll

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.179 
number 85 for 1 4 - 4 and if you'll
remember<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.450> be<00:01:54.140> for<00:01:54.649> one<00:01:54.799> of<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:54.979> first

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
remember and be for one of the first

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:56.859 
remember and be for one of the first
steps<00:01:55.460> we<00:01:55.640> went<00:01:55.820> ahead<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.149> labeled<00:01:56.329> our<00:01:56.630> bags

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
steps we went ahead and labeled our bags

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.359 
steps we went ahead and labeled our bags
so<00:01:57.380> they're<00:01:57.530> easy<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:57.890> find

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
so they're easy to find

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.529 
so they're easy to find
85<00:01:59.210> for<00:01:59.539> 1/4<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:00.700> we're<00:02:01.700> going<00:02:01.909> to<00:02:02.030> need<00:02:02.180> two

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
85 for 1/4 and we're going to need two

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.919 
85 for 1/4 and we're going to need two
pieces<00:02:02.810> of<00:02:03.079> -<00:02:03.560> 4<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:05.270> really<00:02:05.570> need<00:02:05.719> to<00:02:05.810> be

pieces of - 4 you really need to be

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.359 
pieces of - 4 you really need to be
careful<00:02:06.350> when<00:02:06.500> you're<00:02:06.590> opening<00:02:06.649> up<00:02:07.189> these

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
careful when you're opening up these

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.940 
careful when you're opening up these
bags<00:02:07.640> because<00:02:08.210> parts<00:02:08.750> do<00:02:08.990> fall<00:02:09.229> off<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.679> trees

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
bags because parts do fall off the trees

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.520 
bags because parts do fall off the trees
and<00:02:10.540> you<00:02:11.540> don't<00:02:11.690> want<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.900> get<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.050> messed<00:02:12.350> up

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
and you don't want to get a messed up

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.700 
and you don't want to get a messed up
and<00:02:12.950> not<00:02:13.250> be<00:02:13.400> able<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.640> find<00:02:13.880> them<00:02:14.000> later<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:15.230> we

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
and not be able to find them later so we

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.050 
and not be able to find them later so we
need<00:02:16.010> two<00:02:16.430> part<00:02:16.940> number<00:02:17.420> -<00:02:17.750> fours<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:19.340> we're

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
need two part number - fours and we're

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.220 
need two part number - fours and we're
going<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.480> look<00:02:20.750> at<00:02:20.900> our

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
three and we're going to see that part

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.420 
three and we're going to see that part
fours<00:02:25.430> are<00:02:25.790> right<00:02:26.720> here<00:02:27.019> you<00:02:27.739> can<00:02:27.860> take<00:02:28.099> a<00:02:28.129> look

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
fours are right here you can take a look

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.100

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
you look at your tree you're gonna see

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.199 
you look at your tree you're gonna see
that<00:02:38.299> they're<00:02:38.569> marked<00:02:39.170> with<00:02:39.319> a<00:02:39.349> number<00:02:40.209> on

that they're marked with a number on

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.020 
that they're marked with a number on
this<00:02:41.959> one<00:02:42.170> which<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.129> actually<00:02:43.549> eighty<00:02:43.760> five

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
this one which is actually eighty five

this one which is actually eighty five
four<00:02:44.390> one<00:02:44.569> four<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.260> then<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.860> parts<00:02:46.160> are

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
four one four and then the parts are

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.250 
four one four and then the parts are
individually<00:02:46.879> numbered<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.420> there's<00:02:48.200> a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
individually numbered and there's a

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.399 
individually numbered and there's a
number<00:02:48.590> four<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:49.129> between<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.579> two<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.790> these

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
number four in between the two of these

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.860 
number four in between the two of these
signaling<00:02:51.409> that<00:02:51.590> there<00:02:51.799> are<00:02:52.010> two<00:02:52.430> pieces<00:02:52.870> so

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
signaling that there are two pieces so

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.920 
signaling that there are two pieces so
we're<00:02:54.049> going<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.200> go<00:02:54.349> ahead<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:55.720> cut<00:02:56.720> those

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
we're going to go ahead and cut those

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.339 
we're going to go ahead and cut those
off<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.379> our<00:02:57.500> tree<00:03:00.069> in<00:03:01.299> place<00:03:02.299> make<00:03:02.959> sure<00:03:02.989> that

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
off of our tree in place make sure that

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.190 
off of our tree in place make sure that
no<00:03:03.530> parts<00:03:03.890> fell<00:03:04.129> off<00:03:04.780> we're<00:03:05.780> gonna<00:03:05.870> go<00:03:06.079> ahead

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
no parts fell off we're gonna go ahead

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.490 
no parts fell off we're gonna go ahead
and<00:03:06.709> place<00:03:07.040> this<00:03:07.310> tree<00:03:07.840> back<00:03:08.840> into<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.290> bag

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
and place this tree back into the bag

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.819 
and place this tree back into the bag
that's<00:03:10.489> marked<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.150> we<00:03:11.269> know<00:03:11.390> exactly<00:03:11.829> where

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
that's marked so we know exactly where

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.830 
that's marked so we know exactly where
stuff<00:03:13.129> is<00:03:13.340> for<00:03:13.579> the<00:03:13.609> next<00:03:13.910> step<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.450> it's<00:03:14.750> a

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
stuff is for the next step and it's a

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.270 
stuff is for the next step and it's a
ziploc<00:03:15.200> bag<00:03:15.470> we're<00:03:15.709> going<00:03:15.829> to<00:03:15.920> go<00:03:16.010> ahead<00:03:16.099> and

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
ziploc bag we're going to go ahead and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.550 
ziploc bag we're going to go ahead and
seal<00:03:16.519> that<00:03:16.549> up<00:03:19.540> as<00:03:20.540> we<00:03:20.810> mentioned<00:03:21.140> before<00:03:21.200> in

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
seal that up as we mentioned before in

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.680 
seal that up as we mentioned before in
previous<00:03:21.709> videos<00:03:22.340> we're<00:03:22.609> really<00:03:23.060> suggests

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
previous videos we're really suggests

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.400 
previous videos we're really suggests
that<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.900> trim<00:03:24.200> off<00:03:24.230> all<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:25.150> excess<00:03:26.410> flanges

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
that you trim off all the excess flanges

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.890 
that you trim off all the excess flanges
and<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:28.190> whatnot<00:03:28.669> off<00:03:28.819> of<00:03:29.030> your<00:03:29.239> your<00:03:29.540> parts

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
and and whatnot off of your your parts

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.920 
and and whatnot off of your your parts
it<00:03:30.079> makes<00:03:30.260> sort<00:03:30.470> of<00:03:30.530> much<00:03:30.739> better<00:03:30.980> fit<00:03:31.340> built

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
it makes sort of much better fit built

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.420 
it makes sort of much better fit built
you<00:03:32.930> can<00:03:33.049> use<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.260> hobby<00:03:33.530> knife<00:03:33.769> to<00:03:34.010> go<00:03:34.130> ahead

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
you can use a hobby knife to go ahead

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.670 
you can use a hobby knife to go ahead
and<00:03:34.700> clean<00:03:35.569> those<00:03:35.750> up<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.079> rest<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.530> way

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
and clean those up the rest of the way

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.650 
and clean those up the rest of the way
so<00:03:37.400> we<00:03:37.519> have<00:03:37.810> two<00:03:38.810> of<00:03:38.930> these<00:03:39.079> units<00:03:40.359> we<00:03:41.359> are

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
so we have two of these units we are

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.650 
so we have two of these units we are
also<00:03:42.519> going<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.700> need<00:03:45.609> going<00:03:46.609> down<00:03:46.970> parts

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
also going to need going down parts
