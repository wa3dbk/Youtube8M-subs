the<00:03:19.860> place<00:03:20.100> was<00:03:20.340> just<00:03:20.460> packed<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:22.040> how<00:03:23.040> we

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
the place was just packed and how we

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.180 
the place was just packed and how we
went<00:03:23.340> out<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:24.810> embodies<00:03:25.350> everything<00:03:25.620> that

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
went out it embodies everything that

that<00:03:28.950> sharing<00:03:29.520> that<00:03:29.640> moment<00:03:29.790> with<00:03:29.970> coach

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
that sharing that moment with coach

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.270 
that sharing that moment with coach
right<00:03:30.480> after<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.810> game<00:03:30.960> when<00:03:31.800> she<00:03:31.830> hugged<00:03:32.190> me

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
right after the game when she hugged me

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.580 
right after the game when she hugged me
and<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:33.210> all<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.450> could<00:03:33.660> do<00:03:33.780> was<00:03:33.810> just<00:03:34.080> cry<00:03:34.230> in<00:03:34.500> her

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.570 
and I all I could do was just cry in her
arms<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.070> just<00:03:35.490> kind<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.450> showed<00:03:37.310> how<00:03:38.310> our
