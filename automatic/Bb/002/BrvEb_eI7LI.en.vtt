00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:01.719
 that's true, though 

00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:06.120
 all available data are on these memory cards Marshall tries them on 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.120
 your paal 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:13.649
 These cards are high risk 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:16.650
 because they contain in addition to the long winter break in the 18th 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.920
 On the island of Panau we also got Daimler Moslems for the price 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.600
 under League under pressure and took to the back of a lot of mischief 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.099
 Hanau that sounds almost embarrassing to say where is that supposed to 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.270
 be exactly in Southeast Asia so almost always more of Bavaria 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.720
 Well, hockey Canada too 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.490
 the Afghans what 2 the first outing percent of Ricoh and this on the ps3 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.540
 and the operations seemed only for ps2 more 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.780
 "We also do not want to jump on the flags and start talking about it 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.580
 the loss through cutscenes 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.460
 finally look better yes that was not hard 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.180
 you have to win yourself 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.150
 often where is not to help 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.830
 even better in Schoenefeld because they have one in the German Synchro 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.350
 which the Spanish accent percent is main character omitted 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.290
 it is complemented by its sign 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.800
 Officials of the Engine Victory are said to reveal this at a conspiracy 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.340
 for it 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.070
 three of the bene group man of course done orders version for too 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.090
 the moose are 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.090
 In order for the orders to be directed in this country actually 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.740
 Chaos so one destroys cars one destroys factories one destroys 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.450
 Military assets percent 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.080
 it's gonna be people style stuff here 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.170
 and so on and so forth in this mission, for example, shall we 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.760
 holding car drives 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.930
 Escort Erb and in this case disarm such an explosive charge 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.810
 so that not only is geballert 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.000
 whoever is not 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.440
 or grappling hook 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.450
 the 2 1 of the highlights in the first part 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.200
 More of that should be because you can take on or against 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.380
 get back to themselves and attach to the building and warn each other 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.730
 as you can see it from Claus KOSSAG and o 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.200
 and it is also a nice change 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 hate all destructiveness 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.600
 defusing music connoisseurs quicktime events as well as when 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.569
 man Mauth OK ORF at 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.309
 that's one of the minimum wage 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:17.169
 Here we are to escort this technician 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.689
 In addition to emission, the biggest weakness of the game is ours 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:25.609
 played finally work around namely the Koi all cameras here 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.819
 No, because we should accompany during the Main barrage ranks or is from 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.849
 his name has been completed so far 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.529
 Sandweg accordingly annoying if the mission is a completely new 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.119
 to begin 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:38.680
 there lies the snow and ice food compared to cocaine 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.079
 weeping crept 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.779
 So the island is huge big Neonet 3 4 meters also has several climates so 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:46.989
 Stachnik like here 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.939
 there are tropical zones there are big city routes 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.839
 there are small villages 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.839
 as a first measure 5 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:04.739
 Year for me in the first part already so loved 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.610
 we see again no one gets his land 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.529
 this is new yes 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:10.409
 after are more dynamic 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.409
 Dr 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.480
 it's the extent that drives the first few lines to be sure it has me 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:16.989
 already killed a bit 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.459
 That's not even more to discover in the second part when you have all Secrets 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.319
 every little mission makes all of them liberated, I think well over an hour 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.269
 Chief of 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.269
 where that is a good investment in such a good investment 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.039
 if only a window and friends of the first part 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.789
 should risk those for this look at you have however over lacking 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.799
 Carrier and little change in the scenes 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.239
 So I always knew that what's great again 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.260
 that was the most important thing
