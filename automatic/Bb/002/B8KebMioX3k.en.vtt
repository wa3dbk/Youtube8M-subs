slide there with the location so you can

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160 
slide there with the location so you can
get<00:01:07.280> really<00:01:07.550> close<00:01:07.940> I<00:01:08.330> mean<00:01:08.570> if<00:01:08.780> I<00:01:08.900> was<00:01:08.930> trying

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
get really close I mean if I was trying

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.570 
get really close I mean if I was trying
to<00:01:09.320> get<00:01:09.470> let's<00:01:09.710> say<00:01:09.830> I<00:01:09.860> was<00:01:10.010> trying<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.400> get<00:01:10.490> to

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
to get let's say I was trying to get to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.660 
to get let's say I was trying to get to
350<00:01:11.080> then<00:01:12.080> I'd<00:01:12.170> probably<00:01:12.380> just<00:01:12.620> go<00:01:12.770> something

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
350 then I'd probably just go something

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.740 
350 then I'd probably just go something
like<00:01:13.700> that<00:01:14.090> then<00:01:14.870> scroll<00:01:15.260> over<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.620> few<00:01:15.830> pages

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
like that then scroll over a few pages

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.980 
like that then scroll over a few pages
and<00:01:17.750> then<00:01:18.470> let's<00:01:18.680> see<00:01:18.830> where<00:01:18.950> i'm<00:01:19.070> at<00:01:19.190> now<00:01:19.990> that

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
and then let's see where i'm at now that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.240 
and then let's see where i'm at now that
i<00:01:22.960> was<00:01:23.960> trying<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.230> get<00:01:24.380> to

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.790 

and<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:28.970> another<00:01:29.210> way<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.450> navigate<00:01:30.080> is<00:01:30.560> this

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
and so another way to navigate is this

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.320 
and so another way to navigate is this
scroll<00:01:31.100> bar<00:01:31.310> here<00:01:31.520> at<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.700> bottom<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.150> that

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
scroll bar here at the bottom and that

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.730 
scroll bar here at the bottom and that
