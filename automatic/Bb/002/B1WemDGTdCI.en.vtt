00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.420
 i 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.009
 and with two guys I have a boyfriend of 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.809
 michael good guys three I bring the 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.400
 review and tutorial of this we have not 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.530
 called to leave a little volume 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.530
 to this I bring you a new one 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.850
 called the ukip the stars the review the 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.260
 installation that good everything to be a way 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.840
 that we add as the name says 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.270
 block of luck that is craft ea 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.440
 this way in the storage room they are 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.210
 doing in the lower right 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.270
 with this screen this is very simple 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.150
 with gold and gold and a drop the hiccup but 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.710
 guys, when we go 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.990
 when we break them, something will come out 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.420
 random but when we create a new 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.400
 world is not going to generate a structure 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.260
 of four in which you will have a look and 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.690
 block or can they expose in a world 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.670
 normal and we break so that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.710
 or leave so we can get a 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.899
 normal world so without the structure 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.280
 it's just like that but it's good you're going to 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.060
 buy some things here we go to 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.770
 break that gives us 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.300
 but a block of diamond seems to us 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:06.360
 Very very cool that it gives us this 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.060
 drop ers global is very good 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.900
 effects can be bad and very good or 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.900
 regular voucher 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.130
 for some three more 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.660
 not have until we miss a something 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.210
 more does not look at an egg of interest as 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.090
 they saw there to see 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.369
 there is a trap that is supposed to be 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.690
 that appears good would be this union and 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.680
 first boy passes the installation of 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.690
 this mod 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.369
 this as quickly as possible but good the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.409
 mote is very simple example that luck 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.900
 that can do bad things and things 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.670
 good so let's go to the installation and 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.960
 guys from here the installation of the motive 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.460
 good boy first of all tell them 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.610
 that to install this mode we are going to 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.380
 Need force as here indicates it is worth 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.060
 good for the 92 not teach comment the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.159
 forum since I have a video of more or 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.649
 minus 6 minutes of how to install it step 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.270
 step by step so that if what 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.429
 have installed there in this video that 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.310
 are the inscription and learn how to 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.660
 install it step by step and good you have 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.310
 in the installed forum what we will have 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.869
 what to do is go to the page of the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.369
 way that gestates as you can see here we 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.130
 he says he can own us can 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.019
 expose mods and tennessee and others not 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.060
 many things that can expose us as 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.130
 and this in this image that we see here and 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.780
 we will return to the lucky blocks installation 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.930
 here below the image and we give you here a 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.239
 says r vale 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.760
 although not direct to the look page and 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.799
 blogs blogger look and blog and here 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.510
 let's go to the action says download and the 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.709
 version that this mode is worth but to 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.239
 change the installation simply 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.689
 change the title of the video and it's worth 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.280
 ok what blogs and there is not the page 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:40.090
 Atf there where we have to wait for some 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.660
 five seconds and 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.730
 both raisins and drop advertising and 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.590
 ready it's going to download us as for 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.870
 that I had previously downloaded 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.310
 but good here we have another though 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.190
 guys what we have to do now is 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.200
 go here to see what we say we go there 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.640
 says at the beginning because it says look 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.319
 programs and files if you have windows 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.060
 xp here you should leave a button 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.160
 called to run vale but let's 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.040
 write the following percentage app 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.810
 percentage data and we will give it to enter 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.760
 here we are going to have this folder called 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.280
 point microns like what we see here I 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.299
 here I made a copy a mike pointed 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.680
 the one of copies 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.900
 you should also make a contribution 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.790
 perhaps it fails them in something is worth so 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.380
 well we entered the point minecraft and already 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.060
 that when installing the force should not 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.090
 exit is in a folder called a lot 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.160
 here we will not have anything worth it because I have 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.480
 installed mods previously but if 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.860
 you have not installed any mode 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.170
 this wants to be empty as you can see 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.060
 and here we are going to move the file 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.640
 point hard the mod as you can see here 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.110
 we already have it and it would be totally 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.670
 installed let's try it 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.620
 I'm going to go to where she is and 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.270
 crash to to check that if not 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.790
 the mod worked 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.660
 I'm going to go saying goodbye because I know it's going 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.340
 to work 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.170
 it does not have to give them failures or 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.470
 nothing although we do not have to ensure 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.150
 have the by the profile of the forum 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.510
 selected as you can see here is 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.370
 reissued 1.7 points and the forum version 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.100
 how to select it for good there's always 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.950
 a lot of variation says edith profile and it's 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.080
 which one says you use version click 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.730
 there and at the most low 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.320
 here will be the forums that we have 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.440
 installed I have install the two the 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.600
 1.7 point 10 and 1.7 points but as 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.730
 I have installed the mod for version 1.7 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.220
 points 2 p I will choose the obviously the 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.590
 folio 1.7 points 2 ok I have 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.530
 reduced and we're going to give play to that 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.730
 to see that it worked guys 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.230

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.940

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.889
 we have already installed and here not here what 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.129
