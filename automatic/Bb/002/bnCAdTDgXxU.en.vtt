00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.279
 The zone registers you and I think that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.779
 she arrived in the middle of January more 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.970
 I ended up surprising him, he got here. 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.949
 in the beginning of January the themes in the day 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.090
 2 I do not even know what day it is today 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.519
 but I only know that in early January 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.130
 still and how I have this 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.620
 bring the box here for you of the products 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.809
 that the combo I decided to bring a box 37 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.370
 I also have a boxer for those who do not 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.809
 accompanies the channel is only of things 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.399
 for 3ds 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.230
 I decided to bring the phone also because I 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.120
 I commented in the previous video that 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.649
 had bought it over the internet are 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.690
 waiting for him to arrive 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.059
 so let's show the box a little 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.550
 You have the zone 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.829
 who one day I chose to take this 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.050
 Headset here concerned a bit of the brand 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.940
 I also like it and also because of the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.219
 fact that it is a microphone headset is 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.920
 detachable here on the back we have 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.960
 some information about the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.909
 obviously on the headset because it 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.460
 speaks that the microphone focuses the camera focuses 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.939
 it is detachable we also have 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.299
 is the volume controller on the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.189
 all information about the audio is 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.970
 here a little bit for you to learn 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.420
 know a lot about these specifications 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.479
 to leave on this other side also has more 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.040
 some things nÃ© ergonomic sound design 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.590
 premium microphone detectable control and 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.720
 bla bla bla bla various things but beauty 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.210
 open the box now for you 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.149
 remembering that the boc galera he is the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.009
 which shows an Internet standard that 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.840
 People do it with a hand and I do not 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.170
 finding no suitable place for 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.159
 placing the camera this time is not 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.149
 sorry and also for anybody here 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.590
 in the background, right? 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.360
 This time I 'm recording with the microphone. 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.219
 and the camera a little more sensitive 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.590
 to record all the sound of the environment 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.690
 we will be able to pull the headset without 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.730
 take down ufa came out perfect 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.460
 I'll put here a little there aside and 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.900
 let's see what is over here in the box 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.270
 to something and feel a 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.970
 he is detachable I found that 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:30.110
 was a little bigger and 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:34.460
 The beauty that we have more is that the opa 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.530
 we also have the appeal to 2007 obviously 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.970
 Let's open here. It's not going to show. 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.380
 for you because that's boxing is a 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.940
 boring one-handed 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.580
 the most important thing on YouTube but 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.030
 Beauty has nothing cool only has the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.740
 information here in several languages 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.790
 Spanish then to from the box 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.560
 There is nothing else on the back street . 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.730
 now we have is mainly a headset 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.770
 in itself 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.140
 Now I can focus a little better on 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:09.400
 you just started to see that here I 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:12.020
 I'm having a hard time waiting there. 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.660
 People, I'm going to hang out here when I 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.550
 I had taken that I think back to 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.320
 People, I'll have it here now. 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.980
 easier to remove the box with the 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.720
 two hands 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.600
 is the headset guys here it is a 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.000
 A little one looks at our part but in 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.410
 compensation is good because it gets you 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.440
 right in your head 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.880
 and here we have ozone is a detail that 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.660
 I could not identify exactly the 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:40.010
 What I wanted and I do not know anymore. 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:44.060
 here he is very well pulled and there well for 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.340
 so here is very comfortable even 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.840
 even with that part of the top that people 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.850
 can see also is inscribed ozone 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.980
 the cool details 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.130
 and something else that I did not find is 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.370
 selling the product on the internet I only saw 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.170
 now is that his entire movie is blue 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:09.910
 he goes to the other party who also 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:09.910
 Let me take this one out for you. 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.709
 I took the cable he has this small 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.720
 zinho protection so you can climb 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.400
 she 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.410
 I think not even to speak the truth. 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.630
 Branches obvious but it is to prevent 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.530
 you open the wires of both the 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.910
 microphone as of phone and legal 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.200
 It's also that he comes here. 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.730
 gold-plated that she does this 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.560
 person thinks it's just one more detail 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.380
 in less detail but is not here is 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:48.680
 good because I did not want that rust 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:51.440
 then not in the cable not in this one 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.420
 bit here it ends up decreasing 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.540
 quality of the product but not here 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.630
 he has a very nice gold plated one 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.060
 This also leaves me guessing the entrance to the 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.550
 Microphone work to do here is what 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.590
 This part, so I'm going to open a movie for 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.850
 show you also remember that 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.580
 after that video I'm going to make a 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.730
 microphone test 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:17.300
 For you, that microphone I was seeing. 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:21.350
 he ends up capturing much more 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:25.760
 environment than the other sounds in the 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.350
 general but for me it will be a good thing 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.120
 I'll end up trying to 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:35.980
 any way the audacity beauty teams 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.980
 and another side put 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:47.240
 difficult but I think it was the beauty that 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:49.069
 the headset that would be another boxing 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.080
 Very simple people, I'll be back. 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:54.339
 using it now and is reflected in the 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.819
 basically gameplay that the camera focuses 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.499
 there 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.490
 basically this is it guys now stay 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:02.779
 then with the microphone test he spoke 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.300
 so it was beauty now I'm going to test here 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:07.699
 a little the sound of john king's microphone 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.860
 zone st and what are you listening to here 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:12.169
 now the crowd is the sound directly from the 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.849
 microphone with no filter I do not 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.649
 I dealt with no editing program of 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:17.689
 audio tone you are seeing here 

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:20.300
 probably my voice a little 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:21.889
 environmental noise in the case of 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.110
 coolers from my computer that I have 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.930
 several here and makes a fucking noise 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:30.110
 It's high but I think it's much better. 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.999
 than my other handset and the 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.800
 quality of his microphone because the 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:35.839
 another he had a lot of noise then 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.189
 times even dealing with audacity 

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:40.099
 other audio editing programs in 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:41.869
 general did not remove all the noise and 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:45.199
 that which has no noise at all and 

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:47.330
 This is something well the last is and if it is 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:49.849
 something that really is 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.099
 I do not know what makes the audio really bad the fact 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.680
 to get a lot of the ambient noise 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:56.269
 have to withdraw as well and that is good and 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.829
 another also if you do not like yourself 

00:06:56.269 --> 00:07:00.499
 Microphone, I can take it out. 

00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:01.909
 exchanging that I will have a quality one 

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:03.919
 or buy a microphone 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:05.899
 better hope people you guys 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:08.269
 have liked another boxing here 

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:10.249
 which is a very simple boxing even tired 

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:13.099
 To tell you guys, but these videos. 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:14.479
