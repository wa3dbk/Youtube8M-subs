00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.830
 Hi guys here, how are you? I'm back. 

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:09.440
 This time to speak was the best reading. 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.969
 of the month on the reading of the month of August 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.959
 we give a little delay later 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.119
 come on 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.799
 is I had already advanced to you in 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.490
 some other videos talking about my 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.010
 reading is going to be the same project rose tÃ¡ 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.590
 the brett simpson australian think it is 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.300
 so he speaks his name and I 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.710
 I fell in love with this book, it was better 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.710
 inside the eye for now it looks 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.370
 great books this year but he got me 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.559
 by the way of writing and by a factor 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.409
 I'll tell you now it's the 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.190
 project rose tells the story of don don 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:45.620
 is a 39 - year - old man and geneticist and 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.239
 gift is kind of weirdo it's all weird 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.139
 that some manias he is very much attached to 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.600
 routine is and for those who know it is a little 

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:55.129
 about autism about losing them under 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.190
 autism spectrum 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.659
 You can already diagnose the gift in the 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.339
 first paragraph, I did the 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.129
 diagnostic first paragraph has a 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.210
 27- year-old son who is autistic and 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.700
 first paragraph had already 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.890
 diagnosed the gift 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.320
 But so be quiet because this 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.829
 does not interfere with anything with reading you 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.390
 gives a name to the gift problem not 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.009
 mean anything okay it will not 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.020
 influence the rest of your 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.890
 reading beauty 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.140
 we will follow up the gift and it has 39 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.509
 years and he's kind of tired he wants 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.670
 have a wife who has a 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.149
 partner he never got to date 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.250
 it has several serious problems is with a 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.859
 lot of things he has is very 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.799
 connected to the routine he has a whole ritual 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.030
 who does every day he is very sincere in 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.560
 what he says are all the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.549
 characteristics of the autism spectrum 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.320
 OK 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.659
 he is very sincere in what he speaks and 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.789
 Do not understand sarcasm so he has a 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.140
 very big difficulty and relate 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.420
 with other people 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.340
 he has two friends that this forms a 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.670
 couple a couple of psychologists who 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.340
 Claudia Jardim is and the two of you. 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.679
 they are the only friends of the gift are the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.140
 who understand and understand that 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.270
 who understand this line that he tends to 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.340
 7 o'clock in the morning ring the bell 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.530
 because he needs 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.470
 talk or even play at dawn 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.390

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.250
 social rules okay for him is one thing 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.840
 so he needs to talk to him, which is 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.730
 optimize his time is not done 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.450
 Nothing Why not talk at the time. 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.430

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.920
 so he has only two friends he does not 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.360
 managed to date a lot of time is up to them 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.599
 will do this project wife project 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.150

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.760
 pages are front and back time to leave well 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.950
 these 16 pages if you had to 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.690
 you have questions like this from the 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:49.120
 smoker and even there 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.610
 business for him because he is 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.010
 very clever he does not want to stay 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.209
 side of a person falling short of the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.549
 that ideli that I can not have a 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.329
 nice talk anyway he thinks about everything 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.549
 There you start looking for that person they 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.769
 to sign up for relationship sites 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.079
 and he starts looking for the person for 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.349
 This questionnaire is in between 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.690
 time he meets rose and rice and everything 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.829
 that he did not want to be rose and waitress 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.450
 rose smokes rice and is out of control but 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.329
 same time that 's all he does not 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.700
 whether he sees himself asked every day 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.819
 closer to her changing some routines 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.769
 to fit the routine of rose and 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.319
 a friendship begins to emerge between the 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.420
 two and he keeps asking himself but I just 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.040
 I can be friends because she is not what 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.920
 I do not want to be in accordance with the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.680
 project and it creates another project to 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.389
 be able to stay in touch with the rose 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.299
 Do you know about rice? 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:49.209
 to understand with this project is because 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.730
 It was here in the synopsis until but you know 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.130
 It's cool and sitting without knowing this match. 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.790
 I found it very interesting how 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.590
 It was the gift head for nou although 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.859
 that woman does not fit for him 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.459
 was able to fit into a motivation 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:10.569
 Life for him, it's really cool, that's right. 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:12.190
 is a book is is a chick lit has been 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.549
 classified as customers but I do not 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.310
 I consider chick lit is not okay romance is 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.130
 a very different book the vision is all about 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.020
 first person all a vision of the gift 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.700
 the gift is funny without wanting to be 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.340
 Funny for us because he has 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.139
 some situation 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.699
 actions he has some skills 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.380
 social 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.440
 Who did he tell that he is? 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.530
 making us laugh but at the same time 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.030
 that you laugh is tragic because so he 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.910
 do not understand why people do not 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.470
 They understand the way they are and it's very 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.770
 dislocated in society is sad and 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.680
 At the same time, it was a comic book. 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.290
 very good and 5 stars I already told 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.900
 it's really worth it, people are very 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.930
 touching with a person he signs up 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.330
 an hour like a man without feelings is 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.610
 unable to love as a person who is 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.530
 describes how feelings a person 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.240
 who says he is incapable of love can 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.450
 teach so much to us about love is 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.780
 It's a wonderful gorgeous book I recommend. 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.940
 The rest of the reading, I cleaned it. 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.190
 hours are gathering at five o'clock 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:24.020
 it was too much you can not read 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:27.470
 stop the author is he can mix the 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.389
 romance with the focus of the story that this 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.120
 motivation that the gift found to continue 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.850
 near the rose he can blend a lot 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.100
 well these two stories and in a way 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.380
 that we are curious curious or 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.889
 curious reader for two events 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.780
 This is very very good, you are eating too much. 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.210
 it is not that it has already been translated by 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.860
 a lot of countries that is world-wide success 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.810
 if you do not know, you're one foot behind you. 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.139
 I do not like the elite there, I do not like 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.300
 reading do not worry , but there I am 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.010
 I like that he had the vision of a man not 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.520
 I'll find strange people, do not worry. 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.410
 thereby 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.750
 the book is very good and we are going wonderful 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.490
 eating too much, okay, this was the 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.979
 best reading for me of the month of August 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.500
 Next month I'll be back with the best. 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:12.260
