haven't changed at all but I believe a
lot<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> mean<00:02:20.640> let's<00:02:20.970> take<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.240> as<00:02:21.330> it

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
lot of so I mean let's take it as it

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:33.700 
lot of so I mean let's take it as it
comes<00:02:21.480> let's<00:02:21.900> enjoy<00:02:22.140> ourselves

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.320 

here<00:02:34.710> we've<00:02:34.890> got<00:02:35.130> good<00:02:35.370> expectations<00:02:36.090> if<00:02:36.210> the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
here we've got good expectations if the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.550 
here we've got good expectations if the
weather<00:02:36.480> holds<00:02:36.570> up<00:02:36.930> we<00:02:37.140> know<00:02:37.260> it's<00:02:37.410> going<00:02:37.440> to

be damp but we're hoping that the car is
now<00:02:40.590> going<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.980> perform<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:42.060> lot<00:02:42.240> better<00:02:42.300> than

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
