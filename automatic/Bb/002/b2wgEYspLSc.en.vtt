00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.380
 the final of the 38th abn amro world tennis tournament goes between these 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.879
 frenchman jo wilfried tsonga charismatic the current number 18 of 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.369
 the world and he will take on robin sÃ¶derling 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.500
 title defender and the number 4 currently in the world under the watchful eye 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.380
 of this pieter van vollenhoven and who set the level yesterday 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.550
 his left foot immediately put pressure on at the start of the game but play 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.179
 in strokes there it is unknown 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.120
 on Sundays has trouble 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.120
 with the recovery of barneveld the first breaking point in the match 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.540
 in the meantime, come back from the ps as far as it becomes known before they encourage 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.160
 of course a countryman suriname 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.340
 but then it is without both at the lesson 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.340
 6 creates opportunities for itself now 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.520
 yet the frenchman keeps some effort 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.289
 with those hard blows it occasionally tries the service volley 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.289
 tonight takes the power to come down 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.890
 m again in trouble the frenchman by breaking point for sharing 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.260
 it is just too sharp 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.930
 for the second time since yesterday is the opening set 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.910
 and this time you can do that without it and you lose the opening set with 6 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.910
 7 3 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.400
 someone who brings his life forward then he does Holland very nicely 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.650
 background and the most beautiful points of today to now 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.420
 to 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.750
 which in the second set will mainly serve better 6 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.750
 ran a hospital in goes on the first service 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.120
 no way 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.090
 to explain at the first breaking point 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.090
 the list with 5 3 then serves for set profit 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.110
 a few questions 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.930
 give the numbers 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.450
 a decisive third set must be played 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.450
 under the watchful eye of tournament director richard krajicek 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.660
 it goes directly on in that third set the funders reported but then if the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.069
 Sunday's account must have many players have them together 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.060
 also under pressure and that will be refused 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.549
 delivers further 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.539
 lucia de b in the third set 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:19.519
 on the other hand is the timetable 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.519
 for the title 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.989
 2 experience it 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.759
 he has the telegraph 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.099
