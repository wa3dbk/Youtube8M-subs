00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.240
 Greetings from the modest flavors 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.000
 in this section we will share a very easy pie recipe 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.600
 "Puff pastry" 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.760
 But before the materials 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.760
 10 pcs square puff pastry 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.520
 for inside; 3 slices of white cheese 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.520
 10-15 branches of parsley 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.120
 and 1 egg white 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.360
 1 egg yolk for 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.360
 As you can see, our list of materials was too short ... 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.520
 the construction is so easy, let's just start making 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
 First of all we prepare the interior 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.920
 We have 3 slices of cheese, we crush with the help of a fork 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.200
 now parsley with thin stalks 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 adding parsley 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.440
 now the egg in the white 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.560
 we will already use the yellow on 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 re-mixing 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.880
 yes we have prepared, now the order to open the milfÃ¶y dough 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:07.240
 We are expanding our square pork dough with some flour 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.680
 it's enough to expand 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.960
 now cut into four pieces 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.360
 we leave enough space for each part 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.120
 and fold it up and down ... 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.760
 curl 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.440
 and place the tray on which we oil or grease 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.320
 we prepared our last pie 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.280
 40 pieces of pie made from 10 pieces 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.600
 now we've added some milk on the yolk and we're flapping 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.680
 we are driving on our pies 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.960
 yes we had our eggs 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.960
 Now we have preheated 190 degrees oven ... 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.800
 we cook until golden 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.360
 baked from the oven, we can serve after a little 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.480
 Modest Flavors in our kitchen in this section ... 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.120
 we shared a recipe for a very sweet pie 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.400
 "Puff pastry" 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.240
