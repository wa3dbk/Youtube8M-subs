00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello to all the hockey players that you 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.250
 speak for new videos your view 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.469
 at days devoted to a calf the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.990
 legal bionicle combo dating from 2015 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.960
 it is a combo associating the model 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.140
 at 110000 and 782 the protector of the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.270
 class and the model are said 1788 the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.939
 put ice to know that pacac 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.990
 here and so with these two models we 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.210
 will create what is worth in quotation marks 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.189
 who this is here have rather the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.680
 version of power up to score if more 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.760
 of model power and I you 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.070
 recalls that of instruction which are 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.450
 found on the goal.com slash idiot 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.309
 knicks loose country 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.739
 this is just so good and the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.289
 producer we will take mainly 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:57.210
 even old c2a namely this crate there 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:58.949
 here so shot and are curly ice 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.829
 however small modification 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.570
 previously the dark gray piece been 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.430
 setting 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:10.860
 I put myself in this sense there 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.140
 going up and for the model one 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.760
 will have to put it on sale the churn 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.770
 German on the side simply 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.830
 like this here 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.140
 and here we are, we just take Saint-Léon 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.610
 fellus the meaning and then to the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.920
 meadow and quite rightly we can 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.470
 take our quota campo not have that one 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.939
 acquired and well we removed his mask 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.159
 white but as we see 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.340
 removed his shield with this big 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.049
 blade and his tongue so this is so 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.060
 that we will find but in fact a little 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.500
 components the facts because we're going 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.240
 especially to find the two pieces to 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.790
 know this part there as you can 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.250
 see actually we will take we will remove 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.049
 roughly the silver box and the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.360
 place replaced by the piece of ice 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.130
 which before was located here to make 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.299
 simple so now she is at 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.299
 summit and starting from his team 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.180
 next and well we will fit our 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:10.069
 ice shield so roughly like 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.069
 these are 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:20.280
 like that in the little room picks up 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:23.849
 here it is and so that then came 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.270
 at the level of the hand like these and at 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.239
 the rear 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.680
 well I'm going to casey this part to the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.920
 launches that I had so removed 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.920
 previously 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.510
 here and so I put this here I 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.920
 just checked that I was wrong 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.860
 Basque too quite a few things 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.350
 I still want to mislead myself 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.060
 with a piece off and so that's strength 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.920
 now we only have 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.450
 help reborn what it's stalling though 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.519
 will not undergo any modification or gokan 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.000
 additional addition we saw it right at 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.010
 level of the hand here and then after the 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.019
 basque in gold this time and no longer 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.950
 in white is here we have the combo of 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:15.870
 finish and so I want to do a little 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.400
 forward and we will necessarily there as 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.310
 can see it we will not find 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.049
 all the big the same skin at the level 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.640
 feet instructions for use radishes not 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.840
 at all so it's really as it is 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.440
 so that we really have a 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.850
 lighter version of copa k1 so a 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.530
 little different necessarily wages are 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.489
 more trapper took this group for a name 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.160
 which in itself of a rank 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.950
 the concept is interesting I want to 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.350
 to say but it is true that then by 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.940
 against I never cheated 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.820
 excuse me that's it but it's true 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.650
 that they only have for example already that 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.590
 it launches shield I do not understand too much 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.209
 know it a little bit special I find I 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.650
 see a little the idea of ​​the concept versa I 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.239
 tell me yeah I can understand that can 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.799
 serve to adapt to the cs defend at the same 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.819
 time why not but it's true that 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.920
 it makes like that kind of a kind 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.730
 mix a little weird between the two 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.079
 which is what is playable it is 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.900
 competent but it's not either 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.920
 extraordinary nor really so well thought out 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.600
 that I find 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.400
 despite their efforts to change 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.840
 actually for a little bit one restores 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.659
 to different lens since my basic bag 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.889
 the as lens l1 can dial only two of 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.720
 minus ten pieces 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.949
 small rooms so it's not good 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.169
 no longer the easy task but five 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:33.419
 points the locks in speaks a big big 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.260
 thing and after good the little canoe here 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.540
 as you can see it's a bit 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.090
 it's almost a bit pathetic because 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.250
 that it is the size of the barrel actually 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.889
 almost to the fans the size of the point of 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.330
 do not stall necessarily compared to all 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.830
 these big masses it's a kind 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.690
 of little flynn like that they at 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.340
 under his hand first a species of 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.540
 the mob or that continues that extends a 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.680
 little all that force is to confess that I 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.389
 find that he actually has this 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.919
 maybe not too much with the character 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.660
 body the basic character who was 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.100
 massive not there they wanted to make a 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.660
 kind of little less massive version and 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.830
 I say why not as much as they 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.300
 also go out for a little light 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.520
 like that they show that they are not 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.110
 more dynamic be more than 32 in the 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.870
 of course I'm talking about that in relation to his 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.919
 version to its design its design what 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.930
 his z brings out 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.460
 I do not leave storyline and still 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.169
 compared to what we are going to brew 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.160
 revive if it is unique or not but 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.720
 indeed it is true that but there 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.240
 really this aspect a little heavy lessard 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.250
 and here they go they try to go 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.660
 against lawson why not but 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.760
 no I think that but they are 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.560
 and not taken the right way they all 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.550
 not do that the key the good parts where 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.530
 the right accessories 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.180
 because that's the Bavois coface and 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.460
 coopaga who holds a tiny river 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.310
 which base was better proportioned 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.380
 with his protector what my protector 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.380
 bakkour circle but protective all of 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.120
 even so it's true that I have a little 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.919
 wrong I have a little trouble with that after 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.990
 scott who will find the concept of 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.789
 shield throws attraction it's true that 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.770
 Sundays as I said it's pretty 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:01.539
 original in itself but now I find that 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:03.130
 the execution is more than enough what it 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.139
 would still be pretty disappointing for 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.310
 this model there after I can not I 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.030
 do not want a little inspiration reminder 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.669
 since as you could see 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.680
 the installation have not changed anything by 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.180
 compared to the old model 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.229
 they are just more free christian 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.910
 battle even when far fewer 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.910
 from massa to look after 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.439
 it's a bit like that then for those 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.680
 of andré is the big barry if they 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:32.150
 do not come the movement 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.080
 so do not be especially well- known 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.319
 payment where you still have to make 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.969
 dropouts without much problem I want 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.530
 say yes but no what if you want 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:42.710
 yeah maybe a little but it's not 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.009
 neither is it so bad that I 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.169
 thought 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.300
 after of course everything depends on your 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:49.879
 bass scale 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:53.050
 it seems to me quite correct for 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:54.830
 what the base piece can offer 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:07:02.870
 I would like to highlight his 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:04.669
 point which is therefore up to you to see but 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.050
 it actually bought rap or disappointed I 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:07.669
 think I'm dealing with the side 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.800
 a little melee with his sides a 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:13.969
 can fit in lighter but you're 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.710
 not like that here we are going to leave 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:17.090
 on it if you and meats and 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.069
 ecclestone comments do not know but 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.560
 asked I will answer as usual 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.430
 with great pleasure and as always 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.770
 here 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.979
 waiting for a good day 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.779
 a good evening a good morning 

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:31.969
 what you want if it's ugly 

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:33.560
 stay home if fellow would be at home 

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:35.180
 you and then of course wear well 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.620
 it's like so happy and we get 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.810
 find out later for two new 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.810
 very videos all at next
