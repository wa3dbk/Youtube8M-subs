00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
beautiful to another day it seems like

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.780 
beautiful to another day it seems like
whenever<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.619> die<00:00:56.799> it<00:00:57.129> just<00:00:57.309> takes<00:00:57.489> you<00:00:57.640> back

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
whenever you die it just takes you back

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.549 
whenever you die it just takes you back
like<00:00:58.030> 20<00:00:58.180> seconds<00:00:58.750> but<00:00:58.930> you<00:00:59.049> keep<00:00:59.229> everything

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
like 20 seconds but you keep everything

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.590 
like 20 seconds but you keep everything
it's<00:01:00.010> not<00:01:00.159> like<00:01:00.339> in<00:01:00.489> other<00:01:00.970> games<00:01:01.269> similar

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
it's not like in other games similar

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.789 
it's not like in other games similar
that's<00:01:01.869> like<00:01:01.989> double<00:01:02.110> may<00:01:02.320> cry<00:01:02.530> where<00:01:02.739> it

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
that's like double may cry where it

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:04.229 
that's like double may cry where it
takes<00:01:02.949> you<00:01:03.129> back<00:01:03.250> really<00:01:03.519> far<00:01:03.729> and<00:01:04.030> you<00:01:04.089> lose

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
takes you back really far and you lose

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.800 
takes you back really far and you lose
everything<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:05.290> they<00:01:05.590> make<00:01:05.770> it<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:05.950> little<00:01:06.100> more

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
everything so they make it a little more

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.270 
everything so they make it a little more
playable<00:01:07.810> for<00:01:08.110> people<00:01:08.439> difficult<00:01:08.799> casual<00:01:09.189> i

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
playable for people difficult casual i

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.850 
playable for people difficult casual i
guess<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.640> could<00:01:09.729> say<00:01:10.170> there's<00:01:11.170> no<00:01:11.439> life

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
guess you could say there's no life

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.950 
guess you could say there's no life
count<00:01:12.220> so<00:01:12.520> if<00:01:12.880> you<00:01:13.030> die<00:01:13.180> it<00:01:13.570> doesn't<00:01:13.869> really

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
count so if you die it doesn't really

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.960 
count so if you die it doesn't really
matter<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.560> it<00:01:14.979> seems<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.280> date<00:01:15.520> by<00:01:15.670> itself

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
matter and it seems to date by itself

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.539 
matter and it seems to date by itself
because<00:01:16.360> when<00:01:16.869> i<00:01:16.900> was<00:01:17.049> getting<00:01:17.200> off<00:01:17.979> of<00:01:18.220> it<00:01:18.340> it

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
because when i was getting off of it it

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.969 
because when i was getting off of it it
just<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.960> doesn't<00:01:20.140> have<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.350> save<00:01:20.590> button<00:01:20.770> at
