to go ahead and pilot out the program it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
to go ahead and pilot out the program it
was<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.520> very<00:00:38.760> interesting<00:00:39.420> process<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:40.079> I

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
was a very interesting process because I

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.889 
was a very interesting process because I
looked<00:00:40.469> at<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.770> at<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.610> very<00:00:41.850> beta<00:00:42.239> form<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.840> I

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
looked at it at a very beta form so I

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.990 
looked at it at a very beta form so I
was<00:00:43.020> literally<00:00:43.320> given<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.710> spreadsheet<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.520> had

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
was literally given a spreadsheet I had

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.279 
was literally given a spreadsheet I had
all<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> different<00:00:45.660> parts<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> shoot

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
all the different parts of the shoot

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.930 
all the different parts of the shoot
broken<00:00:46.649> down<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.579> different<00:00:47.850> materials

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
broken down all the different materials

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.060 
broken down all the different materials
all<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> different<00:00:48.960> colors<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.770> had<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
all the different colors and I had to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.189 
all the different colors and I had to
kind<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.370> pick<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.969> choose<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> put<00:00:52.170> on

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
kind of pick and choose what to put on

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.229 
kind of pick and choose what to put on
it<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.890> was<00:00:53.010> probably<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> harder

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
it it was probably one of the harder

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.850 
it it was probably one of the harder
things<00:00:54.270> I've<00:00:54.570> had<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:55.020> without<00:00:55.199> being<00:00:55.440> able

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
things I've had to do without being able

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.639 
things I've had to do without being able
to<00:00:56.010> actually<00:00:56.899> visualize<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> sneaker<00:00:58.500> with

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
to actually visualize the sneaker with

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.830 
to actually visualize the sneaker with
like<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> live<00:00:59.160> preview<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.940> what<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.480> on

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
like a live preview of what was going on

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.990 
like a live preview of what was going on
so<00:01:01.379> definitely<00:01:01.739> made<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.129> process<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.760> little

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
so definitely made this process a little

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.810 
so definitely made this process a little
bit<00:01:03.149> difficult<00:01:03.619> but<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.799> was<00:01:05.309> saying<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
bit difficult but I was saying to a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.039 
bit difficult but I was saying to a
couple<00:01:06.090> people<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.450> met<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> sneaker

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
couple people that I met a sneaker

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.050 
couple people that I met a sneaker

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
like a nice and when I were designing

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.400 
like a nice and when I were designing
that<00:03:48.970> this<00:03:49.150> one<00:03:49.329> as<00:03:49.449> well<00:03:49.629> I<00:03:49.690> recognize<00:03:50.260> it

don't have too many all white sneakers

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.710 
don't have too many all white sneakers
so<00:03:54.040> creating<00:03:54.489> this<00:03:54.609> was<00:03:54.790> really<00:03:55.060> nice<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.480> I

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
so creating this was really nice and I

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.020 
so creating this was really nice and I
could<00:03:55.870> see<00:03:56.019> myself<00:03:56.169> wearing<00:03:56.530> it<00:03:56.799> a<00:03:56.829> ton<00:03:57.129> so<00:03:57.609> for

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
could see myself wearing it a ton so for

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.789 
could see myself wearing it a ton so for
the<00:03:58.120> third<00:03:58.299> sneaker<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.900> was<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.049> Stan<00:03:59.409> Smith

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
the third sneaker it was a Stan Smith

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.159 
the third sneaker it was a Stan Smith
this<00:04:00.609> was<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.909> only<00:04:01.120> sneaker<00:04:01.659> that<00:04:01.810> didn't

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
this was the only sneaker that didn't

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.680 
this was the only sneaker that didn't
come<00:04:02.349> out<00:04:02.379> the<00:04:02.799> way<00:04:03.159> I<00:04:03.310> had<00:04:03.549> requested

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
come out the way I had requested

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.869 
come out the way I had requested
I'm<00:04:05.049> assuming<00:04:05.500> it's<00:04:05.799> because<00:04:06.129> it<00:04:06.310> was<00:04:06.459> done<00:04:06.699> in

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
I'm assuming it's because it was done in

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.689 
I'm assuming it's because it was done in
the<00:04:06.970> beta<00:04:07.180> form<00:04:07.829> what<00:04:08.829> I<00:04:08.859> really<00:04:09.250> wanted<00:04:09.579> the

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
the beta form what I really wanted the

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.360 
the beta form what I really wanted the
sneaker<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:10.030> signify<00:04:10.569> is<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.930> Tupac<00:04:11.470> poem<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:12.159> me

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
sneaker to signify is a Tupac poem to me

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.300 
sneaker to signify is a Tupac poem to me
that<00:04:12.669> poem<00:04:12.909> means<00:04:13.359> a<00:04:13.510> lot<00:04:13.720> because<00:04:14.019> it<00:04:14.949> kind<00:04:15.250> of

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
that poem means a lot because it kind of

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.779 
that poem means a lot because it kind of
signifies<00:04:15.879> that<00:04:15.909> you<00:04:16.630> know<00:04:17.519> it<00:04:18.519> talks<00:04:18.700> about

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
signifies that you know it talks about

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.699 
signifies that you know it talks about
like<00:04:19.030> a<00:04:19.060> rose<00:04:19.359> growing<00:04:19.870> from<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.200> cracks<00:04:20.440> that

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
like a rose growing from the cracks that

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.420 
like a rose growing from the cracks that
concrete<00:04:21.099> you<00:04:21.340> think<00:04:21.549> of

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
light to come out of and I think in my

light to come out of and I think in my
life<00:04:32.180> I<00:04:32.780> really<00:04:33.710> identified<00:04:34.190> that<00:04:34.430> poem

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
life I really identified that poem

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.580 
life I really identified that poem
because<00:04:35.090> I<00:04:35.270> think<00:04:35.750> we've<00:04:35.930> all<00:04:36.139> been<00:04:36.169> in<00:04:36.380> a

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
because I think we've all been in a

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.770 
because I think we've all been in a
certain<00:04:36.889> spot<00:04:37.130> where<00:04:37.490> we<00:04:38.030> have<00:04:38.240> been<00:04:38.509> that

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
certain spot where we have been that

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.450 
certain spot where we have been that
crack<00:04:39.020> in<00:04:39.169> the<00:04:39.259> concrete<00:04:39.470> at<00:04:39.919> one<00:04:40.100> point<00:04:40.280> in

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
crack in the concrete at one point in

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.920 
crack in the concrete at one point in
our<00:04:40.580> life<00:04:40.759> and<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:41.210> really<00:04:41.479> have<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.750> choice

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
to either blossom from it and become

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.999 
to either blossom from it and become
something<00:04:43.940> or<00:04:44.900> be<00:04:45.050> stuck<00:04:45.320> there<00:04:45.530> for<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.860> rest

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
something or be stuck there for the rest
