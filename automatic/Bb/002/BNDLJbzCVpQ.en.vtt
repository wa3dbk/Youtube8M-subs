00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:09.330
 of Castilla as can be anyone 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.340
 but maybe imagination takes us 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.620
 on the other hand already what the passage from 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.710
 do everything you want you can do 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.670
 structures sculptures the forms of the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.670
 they prefer to model 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:34.710
 it's a wonderful thing that can do what 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:37.350
 that you want to go forward to do good 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.040
 use four ingredients we have 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.730
 sugar impalpable starch gelatin and 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.730
 vinegar 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.940
 now we have the sugar and the movie 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.030
 that we must sift meanwhile here 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.390
 finished heating I have the gelatin that 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.550
 is already hydrated with the vinegar up 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.910
 that is at a point that I know this is not 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.910
 feel warm one more time and we should 

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:15.319
 Y 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.680
 and let's go 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.640
 to which we already have hot gelatin 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.640
 with the vinegar inside the blender 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.479
 and the only thing we do is matter 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.770
 we leave it a minute until I have a 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.219
 consistency that models us 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.109
 I'm going to tell you something about me because 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.539
 pastry from where I came out I do not know why 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:04.850
 what do you decide to go to pastry shop because from 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.829
 that I was small since before I was born 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.869
 my parents were always later and 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.610
 so I basically grew up in that 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.400
 I grew up with a face full of 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.790
 dessert then since I was little 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.340
 I knew I wanted to study that 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.760
 and I loved the design so first 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.760
 design and then already 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:34.790
 as it does more than I get in any 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.400
 place then costumes and what I did with 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.370
 this disdain with any paper for 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.920
 that when you spread the dough you can 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.170
 mark it and let it dry to cancino 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.220
 this already on the one hand 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.520
 our mass is not liquid either 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.690
 add a little more sugar as 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.290
 we have the envelope inform you 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.290
 to abound 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.040
 a little bit more and they use it until 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.910
 I left them as I told them as if 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.940
 it was a clay let's let 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.200
 This is done from here to the side I have 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.200
 good life I have prepared 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.990
 and with this I am going to show you how to do 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.830
 the most expensive then we must extend 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.840
 to extend can use either 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.030
 starch or impalpable sugar or a mixture 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.600
 of both which is what I like then 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.310
 we are a little bit about our inn 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.760
 and we extend it with a roller 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.760
 anyone 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.840
 can be extended with either a roller 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.340
 smooth as it is or not textured is the 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.650
 area one more touch towards sculptures 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.500
 depending on what they want to do 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.700
 then when I am more or less 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.700
 about 5 millimeters thick 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.620
 like what at that moment 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.989
 although it can be quite again 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.620
 because skating if it's going to dry is a 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:10.190
 come back super super hard then I do not know 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.190
 break 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.090
 I'm going to cut it for my stay that I have 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.660
 that they can use a knife and what 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.910
 I have an exact one that is quite accurate 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:28.170
 we cut out the shape of the mask 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.680
 and then let's dry it on top of the 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.680
 that we already have 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:39.889
 this is how skating can 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:41.990
 use to do things like these 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.289
 or they can also use it as super 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.999
 plasticine to make balls flaws and 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.369
 toxic so they want above their 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:52.219
 there is a very important thing that 

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:53.869
 I wanted to clarify there are many people who 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.419
 confuses what skating does and what 

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:58.219
 county many people believe that the cover 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.580
 with which the cakes are covered 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:03.409
 city but it's not like that they take care of it 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.509
 that we cover the cakes is called fondant 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.490
 and do not confuse precisely because it is 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:09.889
 because just the makeup what is 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.169
 does it have the same texture of a 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.480
 then fondant could not cover or 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.880
 resort a cake at that time 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.220
 in three days what would happen if it turns 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.560
 so but as hard as a rock that does not 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.570
 could then split the difference 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.840
 gestha rib hardens while the 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.870
 point is kept does not have its 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.020
 soft consistency then here of mandela 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.360
 point I put it on myself 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.539
 mold 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.509
 and I'm going to let it dry it takes time 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.939
 dry about three days like this 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:46.419
 that they must do it in advance in 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:49.629
 this moment while continuing like this is smooth 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.849
 They can make texture if they want 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:53.710
 do it as some kind of thing in 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.990
 lives 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:00.039
 as on this side you can see that I 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.599
 This law or this that huequitos 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.150
 we did like some more stylized leagues 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.250
 it depends on what you want to do then 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.560
 Here I am showing you one, one way 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.900
 whatever is the precise moment 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.849
 so that you can do that 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.340
 they can only make textures without life 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:18.909
 that also once it is dry they can 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.400
 use glass to make texture but 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:28.860
 that excels 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:31.360
 and I know I have a dead end day if I 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.150
 tell of any color there 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.880
 many painting techniques can 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.310
 using powders that make 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.560
 glasses grow like this one can leave it 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.270
 white that is pretty traditional what 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.229
 You can paint with airbrush with any 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.229
 color before a brush 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:55.650
 very well the techniques and this can be 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.650
 eat 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:05.620
 and then you do not have to eat, you do not have to 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.840
 diagnose decorations I have to 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.210
 It seems very original and very wearable but 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.229
 here I wanted you showing signs upside down 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.789
 passion is used to decorate if it is not 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:18.400
 implement inside your torso to 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:20.379
 put it on that in this case with a 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.110
 sculpture then the little step is what 

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:25.599
 more we use to do after is in 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.099
 contests and positions and can be used to 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:29.770
 a dessert table is spectacular 

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:36.879
 like this that we have can not have 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:38.620
 just simple and fun and original is 

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:40.180
 a pastry shop that if we go to 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.979
 find original recipes or 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.750
 situations to be able to decorate also 

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:46.389
 our table is a super person 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.159
 versatile exactly it's worth today we should 

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:50.740
 avoid people staying because the 

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:52.689
 threshold and touch that we are going to have a 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.310
 idea that I'm sure gives you life 

00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:56.390
 when you have a very long table and 

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:59.240
 A lot of things 

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:02.560
 and those stop cakes trades and stay 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.560
 because we are going to solve that problem
