00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.269
 Alsatian cuisine la flammekueche 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.269

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.800
 does that mean pies flambées she 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.150
 caused very very fine onions and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.260
 with bacon with a little bit your 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.449
 fresh cream that otherwise we would not be in 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.920
 alsace and that will be cooked very 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.300
 quickly like a pizza okay 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.529
 it's a bit of the principle 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.240
 So here we go you get the recipe 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.539
 is a dough that is very simple and the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.539
 flour 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:39.960
 a pinch of salt for the taste that's it 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.420
 give it serves it is the oil noria 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.079
 which we take 2.8 m not from the liver lot 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.970
 nasa so I make a well and a pasta 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.970
 in Milan do it here and so here I go 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.690
 start mixing a little bit not 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.160
 badly of years and I will complete with 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.860
 warm water until you get a 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.309
 paste to maximum half a glass of water 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.960
 lukewarm 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.989
 in fact it is until having a texture 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.030
 fast zahar and pizza gold I will be everything 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.950
 little bit on the other hand if the dough has 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.200
 finished no listen that seems to be 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.490
 alright so I ball and I'm going to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 leave half an hour 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.340
 during this time we will prepare the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.380
 similar to flame 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.560
 we put arts in a stove rather 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.689
 lukewarm or cold it can do 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.610
 get out the bar like that we'll put 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.049
 directly the white onions will not have to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.509
 still bought from barbarians we networked 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.580
 newcom this is it is very fine and 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.450
 it is important 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.190
 it's a little bit to precook them 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.930
 it's not for them 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.350
 optional we will put a small 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.170
 little weight of the mill an excellent wine 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.670
 white of course Alsatian dry wants to put 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.820
 a little bit of white wine 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.040
 white wine we will let evaporate on 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.080
 is a fire very quickly, it feels good 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.590
 people to notices 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.760
 and there we will put it aside 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.740
 and now we are going to tackle 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.700
 the flammekueche device ie 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.960
 that's what gave the side a little 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.940
 little creme to the recipe you will see 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.710
 clac clac clac it's very pane and 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.099
 white cheese or black cheese that we still 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.539
 too much to the thick cream for 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.970
 the acidity that really important 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.560
 we will put a little bit of rap and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.480
 nutmeg 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.640
 it's optional and I like it 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.500
 add a little bit of starch 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.780
 corn so that's to prevent that 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.970
 did you know that quite 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.409
 optional and I prefer that it avoids 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.280
 does that make up for cooking 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.709
 must it go too 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.990
 we have all our devices it remains 1 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.940
 lower the dough and to him not too much 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.050
 hot very strong very strong and either 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.110
 really effective 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.110
 I have a little bit of ok river flour 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.140
 my tray with his paws at eight see him 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:52.569
 what is the fouillade and 1 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:58.239
 I let you do it he must do there 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:00.310
 the thickness of the cooking capacity 2 3 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:06.120
 mm that's why these two are breaking 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.680
 the nickel fine fineness also well 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.630
 or it seems a little messy 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.440
 do not delay rustic and chic at once 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.440
 in time there but in the center 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.230
 go go there then for aesthetics 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.220
 other documents show the 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.850
 flamekueche but the cream mixture 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.360
 white cheese and there we will put the 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.280
 nature 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.510
 we hamm is a little loose like that then 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.170
 we're going to have fun going to ready to 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.610
 take off but particularly homogeneous 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.230
 as many onions and the minions 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.400
 we can even make a vegetarian corner if 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.769
 you want with more to the lion on one side 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.660
 than the other one and we're going to put a whole thing 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.150
 little bit of grated cheese that is 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.209
 have a melting appearance break signed a 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.760
 little bit wind for the purists the go 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:58.420
 ready they would bake in the oven 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.090
 very hot of its good degree mine during 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.470
 15 minutes max so we showed you 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.910
 how to make this jewel of the kitchen 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.310
 Alsatian flambé tart 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.170
 with a good glass of Alsatian white wine 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.459
 I would like to be close to paradise 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.459
 besides his sorrow the alsace
