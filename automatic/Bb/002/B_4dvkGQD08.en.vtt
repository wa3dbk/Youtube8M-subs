00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:05.580
 not that I want to show that ours 512 euros of licenses 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.580
 but she will not be quite like the others anymore than a round 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.769
 it's a way of living sastre 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.529
 that's his dagger 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.550
 for you to have it off I left in a rush position 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.670
 stitch 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.859
 speakers introduced yesterday again started like this 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.599
 knowing that 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.310
 you take it as 120 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.179
 in fear notes the INSEE closing at the afp 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.739
 you will see the branch that is% and therefore the big shock 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.520
 without the sound the next 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.520
 without what besson can look like this 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.450
 an early season 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.450
 what is actually doing is like giving impetus 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.460
 I hope that 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.910
 the branch he ended on the way so that lydiane% for this movement 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.140
 he remembers house or his if the next hours will be of the season 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.410
 Toronto Oct 8 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.410
 the first is the first move out of his sleeve 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 kikson2 discussions that had closed on himself 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.960
 then 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.860
 we will do a translation but we will make sure that the same time 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.940
 ignore damas 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.940
 in Swiss fitch the curious 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.940
 and it's the same principle you have to be ambitious 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.380
 so that day - Sept. 16 under the impetus 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.430
 v 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.430
 the impression that comes amf sanctions 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.700
 then 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.700
 it's like that 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.830
 while giving an impulse so 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.540
 it's a bit the same principle as version in three movements plus or 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.090
 rather 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.840
 like that 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.140
 for this tour 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.680
 and the same to come back on the front 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.450
 she prefers the intention 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.380
 because the manceau on this side 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.680
 to let pass 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.600
 these are pictures of his game 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.020
 satisfaction 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.390
 I went to the scene
