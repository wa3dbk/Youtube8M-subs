00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
Kelvin going out of pack so that's why

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.520 
Kelvin going out of pack so that's why
they've<00:01:37.140> started<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.979> rise<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:39.380> when<00:01:40.380> they

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
they've started to rise and when they

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.020 
they've started to rise and when they
get<00:01:40.799> saving<00:01:41.130> transferred<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:41.970> not

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
get saving transferred out so it's not

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.399 
get saving transferred out so it's not
the<00:01:42.090> cheapest<00:01:42.360> teens<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.899> team<00:01:43.140> isn't
