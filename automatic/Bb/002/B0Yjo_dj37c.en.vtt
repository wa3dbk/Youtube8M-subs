00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.860 

all<00:00:49.290> that<00:00:49.559> bomb<00:00:50.489> global<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.390> don't<00:00:51.600> need

all that bomb global that I don't need
at<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> moment<00:00:52.440> because<00:00:53.570> scheme<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.719> such<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
at the moment because scheme is such a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.869 
at the moment because scheme is such a
cakewalk<00:00:57.350> nope<00:00:58.350> nope<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.980> not<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.160> cakewalk<00:00:59.430> I

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
cakewalk nope nope it's not a cakewalk I

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.330 
cakewalk nope nope it's not a cakewalk I
find<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.559> reasonably<00:01:01.559> challenging<00:01:01.800> or

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
find it to be reasonably challenging or

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:19.510 
find it to be reasonably challenging or
these<00:01:02.579> things<00:01:02.820> are<00:01:03.030> annoying

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.899 

well<00:01:20.479> maybe<00:01:20.840> I<00:01:20.960> could<00:01:21.259> use<00:01:21.439> some

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
well maybe I could use some

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.230
