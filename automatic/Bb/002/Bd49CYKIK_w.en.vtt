now for these chipset these cores are

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.970 
now for these chipset these cores are
actually<00:02:21.170> pretty<00:02:21.380> good<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:21.830> can

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
actually pretty good so you can

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.620 
actually pretty good so you can

understand the optimization that has
gone<00:02:23.810> into<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.230> but<00:02:24.980> then<00:02:25.160> again<00:02:25.310> it's<00:02:25.700> no

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
fingers six fingers and you can see only

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.060 
fingers six fingers and you can see only
five<00:02:35.300> are<00:02:35.450> detected<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.320> it's<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.530> five<00:02:36.770> point

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
multi-touch display here I'll just show

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.110 
multi-touch display here I'll just show
you<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.320> apps<00:02:39.740> are<00:02:40.040> actually<00:02:40.190> moveable<00:02:41.000> to

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
you that apps are actually moveable to

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.060 
you that apps are actually moveable to
the<00:02:41.270> external<00:02:41.660> storage<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:42.770> can<00:02:42.890> see

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
the external storage so you can see

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.860 
the external storage so you can see
right<00:02:43.250> here<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:43.970> can<00:02:44.150> go<00:02:44.480> ahead<00:02:44.660> and

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
right here that you can go ahead and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.380 
right here that you can go ahead and
move<00:02:45.230> apps<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:46.160> data<00:02:46.370> part<00:02:46.700> will<00:02:46.940> need<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.270> be

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
move apps the data part will need to be

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.630 
move apps the data part will need to be
in<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.660> internal<00:02:48.050> storage<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:49.160> won't<00:02:49.520> be

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
in the internal storage so you won't be

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.430 
in the internal storage so you won't be
able<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.910> install<00:02:50.209> many<00:02:50.600> high-end<00:02:51.140> games

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
able to install many high-end games

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.130 
able to install many high-end games
since<00:02:52.070> you<00:02:52.220> are<00:02:52.340> restricted<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.180> just<00:02:53.390> 4.5

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
since you are restricted to just 4.5

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.470 
since you are restricted to just 4.5
gigs<00:02:54.440> so<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.070> would<00:02:55.310> be<00:02:55.459> able<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:55.730> install<00:02:56.150> one

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
gigs so you would be able to install one

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.140 
gigs so you would be able to install one
or<00:02:56.600> two<00:02:56.780> larger<00:02:57.380> games<00:02:57.650> but<00:02:58.340> yes<00:02:58.550> you<00:02:58.760> can<00:02:58.790> at

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
or two larger games but yes you can at

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.380 
or two larger games but yes you can at
least<00:02:59.300> move<00:02:59.570> app<00:02:59.840> part<00:03:00.580> now<00:03:01.580> let<00:03:01.730> me<00:03:01.850> just<00:03:02.120> plug

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
least move app part now let me just plug

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.500 
least move app part now let me just plug
in<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.840> USB<00:03:02.989> storage<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.970> can<00:03:05.120> see<00:03:05.300> that

it has not been detected and it's not

in terms of comparison yes you would

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.150 
in terms of comparison yes you would
