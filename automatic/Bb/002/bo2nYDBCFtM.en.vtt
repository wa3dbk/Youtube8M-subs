00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
having the 20 gigabytes free it didn't

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.310 
having the 20 gigabytes free it didn't
want<00:02:00.150> to<00:02:00.240> work<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:00.690> it<00:02:00.810> finally<00:02:01.020> worked

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
want to work and then it finally worked

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.880 
want to work and then it finally worked
and<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:02.420> Mac<00:02:03.420> wouldn't<00:02:03.810> load<00:02:03.990> again<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.590> it

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
and then Mac wouldn't load again so it

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.830 
and then Mac wouldn't load again so it
ruined<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.670> whole<00:02:05.820> thing<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.330> it's<00:02:06.479> no<00:02:06.660> big

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
ruined the whole thing but it's no big

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.310 
ruined the whole thing but it's no big
deal<00:02:06.869> i<00:02:07.080> just<00:02:08.510> put<00:02:09.510> on<00:02:09.630> all<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> software

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
deal i just put on all the software

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.820 
deal i just put on all the software
again<00:02:10.440> ok<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.580> took<00:02:11.820> a<00:02:11.880> very<00:02:12.209> long<00:02:12.330> time<00:02:12.660> but<00:02:13.500> as

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
again ok it took a very long time but as

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.680 
again ok it took a very long time but as
you<00:02:14.070> can<00:02:14.160> see<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.430> game<00:02:14.580> works<00:02:15.680> great
