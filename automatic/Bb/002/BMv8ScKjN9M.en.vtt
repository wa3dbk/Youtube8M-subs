00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.280
 Imagine you men do not exist 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.740
 I can not women then we would 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.680
 mess up life and terribly 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.080
 sound in with friends every evening 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.320
 Kaschemme with friends we thanks 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.750
 good women today not even all 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.239
 to know more 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.190
 I do not understand, just imagine 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.829
 We will do what we like 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.100
 Every day of the men's day we would 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.170
 let's celebrate the stupid thing one 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.989
 football stadiums and toads without a break 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.630
 we wish the good women a lot 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.750
 rather at home 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.970
 we will be able to see what interests you 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.370
 would be seen through female influence 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.200
 the fun can pass on thanks 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.630
 We never look to our dear women 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.580
 But more of that is for it 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.980
 operas and the alfred biolek at the glass 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.310
 There were no women on the phone 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.830
 and asked him to block and raise his hands 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.140
 he would still be fascinated by brad pitt 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.950
 the most important question of this world who 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:36.550
 not known mirror of the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:38.020
 rest the most beautiful the host had 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.100
 every fan 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.429
 and everyone by culture whatever that beer 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.380
 was flowing 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:54.039
 but thank god we have ours 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.079
 women without women would have 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.280
 how does a sense and the looks 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:02.439
 the word Chancellor is invented 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.810
 Now she introduces you calmly 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.390
 a world without shouting and with 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.229
 tupperpartys also wants one for 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.229
 always over 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:17.349
 I know who can not seconds from 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.700
 There would be traffic and gossip and gossip 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.340
 then probably not anymore 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.880
 cold feet of the conceivable and view 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.230
 nail polish and only the words fell 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.230
 a piece 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.319
 No one will be in the world in the world 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.120
 Shopping big say the odds too 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.269
 beautiful my darling she must I all 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.610
 we are we are lives the free 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.450
 go crazy and have no fear 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.450
 to put in front of 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.099
 That is why all men see this song of praise 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:57.230
 loud crew that we live our women 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.079
 is it quite clear before by your 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.799
 presence for which we highly honored 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.299
 stabbing us a few small things 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:11.090
 forget those are not the speech 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:12.470
 the value of the front door would burn 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.770
 every day 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:22.210
 and everyone was allowed to drink beer 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.610
 we trust in god thanks 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.880
 we us 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.880
 and 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.260
 end of the discussion
