00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.400
 Hello , everyone's personal is they are 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.580
 Welcome to another video and these are not 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.760
 have one in the head i seem to me more 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:29.070
 light attack and we are in this video 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.380
 staff get Ã£ the war on to the war to 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.220
 But that old habit that brings gaula 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.070
 This is because I bought the 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.210
 my worst soccer daughter's options 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.390
 in this team 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.060
 with the confession in the nation looks and one of the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.040
 games that the lion one of the children gifts 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.800
 the phrase is not very big because it was 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.170
 a more expensive option but it is one of the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.910
 one of the differences of the normal version is 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.830
 What do they offer us? 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.170
 This is what we say is what is 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.990
 say it's a dream of thousands of callers 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.549
 of duty xp has already made some say that until 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.689
 It was better and I'm here for the roosters to 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.450
 try because I never had 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:20.149
 played today is listening to 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:26.969
 computer and the spin it has 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:30.990
 much because I in aspects to tell 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:33.259
 with the fact that I say I'm weak and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.259
 poo 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.159
 You can not do it, it's who you are. 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.889
 What I wanted to talk about today, we just want 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.600
 talk about the black ops two created by 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:58.219
 tell you guys are going to buy for 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.219
 conversion is that you will buy 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.749
 buy a special version anyway are 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.399
 ready 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:07.229
 deep down you are ready to be 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.080
 black options what are your 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.390
 I'm expecting is one more and one more 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.090
 video to ask your opinion for 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.800
 do you still make comments in a 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.460
 Forum genre 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.800
 you in our opinion form is 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.870
 calm without fanaticism 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.760
 the kit that another two or three months from then 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:36.090
 name of the attack the attack well so far no 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:40.230
 conveys calm calm to a grenade in 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.780
 a journey that goes from there upwards is and 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.880
 as I was saying what I want 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.070
 that you say in the comments 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.430
 It is with our expectations as 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.210
 champions is as I have already said is the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.290
 I bought 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:58.890
 therefore is I'll have the game just to 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:04.350
 midnight on the 13th and I'm thinking 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:07.850
 make a live stream live 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.480
 from that time when there is a 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.040
 direction in which the game will be 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.050
 available not yet sure 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.840
 Did you go casually? 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.430
 I wanted you to tell us there 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.290
 if you would like to see a 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.709
 train line seen in the game 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.400
 two hours earlier than in Brazil 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:30.630
 because we have two hours of time zone 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.800
 if you want to see the news of the 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:38.100
 game at last I'll have the map in the yard 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.180
 much is for shadows there is also the 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:46.590
 tancredo pretty well placed six 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.680
 12.5 of the capital ratio for men 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.470
 change in yard 2025 to the 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.680
 multiplayer and what do you say if 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.560
 are curious and are not these news 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:10.520
 if they want me to make three more goals 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:10.520
 these people in the comments between the 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.220
 45 and the comments you want to make 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.709
 Are you curious how many children I am? 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.080
 and I do not know how much time it stimulates 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.450
 plus those 16 minutes but not voting 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.950
 these drafts have never can be 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.570
 used here in the field 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.720
 It's like you know how the games said. 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:36.920
 I had never played this game of the AT 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.290
 work I know for a fps lover it is 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:44.390
 It's really my fault. 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:47.020
 It is and the fact is it was a buy two options 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:51.820
 was a motivation to 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.820
 To interpret, I think this game is 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:03.710
 I was still a little reticent about 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.600
 the option to buy option but to another 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.850
 so that the opposite object because it is 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.690
 because I 'm not a fps player in 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.960
 computer 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.630
 I since the year 2002 as always 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.700
 in fpf for playstation i know for 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:27.830
 Most people fps in 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:30.320
 nohl checks x box that nothing is is 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.310
 almost a crime because they can not 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.530
 you have found them and it is not 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.190
 because I was going to get this 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.740
 computer 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.110
 I'm quite understanding the irony 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.520
 with life would be to buy to the computer 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:51.920
 or so it's playstation like me 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:54.470
 I experienced how you experience yumkella 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.060
 forum or fighter and battlefield 3 in 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:02.870
 my graphics card small quantity 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:07.310
 who say it had to do 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.960
 stream without any problems this year 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.600
 It's over, so I decided to buy 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.650
 computer and also to explore the 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.410
 caring is the fps and improving mine is 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.850
 my aim is that on the radio 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.150
 the people that I want you 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.650
 I commented in the comments say if 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.020
 want me to do there, I'll be there on 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.980
 that the game will be released soon after 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:34.040
 night and expectations at last staff is 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:37.220
 What your feet almost beg you 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.940
 staff were involved and this would be 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.830
 that 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.510
 therefore sporting is in the 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.350
 then leave it here favorite since in the 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.160
 level 6 is not bad because you play only one 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.430
 hour 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.210
 this is a big hug and votes 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.210
 until the next
