although I you know seems like I they're
always<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.930> bloom<00:00:28.199> when<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.470> see<00:00:28.859> them<00:00:29.099> so

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
always in bloom when I see them so

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.970 
always in bloom when I see them so
because<00:00:30.750> we<00:00:30.960> don't<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.380> lot<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.859> these

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
because we don't have a lot of these

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.690 
because we don't have a lot of these
where<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> live<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.780> can't<00:00:34.320> tell<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.829> exactly

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
where I live I can't tell you exactly

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.850 
where I live I can't tell you exactly
when<00:00:36.000> they<00:00:36.180> bloom<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.899> book<00:00:37.110> says<00:00:37.410> spring

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
when they bloom but the book says spring

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.920 
when they bloom but the book says spring
in<00:00:38.010> summer<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:39.000> certainly<00:00:39.390> see<00:00:39.719> them

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
in summer and I certainly see them

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.350 
in summer and I certainly see them
blooming<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.379> lot<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> time<00:00:41.149> when<00:00:42.149> I'm

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
blooming a lot of the time when I'm

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.709 
blooming a lot of the time when I'm
around<00:00:43.110> these<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.879> which<00:00:44.879> I've<00:00:45.090> been<00:00:45.120> in

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
around these and which I've been in

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.310 
around these and which I've been in
numerous<00:00:46.320> times<00:00:46.620> during<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.160> year<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.320> in

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
numerous times during the year so in

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.610 
numerous times during the year so in
design<00:00:50.360> well<00:00:51.360> I'll<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.870> kind<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.230> talk<00:00:52.440> about

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
design well I'll just kind of talk about

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.889 
design well I'll just kind of talk about
where<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.550> use<00:00:53.850> these<00:00:54.059> because<00:00:54.510> I'm<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
where you can use these because I'm in a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.990 
where you can use these because I'm in a
warm<00:00:55.289> inland<00:00:55.680> Valley<00:00:55.949> where<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.460> gets<00:00:56.670> quite

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
warm inland Valley where it gets quite

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240 
warm inland Valley where it gets quite
hot<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.570> I've<00:00:57.750> seen<00:00:58.050> these<00:00:58.289> used<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.129> they

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
hot and I've seen these used and they

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.520 
hot and I've seen these used and they
will<00:00:59.489> grow<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.879> they<00:01:00.270> can<00:01:00.539> tolerate<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.320> heat

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
will grow and they can tolerate the heat

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.939 
will grow and they can tolerate the heat
but<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.730> cannot<00:01:03.120> tolerate<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.930> cold<00:01:04.199> past<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
but they cannot tolerate the cold past a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.660 
but they cannot tolerate the cold past a
certain<00:01:05.159> point<00:01:05.869> they're<00:01:06.869> Hardy<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.590> about<00:01:07.920> 25

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
certain point they're Hardy to about 25

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.380 
certain point they're Hardy to about 25
degrees<00:01:09.210> Fahrenheit<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.729> if<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.939> gets<00:01:12.150> down

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
degrees Fahrenheit and if it gets down

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.109 
degrees Fahrenheit and if it gets down
in<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.840> range<00:01:13.200> that's<00:01:13.680> pretty<00:01:14.010> dicey<00:01:14.310> that

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
in that range that's pretty dicey that

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.149 
in that range that's pretty dicey that
is<00:01:15.360> where<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.780> start<00:01:15.840> having<00:01:16.380> these<00:01:16.619> die<00:01:16.920> on

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
is where you start having these die on

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.870 
is where you start having these die on
you<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:18.710> you're<00:01:19.710> gonna<00:01:19.860> use<00:01:20.220> these<00:01:20.520> in

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you so if you're gonna use these in

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.080 
you so if you're gonna use these in
frosty<00:01:21.600> areas<00:01:22.110> where<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.530> gets<00:01:22.770> below<00:01:22.979> 30<00:01:23.610> on

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
frosty areas where it gets below 30 on

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.690 
frosty areas where it gets below 30 on
any<00:01:24.509> kind<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.960> regular<00:01:25.380> basis<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.490> that

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
any kind of regular basis just know that

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.969 
any kind of regular basis just know that
you<00:01:26.850> might<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.270> using<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.810> more<00:01:28.080> as<00:01:28.290> an<00:01:28.470> annual

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
you might be using it more as an annual

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.310 
you might be using it more as an annual
than<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> perennial<00:01:29.729> these<00:01:30.540> are<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> herbaceous

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
than a perennial these are a herbaceous

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.960 
than a perennial these are a herbaceous
perennial<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:34.439> leaves<00:01:34.740> themselves<00:01:35.220> you

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
perennial and the leaves themselves you

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.950 
perennial and the leaves themselves you
saw<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.990> we'll<00:01:37.229> see<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> moment<00:01:38.070> their

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
saw and we'll see here in a moment their

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.889 
saw and we'll see here in a moment their
leafy<00:01:39.960> big<00:01:40.409> leafy<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> lettuce<00:01:42.060> leaf<00:01:42.299> kind

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
leafy big leafy like a lettuce leaf kind

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.560 
leafy big leafy like a lettuce leaf kind
of<00:01:43.049> green<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.670> see<00:01:44.909> here<00:01:45.210> some<00:01:45.540> of

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
of green and then you see here some of

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.080 
of green and then you see here some of
the<00:01:45.750> yellow<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.530> redder<00:01:47.220> leaves<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.970> those

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the yellow and redder leaves and those

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.850 
the yellow and redder leaves and those
are<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.479> leaves<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.079> are<00:01:49.140> under<00:01:49.500> stress

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
are just leaves that are under stress

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.130 
are just leaves that are under stress
coming<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.700> winter<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.990> also

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
coming out of winter and you can also

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.929 
coming out of winter and you can also
see<00:01:52.530> underneath<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.159> plant<00:01:53.430> there's<00:01:53.729> some

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
see underneath the plant there's some

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.569 
see underneath the plant there's some
dead<00:01:54.210> leaves<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.930> these<00:01:55.470> tend<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.920> sprout<00:01:56.340> out

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
dead leaves so these tend to sprout out

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.310 
dead leaves so these tend to sprout out
of<00:01:56.850> more<00:01:57.180> vigorous<00:01:58.759> pieces<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> plant<00:02:00.420> as

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
of more vigorous pieces of the plant as

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.219 
of more vigorous pieces of the plant as
they<00:02:01.740> get<00:02:01.950> older<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.520> then<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.479> get<00:02:03.689> some<00:02:03.990> die

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
they get older and then you get some die

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.760 
they get older and then you get some die
back<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.860> older<00:02:05.280> parts<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.820> plant<00:02:06.770> these

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
back in older parts of the plant these

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.570 
back in older parts of the plant these
are<00:02:07.979> also<00:02:08.750> will<00:02:09.750> go<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:09.989> seed<00:02:10.500> they<00:02:10.890> naturalize

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
are also will go to seed they naturalize

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.320 
are also will go to seed they naturalize
in<00:02:11.849> certain<00:02:12.209> areas<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.750> sandy

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
in certain areas in sandy

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.090 
in certain areas in sandy
I've<00:02:13.660> seen<00:02:13.900> these<00:02:14.080> growing<00:02:14.410> on<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.830> side<00:02:15.070> of

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
I've seen these growing on the side of

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.200 
I've seen these growing on the side of
the<00:02:15.310> road<00:02:15.550> on<00:02:15.820> sandy<00:02:16.920> kind<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.040> sandstone<00:02:18.730> hill

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
the road on sandy kind of sandstone hill

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.350 
the road on sandy kind of sandstone hill
areas<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.800> these<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.280> go<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.550> seed<00:02:22.060> in

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
areas and so these do go to seed in

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.560 
areas and so these do go to seed in
coastal<00:02:23.200> areas<00:02:23.640> at<00:02:24.640> least<00:02:24.940> in<00:02:25.150> Southern

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
coastal areas at least in Southern

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.100 
coastal areas at least in Southern
California<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:27.460> so<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.030> size<00:02:28.300> of<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:28.690> plant

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
California and so the size of this plant

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.040 
California and so the size of this plant
you<00:02:29.500> probably<00:02:30.280> plant<00:02:30.580> these<00:02:30.820> at<00:02:31.000> about<00:02:31.240> 18<00:02:31.840> to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
you probably plant these at about 18 to

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.020 
you probably plant these at about 18 to
24<00:02:32.710> inches<00:02:32.740> on<00:02:33.190> center

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
24 inches on center

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.030 
24 inches on center
typically<00:02:34.810> from<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.320> one<00:02:35.530> gallon<00:02:35.740> container

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
typically from a one gallon container

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.960 
typically from a one gallon container
and<00:02:36.850> they<00:02:37.360> make<00:02:37.570> a<00:02:37.600> great<00:02:37.930> little<00:02:38.140> accent

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
and they make a great little accent

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.090 
and they make a great little accent
these<00:02:39.970> flowers<00:02:40.570> are<00:02:40.750> great<00:02:40.960> to<00:02:41.230> dry<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> lot<00:02:41.980> of

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
these flowers are great to dry a lot of

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.030 
these flowers are great to dry a lot of
us<00:02:42.250> have<00:02:42.430> seen<00:02:42.640> these<00:02:42.880> in<00:02:43.090> arrangements<00:02:43.870> or<00:02:44.740> as

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
us have seen these in arrangements or as

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.790 
us have seen these in arrangements or as
a<00:02:45.070> dried<00:02:45.490> flower<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.420> it's<00:02:46.990> interesting<00:02:47.290> even

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
a dried flower and it's interesting even

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.410 
a dried flower and it's interesting even
when<00:02:48.070> they're<00:02:48.250> very<00:02:48.430> much<00:02:48.730> alive<00:02:49.150> they

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
when they're very much alive they

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.560 
when they're very much alive they
already<00:02:49.660> feel<00:02:50.050> like<00:02:50.320> they're<00:02:50.590> kind<00:02:50.770> of<00:02:50.980> dried

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
already feel like they're kind of dried

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.440 
already feel like they're kind of dried

the nice lavender purple color is the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.130 
the nice lavender purple color is the
calyx<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.680> then<00:02:57.070> you<00:02:57.250> see<00:02:57.520> white<00:02:58.360> in<00:02:58.720> there<00:02:58.960> as

calyx and then you see white in there as
well<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.680> that's<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.070> corolla<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.910> the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
inches high plus or minus I don't know

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.240 
inches high plus or minus I don't know
that<00:03:28.510> there's<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.810> lot<00:03:29.080> of<00:03:29.230> downside<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:30.100> this

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
that there's a lot of downside to this

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.490 
that there's a lot of downside to this
plant<00:03:30.610> I've<00:03:30.850> also<00:03:31.000> seen<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.510> used<00:03:31.870> in<00:03:32.110> deer

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
plant I've also seen it used in deer

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.620 
plant I've also seen it used in deer
areas<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.280> believe<00:03:33.760> it's<00:03:33.970> pretty<00:03:34.270> drought

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
areas so I believe it's pretty drought

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.250 
areas so I believe it's pretty drought
tolerant<00:03:35.670> but<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:37.060> would<00:03:37.270> probably<00:03:37.510> test<00:03:38.020> that

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
tolerant but I would probably test that

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.000 
tolerant but I would probably test that
one<00:03:38.470> out<00:03:38.800> I'm<00:03:39.130> sorry<00:03:39.730> deer<00:03:40.090> tolerance<00:03:40.600> so<00:03:41.010> but

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
one out I'm sorry deer tolerance so but

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.580 
one out I'm sorry deer tolerance so but
I<00:03:42.040> would<00:03:42.310> test<00:03:42.580> that<00:03:42.910> but<00:03:43.360> as<00:03:43.510> many<00:03:43.780> areas<00:03:44.380> as

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
I would test that but as many areas as

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.070 
I would test that but as many areas as
I've<00:03:44.739> seen<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.160> naturalized<00:03:45.850> in<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.360> am<00:03:46.570> kind<00:03:46.930> of

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
I've seen it naturalized in I am kind of

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.440 
I've seen it naturalized in I am kind of
assuming<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.950> that<00:03:48.520> that's<00:03:48.760> deer

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
assuming that to that that's deer

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.360 
assuming that to that that's deer
tolerant<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:50.170> it's<00:03:50.680> certainly<00:03:51.010> drought

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
tolerant and it's certainly drought

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.020 
tolerant and it's certainly drought
tolerant<00:03:52.000> this<00:03:52.150> plant<00:03:52.480> does<00:03:52.690> not<00:03:52.720> get<00:03:53.200> any

seasonal<00:03:55.030> water<00:03:55.330> for<00:03:55.750> five<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.200> six<00:03:56.380> months<00:03:56.890> in

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
seasonal water for five to six months in

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.320 
seasonal water for five to six months in
summer<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:58.989> fall<00:03:59.770> in<00:04:00.190> Southern<00:04:01.120> California

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
summer and fall in Southern California

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.290 
summer and fall in Southern California
and<00:04:02.200> it's<00:04:02.470> it's<00:04:02.800> growing<00:04:03.160> wild<00:04:03.730> so<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.120> can

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
and it's it's growing wild so it can

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.100 
and it's it's growing wild so it can
certainly<00:04:04.540> be<00:04:04.780> very<00:04:05.230> drought<00:04:05.950> tolerant<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:07.360> I

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
certainly be very drought tolerant and I

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.310 
certainly be very drought tolerant and I
think<00:04:08.410> that's<00:04:08.680> about<00:04:08.920> what<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.370> can<00:04:09.670> tell<00:04:09.910> you

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
think that's about what I can tell you

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.140 
think that's about what I can tell you
it<00:04:11.320> likes<00:04:11.620> full<00:04:11.950> Sun<00:04:11.980> it's<00:04:12.580> going<00:04:12.820> to<00:04:12.880> bloom

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
it likes full Sun it's going to bloom

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.259 
it likes full Sun it's going to bloom
best<00:04:13.540> in<00:04:13.840> full<00:04:14.140> Sun<00:04:14.200> oh<00:04:15.040> also<00:04:16.000> likes

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
best in full Sun oh also likes

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.690 
best in full Sun oh also likes
well-drained<00:04:16.900> soil<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:18.010> places<00:04:18.489> I've<00:04:18.669> seen

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
I've had experience with like this does

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.030 
I've had experience with like this does
not<00:04:33.140> tend<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:33.830> like<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.190> very<00:04:34.460> wet<00:04:35.680> many<00:04:36.680> times

you'll<00:04:37.280> get<00:04:37.460> crown<00:04:38.240> rot<00:04:38.540> so<00:04:39.110> if<00:04:39.230> you<00:04:39.380> combine

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
you'll get crown rot so if you combine

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.210 
you'll get crown rot so if you combine

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830

temperatures and you get that kind of
winter<00:04:46.130> combo<00:04:46.910> I<00:04:47.150> think<00:04:47.900> that's<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.380> main

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
winter combo I think that's the main

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.650 
winter combo I think that's the main
reason<00:04:48.650> these<00:04:49.310> get<00:04:49.580> wiped<00:04:49.820> out<00:04:50.120> where<00:04:50.390> we<00:04:50.630> are

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
reason these get wiped out where we are

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.260 
reason these get wiped out where we are
because<00:04:51.140> I<00:04:51.320> think<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.950> wet<00:04:52.190> roots<00:04:52.550> along<00:04:53.000> with

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
because I think the wet roots along with

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.540 
because I think the wet roots along with
the<00:04:53.450> extreme<00:04:53.960> cold<00:04:54.260> is<00:04:54.590> just<00:04:54.830> too<00:04:55.040> much<00:04:55.250> stress

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
the extreme cold is just too much stress
