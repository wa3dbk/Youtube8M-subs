00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
is what's stretching right here and you

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.870 
is what's stretching right here and you
want<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.339> make<00:01:06.240> sure<00:01:06.270> your<00:01:06.540> knee<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:07.110> not

longer<00:01:08.880> than<00:01:09.090> your<00:01:09.270> foot<00:01:10.010> because<00:01:11.010> then<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.310> it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
longer than your foot because then if it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.550 
longer than your foot because then if it
is<00:01:11.549> then<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.000> doesn't<00:01:12.270> stretch<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.750> that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
is then it doesn't stretch like that

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.510

you're gonna stretch on top of the thing
that's<00:02:57.900> higher<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.530> then<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.580> push<00:02:59.880> down<00:02:59.910> so

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
that's higher and then you push down so

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.540 
that's higher and then you push down so
it's<00:03:00.660> like<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:01.080> little<00:03:01.500> bit<00:03:01.680> higher<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.340> then

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
it's like a little bit higher and then

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.960 
it's like a little bit higher and then
you<00:03:02.640> just<00:03:02.820> go<00:03:03.000> down<00:03:04.460> so<00:03:05.460> it's<00:03:05.610> not<00:03:05.730> like<00:03:05.850> all

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
you just go down so it's not like all

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.210 
you just go down so it's not like all
the<00:03:06.060> gun<00:03:06.330> when<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.600> stretches<00:03:06.800> this<00:03:07.800> area

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
the gun when it stretches this area

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.680 
the gun when it stretches this area
right<00:03:08.610> here<00:03:09.620> like<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:11.010> pulled<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.790> then

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
right here like it pulled it and then

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:21.680 
right here like it pulled it and then
you<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.050> other<00:03:13.170> foot<00:03:19.550> if<00:03:20.550> you<00:03:21.240> want<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.540> do

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
you do the other foot if you want to do

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.340 
you do the other foot if you want to do
like<00:03:21.960> all<00:03:24.050> right<00:03:26.000> if<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.900> want<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.110> do<00:03:28.200> like

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
like all right if you want to do like

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.200 
like all right if you want to do like
heel<00:03:28.710> stretches<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:30.200> heel<00:03:31.200> stretch<00:03:31.500> is

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
heel stretches like a heel stretch is

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.840 
heel stretches like a heel stretch is
that<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:35.700> my<00:03:36.030> suggestion<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:37.490> well<00:03:38.490> this<00:03:38.700> is

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
that and my suggestion is well this is

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.740 
that and my suggestion is well this is
what<00:03:39.000> my<00:03:39.180> coach<00:03:39.480> taught<00:03:39.780> me<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:42.090> land<00:03:42.570> the

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
what my coach taught me you land the

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.180 
what my coach taught me you land the
ground<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.970> land<00:03:45.210> the<00:03:45.360> ground<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:46.020> you<00:03:46.860> pull

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
ground you land the ground and you pull

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.760 
ground you land the ground and you pull
up<00:03:47.430> with<00:03:47.490> the<00:03:47.940> foot<00:03:48.210> that<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.540> have<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.110> you

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
up with the foot that you have and you

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.650 
up with the foot that you have and you
pull<00:03:50.040> as<00:03:50.130> far<00:03:50.340> back<00:03:50.520> as<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.760> can<00:03:50.970> until<00:03:51.510> it

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
pull as far back as you can until it

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.150 
pull as far back as you can until it
pulls<00:03:51.990> and<00:03:52.850> then<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:54.000> do<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:56.010> don't

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
pulls and then you do that you don't

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.830 
pulls and then you do that you don't
have<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.610> exactly<00:03:57.120> just<00:03:57.870> do<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.320> guess<00:03:58.680> and

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
have to exactly just do that I guess and

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.940 
have to exactly just do that I guess and
then<00:04:00.840> eventually<00:04:00.960> you'll<00:04:01.500> get<00:04:01.620> your<00:04:01.770> heel

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
then eventually you'll get your heel

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:11.839 
then eventually you'll get your heel
