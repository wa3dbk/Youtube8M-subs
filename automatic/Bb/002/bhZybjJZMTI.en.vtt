00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.720
 with that padlock and closed this door 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.560
 then the gentleman who was standing here 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.290
 prevented me from leaving, they assure me that 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.690
 lived last weekend inside 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.050
 this barranquino restaurant was a 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:38.620
 nightmare how he started to not believe it 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.800
 they demanded 20 soles to press in the bathroom 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.920
 of the place as he listens to each one 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.710
 charged 10 soles as stated in this 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.230
 invoice literally for the use of the bathroom 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.989
 without 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.750
 because we arrived in search of a friend of 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.520
 we have seen that the boy 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.489
 he was not there I tell my friend 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.050
 it's late it's late 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.820
 logically this already went with six me 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.809
 he says already let's go but before leaving a 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.479
 record go to the bathroom 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.430
 well past then she came out of the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.650
 bathroom we tried to leave both 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.330
 enter the bathroom the two entered but 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.780
 she only uses the toilets of the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.550
 services to her only to use I do not 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.820
 marisol and sharon refused to pay what 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.009
 that obviously was an abuse then 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.590
 this guy in plaid shirt them 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.990
 prevented the exit as they count placed 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.970
 a chain in the fence and kept them 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.400
 kidnapped for 20 minutes 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.610
 at the door avoiding our exit 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.040
 I was passing someone took out an arm left 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.590
 happen when we tried to leave even 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.940
 my friend tried to get out of the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.460
 pushed 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.150
 he picked her up and pushed her and attacked her 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.310
 physically pushing and putting me aside 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.760
 it's an aggression to avoid more 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.410
 problems accepted paying we paid the 20 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.700
 soles and I said you know what else we're going to 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.550
 pay the 20 soles but you're going to 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.380
 make an invoice when you go in a 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.160
 contracture but but for consumption I 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.420
 it says no I have not consumed I use the 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.990
 hygiene services that so it puts me 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.170
 there for bathroom use this is the absurd 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.840
 invoice 20 soles for the use of the bathroom without 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.420
 permission we wanted to know why so 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.790
 we went to sonÃ³n cosongo and found 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.890
 the brother of the protagonist of this 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.070
 video you charge 10 soles for 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.140
 use the bathrooms for each person what 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.130
 what happens is that there is not a fee 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.950
 fix that is 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.310
 they are not users but they charge to use 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.280
 the social bathroom in some cases 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.620
 when 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.600
 for example they do not ask for permission they are not 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.930
 customers really try not to 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.360
 final ended asking for forgiveness I 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.730
 personally I personally ask you 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.459
 apologies to the ladies and if there 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.569
 some way to converse and solve 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.569
 the topic 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.940
 the business at no time warned or 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.430
 a sign or something that said that the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.350
 fee to use in that bathroom was 10 hours 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.610
 then from that point of view 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.840
 it has effectively become 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.910
 contraction 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.340
 Sharon had to travel to Brazil but he has not 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.980
 had to postpone the police report 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.950
 is made only seek that in the face of abuse 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.950
 like this one nobody stays silent
