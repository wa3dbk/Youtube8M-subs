hi<00:00:07.919> everyone<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:08.849> tutorial<00:00:09.030> I'm<00:00:09.540> going

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
hi everyone in this tutorial I'm going

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.690 
hi everyone in this tutorial I'm going
to<00:00:09.840> take<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.050> unity<00:00:10.500> character<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.400> give<00:00:11.610> it

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
to take a unity character and give it

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.400 
to take a unity character and give it
some<00:00:11.849> iclone<00:00:12.179> motions<00:00:12.630> by<00:00:12.840> bringing<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.259> into

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
some iclone motions by bringing it into

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.499 
some iclone motions by bringing it into
3d<00:00:13.740> exchange<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.580> mapping<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.089> characters

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.740 
emotion files this way I'll be able to
use<00:00:19.949> icon<00:00:20.430> motions<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.060> character<00:00:21.570> in

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
go up to eye contact export and then

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.390 
go up to eye contact export and then
make<00:01:03.570> sure<00:01:03.600> animation<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.470> selected<00:01:04.949> but

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
make sure animation is selected but

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.050 
make sure animation is selected but
geometry<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.119> not<00:01:10.369> after<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.520> export<00:01:11.970> is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
geometry is not after that export is

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.460 
geometry is not after that export is
done<00:01:12.240> you'll<00:01:12.600> need<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.810> make<00:01:12.930> sure<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.439> a

done you'll need to make sure you have a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.249 
done you'll need to make sure you have a
unity<00:01:13.950> character<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:15.330> you're<00:01:15.540> new<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.750> unity

model to 3d exchange but the first thing
you'll<00:01:30.049> notice<00:01:30.200> is<00:01:30.530> if<00:01:30.650> there<00:01:30.830> are<00:01:30.890> some

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
you'll notice is if there are some

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.990 
you'll notice is if there are some
material<00:01:31.520> issues<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:33.340> can<00:01:34.340> fix<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:34.729> by

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
material issues I can fix this by

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.789 
material issues I can fix this by
selecting<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:35.630> character<00:01:36.049> in<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.290> hierarchy

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
selecting the character in the hierarchy

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.680

and<00:01:36.950> then<00:01:37.460> applying<00:01:37.759> a<00:01:37.909> material<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.570> the

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
and then applying a material to the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.020 
and then applying a material to the
diffuse<00:01:39.020> swatch<00:01:39.399> I'll<00:01:40.399> just<00:01:40.640> delete<00:01:40.790> the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
diffuse swatch I'll just delete the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.310 
diffuse swatch I'll just delete the
material<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.570> comes<00:01:41.750> in<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.020> opacity

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
material that comes in the opacity

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.560 
material that comes in the opacity
swatch<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.250> then<00:01:43.610> move<00:01:43.759> over<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.240> apply<00:01:44.509> the

swatch and then move over and apply the

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.350 
swatch and then move over and apply the
bump<00:01:44.869> map<00:01:44.960> as<00:01:45.289> well<00:01:45.850> however<00:01:46.850> you'll<00:01:47.240> notice

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
bump map as well however you'll notice

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.730 
bump map as well however you'll notice
that<00:01:47.570> there<00:01:47.750> are<00:01:47.840> still<00:01:48.080> a<00:01:48.140> few<00:01:48.229> issues<00:01:48.560> with

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
that there are still a few issues with

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.700 
that there are still a few issues with
the<00:01:48.950> character's<00:01:49.340> appearance<00:01:50.350> I'll<00:01:51.350> adjust

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
the character's appearance I'll adjust

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.499 
the character's appearance I'll adjust
it<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.950> bit<00:01:52.100> further<00:01:52.340> by<00:01:52.610> setting<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.060> diffuse

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
it a bit further by setting the diffuse

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.490 
it a bit further by setting the diffuse
ambient<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:54.500> specular<00:01:55.190> maps<00:01:55.399> all<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:56.060> whites

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.020 

after<00:02:00.500> I'm<00:02:00.590> done<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.250> want<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.729> set<00:02:01.909> the

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
after I'm done that I want to set the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.630 
after I'm done that I want to set the
self<00:02:02.300> illumination<00:02:02.479> up<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.259> full<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.830> also

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
self illumination up to full and also

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.430 
self illumination up to full and also
adjust<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.119> specular<00:02:05.569> levels<00:02:05.899> to<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.110> suitable

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
adjust the specular levels to a suitable

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.309 
adjust the specular levels to a suitable
range<00:02:10.269> okay<00:02:11.269> so<00:02:11.330> now<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.630> material<00:02:12.110> settings

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
range okay so now the material settings

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.500 
range okay so now the material settings
are<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.590> lot<00:02:12.830> better<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.819> let's<00:02:14.000> move<00:02:14.090> on<00:02:14.269> to<00:02:14.300> the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
are a lot better so let's move on to the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.030 
are a lot better so let's move on to the
next<00:02:14.660> step<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.230> characterization

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
next step of the characterization

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.000 
next step of the characterization
process<00:02:16.069> full<00:02:16.910> mappings<00:02:17.440> just<00:02:18.440> click<00:02:18.650> convert

few minutes but in the end you'll be

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.699 
few minutes but in the end you'll be
able<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.970> apply<00:03:08.090> any<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:08.660> call<00:03:09.049> motion<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.620> your

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.960 

once<00:03:17.200> my<00:03:17.350> mapping<00:03:17.740> is<00:03:17.860> done<00:03:18.130> I'll<00:03:18.460> need<00:03:18.850> to

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
once my mapping is done I'll need to

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.760 
once my mapping is done I'll need to
adjust<00:03:19.060> my<00:03:19.390> character's<00:03:19.960> posture<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.500> little

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
adjust my character's posture a little

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.060 
adjust my character's posture a little
bit<00:03:20.920> as<00:03:21.040> well<00:03:22.590> you'll<00:03:23.590> see<00:03:23.800> that<00:03:23.920> when

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
bit as well you'll see that when

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.190 
bit as well you'll see that when
imported<00:03:24.520> into<00:03:24.640> 3d<00:03:24.970> exchange<00:03:25.480> his<00:03:25.900> toes<00:03:26.170> are

imported into 3d exchange his toes are

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.570 
imported into 3d exchange his toes are
pointed<00:03:26.680> upwards<00:03:27.010> slightly<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:30.190> what<00:03:30.340> I<00:03:30.370> can

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
pointed upwards slightly so what I can

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.820 
pointed upwards slightly so what I can
do<00:03:30.760> is<00:03:30.940> select<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.420> correct<00:03:31.660> bone<00:03:31.960> and<00:03:32.290> then

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
do is select the correct bone and then

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.740 
do is select the correct bone and then
use<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.160> rotation<00:03:33.520> tool<00:03:33.910> to<00:03:34.210> adjust<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.720> to

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
use the rotation tool to adjust it to

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.340 
use the rotation tool to adjust it to
the<00:03:34.900> proper<00:03:34.990> position<00:03:36.690> also<00:03:37.690> important<00:03:38.140> is<00:03:38.260> to

the proper position also important is to

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.660 
the proper position also important is to
check<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.680> vertical<00:03:39.070> posture<00:03:39.460> of<00:03:39.550> the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
check the vertical posture of the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.570 
check the vertical posture of the
character<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.330> make<00:03:40.810> sure<00:03:41.020> it's<00:03:41.200> upright<00:03:41.620> to

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
character and make sure it's upright to

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.550

post and what I want to do is basically
adjust<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:11.860> arm<00:04:12.040> position<00:04:12.490> a<00:04:12.610> bit<00:04:12.640> so<00:04:13.330> the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
adjust the arm position a bit so the

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.060 
adjust the arm position a bit so the
position<00:04:13.840> changes<00:04:14.260> well<00:04:14.440> translate<00:04:14.920> into

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
position changes well translate into

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.360 
position changes well translate into
little<00:04:15.460> or<00:04:15.610> no<00:04:15.760> mesh<00:04:16.060> penetration<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:18.010> do<00:04:18.190> this

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
little or no mesh penetration to do this

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.160 
little or no mesh penetration to do this
I'll<00:04:18.640> use<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:18.970> rotation<00:04:19.480> tool<00:04:19.630> again<00:04:19.930> and

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
I'll use the rotation tool again and

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.500 
I'll use the rotation tool again and
rotate<00:04:20.799> my<00:04:20.950> characters<00:04:21.400> upper<00:04:21.730> arm<00:04:21.910> section<00:04:22.390> a

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
rotate my characters upper arm section a

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.270 
rotate my characters upper arm section a
little<00:04:22.540> back<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.470> little<00:04:23.680> upwards<00:04:24.070> to

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
little back and the little upwards to

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.040 
little back and the little upwards to
compensate<00:04:24.850> for<00:04:25.030> his<00:04:25.090> relatively<00:04:25.780> large

now you can see when I preview the run

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.740 
now you can see when I preview the run
once<00:04:35.250> again<00:04:35.610> that<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.060> arm<00:04:36.240> position<00:04:36.660> is

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
once again that the arm position is

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.619 
once again that the arm position is
adjusted<00:04:37.229> accordingly<00:04:38.120> so<00:04:39.120> now<00:04:39.419> my<00:04:39.569> character

this what I need to do is first create a
dummy<00:06:37.760> game<00:06:38.060> object<00:06:38.510> and<00:06:38.750> then<00:06:39.080> assign<00:06:39.380> it<00:06:39.410> as

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
dummy game object and then assign it as

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.270 
dummy game object and then assign it as
the<00:06:39.710> parent<00:06:40.040> of<00:06:40.160> my<00:06:40.280> character<00:06:41.740> so<00:06:42.740> I'll<00:06:43.040> first

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
the parent of my character so I'll first

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.400 
the hierarchy over to that dummy and the
relationship<00:06:50.810> is<00:06:50.990> assigned<00:06:52.930> once<00:06:53.930> I<00:06:54.050> do<00:06:54.110> that

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
however I'll also need to reset the

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.090 
however I'll also need to reset the
position<00:06:56.270> properties<00:06:57.050> back<00:06:57.260> to<00:06:57.470> zero<00:06:57.740> for<00:06:58.010> my

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
position properties back to zero for my

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.250 
position properties back to zero for my
robots<00:06:58.520> and<00:06:58.850> then<00:06:59.390> select<00:06:59.720> a<00:06:59.810> dummy<00:07:00.050> object

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
robots and then select a dummy object

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.680 
robots and then select a dummy object
and<00:07:00.800> move<00:07:01.160> it<00:07:01.280> down<00:07:01.460> to<00:07:01.730> the<00:07:01.820> proper<00:07:02.210> height

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:04.690 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.790

lastly you may have noticed that the

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.380 
lastly you may have noticed that the
character<00:07:07.250> is<00:07:07.370> a<00:07:07.400> little<00:07:07.760> small<00:07:08.090> for<00:07:08.300> this

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.390 
character is a little small for this

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.170 
character is a little small for this
particular<00:07:08.930> stage<00:07:09.260> so<00:07:10.100> I<00:07:10.130> can<00:07:10.310> scale<00:07:10.730> it<00:07:10.760> up<00:07:11.000> as

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.180 
particular stage so I can scale it up as

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.850 
particular stage so I can scale it up as
well<00:07:13.750> now<00:07:14.750> you<00:07:14.810> can<00:07:15.050> see<00:07:15.230> that<00:07:15.350> everything<00:07:15.800> is

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
well now you can see that everything is

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.350 
well now you can see that everything is
in<00:07:15.920> working<00:07:16.220> order<00:07:16.460> when<00:07:16.730> I<00:07:16.790> preview<00:07:17.270> the

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
in working order when I preview the

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.140 
in working order when I preview the
motion<00:07:17.690> once<00:07:17.900> again<00:07:21.640> let's<00:07:22.640> go<00:07:22.760> over<00:07:22.880> to<00:07:23.030> my

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.150 
motion once again let's go over to my

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.090 
motion once again let's go over to my
robot<00:07:23.510> again<00:07:23.810> and<00:07:24.080> preview<00:07:24.590> another<00:07:24.860> motion

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:25.100 
robot again and preview another motion

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.790 
robot again and preview another motion
by<00:07:25.490> dragging<00:07:25.940> it<00:07:26.030> from<00:07:26.060> my<00:07:26.360> project<00:07:26.630> view<00:07:27.170> over

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
by dragging it from my project view over

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.620 
by dragging it from my project view over
to<00:07:27.920> the<00:07:28.010> inspector<00:07:28.550> and<00:07:28.700> pressing<00:07:29.120> play<00:07:29.150> again

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
to the inspector and pressing play again

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:35.650 
to the inspector and pressing play again
I<00:07:33.130> can<00:07:34.130> repeat<00:07:34.370> the<00:07:34.430> same<00:07:34.550> process<00:07:35.000> with<00:07:35.450> all

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:35.660 
I can repeat the same process with all

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:42.859 
I can repeat the same process with all
the<00:07:35.840> other<00:07:35.990> motions<00:07:36.470> as<00:07:36.620> well

00:07:42.859 --> 00:07:42.869 

00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:45.629

so there you have it now you know how to

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:47.639 
so there you have it now you know how to
take<00:07:45.879> any<00:07:46.119> character<00:07:46.629> motion<00:07:46.990> in<00:07:47.080> a<00:07:47.259> motion

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:47.649 
take any character motion in a motion

00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:49.829 
take any character motion in a motion
format<00:07:48.039> and<00:07:48.279> convert<00:07:48.879> them<00:07:49.059> for<00:07:49.240> use<00:07:49.419> with<00:07:49.629> any
