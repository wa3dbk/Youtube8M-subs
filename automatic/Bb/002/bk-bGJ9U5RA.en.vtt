else<00:04:48.690> you<00:04:48.930> can<00:04:49.080> fit<00:04:49.320> but<00:04:49.730> that's<00:04:50.730> how<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.000> carry

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
else you can fit but that's how I carry

else you can fit but that's how I carry
this<00:04:51.750> bag<00:04:52.140> when<00:04:52.890> I<00:04:53.570> when<00:04:54.570> I<00:04:54.600> go<00:04:54.870> out<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.470> it

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
this bag when I when I go out and it

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:07.670 
this bag when I when I go out and it
barely<00:04:56.750> closes<00:04:58.130> so<00:05:04.190> so<00:05:05.360> yeah<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:07.110> this<00:05:07.410> is<00:05:07.470> my

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
barely closes so so yeah and this is my

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.600 
barely closes so so yeah and this is my
neo<00:05:08.490> medium<00:05:09.030> for<00:05:09.390> back<00:05:09.720> is<00:05:10.050> this<00:05:10.350> you<00:05:10.560> can<00:05:10.890> see

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.200 

this<00:05:14.610> little<00:05:15.600> mini<00:05:15.930> boy<00:05:16.350> bag<00:05:16.680> it's<00:05:17.370> about<00:05:17.640> like

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
this little mini boy bag it's about like

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.600 
this little mini boy bag it's about like
a<00:05:18.380> quarter<00:05:21.080> size<00:05:22.080> of<00:05:22.590> my<00:05:22.950> new<00:05:23.370> media<00:05:23.790> boy<00:05:24.300> bag

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
a quarter size of my new media boy bag

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.790 
a quarter size of my new media boy bag
so<00:05:26.610> again<00:05:26.970> it<00:05:27.540> doesn't<00:05:27.780> fit<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.140> lot<00:05:28.470> it<00:05:28.770> just

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
so again it doesn't fit a lot it just

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.720 
so again it doesn't fit a lot it just
fits<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:31.350> very<00:05:31.980> basic<00:05:32.850> essential

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
fits the very basic essential

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.580 
fits the very basic essential
strategically<00:05:35.730> we<00:05:36.030> can<00:05:36.270> put<00:05:36.840> those<00:05:37.020> in<00:05:37.380> there

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
strategically we can put those in there

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.910 
strategically we can put those in there
so<00:05:40.490> so<00:05:41.490> again<00:05:42.240> this<00:05:42.840> is<00:05:43.050> what<00:05:43.290> it<00:05:43.440> looks<00:05:43.620> like

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
so so again this is what it looks like

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.600 
so so again this is what it looks like
inside<00:05:45.830> so<00:05:46.830> yeah<00:05:47.220> I<00:05:47.460> just<00:05:47.520> wanted<00:05:47.910> to<00:05:48.120> show<00:05:48.870> you

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.270 
boy back and this is how small it is
I<00:05:58.100> like<00:05:59.100> this<00:05:59.400> stingray<00:06:00.380> boy<00:06:01.380> bag<00:06:01.680> I've<00:06:02.040> been

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
I like this stingray boy bag I've been

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.310 
I like this stingray boy bag I've been
looking<00:06:03.180> for<00:06:03.390> it<00:06:03.480> for<00:06:03.510> a<00:06:03.660> while<00:06:03.840> before<00:06:04.080> I

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
looking for it for a while before I

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.990 
looking for it for a while before I
finally<00:06:04.940> bought<00:06:05.940> it<00:06:06.180> one<00:06:07.080> of<00:06:07.170> my<00:06:07.350> essays<00:06:08.000> was

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
finally bought it one of my essays was

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.230 
finally bought it one of my essays was
able<00:06:09.360> to<00:06:09.390> locate<00:06:09.690> one<00:06:10.110> for<00:06:10.380> me

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
able to locate one for me

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.930 
able to locate one for me
so<00:06:12.240> I<00:06:12.680> decided<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:13.830> get<00:06:14.160> it<00:06:14.340> because<00:06:14.670> I<00:06:14.700> was

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
so I decided to get it because I was

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.020 
so I decided to get it because I was
looking<00:06:15.060> for<00:06:15.450> it<00:06:15.540> for<00:06:15.570> a<00:06:15.750> long<00:06:15.810> time<00:06:15.960> so<00:06:16.470> I

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
looking for it for a long time so I

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.140 
looking for it for a long time so I
purchased<00:06:18.030> this<00:06:18.470> last<00:06:19.470> year<00:06:20.010> in<00:06:20.490> about<00:06:20.760> late

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
purchased this last year in about late

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.390 
purchased this last year in about late
October<00:06:21.930> and<00:06:22.500> I<00:06:22.830> used<00:06:23.070> it<00:06:23.280> a<00:06:23.370> couple<00:06:23.580> times

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
October and I used it a couple times

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.520 
October and I used it a couple times
to<00:06:24.940> go<00:06:25.090> out<00:06:25.240> at<00:06:25.389> night<00:06:25.419> and<00:06:25.630> go<00:06:25.990> to<00:06:26.020> parties<00:06:26.290> and

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
to go out at night and go to parties and

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.260 
to go out at night and go to parties and
such<00:06:26.919> so<00:06:27.370> it's<00:06:28.030> very<00:06:28.600> pretty<00:06:29.259> but<00:06:30.250> it's<00:06:30.940> not

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
such so it's very pretty but it's not

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.990 
such so it's very pretty but it's not
really<00:06:31.990> practical<00:06:32.620> as<00:06:33.130> you<00:06:33.340> can<00:06:33.520> see<00:06:33.729> it<00:06:33.850> only

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
really practical as you can see it only

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.950 
really practical as you can see it only
fits<00:06:34.889> so<00:06:35.889> little<00:06:36.280> inside<00:06:37.000> and<00:06:37.389> if<00:06:37.690> you<00:06:37.810> have<00:06:37.930> a

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
fits so little inside and if you have a

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:44.029 
fits so little inside and if you have a
bigger<00:06:38.259> phone<00:06:39.060> it<00:06:40.060> won't<00:06:40.240> fit<00:06:40.600> and<00:06:41.250> if<00:06:42.250> you

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 
bigger phone it won't fit and if you

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.529 
bigger phone it won't fit and if you
don't<00:06:45.039> want<00:06:45.190> to<00:06:45.310> fit<00:06:45.490> your<00:06:45.669> phone<00:06:45.850> inside<00:06:46.300> here

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:46.539 
don't want to fit your phone inside here

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.860 
don't want to fit your phone inside here
and<00:06:46.600> then<00:06:46.690> you<00:06:46.840> can<00:06:47.020> maybe<00:06:47.199> fit<00:06:47.470> a<00:06:47.620> card<00:06:47.889> case

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
and then you can maybe fit a card case

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.060 
and then you can maybe fit a card case
but<00:06:49.870> you<00:06:50.050> have<00:06:50.199> to<00:06:50.350> carry<00:06:50.590> your<00:06:50.800> phone

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
but you have to carry your phone

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.300 
but you have to carry your phone
elsewhere<00:06:52.030> so<00:06:52.330> that's<00:06:52.539> not<00:06:52.919> convenient<00:06:53.919> for

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
elsewhere so that's not convenient for

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.870 
elsewhere so that's not convenient for
me<00:06:54.460> so<00:06:54.840> at<00:06:55.840> least<00:06:56.110> fits<00:06:56.710> my<00:06:57.160> phone<00:06:57.460> in<00:06:57.699> there

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
me so at least fits my phone in there

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.620 
me so at least fits my phone in there
even<00:06:58.510> though<00:06:58.660> I<00:06:58.690> have<00:06:59.080> to<00:06:59.639> slot<00:07:00.639> it<00:07:00.820> diagonally

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
even though I have to slot it diagonally

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.290 
even though I have to slot it diagonally
