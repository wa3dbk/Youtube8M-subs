00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
chopper like that which is pretty cool

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.130 
chopper like that which is pretty cool
but<00:04:06.290> I<00:04:06.350> think<00:04:06.410> it's<00:04:06.710> just<00:04:06.920> way<00:04:07.190> too<00:04:07.250> small<00:04:08.140> and

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
but I think it's just way too small and

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.980 
but I think it's just way too small and
and<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.440> kind<00:04:09.680> of<00:04:09.740> like<00:04:09.890> war<00:04:10.130> machine<00:04:10.990> with

and I kind of like war machine with
complete<00:04:13.630> with<00:04:14.630> complete<00:04:15.230> arsenal<00:04:15.860> I<00:04:16.810> never<00:04:17.810> I

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
complete with complete arsenal I never I

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.680 
complete with complete arsenal I never I
never<00:04:18.109> had<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.770> blind<00:04:19.010> pack<00:04:19.280> I<00:04:19.700> started

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
never had the blind pack I started

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.760 
never had the blind pack I started
collecting<00:04:20.810> these<00:04:21.200> lates

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
collecting these lates

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.490 
collecting these lates
they<00:04:22.160> were<00:04:22.280> all<00:04:22.430> fresh<00:04:22.700> out<00:04:22.940> he<00:04:23.720> can't<00:04:24.020> fit

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
they were all fresh out he can't fit

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.780 
they were all fresh out he can't fit
into<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:25.010> chopper

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
into the chopper

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.830 
into the chopper
as<00:04:26.120> well<00:04:26.450> I<00:04:26.720> think<00:04:26.960> even<00:04:27.350> with<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.710> weapons<00:04:28.070> on

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
as well I think even with the weapons on

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.320 
as well I think even with the weapons on
maybe<00:04:31.840> epic<00:04:32.840> fail<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.410> I<00:04:33.500> can't<00:04:34.180> well<00:04:35.180> he

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
maybe epic fail and I can't well he

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.780 
maybe epic fail and I can't well he
could<00:04:35.570> if<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:36.170> removed<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:37.100> backpack<00:04:37.580> I'm

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790

could if you removed the backpack I'm
sorry<00:04:38.000> I'm<00:04:38.120> sure<00:04:38.300> he<00:04:38.450> could<00:04:39.220> but<00:04:40.220> anyway<00:04:40.550> just

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
sorry I'm sure he could but anyway just

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.510 
sorry I'm sure he could but anyway just
for<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.150> sake<00:04:41.330> of<00:04:41.420> argument<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:43.100> chopper

itself<00:04:43.880> is<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.380> fantastic<00:04:45.380> build<00:04:45.650> set<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.340> mean<00:04:46.370> I

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
itself is a fantastic build set I mean I

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.480 
itself is a fantastic build set I mean I
absolutely<00:04:47.180> love<00:04:47.810> this<00:04:48.650> particular<00:04:48.950> chopper

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
absolutely love this particular chopper

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.590 
absolutely love this particular chopper
I<00:04:49.610> was<00:04:49.760> building<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.150> only<00:04:50.300> thing<00:04:50.420> I<00:04:50.480> hate

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
I was building the only thing I hate

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.770 
I was building the only thing I hate
about<00:04:50.660> it<00:04:50.960> are<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.230> legs<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.920> landing<00:04:52.520> pads

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
about it are the legs the landing pads

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.630 
about it are the legs the landing pads
it<00:04:53.780> even<00:04:54.200> comes<00:04:54.410> with<00:04:54.560> an<00:04:54.710> extra<00:04:54.950> piece<00:04:55.250> a

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
it even comes with an extra piece a

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.340 
it even comes with an extra piece a
temporary<00:04:56.090> piece<00:04:56.420> which<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:56.750> can<00:04:56.900> add<00:04:57.050> to

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
temporary piece which you can add to

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.870 
temporary piece which you can add to
keep<00:04:57.590> it<00:04:57.740> stable<00:04:58.100> while<00:04:58.250> you're<00:04:58.400> building<00:04:58.760> it

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
keep it stable while you're building it

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.270 
keep it stable while you're building it
or<00:04:59.180> while<00:04:59.690> you're<00:04:59.840> displaying<00:05:00.290> it<00:05:00.440> but<00:05:01.190> you

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
or while you're displaying it but you

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.840 
or while you're displaying it but you
don't<00:05:01.400> really<00:05:01.730> need<00:05:02.210> it<00:05:02.270> it'll<00:05:03.610> sit<00:05:04.610> fine

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
don't really need it it'll sit fine

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.080 
don't really need it it'll sit fine
it'll<00:05:05.120> stand<00:05:05.330> up<00:05:05.540> just<00:05:05.570> fine<00:05:06.520> he<00:05:07.520> also<00:05:07.670> comes

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
it'll stand up just fine he also comes

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.190 
it'll stand up just fine he also comes
with<00:05:08.240> a<00:05:08.450> sort<00:05:08.720> of<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:09.700> makeshift<00:05:10.700> helipad<00:05:11.170> or<00:05:12.170> a

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
with a sort of a makeshift helipad or a

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.590 
with a sort of a makeshift helipad or a
marker<00:05:12.770> it's<00:05:13.010> think<00:05:13.730> it's<00:05:13.760> way<00:05:14.150> too<00:05:14.210> small

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
marker it's think it's way too small

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.840 
marker it's think it's way too small
maybe<00:05:15.050> for<00:05:15.290> a<00:05:15.320> building<00:05:15.770> I<00:05:15.980> think<00:05:16.490> we'll<00:05:16.730> be

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
maybe for a building I think we'll be

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.350 
maybe for a building I think we'll be
fine

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
fine

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.540 
fine
but<00:05:17.510> extra<00:05:18.260> pieces<00:05:18.470> do<00:05:18.650> that<00:05:18.830> you<00:05:19.250> can<00:05:19.400> also

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
but extra pieces do that you can also

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.010 
but extra pieces do that you can also
rebuild<00:05:20.150> this<00:05:20.360> particular<00:05:20.750> set<00:05:21.220> into<00:05:22.220> a<00:05:23.020> an

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
rebuild this particular set into a an

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.340 
rebuild this particular set into a an
aquatic<00:05:24.790> hydro<00:05:25.790> vehicle<00:05:26.270> or<00:05:26.360> an<00:05:26.420> aquatic

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
aquatic hydro vehicle or an aquatic

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.570 
aquatic hydro vehicle or an aquatic
vehicle<00:05:29.680> sort<00:05:30.680> of<00:05:30.740> like<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.860> speedboat<00:05:31.310> just

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
vehicle sort of like a speedboat just

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.700 
vehicle sort of like a speedboat just
like<00:05:31.700> this<00:05:31.880> one<00:05:32.150> but<00:05:32.570> I<00:05:32.810> think<00:05:32.870> this<00:05:33.230> is<00:05:33.470> the

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
like this one but I think this is the

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.910 
like this one but I think this is the
better<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:36.530> better<00:05:38.260> vehicle<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.440> build<00:05:39.650> and

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:39.920 
better the better vehicle to build and

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.590 
better the better vehicle to build and
will<00:05:40.310> include<00:05:40.490> all<00:05:40.760> the<00:05:40.880> parts<00:05:41.180> I<00:05:41.300> think<00:05:41.510> the

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
will include all the parts I think the

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.110 
will include all the parts I think the
the<00:05:41.870> second<00:05:42.260> version<00:05:42.440> will<00:05:43.040> not<00:05:43.250> use<00:05:43.730> up<00:05:43.940> all

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
the second version will not use up all

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.170 
the second version will not use up all
the<00:05:44.150> parts<00:05:44.480> so<00:05:45.290> anyway<00:05:45.530> a<00:05:45.710> very<00:05:46.640> very<00:05:46.970> good

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
the parts so anyway a very very good

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.910 
the parts so anyway a very very good
sets<00:05:47.540> I'm<00:05:47.780> actually<00:05:47.990> very<00:05:48.350> impressed<00:05:48.770> with

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
sets I'm actually very impressed with

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.020 
sets I'm actually very impressed with
these<00:05:49.070> mega<00:05:49.280> block<00:05:49.550> sets

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
these mega block sets

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.270 
these mega block sets
I'm<00:05:50.150> actually<00:05:50.330> glad<00:05:50.660> I<00:05:50.780> picked<00:05:51.140> them<00:05:51.230> up<00:05:51.410> on

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
I'm actually glad I picked them up on

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.940 
I'm actually glad I picked them up on
clearance<00:05:52.760> for<00:05:53.000> that<00:05:53.090> matter<00:05:53.620> if<00:05:54.620> you<00:05:54.770> see
