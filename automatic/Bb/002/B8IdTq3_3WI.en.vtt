he pulling on this turns analyze to the
left<00:02:39.849> but<00:02:40.150> yet<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.450> just<00:02:40.599> took<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.900> corner<00:02:41.200> going

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
left but yet I just took a corner going

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.220 
left but yet I just took a corner going
to<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.650> right

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.430 

another<00:02:44.709> way<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:44.950> people<00:02:45.430> do<00:02:45.550> it

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
another way to people do it

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.470 
another way to people do it
push<00:02:47.620> right<00:02:47.920> go<00:02:48.250> right<00:02:48.550> so<00:02:49.060> when<00:02:49.210> you<00:02:49.270> push

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
push right go right so when you push

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.880 
push right go right so when you push
right<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:49.930> should<00:02:50.140> turn<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.440> handlebars<00:02:50.680> to

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
right you should turn the handlebars to

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.800 
right you should turn the handlebars to
the<00:02:51.010> left<00:02:51.250> right<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:52.330> I<00:02:52.390> took<00:02:52.480> this<00:02:52.720> hand<00:02:52.960> off

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
the left right so I took this hand off

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
the left right so I took this hand off
I<00:02:54.870> push<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.280> bring<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.580> flag<00:02:56.849> to<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.599> right

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
I push and I bring the flag to the right

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.530 
I push and I bring the flag to the right
by<00:02:58.830> pushing<00:02:59.130> on<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.430> right<00:02:59.640> handle<00:03:00.000> bar<00:03:00.120> turns

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
by pushing on the right handle bar turns

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.240 
by pushing on the right handle bar turns
the<00:03:00.630> handle<00:03:00.780> bars<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.260> left<00:03:01.349> makes<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.950> bike

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
the handle bars to the left makes a bike

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.830 
the handle bars to the left makes a bike
go<00:03:02.430> around<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:02.790> right<00:03:02.940> corner

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
go around that right corner

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.540 
go around that right corner
that's<00:03:05.349> it<00:03:05.560> easy<00:03:06.190> as<00:03:06.550> that<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:08.230> kicks<00:03:08.620> in<00:03:08.860> at

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
that's it easy as that this kicks in at

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.610 
that's it easy as that this kicks in at
any<00:03:09.790> speed<00:03:10.120> above<00:03:10.420> ten<00:03:10.690> kilometers<00:03:11.230> an<00:03:11.319> hour<00:03:11.440> I

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
any speed above ten kilometers an hour I

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.290

that would have worked

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.600 
that would have worked
what<00:04:04.260> about<00:04:04.349> the<00:04:04.560> cutback<00:04:04.920> guy<00:04:05.099> off<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.459> get

there
here's<00:04:08.159> a<00:04:08.310> little<00:04:08.519> side<00:04:08.670> street<00:04:08.970> I'll<00:04:09.120> take

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
here's a little side street I'll take

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:16.039 
here's a little side street I'll take
that

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.499 

so<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:18.239> guy's<00:04:18.590> passing<00:04:19.590> on<00:04:19.680> total<00:04:19.949> song<00:04:20.509> okay

00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:24.629 
so at this speed if I turn to the right

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:25.850 
so at this speed if I turn to the right
the<00:04:24.810> bike<00:04:24.990> will<00:04:25.139> go<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.440> right<00:04:25.560> obviously

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
the bike will go to the right obviously

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.159 
the bike will go to the right obviously
see<00:04:26.490> it's<00:04:26.610> going<00:04:26.759> to<00:04:26.849> the<00:04:26.940> right<00:04:27.120> now<00:04:28.050> I'm

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169

kilometres an hour I turn to the left to
go<00:04:33.210> left<00:04:33.419> at<00:04:33.539> turn<00:04:33.690> two<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.810> radical<00:04:34.259> right

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
go left at turn two the radical right

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.369 
go left at turn two the radical right
okay<00:04:35.039> but<00:04:35.340> now<00:04:35.460> if<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.639> do<00:04:35.780> 20<00:04:36.780> kilometers<00:04:37.229> now

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
okay but now if I do 20 kilometers now

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.980 
okay but now if I do 20 kilometers now
turn<00:04:37.800> to<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:37.949> right<00:04:38.099> make<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.460> left<00:04:38.490> turn<00:04:39.000> to

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
turn to the right make a left turn to

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.820 
turn to the right make a left turn to
the<00:04:40.050> left<00:04:40.199> I<00:04:40.349> go<00:04:40.500> right

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.879 

yeah<00:04:45.310> so<00:04:45.610> it's<00:04:46.330> right<00:04:46.539> around<00:04:46.659> 15<00:04:47.379> or<00:04:47.530> 20

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
yeah so it's right around 15 or 20

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.490 
yeah so it's right around 15 or 20
kilometers<00:04:48.430> an<00:04:48.460> hour<00:04:48.699> which<00:04:49.120> is<00:04:49.330> about<00:04:49.500> 12

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
kilometers an hour which is about 12

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.879 
kilometers an hour which is about 12
miles<00:04:50.889> an<00:04:51.190> hour<00:04:51.370> maybe<00:04:51.940> 8<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:53.139> 12<00:04:53.409> miles<00:04:53.680> an

miles an hour maybe 8 to 12 miles an
hour<00:04:54.069> it<00:04:54.819> switches<00:04:55.210> from<00:04:55.539> steering<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.020> way

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
hour it switches from steering the way

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.170 
hour it switches from steering the way
you<00:04:56.199> want<00:04:56.530> to<00:04:56.650> go<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:56.830> going<00:04:57.639> the<00:04:57.729> opposite<00:04:58.120> way

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
you want to go to going the opposite way

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.610 
you want to go to going the opposite way
and<00:04:58.720> I've<00:04:58.870> altered<00:04:59.050> this<00:04:59.289> is<00:04:59.440> interesting

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
and I've altered this is interesting

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.070 
and I've altered this is interesting
I've<00:05:00.099> often<00:05:00.310> heard<00:05:00.550> people<00:05:00.610> say<00:05:01.120> at<00:05:01.419> speeds

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
I've often heard people say at speeds

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.439 
I've often heard people say at speeds
under<00:05:02.650> 10<00:05:02.919> miles<00:05:03.159> an<00:05:03.370> hour<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.849> motorcycle

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
under 10 miles an hour the motorcycle

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.300 
under 10 miles an hour the motorcycle
steers<00:05:04.720> like<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:05.020> bicycle<00:05:05.590> turn<00:05:05.770> right<00:05:06.009> go

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
steers like a bicycle turn right go

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.029 
steers like a bicycle turn right go
right<00:05:06.550> but<00:05:07.389> it<00:05:07.509> speeds<00:05:07.780> over<00:05:08.110> 10<00:05:08.620> miles<00:05:08.830> an

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
right but it speeds over 10 miles an

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.070 
right but it speeds over 10 miles an
hour<00:05:09.190> it<00:05:09.550> you<00:05:10.000> can<00:05:10.419> use<00:05:10.569> this<00:05:10.690> counter

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
hour it you can use this counter

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.619
