00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
a support player the p90 works great

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.170 
a support player the p90 works great

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.210 
with the hardline UAV ballistic vest
gumbo<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.410> is<00:03:10.440> probably<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.950> best

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
gumbo so this is probably the best

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.120 
gumbo so this is probably the best
support<00:03:11.610> setup<00:03:12.030> if<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:13.170> soul<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.680> your<00:03:13.890> sort<00:03:14.070> of

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
killstreaks take advantage of the good

the<00:03:18.840> p90<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:20.430> personally<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.060> think<00:03:21.090> 6<00:03:21.660> 9<00:03:21.840> 12

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.540 
the p90 so personally I think 6 9 12
allows<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.740> loop<00:03:22.950> your<00:03:23.130> killstreak
