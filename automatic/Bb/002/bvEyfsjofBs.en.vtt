00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.860
 My name is Vladimir Selivan 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.300
 practicing psychologist and today we 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.389
 talk about the topic 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.020
 treason in the relationship of men and women 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.970
 and as for cheating there may be 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.910
 for a start it makes sense to think at all 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.800
 over the very notion of treason what is 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.899
 treason and where the boundaries where what action 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.690
 is a traitor dystonia is 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.190
 treason because after all the relationship between 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.360
 men and women can be very 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.640
 different for someone 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.770
 is already a betrayal for someone sex on 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 side is not cheating 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.570
 therefore it is important to understand how about what 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.050
 we say and it is also important that in fact 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.910
 word betrayal already laid some not 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.800
 negative 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.129
 discussion estimated about the most 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.290
 such an event but cheating is like 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.740
 as a betrayal that is a man 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.460
 who changed he means betray why 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.680
 I would like to move away from it 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.840
 but such a critical judgment is because 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.090
 what's the mark behind the label is always easy 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.250
 hide some real processes 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.909
 it's easy he doesn't see what's going on 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.560
 in fact, and for the month gera we just 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.140
 then in no way can 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.030
 deal with this issue 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:42.860
 so the first such question is rather that 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.649
 such a betrayal now why people change 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.420
 unconditionally well so in this matter of reasons 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.729
 maybe a lot of the most banal 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.000
 the simplest reason is this flaw 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.940
 sexual diversity it happens in 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.759
 men it happens and good luck if a man 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.899
 or a woman sits on herself on 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.369
 side precisely because of lack 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.399
 this lack sexual life 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.539
 pleasure it makes 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.410
 enough 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.890
 usually the easiest option but here 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:20.060
 motivation is simple and understandable is not enough and 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:24.400
 then the person can already decide either he 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.500
 develops into a sexual relationship 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.590
 diverse relationships within a couple or 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.900
 he goes there in such an alternative way 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.780
 still looking for partners side 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.840
 just its that way the situation is to 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.850
 it was not traumatic for for him for 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.380
 partner for all participants of this 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:51.040
 events but motivation is often hidden and 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:55.340
 unconscious difficult for example often 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.390
 one of the problems in relationship crises 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.690
 men and women 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.290
 this lack of recognition is people 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.060
 lack of women 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.489
 second recognition by a woman 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.280
 porn to your man what is he for 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.340
 her man man does not give recognition 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.939
 his woman that she is a woman to him 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.030
 is an 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:17.670
 slowly recognizing figure owls and d 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.129
 confessions in the form of some actions we see 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.769
 courtship 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.959
 just what the relationship was supplemented on 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.079
 early stage on the stage of love and 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.319
 certainly when there is a shortage of it 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.750
 recognition then a man may not 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.209
 feel like a man in this pair 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.060
 He can look for when a partner on 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.280
 side of the partner with which he is not only 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.200
 will sexually satisfy and not 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:49.019
 as much as he will implement 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.090
 but some of its own feeling of itself 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.489
 men in the same way can be and on 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.760
 woman a woman who does not feel 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.680
 herself a woman paired with her husband she 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.930
 can you find a partner on the side 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.169
 which will give 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.290
 and this is some kind of male attention and 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:09.659
 feeds her confidence that she 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.909
 woman is attractively desirable except 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:19.260
 that if you dig even deeper who often 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:21.630
 male or female institution 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.090
 partner on the side can realize 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.720
 their aggression their grievances against 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.080
 partner 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.789
 but for now I'm not like they consciously like 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.740
 the rule is the form of the place when over the years already 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.960
 marital life offenses have accumulated 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.720
 enough here they are 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.630
 all that it was time could not be 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.699
 deal with these types of either in pair 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.979
 not taken to talk about their 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.270
 feelings and emotions claims experiences 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.540
 then 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.420
 but unconscious by katya beaten can 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.740
 be implemented in the form of such 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.380
 form together to get 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.550
 no one partner on the side of everything you 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.860
 kind and wish you find your personal 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.690
 individual ways to be happy 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.690
 and open in a relationship
