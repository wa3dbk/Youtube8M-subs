00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
like to call elevator sets if you

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.360 
like to call elevator sets if you
haven't<00:00:34.079> seen<00:00:34.290> me<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:34.829> these<00:00:34.980> before

bigger max on your bench press and
overhead<00:00:47.910> press<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.420> without<00:00:48.930> further<00:00:49.230> ado

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
overhead press so without further ado

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.670 
overhead press so without further ado
let's<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.969> sample<00:00:51.870> dumbbell

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
let's get to this sample dumbbell

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.459 
let's get to this sample dumbbell
elevator<00:00:53.160> set<00:00:53.520> throw<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.570> let<00:00:55.170> me<00:00:55.320> know

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
elevator set throw it in and let me know

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.680 
elevator set throw it in and let me know
how<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> goes<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.399> okay<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.660> have

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
how it goes for you okay so what we have

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.569 
how it goes for you okay so what we have
here<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.230> four<00:00:58.590> rounds<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.039> an<00:00:59.129> elevator

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
here is four rounds of an elevator

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.270 
here is four rounds of an elevator
setting<00:01:00.059> what<00:01:00.210> we're<00:01:00.390> gonna<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.280> ascending

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
setting what we're gonna do is ascending

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.109 
setting what we're gonna do is ascending
followed<00:01:02.820> by<00:01:03.049> descending<00:01:04.049> angles<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
followed by descending angles of

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
followed by descending angles of
dumbbell<00:01:06.119> press<00:01:06.600> variation<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.710> we're<00:01:08.010> going

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
dumbbell press variation so we're going

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.719 
dumbbell press variation so we're going
to<00:01:08.340> start<00:01:08.909> with<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.960> flat<00:01:10.380> dumbbell<00:01:10.890> bench

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
to start with a flat dumbbell bench

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.170 
to start with a flat dumbbell bench
press<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.689> move<00:01:13.020> into<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.890> higher<00:01:14.460> angle<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
press then move into a higher angle the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.080 
press then move into a higher angle the
incline<00:01:15.720> then<00:01:16.470> go<00:01:16.740> into<00:01:16.950> military<00:01:17.369> that's<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
incline then go into military that's the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.020 
incline then go into military that's the
ascension<00:01:18.840> part<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.189> elevator<00:01:20.520> set<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
ascension part of the elevator set and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.899 
ascension part of the elevator set and
the<00:01:21.540> dissention<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.560> going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.700> back

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the dissention is going to be going back

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.440 
the dissention is going to be going back
down<00:01:24.270> after<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.380> military<00:01:25.979> press<00:01:26.520> back<00:01:27.420> into

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
down after this military press back into

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.550 
down after this military press back into
the<00:01:28.439> incline<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.460> then<00:01:30.240> finishing<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.110> with

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the incline and then finishing up with

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.550 
the incline and then finishing up with
the<00:01:31.860> flat<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.579> absolutely<00:01:32.820> love<00:01:33.720> these

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the flat and I absolutely love these

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.469 
the flat and I absolutely love these
types<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.100> sets<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.759> multiple<00:01:36.299> reasons

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
types of sets for multiple reasons

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.370 
types of sets for multiple reasons
number<00:01:36.900> one<00:01:37.340> it's<00:01:38.340> going<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.180> hit<00:01:39.450> different

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
number one it's going to hit different

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.550 
number one it's going to hit different
muscle<00:01:41.009> groups<00:01:41.340> at<00:01:41.610> different<00:01:42.390> heads<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
muscle groups at different heads of the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.749 
muscle groups at different heads of the
muscle<00:01:43.860> group<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.189> you're<00:01:44.340> going<00:01:44.579> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
muscle group so you're going to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.300 
muscle group so you're going to
automatically<00:01:45.479> recruit<00:01:45.960> far<00:01:46.590> more<00:01:46.829> muscle

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
automatically recruit far more muscle

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.740 
automatically recruit far more muscle
fibers<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.509> chest<00:01:48.990> shoulders<00:01:50.750> your

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
fibers in the chest shoulders your

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.170 
fibers in the chest shoulders your
triceps<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.710> even<00:01:53.220> your<00:01:53.340> upper<00:01:53.670> back<00:01:53.909> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
triceps and even your upper back to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.810 
triceps and even your upper back to
better<00:01:54.390> stabilize<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.500> weight<00:01:55.770> not<00:01:56.520> only

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
better stabilize the weight not only

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.050 
better stabilize the weight not only
that<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.719> high<00:01:58.049> volume<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.640> equate

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
that the high volume is going to equate

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.359 
that the high volume is going to equate
to<00:02:00.119> more<00:02:00.360> time<00:02:00.840> under<00:02:01.140> tension<00:02:01.170> which<00:02:01.740> means

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
to more time under tension which means

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.359 
to more time under tension which means
more<00:02:02.610> growth<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.390> ultimately<00:02:04.340> because<00:02:05.340> of

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
more growth and ultimately because of

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.249 
more growth and ultimately because of
the<00:02:05.549> muscle<00:02:06.090> fibers<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.509> you're<00:02:06.810> going<00:02:07.079> to

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the muscle fibers that you're going to

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.960 
the muscle fibers that you're going to
initiate<00:02:07.700> during<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:09.000> killer<00:02:09.450> set<00:02:09.989> you're

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
initiate during this killer set you're

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.900 
initiate during this killer set you're
are<00:02:11.030> also<00:02:11.350> going<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.470> increase<00:02:12.800> work<00:02:13.220> capacity

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
are also going to increase work capacity

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.020 
are also going to increase work capacity
in<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.870> weak<00:02:15.680> point<00:02:16.070> areas<00:02:16.490> which<00:02:16.820> will

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
in the weak point areas which will

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.720 
in the weak point areas which will
initiate<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.750> bigger<00:02:18.110> one<00:02:18.500> rep<00:02:18.710> max<00:02:18.740> in<00:02:19.310> your

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
initiate a bigger one rep max in your

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.810 
initiate a bigger one rep max in your
overhead<00:02:20.180> press<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.720> bench<00:02:21.470> press<00:02:21.670> if<00:02:22.670> you

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
overhead press and bench press if you
