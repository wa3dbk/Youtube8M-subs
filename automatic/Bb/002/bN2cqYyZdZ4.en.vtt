00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
I don't know if you can tell maybe if I

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.170 
I don't know if you can tell maybe if I
move<00:03:15.760> this<00:03:16.000> but<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:17.079> actually<00:03:17.530> like<00:03:18.180> that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
move this but it's actually like that

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.240 
move this but it's actually like that
like<00:03:20.519> son<00:03:21.549> like<00:03:22.000> shape<00:03:22.269> right<00:03:22.450> there<00:03:23.250> that's

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
like son like shape right there that's

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.399 
like son like shape right there that's
actually<00:03:24.489> textured<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:25.510> actually<00:03:25.989> those<00:03:26.170> in

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
actually textured so actually those in

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.069 
actually textured so actually those in
up<00:03:26.650> in<00:03:27.040> cuff

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
up in cuff

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.759 
up in cuff
it's<00:03:29.079> not<00:03:29.319> really<00:03:29.620> it's<00:03:29.919> pretty<00:03:30.250> dope<00:03:30.489> oh<00:03:31.769> no

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
it's not really it's pretty dope oh no

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.379 
it's not really it's pretty dope oh no
it<00:03:32.829> does<00:03:33.129> I<00:03:33.340> guess<00:03:33.639> we'll<00:03:33.790> have<00:03:33.819> to<00:03:33.939> try<00:03:34.209> out

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
it does I guess we'll have to try out

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.629 
it does I guess we'll have to try out
find<00:03:34.900> out<00:03:35.019> we<00:03:35.169> try<00:03:35.349> them<00:03:35.500> on<00:03:35.590> then<00:03:36.430> goes<00:03:36.609> back

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
find out we try them on then goes back

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.339 
find out we try them on then goes back
into<00:03:36.879> that<00:03:37.150> black<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.720> winter<00:03:37.900> line<00:03:38.079> on<00:03:38.230> the

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
into that black and winter line on the

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.970 
into that black and winter line on the
top<00:03:39.750> outsole<00:03:40.750> what<00:03:41.079> I<00:03:41.169> think<00:03:41.349> is<00:03:41.439> really<00:03:41.709> cool

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
top outsole what I think is really cool

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.099 
top outsole what I think is really cool
it's<00:03:42.909> pretty<00:03:43.120> much<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.359> same<00:03:43.510> exact<00:03:43.840> thing<00:03:43.989> as

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
it's pretty much the same exact thing as

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.869 
it's pretty much the same exact thing as
the<00:03:44.200> lunar<00:03:44.409> glad<00:03:44.650> 6<00:03:44.980> as<00:03:45.189> well<00:03:45.400> as<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.639> sides

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
the lunar glad 6 as well as the sides

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:46.949 
the lunar glad 6 as well as the sides
the<00:03:46.389> mid-tommy

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
the mid-tommy

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.599 
the mid-tommy
the<00:03:47.500> midsole<00:03:47.769> is<00:03:47.919> the<00:03:48.010> same<00:03:48.159> thing<00:03:48.400> as<00:03:48.519> the

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
the midsole is the same thing as the

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.119 
the midsole is the same thing as the
lunar<00:03:48.849> bride<00:03:49.030> 6<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:50.530> only<00:03:50.709> difference<00:03:51.040> really

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
lunar bride 6 the only difference really

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.129 
lunar bride 6 the only difference really
on<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.579> upper<00:03:51.819> besides<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.540> material

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
on the upper besides the material

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:58.080 
on the upper besides the material
changes<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.569> AMA<00:03:55.780> this<00:03:56.760> was<00:03:57.760> on<00:03:57.969> the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
changes is the AMA this was on the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.349 
changes is the AMA this was on the
dynamic<00:03:58.780> support<00:03:59.069> shank<00:04:00.069> was<00:04:00.549> on<00:04:00.699> the<00:04:00.819> cage

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
dynamic support shank was on the cage

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.199 
dynamic support shank was on the cage
caging<00:04:02.109> was<00:04:02.290> on<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.530> lunar<00:04:02.709> glide<00:04:02.949> 6<00:04:03.250> except

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
caging was on the lunar glide 6 except

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.030 
caging was on the lunar glide 6 except
in<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.389> mid<00:04:04.540> back<00:04:05.139> here<00:04:05.319> wasn't<00:04:05.530> flying<00:04:05.889> it

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040

I just want to say like how I felt after
running<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:52.450> midsole<00:04:52.930> did<00:04:53.170> take<00:04:53.440> a<00:04:53.470> bit<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.040> a

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
running the midsole did take a bit of a

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.070 
running the midsole did take a bit of a
while<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.490> break<00:04:54.700> in<00:04:54.940> a<00:04:55.060> bit<00:04:55.330> stiffer<00:04:55.750> first

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
while to break in a bit stiffer first

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.780 
while to break in a bit stiffer first
but<00:04:56.590> then<00:04:56.710> once<00:04:56.920> it<00:04:57.070> broke<00:04:57.250> in<00:04:57.460> it<00:04:57.640> was

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
but then once it broke in it was

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.250 
but then once it broke in it was
extremely<00:04:58.450> comfortable<00:05:00.420> the<00:05:01.420> materials<00:05:02.110> are

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
extremely comfortable the materials are

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.140 
extremely comfortable the materials are
very<00:05:02.290> loose-fitting<00:05:02.740> they<00:05:03.670> didn't<00:05:04.030> require

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
very loose-fitting they didn't require

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.780 
very loose-fitting they didn't require
any<00:05:04.330> break-in<00:05:04.960> time<00:05:05.170> up<00:05:05.560> here<00:05:05.890> this<00:05:06.340> locks

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
any break-in time up here this locks

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.760 
any break-in time up here this locks
down<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.210> inner<00:05:07.540> part<00:05:07.960> of<00:05:07.990> my<00:05:08.080> foot<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.560> fly

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
down the inner part of my foot the fly

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.030 
down the inner part of my foot the fly
wire<00:05:08.980> really<00:05:09.340> helped<00:05:09.700> and<00:05:09.910> then<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:11.800> back

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
wire really helped and then the back

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.460 
wire really helped and then the back
being<00:05:12.520> that<00:05:12.669> I'm<00:05:12.790> so<00:05:12.970> cushiony<00:05:13.450> it<00:05:14.080> was<00:05:14.200> a<00:05:14.230> lot

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
being that I'm so cushiony it was a lot

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.840 
being that I'm so cushiony it was a lot
more<00:05:14.500> comfortable<00:05:14.860> on<00:05:15.160> the<00:05:15.220> heel<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:15.490> this

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
more comfortable on the heel and this
