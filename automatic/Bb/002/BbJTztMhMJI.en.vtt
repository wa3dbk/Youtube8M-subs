00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.600
 how about you welcome to mike 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.760
 see but my name is add and in this 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.119
 occasion we are going to solve a problem 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:20.250
 together that at the moment we 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:24.020
 we installed mavericks from scratch we have 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.150
 certain problems not everything was good 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.930
 the problem is the following when 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.850
 we want to activate search for my mac 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.530
 I get a legend that says that 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.800
 we require a partition of 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.890
 recovery for some reason at the moment 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.950
 to erase from scratch does not give you that 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.190
 option to load the partition 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.820
 recovery although usually or what 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.000
 ideal or the logical thing would be to activate this 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.520
 option 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.710
 ok I'm uploading this tutorial because 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.200
 it happened to me and I was looking at several 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.840
 blogs in this case also the atmosphere 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.420
 dirt or the same but good the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.550
 momentary solution is no longer 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:16.920
 working if this the solution to this 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:19.229
 problem to be able to activate my mac this 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.810
 It is inside our own 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.119
 operating system normally when a 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.300
 application or operating system is already 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.960
 installed you specific here that is already 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.300
 installed in this case for some reason 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.090
 if we can download it again and that 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.369
 is what we should do download a 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.170
 once the 5.2 gigas were downloaded 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.710
 again or if you still have the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.140
 we will only execute it 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.060
 and the moment we execute it remember 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.670
 that the next accept already the the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.560
 llanada is going to restart the computer it 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.650
 will update and once it finishes 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.320
 update should appear the partition of 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.800
 Recovery 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.729
 already at that moment we can 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.679
 activate search my mac and after that 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.600
 let's activate this I recommend you 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.700
 make use of clean my mac 2 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.770
 this is to erase things 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.290
 unnecessary that an update or that 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.010
 the same operating system generates you at 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.830
 time to install 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.500
 after that I recommend that we 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.510
 direct to disk utility 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.299
 we select macintosh hd and we give it 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.079
 repair permit this is not part of the 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:36.440
 solution but if it will help us a lot 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:39.709
 maintain the experience of use that gives you 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.250
 a installation from scratch good I hope 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.569
 that this information has been useful 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.560
 I remind you my name is add 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.560
 this is mauer pro
