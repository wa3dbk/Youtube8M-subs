the<00:00:57.989> castle<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.739> they<00:00:59.370> get<00:00:59.640> larger<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the castle and they get larger as you

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.709 
the castle and they get larger as you
get<00:01:00.510> farther<00:01:00.750> away<00:01:01.609> and<00:01:02.609> i<00:01:03.120> must<00:01:03.510> say<00:01:03.690> that

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
get farther away and i must say that

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.410 
get farther away and i must say that
there<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.439> hike<00:01:04.890> kept<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.850> hike<00:01:06.000> camp<00:01:06.270> is

there is a hike kept the hike camp is
like<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:07.409> tall<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.010> comes<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
like this tall when it comes to the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.460 
like this tall when it comes to the
buildings<00:01:08.729> because<00:01:09.390> anything<00:01:09.810> Tyler<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.229> just

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
buildings because anything Tyler is just

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.380 
buildings because anything Tyler is just
ugly<00:01:10.710> um<00:01:11.510> we<00:01:12.510> don't<00:01:12.600> really<00:01:12.750> like<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:14.210> this<00:01:15.210> is

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
ugly um we don't really like it this is

here<00:01:18.450> um<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:19.140> guess<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.590> empty<00:01:19.890> store

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
