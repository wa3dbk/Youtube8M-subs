00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.700 
thing but this thing slides off so this
is<00:01:20.330> how<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.600> looks<00:01:20.630> like<00:01:21.010> without<00:01:22.300> doubt<00:01:23.300> it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
is how it looks like without doubt it

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:36.940 
is how it looks like without doubt it
it's<00:01:24.710> kind<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:25.040> funky<00:01:25.690> so<00:01:29.710> what<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:30.830> do<00:01:31.070> is<00:01:35.950> you

it's kind of funky so what you do is you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.109 
it's kind of funky so what you do is you
do<00:01:37.130> is<00:01:37.369> you<00:01:37.610> just<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:41.780> just<00:01:41.840> get<00:01:42.500> this<00:01:43.119> you

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
do is you just you just get this you

00:01:44.119 --> 00:02:00.800 
do is you just you just get this you
just<00:01:44.180> put<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:44.570> back<00:01:44.660> on<00:01:44.840> that

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.120 

very<00:02:01.810> right<00:02:02.080> there

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.070

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
I think if it's just good to compare it

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.960 
I think if it's just good to compare it
like<00:02:15.410> these<00:02:15.980> things<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.550> know<00:02:16.610> how<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.910> make
