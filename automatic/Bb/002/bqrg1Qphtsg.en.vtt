00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.700 

and<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.760> thought<00:00:44.970> the<00:00:45.030> work<00:00:45.210> fee<00:00:45.450> thing<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.050> can't

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and I thought the work fee thing I can't

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.020 
and I thought the work fee thing I can't
even<00:00:46.800> see<00:00:47.190> him

even see him

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.070 
even see him
well<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.420> would<00:00:50.540> have<00:00:50.600> been<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.870> little

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
well it would have been the little

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.180 
well it would have been the little
turbulence<00:00:51.620> by<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:51.950> plane<00:00:52.280> but<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.920> would<00:00:55.040> be

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
turbulence by the plane but it would be

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.540 
turbulence by the plane but it would be
absolutely<00:00:56.060> magnificent<00:00:57.130> I've<00:00:58.130> got<00:00:58.310> to<00:00:58.400> come

brings<00:02:37.560> life<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.550> here<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.000> have<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:40.230> flow<00:02:40.500> of

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
brings life so here you have the flow of

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.940 
brings life so here you have the flow of
water<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.990> splurge<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.850> seaweed<00:02:45.710> all<00:02:46.710> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
water and the splurge of seaweed all the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.930 
water and the splurge of seaweed all the
way<00:02:47.070> down<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.870> then<00:02:49.020> compare<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.940> the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
way down and then compare that to the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.440 
way down and then compare that to the
stagnant<00:02:51.690> pool<00:02:52.520> which<00:02:53.520> seriously<00:02:54.030> doesn't

now let's throw about four starfish
so<00:03:57.840> we<00:03:58.840> find<00:04:00.420> hundreds<00:04:01.420> of<00:04:01.810> tadpoles

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720
