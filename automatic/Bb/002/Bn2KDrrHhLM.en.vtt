00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 many children choose the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.040
 football to flourish while 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.469
 practicing physical activity and they 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.860
 have 250 to be registered this year 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.770
 aged 4 and a half to 8 years in 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.060
 starting a motor skills or awakening 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:34.420
 drops of small games 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:36.309
 mahmoud abbas what did you have the youngest 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.640
 of them represent two groups 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.010
 the u6 and u7 that is to say large section 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.720
 kindergarten and CP and they have a 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.329
 common training every wednesday 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.360
 and Saturdays a rite that allows them to 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.940
 progress slowly but surely in 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.350
 succeed to the workers we had 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.430
 started with balloon on coordination 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.420
 and we realize that it's too much 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.040
 difficult so that's why 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.809
 now adopt them gets carried away because 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.330
 it's really complicated but it's 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.430
 true that at that age we see the 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.520
 potential and but that does not mean 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:17.830
 that the one who emits an internship to be worth 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:18.610
 necessarily later all children have 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.250
 so their luck 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.900
 not privilege they all receive the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.219
 same teaching and work at their 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.749
 rhythm is a real challenge for 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.030
 the educators in charge of these 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:32.829
 beginners they must be rigorous and 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.189
 to take all the basics of football to 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.189
 their children 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.119
 so close 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.410
 fcr m makes every effort to ensure that 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.800
 every child can learn and 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.800
 progress
