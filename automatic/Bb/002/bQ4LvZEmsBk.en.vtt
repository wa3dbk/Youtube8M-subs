00:00:04.612 --> 00:00:07.243
&gt;&gt; Walter Reeves: Lets have
a talk about ivy.

00:00:07.243 --> 00:00:10.307
Now I'm not talking about the
leaves of three of poison ivy

00:00:10.307 --> 00:00:13.889
that a lot of people fear;
I'm talking about English Ivy

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.943
which to some people should
be feared just as much as

00:00:16.943 --> 00:00:18.777
its tri-foliate friend.

00:00:18.777 --> 00:00:23.105
You see, English ivy has
a good side and a bad side.

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:25.274
English ivy grows
in dense shade;

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:27.274
I've seen it growing
underneath magnolia trees.

00:00:27.274 --> 00:00:30.871
I've even seen it growing
underneath kudzu sometimes.

00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:33.090
It can grow in any soil
throughout Georgia.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.320
It's drought tolerant.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.765
It spreads very readily.

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:37.968
And in some cases where there
is nothing else that will

00:00:37.968 --> 00:00:41.396
control erosion, English ivy
is a great choice.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.275
The problem is is that
English ivy if left uncontrolled

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:48.529
can be a real problem
in your landscape.

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:50.782
Look behind me and
you'll see what I mean.

00:00:50.782 --> 00:00:51.911
What do you see?

00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:54.813
Nothing but English ivy,
a couple of privet hedges,

00:00:54.813 --> 00:00:56.853
and maybe a couple
of pine trees there.

00:00:56.853 --> 00:00:59.702
We have, basically,
an ivy desert;

00:00:59.702 --> 00:01:02.356
no ferns, no native
plants, no flowers –

00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:05.389
nothing but English ivy
growing in this area because

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:08.346
it was let to grow
and never controlled.

00:01:08.346 --> 00:01:11.579
Another problem with English ivy
is the affect that it has

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.780
on trees when it
grows up tree trunks.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.512
You can see this
pine tree right here.

00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:18.256
Once upon a time it was
a vertical pine tree

00:01:18.256 --> 00:01:20.731
but then the English ivy
was allowed to grow up it,

00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:24.001
came a big thunderstorm
and bangedy boom down comes

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:28.121
the pine tree because the
ivy leaves acted as a sail.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:31.207
When you have an ice
storm or a big rain storm,

00:01:31.207 --> 00:01:34.800
the ivy leaves hold that weight
and the tree may not be ready –

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.533
may not be capable of holding
the weight of the ice or

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:40.811
the snow or the rain and
the limbs fall out of the tree

00:01:40.811 --> 00:01:43.429
and the tree itself
then may fall down.

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.143
Of course ivy also, as it gets
up into the top of the tree,

00:01:46.143 --> 00:01:48.765
causes the lower limbs to
be shaded out so they

00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:51.611
fail and fall from
the tree as well.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:54.376
So, how do you control
English ivy once

00:01:54.376 --> 00:01:57.119
its gotten out of control
in your landscape?

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.512
You know, I wish
there were a chemical

00:01:59.512 --> 00:02:00.350
I could tell you,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.720
"“You spray it on English ivy
and the ivy will be gone.”"

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.211
But actually, there's not.

00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:07.907
A couple of chemicals
that I've tried and

00:02:07.907 --> 00:02:11.228
I do use on occasion are
the chemical glyphosate –

00:02:11.228 --> 00:02:13.671
that's the active ingredient
in Roundup.

00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:16.250
I also use sometime
triclopyr and that's

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.818
the active ingredient
in Brush-B-Gon.

00:02:18.818 --> 00:02:23.512
Both of them though take a long
time to kill the English ivy.

00:02:23.512 --> 00:02:26.322
You spray it on the leaves,
you wait 3 weeks and finally

00:02:26.322 --> 00:02:28.487
you see some yellowing,
some spots on the leaf, and

00:02:28.487 --> 00:02:32.178
maybe a week or 2 later the leaves
begin to die and fall off.

00:02:32.178 --> 00:02:34.458
But, a couple of more weeks
and you'll see there are

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:36.991
more sprouts of the English ivy
that's come up from places that

00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:40.366
it's rooted and you'll have to
come back and spray those too.

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:45.116
Honestly, the best way to
control at least a small patch

00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:46.677
of English ivy is
to pull it up.

00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:48.521
You and some friends
get out there,

00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:50.678
pull the vines
out of the ground,

00:02:50.678 --> 00:02:53.556
one of you take the
clippers and just clip it.

00:02:54.396 --> 00:02:57.264
Clip, there's some right
there where it’s rooted.

00:02:57.804 --> 00:03:01.351
Pull more,
clip where it's rooted.

00:03:01.351 --> 00:03:04.938
[ clipping sounds ]

00:03:04.938 --> 00:03:08.272
And pretty soon you'll have
a great big ball of vine that

00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:10.854
you can put out on the street,
give it to the garbage man and

00:03:10.854 --> 00:03:12.191
let him take it away.

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:15.201
This is not a plant that I would
put on my compost pile because,

00:03:15.201 --> 00:03:17.971
obviously, it will re-root
there and then you've got even

00:03:17.971 --> 00:03:20.208
more problems in
your landscape.

00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:24.268
And what do you do when English
ivy has started climbing a tree?

00:03:24.268 --> 00:03:26.830
Come with me back to the
forest and I'll show you a way.

00:03:30.986 --> 00:03:34.608
The good news is that ivy is
not a parasite even though

00:03:34.608 --> 00:03:38.084
it has great big hairy vines
and a lot of little rootlets

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:40.981
that adhere to the bark;
the rootlets do not go through

00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:43.264
the bark and suck
the sap of the tree.

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:46.296
So, if you cut the vine down
low, the top of the vine up

00:03:46.296 --> 00:03:48.703
in the tree eventually
is going to die.

00:03:48.946 --> 00:03:52.248
Now, it may be a month before
you see those leaves up there

00:03:52.248 --> 00:03:54.945
start to turn brown but
eventually the upper part of

00:03:54.945 --> 00:03:58.338
the vine will die if you
just clip the vine out.

00:03:59.247 --> 00:04:03.540
What you'll find as you're
clearing the vine off the tree

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.553
is there will be great big
vines that you barely can

00:04:06.553 --> 00:04:07.919
get your clipper through.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.675
So what do you do then?

00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:10.932
You've got to clip it.

00:04:10.932 --> 00:04:13.030
Sometime a saw is not
the greatest answer because

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.954
it saws into the
bark of the tree;

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:17.121
not the thick bark of
this pine tree right here.

00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:20.314
So here's a trick on how
to get that vine out

00:04:20.314 --> 00:04:22.385
so that you can get
it off of the tree.

00:04:24.034 --> 00:04:26.509
Use a pry bar; 
just a flat pry bar.

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.194
Put it behind the vine and hit it
a couple of times with a hammer.

00:04:30.194 --> 00:04:32.299
[ hammering sounds ]

00:04:32.299 --> 00:04:36.484
Then, if you pull the whole
vine away from the tree and

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:40.306
take your pruner and
you can clip it off.

00:04:40.928 --> 00:04:44.031
Now I always try to take a
big section out of the vine.

00:04:44.031 --> 00:04:46.795
I want to make sure that
behind the vine there aren't

00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:49.040
any little vines that
are hiding there.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.742
So once I have the section taken
off the trunk of the tree,

00:04:51.742 --> 00:04:54.420
I know that this part right
here is still living but

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.646
this part up here is dead.

00:04:56.646 --> 00:04:59.218
Now, obviously, I'd try to
take this off down closer

00:04:59.218 --> 00:05:02.472
to the ground to make sure
that the vine is not climbing

00:05:02.472 --> 00:05:03.851
up the pine tree.

00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:07.359
But there is a way to make sure
that this vine does not re-sprout

00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:10.727
anymore and that is use
a paint brush and some of

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:14.129
that undiluted glyphosate - 
undiluted Roundup.

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.680
Take the paint brush and
put it in our container

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.733
right there and paint
it onto the stem.

00:05:24.733 --> 00:05:27.299
By painting the Roundup
onto the stem of the plant,

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:29.831
it will be sucked down through
the stem, at least a couple of

00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:31.926
feet, and will keep
it from re-sprouting.

00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:34.700
You can use the same trick when
you're trying to keep stumps

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.738
from privet hedge or sweetgum
or maple from sprouting too;

00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:41.321
when you cut them down, paint
the stump with Roundup.

00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:44.015
Now another thing that I want
to show you about ivy before we

00:05:44.015 --> 00:05:48.382
leave is the change in ivy
leaves as they mature over time.

00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:51.122
Come with me back to the tree
and I'll show you that.

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:58.655
We're all familiar with the
lobed leaves of English ivy

00:05:58.655 --> 00:06:01.150
when we buy it a nursery;
sometimes they have 3

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.753
and maybe 5 – lobes
on a single leaf.

00:06:03.753 --> 00:06:08.111
But did you know that this is
the juvenile for of English ivy?

00:06:08.111 --> 00:06:11.021
After the ivy vine has been
growing on a vertical surface

00:06:11.021 --> 00:06:14.031
for several years, the lobes
will disappear.

00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:15.567
The leaves will change.

00:06:15.567 --> 00:06:19.631
They'll be rounded; having
very few, if no lobes at all.

00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:23.398
It's the adult English ivy that
has flowers and berries on it.

00:06:23.398 --> 00:06:25.368
These berries are what
birds can eat spreading

00:06:25.368 --> 00:06:27.400
the English ivy
even further.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.740
Another interesting thing
about adult English ivy is

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.839
if you take a cutting of the
adult form and root it, it will

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:37.018
grow as a small shrub not as a
vine as the juvenile form does.

00:06:37.018 --> 00:06:39.958
You can take the shrub and put
it in the same heavy shade

00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.362
that you would the vine and
it tolerates it just fine.

00:06:43.362 --> 00:06:46.313
English ivy, it's
a non-native exotic.

00:06:46.313 --> 00:06:48.941
It can be a friend
or it can be a foe;

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:50.819
just be aware before
you plant it.

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:54.230
If you give it an inch,
it can take your yard.

00:06:57.044 --> 00:06:59.770
