00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.549
 when you enter the dot com book 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.190
 and tighten on having you know what happens 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.740
 on the other side of your computer screen 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.990
 Let's talk a little about how it works in 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.140
 the cycling tourism project in the 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.570
 Brazil behind this pompous name 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.550
 The intention is very simple to disclose the 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.679
 cycling in Brazil in its various 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.390
 strands 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.910
 we believe that the major obstacles to 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.489
 the practice of cycling in Brazil are 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.070
 cultural order and the best way to change 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.590
 culture is through education and 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.020
 books so our work is 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.020
 produce guidebooks and dvds about 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.050
 cycling our guides talk about 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.789
 various bicycle travel styles 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.739
 all within the national territory 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.870
 the guides interconnect so that the cip 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.179
 can plan from the pedal on the 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.699
 weekend to great travels 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:03.280
 across our immense country 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.989
 we designed this project in a way that 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.930
 provide balance and 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.510
 sustainability in our lives to 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.910
 that from this we can also 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.120
 offer the balance and sustainability 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.550
 in our products respecting our 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.070
 eclectic nature we have opted for 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.080
 develop the capacities to produce 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.260
 all that is necessary for making 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.540
 Each day of each guide we are in a 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.380
 doing research on a new 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.810
 circuit 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.610
 the other day we cycled a new one up 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.890
 chasing the hint of a beautiful way 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.010
 other we spend hours on a computer 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.250
 writing by aggravating the guide by editing 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.770
 a dvd we quickly realize that if 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.770
 living in a motor home would be more 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.060
 easy to carry out 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.790
 independent project of such 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.770
 wingspan 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.740
 except for print jobs 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.110
 everything is done inside the motor home 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.790
 after intensive research 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.640
 we parked our motor home in the region 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.930
 to be mapped and do all the work 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.930
 with our bikes 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.050
 once the fieldwork is finished 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.239
 We chose a beautiful quiet place with 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.030
 electricity and water so we can 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:24.010
 organize and write and record and edit 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.010
 all material collected in the field 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.840
 to carry out the distribution is one of the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.239
 key to maintaining our 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.769
 balance when we are not doing the 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.800
 field work 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.170
 when submitting the kia application actually 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.930
 you're passing a media directly 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.010
 for us through a precarious connection 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.120
 via cellphone 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.470
 we check the deposit we make the package 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.250
 More sent from the mail 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.709
 next 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.260
 acquiring directly from the authors will 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.690
 great agility and the security of receiving 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.880
 an updated product comparing 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.430
 with other virtual stores may seem 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.950
 a precarious system but offers large 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.900
 advantages such as being attended to 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.180
 for a real human being if you want 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.600
 you can receive your autographed book 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.820
 It 's a pleasure for us to connect 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.030
 with fellow travelers and resolve 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.370
 any doubt beyond direct contact the 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.000
 system of work that we have opted 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.989
 offers a special advantage 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.060
 we believe that the best way to 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.060
 break with the sedentary lifestyle of life 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.850
 modern day is to impose daily tasks that 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.950
 involve exercises at this time in the 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.170
 we join all those who have decided 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.519
 leave the car in the garage to go to 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.890
 bicycle work 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.380
 Just look around whenever we can choose 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.630
 stay in a place like Timburi when 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.030
 we arrived in the area we parked at 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.340
 terrain of the inn cantinho da figueira 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.739
 today it is about 10 kilometers from 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.920
 city and thus to each book that 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.660
 we sell we must pedal 20 kilometers 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.640
 to go to the post office and buy 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.829
 groceries 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.109
 this is the opportunity we have created for 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.260
 do our daily exercise 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:08.419
 and of course we took advantage to clean our 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.319
 mind while we observe the beautiful 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.709
 sights 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.579
 the path despite the faithful support of 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.459
 friends 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.889
 our project is sponsored only 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.449
 by readers and five tourists 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.500
 Brazilians who we are who this is 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.500
 always very grateful 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:34.009
 the slow and rafaela 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.310
 when you're writing the next one 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:40.099
 are invited to come to the 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.370
 canton of the fig tree here in the city of 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.370
 tisbury
