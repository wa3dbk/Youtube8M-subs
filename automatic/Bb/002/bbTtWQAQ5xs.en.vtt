the<00:00:43.690> screen<00:00:44.020> printers<00:00:44.790> I've<00:00:45.790> set<00:00:46.060> up<00:00:46.180> some

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
the screen printers I've set up some

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.600 
the screen printers I've set up some
triangles<00:00:46.840> here<00:00:47.170> as<00:00:47.410> examples<00:00:48.040> of<00:00:48.190> some<00:00:48.579> of

triangles here as examples of some of
the<00:00:48.700> benefits<00:00:48.910> and<00:00:50.070> also<00:00:51.070> is<00:00:51.220> in<00:00:51.310> a<00:00:51.370> way<00:00:51.489> to

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
the benefits and also is in a way to

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.010 
the benefits and also is in a way to
look<00:00:51.910> at<00:00:52.090> some<00:00:52.239> of<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.390> basics<00:00:52.899> of

look at some of the basics of

look at some of the basics of
understanding<00:00:53.590> overprinting<00:00:54.570> over<00:00:55.570> here

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
understanding overprinting over here

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.150 
understanding overprinting over here
I've<00:00:55.810> got<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:55.989> triangle<00:00:56.410> with<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.560> colors<00:00:56.860> red

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
I've got a triangle with the colors red

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.049 
I've got a triangle with the colors red
yellow<00:00:57.430> and<00:00:57.850> black<00:00:58.239> as<00:00:58.630> flat<00:00:58.989> spot<00:00:59.380> colors

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
yellow and black as flat spot colors

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.400 
yellow and black as flat spot colors
next<00:01:01.059> that<00:01:01.149> I've<00:01:01.239> got<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.540> color<00:01:01.750> yellow<00:01:02.020> with

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
next that I've got the color yellow with

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.660 
next that I've got the color yellow with
a<00:01:02.440> tint<00:01:02.860> of<00:01:03.040> red<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.610> a<00:01:03.790> tint<00:01:04.119> of<00:01:04.299> black<00:01:05.670> now

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
a tint of red and a tint of black now

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.950 
a tint of red and a tint of black now
here<00:01:06.880> in<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.030> third<00:01:07.240> triangle<00:01:07.509> I've<00:01:07.719> taken

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
here in the third triangle I've taken

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.109 
here in the third triangle I've taken
the<00:01:08.140> yellow<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:08.649> the<00:01:08.740> tint<00:01:09.250> of<00:01:09.430> red<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:10.090> a

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
the yellow and the tint of red and a

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.940 
the yellow and the tint of red and a
tint<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.479> black<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:11.049> I've<00:01:11.170> over<00:01:11.500> printed

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
tint of black and I've over printed

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.320 
tint of black and I've over printed
those<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:12.370> can<00:01:12.549> right<00:01:12.729> click<00:01:12.760> on<00:01:13.150> these

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
those and you can right click on these

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.719 
those and you can right click on these
and<00:01:13.630> actually<00:01:14.590> see<00:01:14.830> that<00:01:14.979> over<00:01:15.130> printing<00:01:15.610> is

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
and actually see that over printing is

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.930 
and actually see that over printing is
enabled<00:01:16.799> if<00:01:17.799> you<00:01:17.979> want<00:01:18.159> to<00:01:18.250> view<00:01:18.430> or<00:01:18.549> print<00:01:18.729> you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
enabled if you want to view or print you

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.420 
enabled if you want to view or print you
have<00:01:18.970> to<00:01:19.180> go<00:01:19.299> to<00:01:19.360> view<00:01:20.080> and<00:01:20.110> Corel<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:20.950> set

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
have to go to view and Corel and set

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.350 
have to go to view and Corel and set
your<00:01:22.060> view<00:01:22.420> to<00:01:22.600> simulate<00:01:23.049> over<00:01:23.380> prints<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:25.270> I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
your view to simulate over prints but I

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.760 
your view to simulate over prints but I
think<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:25.600> can<00:01:25.720> see<00:01:25.840> here<00:01:26.020> we've<00:01:26.170> gone<00:01:26.409> from

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
think you can see here we've gone from

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.300 
think you can see here we've gone from
just<00:01:26.830> a<00:01:27.280> flat<00:01:27.880> red<00:01:28.540> yellow<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:29.229> black<00:01:29.590> print

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
just a flat red yellow and black print

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.140 
just a flat red yellow and black print
into<00:01:31.150> multi<00:01:31.659> color<00:01:31.930> printing<00:01:32.350> with<00:01:32.470> tints<00:01:32.950> and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
into multi color printing with tints and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.270 
into multi color printing with tints and
over<00:01:34.150> printing<00:01:34.540> so<00:01:35.290> we're<00:01:35.500> expanding<00:01:35.979> the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
over printing so we're expanding the

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.880 
over printing so we're expanding the
number<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.640> colors<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.270> we<00:01:37.450> can<00:01:37.720> print<00:01:38.110> based

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
number of colors that we can print based

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.130 
number of colors that we can print based
on<00:01:39.159> just<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.490> colors<00:01:39.880> red<00:01:40.180> yellow<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.780> black

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
on just the colors red yellow and black

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.859 
on just the colors red yellow and black
very<00:01:41.530> important<00:01:42.040> in<00:01:42.100> screen<00:01:42.369> printing<00:01:42.869> here

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
very important in screen printing here

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.840 
very important in screen printing here
I've<00:01:44.020> got<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.320> color<00:01:44.530> yellow<00:01:44.830> with<00:01:45.310> blue<00:01:45.610> and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
I've got the color yellow with blue and

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.370 
I've got the color yellow with blue and
we've<00:01:46.090> got<00:01:46.299> just<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.600> little<00:01:46.630> tint<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.320> blue

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
we've got just a little tint of blue

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.490 
we've got just a little tint of blue
here<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.159> then<00:01:48.850> we've<00:01:49.000> got<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.509> stronger<00:01:50.170> tint

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
here and then we've got a stronger tint

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.380 
here and then we've got a stronger tint
of<00:01:50.680> that<00:01:50.979> here<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.430> can<00:01:51.580> see<00:01:51.759> we<00:01:51.880> get<00:01:51.970> a<00:01:52.030> gray

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
of that here you can see we get a gray

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.990 
of that here you can see we get a gray
from<00:01:52.659> that<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.189> also<00:01:54.189> we<00:01:54.460> get<00:01:54.670> what<00:01:54.850> looks

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
from that and also we get what looks

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.910 
from that and also we get what looks
like<00:01:55.150> some<00:01:55.450> shading<00:01:55.810> for<00:01:56.200> our<00:01:56.350> yellow<00:01:56.619> so<00:01:56.860> we

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
like some shading for our yellow so we

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.830 
like some shading for our yellow so we
can<00:01:57.040> start<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.490> create<00:01:57.820> our<00:01:57.970> graphics<00:01:58.540> even

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
can start to create our graphics even

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
though they're just two colors so they

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.070

three color print so I think you can see
that<00:04:58.610> overprinting<00:04:59.540> is<00:04:59.830> the<00:05:00.830> strategic<00:05:01.520> color

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910
