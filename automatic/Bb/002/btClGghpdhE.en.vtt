glue so fold it along the body and use

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.340 
glue so fold it along the body and use
glue<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.850> stick<00:03:54.360> it<00:03:55.730> so<00:03:56.730> use<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.810> glue<00:03:58.050> evenly

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
glue to stick it so use the glue evenly

time star point is ready but too light
come<00:04:18.720> out<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.769> can<00:04:20.150> cut<00:04:21.150> some<00:04:21.359> holes<00:04:22.130> on<00:04:23.130> the

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
come out you can cut some holes on the

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.290 
come out you can cut some holes on the
edges<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.740> take<00:04:25.740> even<00:04:26.040> distance<00:04:26.550> approximate

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
edges you take even distance approximate

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.920 
edges you take even distance approximate
7<00:04:27.630> centimeter<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:29.790> can<00:04:30.000> cut<00:04:30.240> three<00:04:30.600> holes

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
7 centimeter and you can cut three holes

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:40.010 
7 centimeter and you can cut three holes
on<00:04:31.700> both<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.910> sides<00:04:33.210> I<00:04:37.880> got<00:04:38.880> a<00:04:39.240> diamond<00:04:39.720> like

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
on both the sides I got a diamond like

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:54.159 
on both the sides I got a diamond like
shape<00:04:41.330> both<00:04:42.330> side

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.350 

especially<00:04:55.129> for<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.550> light<00:04:55.699> to<00:04:55.729> come<00:04:55.939> out

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
especially for the light to come out

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.640 
especially for the light to come out
from<00:04:57.319> the<00:04:57.470> star<00:04:57.759> if<00:04:58.759> we<00:04:59.060> put<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.360> light<00:04:59.750> inside

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
from the star if we put a light inside

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.070 
from the star if we put a light inside
the<00:05:01.090> star<00:05:03.550> like<00:05:04.550> that<00:05:04.729> our<00:05:04.849> one<00:05:05.180> star<00:05:05.629> point<00:05:05.930> is

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
the star like that our one star point is

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.899 
the star like that our one star point is
ready<00:05:06.349> and<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:08.240> extra<00:05:08.629> paper<00:05:08.810> you<00:05:09.050> can<00:05:09.229> see<00:05:09.259> on

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
start points already I already made the

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.389 
start points already I already made the
five<00:05:24.249> star<00:05:24.519> points<00:05:25.739> once<00:05:26.739> that<00:05:26.979> they<00:05:27.309> have

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:27.399 
five star points once that they have

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:31.320 
five star points once that they have
ready<00:05:27.669> glue<00:05:28.629> each<00:05:28.839> other<00:05:29.550> this<00:05:30.550> extra<00:05:30.969> paper

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:40.110 
ready glue each other this extra paper
area<00:05:31.659> will<00:05:32.289> put<00:05:32.499> the<00:05:32.649> glue<00:05:37.409> folded

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
area will put the glue folded

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.550 
area will put the glue folded
backside<00:05:40.600> and<00:05:41.520> put<00:05:42.520> one<00:05:42.910> more<00:05:43.180> star<00:05:43.560> point

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
backside and put one more star point

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.040 
backside and put one more star point
below<00:05:44.919> like<00:05:45.190> that<00:05:45.490> you<00:05:45.760> can<00:05:45.940> stack<00:05:46.300> all<00:05:46.570> the

below like that you can stack all the
five<00:05:47.320> star<00:05:47.740> points<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:48.639> put<00:05:49.570> away<00:05:49.780> two<00:05:50.050> and

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
five star points and put away two and

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.360 
five star points and put away two and
let<00:05:51.460> it<00:05:51.580> dry<00:05:51.820> on<00:05:52.180> the<00:05:52.990> top<00:05:53.350> side<00:05:53.680> and<00:05:54.010> on<00:05:54.220> the

let it dry on the top side and on the

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.580 
let it dry on the top side and on the
bottom<00:05:54.790> side<00:05:55.030> you<00:05:55.090> can<00:05:55.419> put<00:05:55.449> one<00:05:55.720> spring<00:05:56.260> you

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
bottom side you can put one spring you

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.219 
bottom side you can put one spring you
can<00:05:56.770> just<00:05:57.210> glue<00:05:58.210> it<00:05:58.240> with<00:05:58.479> a<00:05:58.570> texture<00:05:58.960> paper

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
can just glue it with a texture paper

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:07.629 
can just glue it with a texture paper
one<00:05:59.380> string

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.390 

once<00:06:08.509> it<00:06:08.689> get<00:06:08.930> right<00:06:09.199> careful<00:06:09.530> open<00:06:09.979> the<00:06:10.099> star

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
once it get right careful open the star

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.760 
once it get right careful open the star
and<00:06:10.819> pull<00:06:11.120> the<00:06:11.270> two<00:06:11.419> strings<00:06:11.810> the<00:06:12.289> study<00:06:12.590> is

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
and pull the two strings the study is

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.409 
and pull the two strings the study is
now<00:06:12.979> opened<00:06:13.520> beautiful<00:06:14.030> three-dimensional

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
now opened beautiful three-dimensional

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.790 
now opened beautiful three-dimensional
star<00:06:15.310> you<00:06:16.310> can<00:06:16.460> use<00:06:16.580> this<00:06:16.759> kind<00:06:17.060> of<00:06:17.300> wire<00:06:17.990> with

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
star you can use this kind of wire with

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.709 
star you can use this kind of wire with
a<00:06:18.830> folder<00:06:19.900> to<00:06:20.900> put<00:06:21.050> a<00:06:21.229> light<00:06:21.590> inside<00:06:22.069> it<00:06:22.280> I<00:06:22.719> used

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:23.719 
a folder to put a light inside it I used

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:25.839 
a folder to put a light inside it I used
I<00:06:24.020> hand<00:06:24.379> in<00:06:24.530> front<00:06:24.710> of<00:06:24.889> my<00:06:24.949> door<00:06:25.340> you<00:06:25.580> can<00:06:25.819> see
