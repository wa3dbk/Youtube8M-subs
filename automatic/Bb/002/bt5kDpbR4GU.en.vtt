00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.179 

so<00:00:06.000> we<00:00:06.150> have<00:00:06.330> our<00:00:06.540> bamboo<00:00:06.990> harvest<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.950> we're

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
so we have our bamboo harvest and we're

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.100 
so we have our bamboo harvest and we're
going<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.400> prepare<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:09.000> cook<00:00:09.269> them<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.900> never

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
going to prepare to cook them you never

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.560 
going to prepare to cook them you never
want<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.440> eat<00:00:10.530> raw<00:00:10.950> bamboo<00:00:11.490> shoots<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.240> always

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
want to eat raw bamboo shoots you always

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.990 
want to eat raw bamboo shoots you always
parboil<00:00:13.139> them<00:00:13.410> first<00:00:13.799> if<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.429> buy<00:00:14.730> them

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
parboil them first if you buy them

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.240 
parboil them first if you buy them
canned<00:00:15.330> they're<00:00:15.780> already<00:00:16.320> been<00:00:16.590> parboiled

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
canned they're already been parboiled

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.019 
canned they're already been parboiled
and<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:18.000> removes<00:00:18.330> any<00:00:18.660> traces<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.230> cyanide

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
and that removes any traces of cyanide

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.929 
and that removes any traces of cyanide
so<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.689> want<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.990> cut<00:00:22.199> along<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.939> outside

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
so you want to cut along the outside

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.290 
so you want to cut along the outside
curve<00:00:24.830> about<00:00:25.830> halfway<00:00:26.160> through<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:27.060> root

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
curve about halfway through the root

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.750 
curve about halfway through the root
there's<00:00:28.230> no<00:00:28.560> need<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.800> remove<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.550> outer

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
there's no need to remove the outer

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.089 
there's no need to remove the outer
leaves<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.630> they<00:00:31.260> don't<00:00:31.439> even<00:00:31.560> need<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.890> be

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
leaves and they don't even need to be

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.720 
leaves and they don't even need to be
washed<00:00:32.369> or<00:00:32.730> scrubbed<00:00:35.480> we're<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> cut

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
washed or scrubbed we're going to cut

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:47.870 
washed or scrubbed we're going to cut
halfway<00:00:38.730> through

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.300 

and<00:00:47.970> then<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.930> want<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.230> trim<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.740> top<00:00:50.040> as

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
and then you want to trim the top as

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.540 
and then you want to trim the top as
well<00:00:50.340> cut<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.270> diagonally<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.920> cut<00:00:53.130> off<00:00:53.280> that

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
well cut it diagonally to cut off that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.210 
well cut it diagonally to cut off that
tip<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.840> that's<00:00:55.110> not<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:55.590> edible<00:00:55.950> part

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
tip because that's not the edible part

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.500 
tip because that's not the edible part
and<00:00:57.530> also<00:00:58.530> by<00:00:58.890> opening<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.610> up<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.030> will<00:01:00.210> cook<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
and also by opening it up it will cook a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.900 
and also by opening it up it will cook a
little<00:01:00.660> bit<00:01:00.780> faster<00:01:01.220> there<00:01:02.220> we<00:01:02.340> go<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:05.280> we'll

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
little bit faster there we go and we'll

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.940 
little bit faster there we go and we'll
put<00:01:06.120> that<00:01:06.300> into<00:01:06.660> the<00:01:06.780> boiling<00:01:07.050> pot<00:01:07.500> that's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
put that into the boiling pot that's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.180 
put that into the boiling pot that's
just<00:01:08.370> water<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.720> contains<00:01:10.170> Nuka<00:01:10.830> or

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
just water and this contains Nuka or

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.940 
just water and this contains Nuka or
rice<00:01:11.550> bran<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.630> after<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> rice<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.620> milled

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
rice bran so after the rice is milled

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.060 
rice bran so after the rice is milled
there's<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.750> leftover<00:01:15.750> bran<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.530> put<00:01:16.800> in<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
there's the leftover bran we put in a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.730 
there's the leftover bran we put in a
hefty<00:01:17.520> handful<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.290> don't<00:01:19.470> have

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
hefty handful of that if you don't have

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.790 
hefty handful of that if you don't have
that<00:01:20.040> when<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.520> rinse<00:01:20.880> your<00:01:21.060> rice<00:01:21.720> before<00:01:22.500> you

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
that when you rinse your rice before you

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.850 
that when you rinse your rice before you
cook<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.820> white<00:01:24.330> milky<00:01:24.990> water<00:01:25.200> that's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
cook it that white milky water that's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.160 
cook it that white milky water that's
left<00:01:26.340> over<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.940> also<00:01:27.270> good<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.509> cook<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.990> in

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
left over is also good to cook it in

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.290 
left over is also good to cook it in
that<00:01:28.710> will<00:01:28.890> take<00:01:29.100> away<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> bitterness<00:01:29.759> of

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
that will take away the bitterness of

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.530 
that will take away the bitterness of
the<00:01:31.259> bamboo<00:01:31.650> shoot'<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.479> we<00:01:33.479> boil<00:01:33.750> them<00:01:35.540> these

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the bamboo shoot' and we boil them these

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.840 
the bamboo shoot' and we boil them these
took<00:01:36.869> about<00:01:37.080> 30<00:01:37.440> minutes<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:38.040> boil<00:01:40.340> we<00:01:41.340> poked

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
took about 30 minutes to boil we poked

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.370 
took about 30 minutes to boil we poked
them<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:43.190> chopstick<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.220> they're<00:01:44.670> tender

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
them with a chopstick and they're tender

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:57.260 
them with a chopstick and they're tender
so<00:01:46.380> then<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.800> ready<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.160> take<00:01:47.310> out

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.960 

so<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:58.110> bring<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.500> those<00:01:58.680> bamboo<00:01:59.009> shoots<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
so we bring in those bamboo shoots and

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.460 
so we bring in those bamboo shoots and
we<00:02:00.509> start<00:02:00.780> peeling<00:02:01.049> away<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.680> outer<00:02:02.640> leaves

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.130 

you<00:02:07.470> keep<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.890> peeling<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.849> what's<00:02:09.660> left<00:02:09.869> on

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you keep on peeling and what's left on

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.900 
you keep on peeling and what's left on
the<00:02:10.229> inside<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.009> edible<00:02:11.400> part<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
the inside of the edible part of the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.180 
the inside of the edible part of the
bamboo<00:02:12.300> shoot'<00:02:15.650> mine<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.950> little<00:02:17.069> bit

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
bamboo shoot' mine is a little bit

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.790 
bamboo shoot' mine is a little bit
ragged<00:02:17.580> because<00:02:18.239> these<00:02:18.450> were<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.900> ones<00:02:19.620> that

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
ragged because these were the ones that

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.670 
ragged because these were the ones that
were<00:02:20.010> not<00:02:20.300> cut<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.569> cleanly<00:02:21.900> when<00:02:22.560> we

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
were not cut so cleanly when we

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.610 
were not cut so cleanly when we
harvested<00:02:23.239> then<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.420> start<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.989> slice<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.470> up

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
harvested then you start to slice it up

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.559 
harvested then you start to slice it up
however<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.160> need<00:02:26.459> for<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.790> dish<00:02:27.060> thick

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
however you need for the dish thick

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.809 
however you need for the dish thick
slices<00:02:28.700> thin<00:02:29.700> slices<00:02:30.890> whatever<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.250> that

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
slices thin slices whatever it is that

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.030 
slices thin slices whatever it is that
you're<00:02:33.060> going<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.450> be<00:02:33.510> cooking<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.799> want

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
you're going to be cooking so you want

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.900 
you're going to be cooking so you want
to<00:02:35.130> start<00:02:35.340> slicing<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.970> up<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:38.790> can

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
to start slicing it up and you can

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.660 
to start slicing it up and you can
refrigerate<00:02:39.269> this<00:02:40.760> or<00:02:41.760> use<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.209> immediately

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.420 

if<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.090> root<00:02:48.299> has<00:02:48.569> some<00:02:48.900> rather<00:02:49.680> dark<00:02:50.040> area

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
if the root has some rather dark area

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.370 
if the root has some rather dark area
that<00:02:50.670> gray<00:02:50.910> stuff<00:02:50.970> go<00:02:51.600> ahead<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:52.140> want<00:02:52.319> to

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
that gray stuff go ahead and you want to
