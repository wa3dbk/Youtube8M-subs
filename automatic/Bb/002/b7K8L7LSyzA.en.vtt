00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.240
 the competition started with twenty-one 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.920
 competitors at the start of class 125 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.750
 promotional where the very young 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.730
 Mexican champion of pacts 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.320
 antonio cairoli that seemed 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.270
 literally floating on the sand 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.890
 imparted a power style lesson 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.020
 competitive his opponents and nothing 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.000
 they could do to counter it in the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.100
 victory really bright the future of 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.170
 this very young champion maybe the 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.930
 youngest champion of Italy of the 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.300
 minicross seems to me so in 98 videos 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.000
 world champion or 13 years old today runs 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.990
 in the 125 promotional cadets 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.400
 you are from messina of pacts of pacts 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.770
 what do you think of the supermarecross 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.570
 as a specialty since you did 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.660
 even the cross is actually and is one 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.340
 specialty that specializes in precise 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.620
 driving techniques 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.690
 he had practically been like a runway for 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.420
 on the mud motocross let's say why 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.140
 so there are so same reports 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.240
 of the bikes I understand where I hope to 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.710
 arrive and antonio but we hope to 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.430
 arriving in two years and the World 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.070
 that's enough 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.140
 you saw you see messina on top yes 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.160
 yes you have seen it sometimes yes 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.050
 some very slow but 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.340
 ok good luck then so many things 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.340
 beautiful for today's run hi 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.860
 well we have passed for this fifth 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.200
 Trial of the organized winter trophy 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.640
 from the tim and three hills and from rinaldo of 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.070
 broken an extraordinary test of the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.270
 national motorcycling because today 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.360
 this is a championship test 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.849
 supermarecross italian and for us it is 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.250
 tradition to have a great champion and 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.880
 even and world champion 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.769
 this year tony cairoli tones one more 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.840
 world for you the second in a row 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.550
 in the limbo mx2 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.950
 but the most beautiful thing that I have 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.150
 telling the sportsmen and that to help 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.370
 however the team seems for 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.850
 strategic opportunities of yours 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.819
 team 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.489
 to the course in the mx1 and you have also dominated 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.299
 that race where you want to get tones 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.730
 certainly it was a championship 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.440
 in the name of great success we have 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.750
 won both the world mix that is one 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.250
 mx1 race at the first exit with the 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.120
 completely new bike and therefore it is 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.370
 it was definitely a great one 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.260
 satisfaction for me and the team is one 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.599
 season really to frame and 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.540
 this year compared to the world premiere 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.940
 where he had difficulties because 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.320
 we of the competitors say a little hard 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.900
 this year practically yours 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.260
 competitors have calmed down with 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.480
 the soul because they are used to seeing you 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.769
 champion with another jam march but 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.450
 let's say that this year at the end 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.950
 competitors were the same year 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.720
 last video was taken a step of 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.010
 quality 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.440
 fig much more training 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.600
 this winter is the security he had 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.020
 the way was 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.940
 at the beginning of the championship really 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.560
 hard to hold for others of 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.940
 other drivers and so I immediately took a 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.400
 good advantage at the beginning of the championship 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.830
 after dominated then large very large 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.960
 carlo team definitely and these are 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.850
 the components combined with your skill la 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.340
 your athleticism let's say why 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.380
 rightly to be these levels 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.650
 you need to be prepared and this is out 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.970
 of doubt then a component mixer 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.870
 that by now they have detached you from the 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.000
 competition 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.000
 yes in the end it takes to win 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.160
 energy the team that the bike that the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.970
 pilot so it's a mix of things at the end 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.920
 This year has been the choice was 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.810
 winning we have a better team are 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.970
 the last best and there is in Italy 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.430
 and a team that follows me great e 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.550
 then a bike set up 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.130
 that was the winter training 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.230
 the best one and then I brought a 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.570
 home of really good results only 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.430
 the last consideration is you are still 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.590
 overtaken by your friends who want you 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.780
 so well they raised you as a child 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.920
 in this environment luigi mamone rinaldo 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.720
 of course and beautiful company 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.240
 on turns you accompanied by now 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.610
 many years you want to spend a few words for 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.020
 us the tones because we who admire in 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.820
 television, however, we love you so much 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.520
 when we see you we ca n't do a 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.990
 less to disturb you to feel but it is 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.360
 a pleasure also because 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.800
 the organizer is always warming up 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.050
 great person organized the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.360
 events in the south is really good 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.260
 then again more follows us 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.190
 therefore always this both for us and for 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.290
 hopefully the organization of the race 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.450
 continue even if not good luck 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.690
 tones see you on the track already in your mouth 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.690
 to the wolf
