so<00:05:15.880> that's<00:05:16.330> that<00:05:16.540> one<00:05:16.800> now<00:05:17.800> we'll<00:05:17.950> go<00:05:18.070> back<00:05:18.100> to

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
so that's that one now we'll go back to

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:28.670 
so that's that one now we'll go back to
the<00:05:18.640> ocean<00:05:18.910> wave<00:05:22.080> place

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.920 

videos<00:05:29.370> started
