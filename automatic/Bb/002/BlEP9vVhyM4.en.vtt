00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.000 
you want to add the glitter liner over
the<00:02:12.640> top<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:13.060> just<00:02:13.630> figured<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:13.960> sparkle<00:02:14.710> goes

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
the top I just figured that sparkle goes

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.310 
the top I just figured that sparkle goes
hand-in-hand<00:02:15.370> with<00:02:15.580> prams<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.660> went<00:02:17.140> over

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
hand-in-hand with prams so I went over

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:24.440 
hand-in-hand with prams so I went over
the<00:02:17.410> top<00:02:17.440> of<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.830> glitter<00:02:18.070> liner

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.970 

next<00:02:25.450> apply<00:02:25.690> some<00:02:25.930> mascara<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.590> some<00:02:26.770> false

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
next apply some mascara and some false

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.250 
next apply some mascara and some false
lashes<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.640> then<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.630> might<00:02:28.810> want<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.050> hide

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
lashes and then you might want to hide

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.750 
lashes and then you might want to hide
the<00:02:29.470> bond<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.920> lashes<00:02:30.280> with<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.550> liner

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
the bond of the lashes with the liner

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.970 
the bond of the lashes with the liner
these<00:02:31.450> lashes<00:02:31.840> don't<00:02:32.020> really<00:02:32.290> need<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.680> but

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
these lashes don't really need it but

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.070 
these lashes don't really need it but
the<00:02:33.280> glue<00:02:33.520> doesn't<00:02:33.730> dry<00:02:33.880> matte<00:02:34.240> so<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.780> kind<00:02:34.990> of

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
the glue doesn't dry matte so it kind of

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.620 
the glue doesn't dry matte so it kind of
looks<00:02:35.230> silly<00:02:35.500> if<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.770> don't<00:02:35.980> then<00:02:36.940> apply<00:02:37.300> tiny

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
looks silly if you don't then apply tiny

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.240 
looks silly if you don't then apply tiny
bit<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:37.930> brown<00:02:38.140> eyeshadow<00:02:38.560> underneath<00:02:38.980> the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
bit of brown eyeshadow underneath the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:52.600 
bit of brown eyeshadow underneath the
eye<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.670> apply<00:02:40.360> some<00:02:40.390> mascara

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.330 

for<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.700> lips<00:02:53.879> I<00:02:54.090> used<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.780> new<00:02:55.590> elf<00:02:55.799> lipstick

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
for the lips I used a new elf lipstick

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.339 
for the lips I used a new elf lipstick
that<00:02:56.549> I've<00:02:56.640> got<00:02:56.819> in<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.180> shade<00:02:57.360> fiery<00:02:57.750> fuchsia

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
that I've got in the shade fiery fuchsia

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.190 
that I've got in the shade fiery fuchsia
it's<00:02:58.920> not<00:02:59.400> really<00:02:59.610> fire<00:02:59.819> rate<00:03:00.060> or<00:03:00.269> fuchsia<00:03:00.659> but

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
it's not really fire rate or fuchsia but

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.199 
it's not really fire rate or fuchsia but
I<00:03:01.470> will<00:03:01.799> forgive<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.220> because<00:03:02.549> I<00:03:02.790> absolutely

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
I will forgive it because I absolutely

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.869 
I will forgive it because I absolutely
love<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:03.900> beautiful<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:05.489> wanted<00:03:05.760> the

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
love it it is beautiful and I wanted the

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.059 
love it it is beautiful and I wanted the
lips<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.360> look<00:03:06.480> kind<00:03:06.659> of<00:03:06.720> natural<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.860> paired

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
lips to look kind of natural so I paired

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.410 
lips to look kind of natural so I paired
the<00:03:08.250> color<00:03:08.459> on<00:03:08.610> with<00:03:08.760> my<00:03:08.909> finger

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
the color on with my finger

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.960 
the color on with my finger
and<00:03:09.510> then<00:03:09.780> added<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> lip<00:03:10.530> balm<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.069> top<00:03:11.280> but

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
and then added a lip balm of the top but
