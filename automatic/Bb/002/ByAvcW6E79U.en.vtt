00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
all they would have to do is you know

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.390 
all they would have to do is you know
knock<00:01:29.920> out<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.810> computer<00:01:31.810> player<00:01:32.080> on<00:01:32.470> the

spin wheel and add just another

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.480 
spin wheel and add just another
variation<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:37.299> guess<00:01:37.540> at<00:01:38.500> another<00:01:38.860> option<00:01:39.340> to

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490

it<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.900> mean<00:01:41.049> you<00:01:41.140> could<00:01:41.260> put<00:01:41.590> it<00:01:41.680> into<00:01:41.950> like

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
it and I mean you could put it into like

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.840 
it and I mean you could put it into like
a<00:01:42.270> probably<00:01:43.270> like<00:01:43.450> wager<00:01:44.140> match<00:01:44.320> or<00:01:44.560> something

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
a probably like wager match or something
