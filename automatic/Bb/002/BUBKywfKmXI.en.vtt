00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
first step we'll look at the figure and

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.930 
first step we'll look at the figure and
this<00:01:17.330> is<00:01:17.510> Charlie<00:01:17.810> crow<00:01:18.229> he<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:19.250> only<00:01:19.460> in<00:01:19.700> this

set so the arms and the legs are all
attached<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:25.880> they<00:01:26.060> do<00:01:26.120> move<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:27.440> head

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
attached and they do move the head

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.789 
attached and they do move the head
swivels<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.990> torso<00:01:29.990> can<00:01:30.229> move<00:01:30.380> up<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.680> down

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
swivels the torso can move up and down

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.890 
swivels the torso can move up and down
and<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.310> arms<00:01:31.580> can<00:01:31.760> go<00:01:31.940> up<00:01:32.180> and<00:01:32.360> down<00:01:32.450> there's

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
and the arms can go up and down there's

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.310 
and the arms can go up and down there's
no<00:01:33.049> other<00:01:33.350> joints<00:01:34.010> though<00:01:34.250> just<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:35.140> you<00:01:36.140> can

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
no other joints though just the you can

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.210 
no other joints though just the you can
do<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:36.530> you<00:01:36.650> can't<00:01:36.890> move<00:01:37.040> one<00:01:37.280> leg<00:01:37.460> at<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.729> time

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
do it you can't move one leg at a time

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.149 
do it you can't move one leg at a time
that's<00:01:40.220> your<00:01:40.970> full<00:01:41.210> range<00:01:41.420> of<00:01:41.659> movement<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:43.070> I

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
that's your full range of movement and I

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.410 
that's your full range of movement and I
think<00:01:43.760> it<00:01:43.909> was<00:01:44.090> kind<00:01:44.360> of<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.540> safety<00:01:45.020> thing<00:01:46.420> so

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
think it was kind of a safety thing so

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.910 
think it was kind of a safety thing so
the<00:01:47.510> kids<00:01:47.689> couldn't<00:01:47.990> eat<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.439> figures

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
the kids couldn't eat the figures

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.390 
the kids couldn't eat the figures
whatever<00:01:49.159> you<00:01:49.790> know<00:01:50.920> who<00:01:51.920> wouldn't<00:01:52.220> want<00:01:52.340> to

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
whatever you know who wouldn't want to

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.690 
whatever you know who wouldn't want to
eat<00:01:52.490> a<00:01:52.520> crow<00:01:52.939> I<00:01:53.210> guess<00:01:53.659> eat<00:01:54.229> crow<00:01:54.560> huh<00:01:54.830> so

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
it's just it's a real simple build and I

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.140 
it's just it's a real simple build and I
like<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.590> way<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.889> instructions<00:04:14.280> are

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
like the way the instructions are

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.330 
like the way the instructions are
designed<00:04:15.629> they're<00:04:15.930> designed<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.979> kind<00:04:17.159> of

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
designed they're designed to kind of

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.839 
designed they're designed to kind of
just<00:04:17.849> show<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.329> character<00:04:18.870> building<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:20.039> it's

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
just show the character building it it's

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:25.510 
just show the character building it it's
kind<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.180> like<00:04:21.389> a<00:04:23.029> mad<00:04:24.029> about<00:04:24.180> lego<00:04:24.750> video

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
kind of like a mad about lego video

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.360 
kind of like a mad about lego video
except<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:26.700> just<00:04:26.820> printed<00:04:27.419> off

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.080 

so<00:04:31.370> it<00:04:31.460> just<00:04:31.580> kind<00:04:31.849> of<00:04:31.970> shows<00:04:33.879> Charlie<00:04:34.879> Crowe

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
so it just kind of shows Charlie Crowe

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.659 
so it just kind of shows Charlie Crowe
building<00:04:35.539> his<00:04:35.720> car<00:04:36.020> step<00:04:36.919> by<00:04:37.099> step<00:04:39.490> so<00:04:40.490> that's
