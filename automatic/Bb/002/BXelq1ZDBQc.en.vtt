 it comes t uploaded and lots of people 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.140
 built a sequel to that one part 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.580
 Tomorrow that last part is not yet 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.870

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.790

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.989
 You can paste annotation on your screen 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.400
 you just click and then that too 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.110
 new window and then you just come 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.360
 with that previous video but you also watch 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.070
 to watch this video in 1080p because 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.690
 as of sexy quality and i can do you too 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.850
 see exactly how it looks to him 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.199
 on my own screen because 1080p is 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.150
 really just the best quality that on 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.769
 can upload this moment on youtube follows 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.540
 michael you also original quality 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.460
 upload came klaas behind and that 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.870
 even better at 1080p but the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.460
 market were not very much off today 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.019
 another clean race for you 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.909
 because I race on a circuit on one 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.949
 abandoned airport and x is Coming up 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.449
 They also went on a public road 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.100
 it will see you now i use it now 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.110
 is good with turbo the term comes here 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.560
 have a not red when pretty out of water 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.790
 fire 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.500
 different types of exhausts 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.000
 Dependent on working with really here 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.570
 just a car in my way i drift 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.100
 him 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.200
 I'm almost out of the way or I'll be in my 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.340
 forest right but unfortunately for the players 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.780
 I don't get to those behind me 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.640
 rightly so and then I'll just continue with 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.930
 there is courage to ride three laps in total 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.100
 and with me it's always like me 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.390
 must spin three rounds 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.159
 for I the first round really clean 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.630
 row two dreams usually one that chris in 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.070
 the third round usually twice Christmas 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.420
 but that was not the case here because me 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.250
 do n't lose my concentration here 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.960
 just kept racing and the race became too 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.310
 again probably because suddenly at the 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.140
 third round it stays really dark 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.430
 it became tendon in the middle of the night and me 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.140
 couldn't do anything more simon and for 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.909
 lights were broken in post there again 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.039
 almost against fellow player who drove in 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.750
 a mustang gt so that was all real 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.399
 of itself but still is a gland 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.920
 is one see top right and then me 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.899
 record on this job is 3 minute 036 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.399
 hundredths and I just tried this one 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.079
 race to ride under three minutes and 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.789
 it might be lucky to see that 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.679
 automatically at the end of this race mine 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.179
 warrior in the jaguar xp there what i really 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.570
 just a whole chilling car to get in 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.670
 to drive 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.899
 but I am very upset to the left 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.520
 and to the right you could just have one 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.080
 want to have car without upset it 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.399
 is therefore not a calculated car for you 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.600
 because as a habit it points out one 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.920
 turn comes then sends that help from all 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.300
 Once a lot to the right and then you have to 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.830
 you just very well against work if you 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.060
 it cannot work against you then drag you 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.920
 you only suddenly leave the bends 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.510
 all the way off crashing and r &amp; b 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.130
 so just game about losing that race 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.540
 Are we now in the third round you 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.980
 almost sees the animal crown against this one 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.590
 guy on the way back immediately 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.120
 with me at mustang gt at the mustang 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.099
 GT is one of my love 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.680
 just find brother-in-law in real life 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.150
 mustang gt so look further they lie 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.370
 of course we lay ground is really just 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.260
 a thick thick box just like the racer 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.150
 I also really think about the jaguar 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.769
 a super cool car in real life 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.530
 and further I find the last one 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.000
 porcelain eleven turbos are really a sick person 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.230
 old looks like I put that car on 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.640
 I always go there on the street 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.349
 I always think it's super cool 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.000
 completely like that blue is completely like 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.690
 that is yellow because yellow that fits and just 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.060
 at the post 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.220
 but I think the Ford Mustang GT really does 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.510
 simply the thickest magicite and of course 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.220
 once an hour there is also one that is too 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.079
 layer another video about uploaded and me 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.340
 find those things about it and look so sick 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.090
 if I am ever rich enough to have such a 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.560
 to buy a car 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.150
 then I will certainly do it girl who 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.799
 dirk rop almost at that feta but 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.299
 luckily I can just dodge him in 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.680
 otherwise I just had 10 more 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.720
 grace lost because you see it on the 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.220
 minimap that there is another ford 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.569
 mustang behind me right in the hauled 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.709

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.299

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.250
