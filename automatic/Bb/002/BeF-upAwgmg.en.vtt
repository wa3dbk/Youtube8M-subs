you<00:02:38.030> know<00:02:38.120> WEC<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.690> think<00:02:38.930> would<00:02:38.989> be<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.140> place

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
you know WEC I think would be the place

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.020 
you know WEC I think would be the place
for<00:02:39.440> zuffa<00:02:40.280> right<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:40.640> how<00:02:40.760> does<00:02:40.819> that<00:02:40.970> all

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
for zuffa right so how does that all

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.440 
for zuffa right so how does that all
kind<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.420> mix<00:02:41.540> together<00:02:41.690> um<00:02:42.500> good<00:02:42.950> questions

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
kind of mix together um good questions

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.050 
kind of mix together um good questions
all<00:02:44.450> very<00:02:44.870> good<00:02:44.930> questions<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.590> think<00:02:45.800> that<00:02:46.060> for

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
all very good questions I think that for

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.370 
all very good questions I think that for
me<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:48.040> CBS<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.220> always<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.459> great<00:02:49.670> thing<00:02:50.380> WCS

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
me and CBS is always a great thing WCS

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.930 
me and CBS is always a great thing WCS
always<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> great<00:02:51.799> thing<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.280> showtimes<00:02:52.790> a

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
always a great thing and showtimes a

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.780 
always a great thing and showtimes a
great<00:02:53.090> thing<00:02:53.269> so<00:02:53.510> all<00:02:54.500> those<00:02:54.739> are<00:02:54.980> three<00:02:55.310> big

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
great thing so all those are three big

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.360 
great thing so all those are three big
big<00:02:56.450> stages<00:02:56.720> even<00:02:57.200> even<00:02:57.500> if<00:02:57.860> we<00:02:58.100> could<00:02:58.220> like

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
big stages even even if we could like

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.800 
big stages even even if we could like
pull<00:02:58.549> off<00:02:58.640> since<00:02:58.850> on<00:02:58.970> UFC<00:02:59.390> that<00:02:59.569> would<00:02:59.630> be

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
pull off since on UFC that would be

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.320 
pull off since on UFC that would be
crazy<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.830> know<00:03:00.950> it's<00:03:01.489> a<00:03:01.580> possibility<00:03:01.880> did<00:03:02.180> I

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
crazy you know it's a possibility did I

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.789 
crazy you know it's a possibility did I
mention<00:03:02.600> that<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:02.870> actually<00:03:03.019> get<00:03:03.260> on<00:03:03.350> UFC<00:03:03.680> on

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
mention that you actually get on UFC on

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.440 
mention that you actually get on UFC on
pay-per-view<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.430> think<00:03:04.880> they<00:03:05.000> could<00:03:05.360> have

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
pay-per-view I think they could have

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.710 
pay-per-view I think they could have
been<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:05.690> possibility<00:03:06.110> but<00:03:06.470> uh<00:03:07.480> but<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.600> know

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
been a possibility but uh but you know
