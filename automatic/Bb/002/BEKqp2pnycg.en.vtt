 [Music] 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.110
 and they know what color is 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.660
 better distinguishes black at sea and that 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.220
 symbolizes the class the black 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.470
 so if you want to draw attention 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.410
 with elegance they must choose a boat 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.410
 black as the sun siegfried heitor 64 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.960
 has a great line because it is 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.780
 large and has a sporty design but 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.640
 the cover similar to open will be fast 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.890
 like a big motorboat of al 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.840
 discovered in fact the area is very 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.840
 spacious and fully equipped 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.780
 Project 64 has a great room 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.510
 It has a very elegant modulation and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.100
 modern but without exaggerating the tones that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.989
 they are based on the contrast of light and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.680
 dark and the furniture make the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.680
 cozy atmosphere 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.670
 What I like most of all is the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.020
 feeling of being able to take refuge here and 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.970
 same time be able to be in 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.280
 contact with the sea with the sky 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.280
 opening the roof look how big it is 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.530
 lowering the side windows or 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.330
 sliding the composite stern window 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.960
 of highs that overlap until 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.960
 disappear 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.010
 these large side windows give a 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.600
 emotion that only the best works of 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.600
 architecture can offer 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.030
 the wash compartment of the tender 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.159
 it is accessible from the platform 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.050
 submersible and from the position of 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.050
 garage on the edge of the platform 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.650
 in the cabin there are two control panels 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.180
 one near the pilot and one further away there is 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.640
 So much space that gives the impression that 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.760
 missing some instrument instead 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.160
 missing none is more they are double box 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.290
 analog and digital displays choose in 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.510
 which can be set the screens for 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.920
 navigation are 12 inches but 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.920
 there is space for larger screens 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.319
 [Music] 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.260
 the style that elicited the plow to all the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.540
 range of aitor makes you think that these 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.939
 boats are very fast and 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.500
 powerful to run is a frame the 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.720
 exemplary that we are testing in this 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.579
 episode has two engines see from 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.920
 1,200 horses each 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.960
 each line is cradle 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.960
 [Music] 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.240
 we follow the port of genoa a boat 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.000
 how is this line when arriving at port 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.950
 pine that is only 14 miles away but 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.930
 we prefer to face the open sea and 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.980
 test the maximum performance of this 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.000
 boat 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.000
 [Music] 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.520
 to 1400 productions at the speed of 15 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.830
 knots the helmet is already in plan but 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.480
 sea conditions are ideal 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.100
 Helmet and propellers are clean 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.069
 we want to see how far we can go 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.069
 [Music] 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.799
 we are going to 2000 rpm that are 28 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.740
 knots but I have the flaps down now 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.900
 Also 's and see what things happen 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.940
 the boat becomes immediately more 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.550
 light on the water because it raises the bow 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.190
 more agility is requested and a knot is won 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.790
 more in the speed 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.510
 now let's take cycle 564 to the 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.510
 maximum speed 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.030
 the metals reach 2 thousand 340 rpm 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.800
 therefore they offer their maximum power 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:17.180
 and the speedometer signal to 33.5 migration 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:19.600
 [Music] 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.600
 all right 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.580
 the 14 64 the 64 projector is design and 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.590
 english construction but we have seen 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.540
 which is very mediterranean as well as 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.030
 ease of use and performance in 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.260
 seasons 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.260
