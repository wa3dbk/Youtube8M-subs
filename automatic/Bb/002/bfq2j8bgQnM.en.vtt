00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.519
Welcome back. The OpenMW team is proud to
announce the release of version 0.33.0. This

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.420
is a very exciting release for OpenCS, our
editor, but let's have a look at the changes

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.010
to the engine first.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.560
Death music has been implemented. This means
that the player may now enjoy the conciliatory

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.149
tones of Jeremy Soule's original soundtrack
as their thread of prophecy is broken once

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.949
again.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.870
The Level-Up music will now also play to give
the player a sense of achievement for all

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.870
that grinding - or paid training, if you play
Morrowind like most people.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.770
Console targeting on the player model through
clicking is now implemented. This previously

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.550
could be done by typing "player" in the console
window, but I think you'll agree that it's

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.550
now much easier to do.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.780
The Red on-hit overlay has been introduced.
It turns out that hits on the player come

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.770
up as a sort of red throb covering the whole
screen in Morrowind. In previous versions

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.660
of OpenMW, we had the player model bleed just
like NPCs. This older functionality can be

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.140
restored through the settings file, should
you prefer it.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.800
Spell-casting for non-humanoid creatures has
now been implemented.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.010
Therefore Scribs have been restored to their original purpose of paralyzing the player

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.960
for unreasonable amounts of time.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.460
For all you bibliophiles, books with images
now display correctly, and images no longer

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.480
cause text to shift to the next page. We've
also fixed some other formatting issues, so

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.480
all of Morrowind's books should now be displayed
correctly for your reading pleasure.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.740
There has been increasing development on OpenCS
over the last few releases. This version is

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.950
no different, and brings a host of new features
to the program. This is highly exciting, as

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.450
OpenCS will redress many of the infamous bugs
that plagued the Original construction set

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.380
and eventually allow for advanced OpenMW content
to be produced.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.430
Terrain rendering has been implemented within
OpenCS. We can now view objects in relation

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.950
to the terrain that they exist on. This takes
us one step closer to complete rendering capacity,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.950
with only water and fog remaining.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.030
Running the game immediately from the current
position whilst maintaining edits has been

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.170
implemented within OpenCS. This allows content
developers to seamlessly switch between editing

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:03.170
and play-testing. It is our hope that this
will save modders many hours of frustration!

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.410
On the interface side, a number of reference
tables were added.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.459
Spells, path-grids, and SoundGen records are
now all accessible through their respective

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.459
tables.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.249
We can now use the right-click menu on a record
column to jump directly to editing that record.

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:51.400
For example, we can edit the script of an
object through the right-click menu on its

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.819
script column. Or, if we have a cell reference,
we can easily edit the base object that is

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:03.819
referenced.

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.759
That's about it for this time around. As always
there were a large number of smaller fixes

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.189
and enhancements which weren't included in
this video. For more information, I'd advise

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:18.639
you to check out the full release announcement
on our website, 'openmw.org'. These are exciting

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.800
times for OpenMW, and we hope to be back soon
with more substantial updates.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.800
Until next time, thanks for watching.
