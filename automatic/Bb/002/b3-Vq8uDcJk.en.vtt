 Welcome to the legendary 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.640
 Opening of a legendary competition 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.780
 which already over the generation 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:53.550
 our humanity was transported 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.129
 a competition of so anything seen before 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.039
 of course it is in the shade 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:05.909
 that's why we have to prove courage 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:08.460
 concentration on courage and of course one 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.990
 the highest degree of competence is required 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.799
 to pass this challenge 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.360
 you know what I'm talking about it is that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.020
 Legendary game number one of the 30 150th 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:27.429
 fans 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:29.560
 yes very nice the first game of the 30 150th 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.149
 fans is also the opening 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.729
 a best of five, I'm looking forward to it 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.439
 world cyber games qualification on the 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.979
 gamescom it was played between 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.709
 Recruit and locate the two socks 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.959
 let 's now bio five moderately right 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.619
 crash and again to the challenge 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:48.969
 the wagers I am quite satisfied with 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.860
 please think what issues in the 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.759
 podcast made in a suggestion 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.610
 We have some suggestions from you in 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.780
 the forum 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.090
 but that's more so 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.079
 I'm sure I'll fight and fight 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.689
 eat butter because it is just total 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.849
 is free and not funny that 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.869
 means something has to come and the 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:14.500
 picks are clear 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:15.730
 until 23h59 of the last of this month 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.700
 have to 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.230
 and that's when the games have to be cast 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.349
 his 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.480
 in doubt, it's enough if I'm on the brink 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.329
 Twelve makes the live stream and that 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.850
 show last game if it is too 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.590
 it is possible to deduce it in a timely manner 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.329
 to cast the games and them 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.850
 Of course, if possible also in 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.090
 to unload this month 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.900
 So there was a little bit last time 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.819
 couple ask openly 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.250
 This time is actually relatively clear 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.079
 because the only 30 day moon refers 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:53.109
 so really on this month 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:55.090
 from the first to the 30 and yes I hope 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.769
 now with her, the games continue me 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.900
 was of course trying that far so far 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.430
 is somehow to get the turn 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.239
 which is already one 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.239
 challenge is 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.159
 so no matter challenge more info come 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.049
 Dickel news will also come and then 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.440
 is that going on but now for the first time 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.090
 game sock against joel on and off animals 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.640
 not seen that much lately 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.410
 That's why the man has to play here now 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.580
 always very nice and do not look very much 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.110
 and let's see what should 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.940
 has fabricated here his classic 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.799
 opening the gambling thing with housing money 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.260
 core plus two degrees 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.239
 on the other side we have the 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.370
 fast day in animals with currently only 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.709
 a gas on the factory the first 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.980
 skirmish here nice micro front 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.109
 coelho against the versailler we look 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:50.750
 we talk in closeup at 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:53.780
 she comes there is nothing done 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.780
 neither berlin nor marines scv is coming 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.269
 back from skating the current info 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.660
 because of the fact that the gas was already relatively 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.310
 early there was the day keeps on going 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.540
 the starboard currently but not yet 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.310
 only he as off 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.810
 I think it's going to be a classic here 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.060
 Harry &amp; Drop will be on the other 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.410
 Side we actually see at sock 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.230
 very far in the back 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.419
 the stargate and that could be a lot 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.450
 very good option against a bike 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.700
 the one on the way is his first 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.889
 verse to lose for the first time provides focus 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.750
 he let out, so to speak, nothing more 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.830
 do 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.010
 he will still be like cats 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:36.240
 yumiko stocker on the escape stargate 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.750
 not quite finished going on here draws 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.420
 back 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.760
 a stalker may be too 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:50.030
 Angry will generate range like that 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:57.720
 a bit on the range 5 and on grange 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:59.670
 6 you can see three quite clearly 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.380
 games now connected to here 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.210
 really the classic of pedestal as well 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.470
 you know him and you love him 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.470
 he aggressive on the left 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.380
 since some will do harm to me 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.240
 I think he will wait for the second one 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.530
 phoenix a third maybe even one 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.229
 fourth is very keen on it again 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.470
 but animals first take the drop 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.690
 her protoss in principle wind out of the 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.280
 Sailing also brings scb with build directly 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.199
 in the bunker in the maine base aktuell 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.260
 relatively unprotected front only one 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:33.060
 century fox on the fc triberg and now 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.320
 It will be interesting because we see the 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.760
 points in the fourth possibly 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.479
 actually who has you nothing 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.580
 disassembled 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.960
 here is just worrying up a bit 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.180
 wrong foot caught fit naturally 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.530
 it is very bitter 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.350
 2 of the phoenix can not do anything without 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.110
 his colleagues are also here and now 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:52.770
 least of all the gp socks the aliens in the 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.539
 base with the yes without blue flame but 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.160
 four pieces on the number that is called here 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:59.639
 it'll rattle right away and 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.970
 so nothing more furious opening of lag 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.590
 with animals and very very aggressive 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.080
 played by him and that has become 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.840
 paid off with the drop and the bunker 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.699
 here in the my base of sock that can 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.260
 yes only really fantastic 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.210
 So I'm looking forward to the next one 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.039
 let's go ahead with it 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.530
 Game number two of the 30 100 challenge 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:24.349
 and play number two between etienne 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.349
 sock and until then
