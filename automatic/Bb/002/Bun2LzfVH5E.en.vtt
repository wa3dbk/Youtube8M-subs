00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
synchronous five ball pattern you see a

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.709 
synchronous five ball pattern you see a
lot<00:00:07.830> people<00:00:08.460> do<00:00:08.760> it<00:00:08.880> all<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.179> time

people<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:13.049> have<00:00:13.170> just<00:00:13.380> learned<00:00:13.620> five<00:00:13.860> balls

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
people that have just learned five balls

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.410 
people that have just learned five balls
and<00:00:14.370> want<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.580> learn<00:00:14.670> some<00:00:14.880> tricks

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
and want to learn some tricks

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.840 
and want to learn some tricks
this<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.320> often<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.859> one<00:00:17.100> that's<00:00:17.400> then

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
this is often a one that's then

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.890 
this is often a one that's then
immediately<00:00:18.060> pointed<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:19.160> now<00:00:20.160> if<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.689> want

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
to immediately be able to do this it's

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.870 
to immediately be able to do this it's
not<00:00:24.930> gonna<00:00:25.109> happen<00:00:25.400> you<00:00:26.400> know<00:00:26.490> you're<00:00:26.760> gonna

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
not gonna happen you know you're gonna

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.400 
not gonna happen you know you're gonna
have<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.150> work<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.539> couple<00:00:27.689> months<00:00:27.990> at<00:00:28.230> it

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
have to work a couple months at it

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.209 
have to work a couple months at it
unless<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.010> you're<00:00:30.080> 13<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.410> can<00:00:32.040> pick

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
unless you know you're 13 and can pick

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.810 
unless you know you're 13 and can pick
up<00:00:32.399> stuff<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.030> do<00:00:33.270> it

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
up stuff and just do it

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.270 
up stuff and just do it
but<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.390> took<00:00:36.630> me<00:00:36.840> probably<00:00:37.219> six<00:00:38.219> months

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
but it it took me probably six months

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.060 
but it it took me probably six months
before<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.910> could<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.420> would<00:00:40.200> consider<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.680> had<00:00:40.950> it

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
before I could I would consider I had it

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.729 
before I could I would consider I had it
remotely<00:00:41.879> solid<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:43.040> don't<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.489> is

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
remotely solid I don't have it is

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.430 
remotely solid I don't have it is
consistent<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:46.829> I'd<00:00:47.010> like<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.280> still<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.440> it's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
consistent as I'd like it still and it's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.360 
consistent as I'd like it still and it's
still<00:00:49.680> something<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.129> work<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:52.340> you<00:00:53.340> know

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
still something I work on so you know

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.150 
still something I work on so you know
it's<00:00:53.820> not<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> faint<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.750> heart<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.320> know

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
it's not for the faint of heart you know

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.770 
it's not for the faint of heart you know
if<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.489> don't<00:00:56.610> want<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.969> if<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.329> want<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.570> trick

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
if you don't want to if you want a trick

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.299 
if you don't want to if you want a trick
that<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.960> don't<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.530> learn<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.219> know

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that you don't have to learn you know

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.389 
that you don't have to learn you know
for<00:00:59.609> months<00:00:59.870> you<00:01:00.870> know<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.230> look<00:01:02.219> for

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
for months you know just look for

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.780 
for months you know just look for
something<00:01:02.579> else<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.390> for<00:01:03.629> up<00:01:04.790> you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
something else like one up for up you

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.140 
something else like one up for up you
know<00:01:05.909> stuff<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.450> okay<00:01:07.820> now<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:08.880> those

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
know stuff like that okay now for those

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.000 
know stuff like that okay now for those
of<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.600> are<00:01:09.720> still<00:01:09.930> interested<00:01:13.010> over

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
of you that are still interested over

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.539 
of you that are still interested over
here<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.700> right<00:01:15.259> I've<00:01:16.259> put<00:01:16.650> some<00:01:16.890> links<00:01:17.189> up

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
here on the right I've put some links up

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.780 
here on the right I've put some links up
to<00:01:18.140> juggling<00:01:19.140> Lab<00:01:19.320> which<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> site<00:01:20.490> swap

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
to juggling Lab which is a site swap

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.190 
to juggling Lab which is a site swap
simulator<00:01:21.330> okay<00:01:23.600> there<00:01:24.600> will<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.750> several

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
simulator okay there will be several

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.230 
simulator okay there will be several
siteswaps<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.189> are<00:01:26.280> animated<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:27.060> those

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
siteswaps that are animated in those

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.810 
siteswaps that are animated in those
links<00:01:27.799> that'll<00:01:28.799> help<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.159> get<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.549> where<00:01:29.610> you

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
links that'll help you get to where you

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.450 
links that'll help you get to where you
can<00:01:30.000> learn<00:01:30.259> this<00:01:31.259> trick<00:01:31.560> 6x4<00:01:32.780> I'm<00:01:33.780> gonna<00:01:33.990> do

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
can learn this trick 6x4 I'm gonna do

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.179 
can learn this trick 6x4 I'm gonna do
most<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.670> these<00:01:35.759> sites<00:01:36.060> swaps<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> video

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
most of these sites swaps in the video

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.940 
most of these sites swaps in the video
but<00:01:38.659> sometimes<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.960> nice<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
but sometimes it's nice to just have the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.880 
but sometimes it's nice to just have the
simulator<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.970> I'm<00:01:42.090> putting<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.509> there<00:01:42.720> just

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
simulator so I'm putting it there just

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.090 
simulator so I'm putting it there just
just<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.040> those<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.399> them<00:01:44.549> want<00:01:44.759> that

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
just for those of you them want that

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.100 
just for those of you them want that
okay<00:01:47.100> six<00:01:47.399> six<00:01:47.610> four<00:01:47.820> four<00:01:48.090> six<00:01:48.329> six<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.930> is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
okay six six four four six six this is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.240 
okay six six four four six six this is
what<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.380> looks<00:01:49.590> like

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
what it looks like

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.270 
what it looks like
okay<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.960> synchronous<00:01:52.409> fireball<00:01:52.860> pattern

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
okay the synchronous fireball pattern

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.770 
okay the synchronous fireball pattern
it's<00:01:53.729> awkward<00:01:54.299> because<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.110> know<00:01:55.350> you've<00:01:55.950> got

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
it's awkward because you know you've got

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.330 
it's awkward because you know you've got
an<00:01:57.780> odd<00:01:58.229> number<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.710> balls<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.219> you're

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
an odd number of balls and you're

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.859 
an odd number of balls and you're
throwing<00:01:59.549> them<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.969> synchronous<00:02:00.450> pattern

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
throwing them in a synchronous pattern

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.260 
throwing them in a synchronous pattern
it's<00:02:01.590> really<00:02:02.219> weird<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.700> first<00:02:02.729> few<00:02:03.090> times

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
it's really weird the first few times

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.560 
it's really weird the first few times
okay<00:02:03.719> start<00:02:04.140> with<00:02:04.200> three<00:02:04.530> balls<00:02:05.360> this<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.540> a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
okay start with three balls this is a

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.380 
okay start with three balls this is a
first<00:02:06.899> pattern<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.680> really<00:02:08.280> long<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
first pattern it's really long on the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.140 
first pattern it's really long on the
side<00:02:09.569> swap<00:02:10.129> but<00:02:11.129> it's<00:02:11.250> only<00:02:11.430> three<00:02:11.730> balls<00:02:11.940> so

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
side swap but it's only three balls so

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
side swap but it's only three balls so
it's<00:02:12.180> not<00:02:12.720> as<00:02:12.959> hard<00:02:13.170> as<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.440> think

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
it's not as hard as you think

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.839 
it's not as hard as you think
okay<00:02:15.330> here's<00:02:16.330> what<00:02:16.569> it<00:02:16.660> looks<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:17.849> basically

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
okay here's what it looks like basically

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.089 
okay here's what it looks like basically
you<00:02:19.030> throw<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.300> 6x4<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.380> then<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.590> throw<00:02:20.890> a

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
you throw a 6x4 and then you throw a

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.940 
you throw a 6x4 and then you throw a
four<00:02:21.489> under<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.120> six<00:02:22.440> that's<00:02:23.440> all<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:23.890> okay

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
four under the six that's all it is okay

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.890 
four under the six that's all it is okay
next<00:02:26.950> we<00:02:27.190> move<00:02:27.370> on<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.550> little<00:02:27.760> bit<00:02:27.880> harder<00:02:28.360> but

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
next we move on a little bit harder but

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.130 
next we move on a little bit harder but
this<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.290> gonna<00:02:29.440> be<00:02:29.910> more<00:02:30.910> like<00:02:30.970> what<00:02:31.510> six<00:02:31.930> x

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
this is gonna be more like what six x

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.710 
this is gonna be more like what six x
four<00:02:32.350> is<00:02:32.380> gonna<00:02:32.680> feel<00:02:32.950> like<00:02:33.160> okay<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:36.720> little

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
four is gonna feel like okay a little

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.570 
four is gonna feel like okay a little
bit<00:02:37.840> harder<00:02:38.200> but<00:02:38.290> not<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.890> whole<00:02:39.130> lot<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.459> know

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
bit harder but not a whole lot you know

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.610 
bit harder but not a whole lot you know
we're<00:02:39.790> still<00:02:39.970> only<00:02:40.150> three<00:02:40.360> balls<00:02:40.630> okay<00:02:41.350> here's

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
we're still only three balls okay here's

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.620 
we're still only three balls okay here's
a<00:02:41.709> four<00:02:42.010> ball<00:02:42.190> version<00:02:42.640> you're<00:02:42.910> gonna<00:02:43.030> do<00:02:43.269> is<00:02:43.390> 6

a four ball version you're gonna do is 6
X<00:02:43.840> 4<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:44.200> then<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.319> kind<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.370> box<00:02:45.640> maneuver

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
X 4 and then a kind of a box maneuver

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.900 
X 4 and then a kind of a box maneuver
start<00:02:47.709> with<00:02:47.830> four<00:02:48.190> ball<00:02:48.400> synchronous

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
start with four ball synchronous

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.240 
start with four ball synchronous
fountain<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.420> just<00:02:49.569> try<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.810> do<00:02:50.019> one<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:51.160> know

okay<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.380> then<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.069> can<00:03:06.100> try<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.489> running<00:03:06.880> it

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
okay and then you can try it running it

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.509 
okay and then you can try it running it
one-sided<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:11.140> this<00:03:11.380> is<00:03:11.530> what<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:12.100> know<00:03:12.190> good

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
one-sided and this is what you know good

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.080 
one-sided and this is what you know good
and<00:03:12.610> round<00:03:12.819> of<00:03:12.940> one<00:03:13.150> side<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.600> would<00:03:13.720> be<00:03:18.060> okay

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
and round of one side it would be okay

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.449 
and round of one side it would be okay
this<00:03:19.390> time<00:03:19.660> it's<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.709> little<00:03:20.739> bit<00:03:21.010> harder

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
this time it's a little bit harder

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.550 
this time it's a little bit harder
you're<00:03:22.269> gonna<00:03:22.420> it's<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.720> same<00:03:22.959> trick<00:03:23.230> but

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
you're gonna it's the same trick but

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.349 
you're gonna it's the same trick but
we're<00:03:23.739> gonna<00:03:23.859> put<00:03:24.640> both<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.850> them<00:03:25.120> in<00:03:25.180> there

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
we're gonna put both of them in there

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.210 
we're gonna put both of them in there
you<00:03:25.390> did<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.780> 6<00:03:25.989> X<00:03:26.170> 4<00:03:26.380> with<00:03:26.590> your<00:03:26.769> right<00:03:27.010> hand

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
you did the 6 X 4 with your right hand

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.360 
you did the 6 X 4 with your right hand
and<00:03:27.430> then<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.609> 6<00:03:27.850> X<00:03:28.000> 4<00:03:28.209> with<00:03:28.390> your<00:03:28.420> left<00:03:28.720> hand

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
and then the 6 X 4 with your left hand

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.190 
and then the 6 X 4 with your left hand
well<00:03:30.370> leading<00:03:30.670> with<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.390> know<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.750> left<00:03:31.959> hand

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
well leading with you know you left hand

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.849 
well leading with you know you left hand
ok<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:34.150> one<00:03:34.420> I<00:03:34.450> think<00:03:34.750> feels<00:03:34.959> more<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:35.350> 6<00:03:35.680> X

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
ok this one I think feels more like 6 X

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.729 
ok this one I think feels more like 6 X
4<00:03:36.070> than<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.400> other<00:03:36.519> 4<00:03:36.820> ball<00:03:37.000> pattern<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.739> this

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
4 than the other 4 ball pattern and this

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.880 
4 than the other 4 ball pattern and this
is<00:03:38.890> what<00:03:39.070> it<00:03:39.160> looks<00:03:39.370> like<00:03:39.459> I<00:03:40.769> remember<00:03:41.769> these

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
is what it looks like I remember these

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.289 
is what it looks like I remember these
siteswaps<00:03:42.400> are<00:03:42.549> going<00:03:42.670> to<00:03:42.730> be<00:03:42.820> on<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.060> side

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
siteswaps are going to be on the side

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.690 
siteswaps are going to be on the side
for<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.079> look<00:03:44.290> at<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:44.739> try<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.340> imitate

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
for you to look at and try and imitate

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.870 
for you to look at and try and imitate
so<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:47.859> know<00:03:47.920> make<00:03:48.130> sure<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.459> make<00:03:48.609> use<00:03:48.850> of

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
so you know make sure to make use of

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.449 
so you know make sure to make use of
those<00:03:49.150> simulators<00:03:49.930> ok<00:03:50.799> here's<00:03:51.070> a<00:03:51.130> couple

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
those simulators ok here's a couple

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.120 
those simulators ok here's a couple
transitions<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:53.109> know<00:03:53.200> it's<00:03:53.410> an<00:03:53.530> excited

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
transitions you know it's an excited

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.740 
transitions you know it's an excited
state<00:03:54.160> siteswap<00:03:55.060> so<00:03:55.239> you<00:03:55.329> can't<00:03:55.570> go<00:03:55.690> straight

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
state siteswap so you can't go straight

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.960 
state siteswap so you can't go straight
into<00:03:56.350> it<00:03:56.440> from<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.680> Cascade<00:03:57.160> you're<00:03:57.760> going<00:03:57.910> to

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
into it from the Cascade you're going to

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.410 
into it from the Cascade you're going to
one<00:03:58.269> up<00:03:58.390> for<00:03:58.690> up<00:03:58.870> into<00:03:59.140> 6<00:03:59.380> X<00:03:59.590> 4<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.280> then<00:04:00.970> you

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
one up for up into 6 X 4 and then you

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.110 
one up for up into 6 X 4 and then you
know<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.690> get<00:04:01.989> out<00:04:02.140> of<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:03.150> can<00:04:04.150> do<00:04:05.069> the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
know to get out of it you can do the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.580 
know to get out of it you can do the
multiplex<00:04:07.120> cascade<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:07.930> then<00:04:08.049> go<00:04:08.170> back<00:04:08.380> into

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
multiplex cascade and then go back into

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.940 
multiplex cascade and then go back into
the<00:04:08.709> 5<00:04:09.130> ball<00:04:09.340> cascade<00:04:09.959> ok<00:04:10.959> that's<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.590> cheaters

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
the 5 ball cascade ok that's a cheaters
