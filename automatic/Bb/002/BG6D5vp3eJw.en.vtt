00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.790
 unqualified meaning has changed

 yeah and I turned offensive rimark 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.200
 honoring the background and the form 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.400
 and that's great because you play 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.950
 with no but it's really serious 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.479
 then 1999 the code of honor 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.240
 in 2001 life before death 2004 the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.399
 pride of our 2005 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.320
 beyond my limits 2008 the code of 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:36.420
 honor the code of horror and so 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.880
 the padre of rap is your seventh album 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.460
 yeah it starts to do a lot for 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.130
 a renewal discography is 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:50.250
 passed for me i do not do enough awards 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:55.789
 often do wikipedia there is a crowd 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.869
 information is the true of the false 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.390
 2008 was frankly the year of the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.240
 consecration because the thing has exposed 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.069
 way was not the same thing but in 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.310
 favorite years was better memory 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:10.019
 finally the album that touched you the most 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.170
 you had the most I do not know to count 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.299
 that the audience at the professional level 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.810
 pushes them all by asking them for their 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.849
 highlights 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.870
 I can not really choose because 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:24.420
 it's like choosing one of your children 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:27.120
 his two because they were written in va 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.709
 with the quiver at least 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.329
 albums it's a bit of pictures like 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.060
 this visit moralizing moments 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.100
 lived in this period of that me the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.720
 pride of ours corresponds to 2003 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.540
 2004 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.840
 code of honor at 998 39 I had 22 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.520
 years I think wake I can not I can 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.770
 not really chosen but so how 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.320
 how do we go from 2 of a 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.220
 feeling that was in 1998 an album that 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.640
 fate in 2008 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.650
 I say that it has matured what would be low 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.660
 pity for me do not respect 90 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.340
 no but we evolve we evolve in the ain 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.560
 but artists but not only 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.560
 rappers one is two artists have evolved 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.000
 in his time with the skill this at 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.310
 rhythm of the world time and worked 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000

 toulouse no but you have a good shot 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.150
 heart or under holster I think it's 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.950
 an end it is a woman who speak 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.720
 between them 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.650

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.770

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.170
 female artist who sees this time no
