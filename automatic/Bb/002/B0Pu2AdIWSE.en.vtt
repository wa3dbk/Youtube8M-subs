 tv point and slabs br and recommends all 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.230

 how will you improve your 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.810
 there are some topics with 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.060
 I separated first to prepare your brain 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.460
 your body change your perception of time 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.800
 control the mate making play to 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.800
 beat the hardy trai and be flexible 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.809
 preparing your brain to have a good 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.680
 daily sleep a good ventilation where you 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.739
 are playing 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.600
 stay hydrated if you feed well and 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.700
 practice the exercise in the morning 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.280
 If you do, your brain is better. 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.530
 today is generated and its time you have 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.510
 Throwing your brain will think - no 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.850
 your body and will focus more on the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.220
 change your perception of time to play without 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.049
 stopping is not always the best way to 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.330
 League up so a lot of people have already seen 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.640
 play play play is not half what it is 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.560
 wrong to think that the game is 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.750
 win or lose and starts to think about 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.330
 game how to win i will learn then i wanted 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.450
 that the word lost its conception of 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.409
 game and then there is what I recommend to 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.860
 you 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.509
 read several guides see some videos 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.600
 like the one you 're seeing 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.179
 see the statistics site think about 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.009
 that do what not to do your next 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:39.990
 so enjoy your time to do 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.030
 this with simple time of a defeat 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.369
 You can learn things that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.050
 transformed into a defeat in victory 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.210
 so if you think you want 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.369
 improve and go there I could be 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.259
 Losing now I'm going to take this time and 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.509
 I'm going to study something from a serious legend. 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.149
 So you 're already earning time and who? 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:03.690
 knows how to win but his matches in the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:05.550
 future between the parties so what 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.170
 You do when the match ends and you 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.270
 will start the other 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.800
 rest between four and ten minutes 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.780
 between each match 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.730
 drink the water as a fruit or any 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.900
 food make your needs 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.200
 physiological 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.910
 reflect the shit in the last game and 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.459
 reflect on what you might have done to 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.489
 change the result or what you did 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:31.020
 to be crucial to that victory or 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.900
 for that result exit the screen 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.120
 selections as well is the famous dodge 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.129
 if you realize that serving is impossible 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.050
 with your team on the selection screen for a 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.720
 or more reasons as the player touches the 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.849
 weak composition tropics etc 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.310
 does not exist to exit the selection screen 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.400
 played game high turnover rate 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.709
 route can frustrate titles and 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.849
 stress and consequently harm 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.430
 your upcoming games 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.769
 then you enter the game you're already 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.879
 I lost to lose anger at your 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.760
 upcoming games and will be influenced by 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.950
 by your past gameplay and then you 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.110
 you will lose not only that game you can 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.930
 lose the next ones too so it's 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.840
 you better leave this screen 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.480
 selections you lose few 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.819
 others league but do not lose it puts me hot 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.860
 or you will miss him three some 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.349
 pdl dots 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.300
 but as a consequence you do not lose cmr 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.800
 consequently his next game he 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.080
 It's too late 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.090
 so I'm going to get more points earning 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.819
 the future games you win do not get 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.549
 worries about this pdl that you lose 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.650
 remember brandoni do not abandon games if 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.739
 you have m of 3,005 and you have the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.810
 defeat and the escape time he reserves 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.590
 after 16 hours I recommend everything there 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.870
 the world to have at least two 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.000
 edit the selections per day until difficult 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.000
 leave five minutes 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.530
 It's difficult to leave again 15 minutes and then 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.629
 You wait for your fifteen 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.459
 minutes of game again the third escape 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.280
 already half complicated that the 60 minutes 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.829
 so there's nothing like you there 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.959
 calculate well when you're going to run away 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.959
 of sections or compositions with a 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.790
 control the med make then what is the met 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.019
 making and how to control this system I 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.820
 I solved it for you 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.109
 the netbook is the following any player 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.539
 called elect 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.130
 He has the led vegetable tries to make it 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.370
 this player has a victory rate of 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:31.139
 52 per 100 that is it will put you 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.060
 with players to control this rate 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.490
 your win to prevent players from 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.050
 have very high victories and 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.020
 to prevent players without the 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.930
 defeat very low the rate of defeating the 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.820
 then he does he puts players 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.860
 who lost along with players who 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.200
 lost and places players who have won 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.060
 with players who won and when you 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.800
 is earning a lot and puts you with 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.639
 players who lost to you did not 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.169
 shoot 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.090
 so basically this then as what 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.970
 You control it, come on. 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.520
 If you're earning enjoy and making 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.560
 and is that he is wanting you to win 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.210
 simply take a short break 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.250
 between the game again or it will 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.060
 put a stripe in the sequence of 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.880
 victories 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.860
 He'll stay the way I can talk. 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.479
 with pride of yourself and it goes 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.300
 be happy is what is is 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.400
 Reward long neck consequently 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.979
 There's a bad side you got to lose. 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.039
 You lost again, right? 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.280
 stop for a longer break you have to 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.960
 fall 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.960
 catch the next game then you have to 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.060
 prepare and prepare the mind for the body 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.690
 after a long pause the mop usually 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.480
 return to the winning position of 50% 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.000
 then the 50% win rate you have 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.110
 there a higher rate to win the next 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.690
 game 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.889
 if you do these tips here 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:52.919
 so much to leave the queues of quetta is 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:58.290
 date of the election as between the stop 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:06:00.180
 games while avoiding this sequence 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.919
 of defeat and victory sequence 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.470
 seize the sequence of victories you 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:07.080
 increase its winning rate and 52% 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.480
 1 55 56 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.610
 consequently you will raise your 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.880
 much faster queues 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.760
 will see playing to beat any 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.580
 Cost, then do everything to win. 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.740
 play with your fucker champion play 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.780
 with champions of high rate of victory 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.500
 so you have to search for websites 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.760
 statistics to find out which 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.479
 best champions beyond method 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.340
 usual but will be without pity it has 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:35.100
 your opponent team will kill him 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.410
 then no fair play in the ranking he does not 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.130
 has fair play is just what the viaduct already 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:43.850
 it was and there gei takes advantage when it has to 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.979
 have or someone fell on the other side 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:50.190
 Be flexible, huh? 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:51.870
 you have your well if looks have also 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.490
 its main champions 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.680
 so at the time you went to choose 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.180
 a boring healthy practice 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.789
 according to the code of invoking the pain who 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.669
 is above has the right to choose 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:05.190
 respect, that is not always the talk 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:08.910
 good inside the game maybe you end up 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:11.330
 someone tucano then avoid chats and use 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.770
 the more the pings we have the pings to 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.680
 that will help a lot 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.180
 did not give up the game quickly with 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.950
 time you 'll learn how 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.500
 transforming the few chances of success 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:25.289
 in more chances and who knows how to take your 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.419
 time for victory is in return the 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:29.700
 game is really lost 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.919
 The faster you give away 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.860
 better because you're going to avoid it 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:36.210
 more stress of that match and play - 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.280
 said the next 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.520
 if you 're playing it's not the tips 

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.830
 It has a chance of victory. 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.410
 call your team player does not have this 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.970
 sunk impossible 4 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.860
 the components weigh 20 kilos and carry a 

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:51.050
 inhibitor arrow , and lacks around 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.599
 but the crew 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.639
