there<00:00:05.509> are<00:00:05.690> a<00:00:05.779> number<00:00:05.839> of<00:00:06.170> camera<00:00:06.830> animation

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:07.009 
there are a number of camera animation

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.190 
there are a number of camera animation
schools<00:00:07.939> of<00:00:08.210> thought<00:00:08.420> out<00:00:08.450> there<00:00:08.660> that

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
schools of thought out there that

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.660 
schools of thought out there that
subscribe<00:00:09.620> to<00:00:09.650> the<00:00:09.799> view<00:00:10.010> that<00:00:10.219> it's<00:00:10.340> a<00:00:10.430> good

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
subscribe to the view that it's a good

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.910 
subscribe to the view that it's a good
idea<00:00:11.120> to<00:00:11.389> use<00:00:11.540> null<00:00:11.959> object<00:00:12.440> layers<00:00:12.650> to

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
idea to use null object layers to

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.830 
idea to use null object layers to
control<00:00:13.279> the<00:00:13.400> camera<00:00:13.820> now<00:00:14.389> I<00:00:14.420> don't

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
control the camera now I don't

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.630 
control the camera now I don't
necessarily<00:00:15.020> go<00:00:15.529> along<00:00:15.799> with<00:00:15.949> all<00:00:16.070> this<00:00:16.219> ideas

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
necessarily go along with all this ideas

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.830 
necessarily go along with all this ideas
I<00:00:16.699> think<00:00:16.789> there<00:00:16.970> are<00:00:17.029> a<00:00:17.060> couple<00:00:17.359> of<00:00:17.690> ideas

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
I think there are a couple of ideas

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.870 
I think there are a couple of ideas
within<00:00:18.380> there<00:00:18.560> that<00:00:18.710> are<00:00:18.830> worth<00:00:19.039> examining

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
within there that are worth examining

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.150 
within there that are worth examining
so<00:00:20.420> I'm<00:00:20.480> going<00:00:20.570> to<00:00:20.630> show<00:00:20.750> you<00:00:20.810> two<00:00:21.170> null<00:00:21.650> object

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
so I'm going to show you two null object

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.279 
so I'm going to show you two null object
camera<00:00:22.610> control<00:00:23.030> ideas<00:00:23.450> in<00:00:23.600> this<00:00:23.720> lesson<00:00:24.140> so

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
camera control ideas in this lesson so

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.320 
camera control ideas in this lesson so
go<00:00:24.410> to<00:00:24.470> working<00:00:24.770> files<00:00:25.010> cut<00:00:25.880> After<00:00:26.120> Effects

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
go to working files cut After Effects

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.150 
go to working files cut After Effects
projects<00:00:26.870> and<00:00:27.170> then<00:00:27.320> open<00:00:27.530> up<00:00:27.650> one<00:00:27.980> eight<00:00:28.130> zero

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
projects and then open up one eight zero

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.690 
projects and then open up one eight zero
for<00:00:28.640> animation<00:00:29.119> null

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
for animation null

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.400 
for animation null
okay<00:00:31.330> once<00:00:31.510> again<00:00:31.630> we're<00:00:31.900> going<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.080> animate

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
okay once again we're going to animate

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.870 
okay once again we're going to animate
around<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.950> scene<00:00:33.250> and<00:00:33.280> we're<00:00:33.610> going<00:00:33.730> to<00:00:33.790> do

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
around the scene and we're going to do

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.760 
around the scene and we're going to do
two<00:00:34.090> techniques<00:00:34.630> here<00:00:35.020> one<00:00:35.290> is<00:00:35.440> called<00:00:35.500> an

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
two techniques here one is called an

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.430 
two techniques here one is called an
orbit<00:00:36.220> null<00:00:36.700> so<00:00:37.300> let's<00:00:37.450> make<00:00:37.630> a<00:00:37.660> new<00:00:37.840> camera<00:00:38.140> by

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
orbit null so let's make a new camera by

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.120 
orbit null so let's make a new camera by
right-clicking<00:00:38.830> here<00:00:39.370> new<00:00:39.820> camera<00:00:40.950> take<00:00:41.950> the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
right-clicking here new camera take the

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.260 
right-clicking here new camera take the
previous<00:00:42.340> defaults<00:00:42.880> that<00:00:42.910> we've<00:00:43.090> been<00:00:43.150> doing

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
previous defaults that we've been doing

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.680 
previous defaults that we've been doing
to<00:00:43.840> node<00:00:44.080> 50<00:00:45.010> millimeters<00:00:45.460> oh<00:00:45.850> depth<00:00:46.330> of<00:00:46.480> field

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
to node 50 millimeters oh depth of field

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.930 
to node 50 millimeters oh depth of field
okay<00:00:47.080> but<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.100> want<00:00:48.340> to<00:00:48.430> do<00:00:48.520> is<00:00:48.610> I<00:00:48.699> want<00:00:48.850> to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
okay but I want to do is I want to

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.060 
okay but I want to do is I want to
rotate<00:00:49.150> this<00:00:49.629> camera<00:00:50.020> around<00:00:50.170> this<00:00:50.710> entire

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
rotate this camera around this entire

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.670 
rotate this camera around this entire
scene<00:00:51.489> and<00:00:51.790> to<00:00:52.480> do<00:00:52.690> that<00:00:52.930> with<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:53.410> selection

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
scene and to do that with the selection

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.650 
scene and to do that with the selection
tool<00:00:53.860> or<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:54.580> unified<00:00:54.850> camera<00:00:55.120> tool<00:00:55.239> or<00:00:55.480> some

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
tool or the unified camera tool or some

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.150 
tool or the unified camera tool or some
combination<00:00:55.900> of<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.290> above<00:00:56.320> is<00:00:56.710> pretty

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
combination of the above is pretty

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.670 
combination of the above is pretty
tricky<00:00:57.699> so<00:00:58.300> if<00:00:58.420> you're<00:00:58.540> going<00:00:58.840> to<00:00:59.170> do<00:00:59.379> that<00:00:59.559> if

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
tricky so if you're going to do that if

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.110 
tricky so if you're going to do that if
you're<00:00:59.800> going<00:00:59.890> to<00:00:59.949> take<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.129> camera<00:01:00.430> rotate<00:01:01.000> it

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
you're going to take a camera rotate it

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.509 
you're going to take a camera rotate it
around<00:01:01.239> a<00:01:01.510> scene<00:01:01.809> that's<00:01:02.530> when<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.100> orbit

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
around a scene that's when the orbit

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.270 
around a scene that's when the orbit
null<00:01:03.820> tool<00:01:04.120> comes<00:01:04.510> into<00:01:04.989> play<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.500> it's<00:01:06.040> used

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
null tool comes into play and it's used

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.850 
null tool comes into play and it's used
so<00:01:06.520> commonly<00:01:06.550> that<00:01:07.479> there<00:01:07.540> is<00:01:07.870> now<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:08.080> shortcut

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
so commonly that there is now a shortcut

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.560 
so commonly that there is now a shortcut
to<00:01:09.100> create<00:01:09.460> one<00:01:09.700> inside<00:01:10.060> After<00:01:10.360> Effects

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
to create one inside After Effects

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.840 
to create one inside After Effects
instead<00:01:10.900> of<00:01:10.990> doing<00:01:11.200> it<00:01:11.260> manually<00:01:11.680> so<00:01:12.670> just

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
instead of doing it manually so just

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.880 
instead of doing it manually so just
right<00:01:13.180> click<00:01:13.540> on<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:14.020> camera<00:01:14.290> layer<00:01:14.590> and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
right click on the camera layer and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.030 
right click on the camera layer and
select<00:01:15.490> camera<00:01:15.909> create<00:01:16.870> orbit<00:01:17.320> null<00:01:17.560> there

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
select camera create orbit null there

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.710 
select camera create orbit null there
you<00:01:18.159> go<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.460> now<00:01:18.580> you've<00:01:18.729> created<00:01:18.940> it<00:01:19.270> there's

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
you go and now you've created it there's

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.360 
you go and now you've created it there's
the<00:01:19.930> null<00:01:20.080> object<00:01:20.170> layer<00:01:20.560> there's<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.979> camera

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
the null object layer there's the camera

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.580 
the null object layer there's the camera
if<00:01:21.490> you<00:01:21.610> right<00:01:21.790> click<00:01:21.820> here<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:22.330> say<00:01:22.780> columns

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
if you right click here and say columns

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.460 
if you right click here and say columns
parent<00:01:24.430> you'll<00:01:25.330> see<00:01:25.510> that<00:01:25.659> this<00:01:25.930> camera<00:01:26.260> is

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
parent you'll see that this camera is

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.200 
parent you'll see that this camera is
parented<00:01:27.040> now<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.610> null<00:01:27.760> object<00:01:27.850> layer

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
parented now to the null object layer

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.620 
parented now to the null object layer
just<00:01:28.900> like<00:01:29.049> that<00:01:29.560> automatically<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.510> make

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
just like that automatically so to make

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.149 
just like that automatically so to make
this<00:01:31.780> thing<00:01:31.960> work<00:01:32.020> right<00:01:32.530> we<00:01:32.740> want<00:01:32.979> to<00:01:33.070> have

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
this thing work right we want to have

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.500 
this thing work right we want to have
the<00:01:33.280> null<00:01:33.460> object<00:01:33.490> layer<00:01:33.909> kind<00:01:34.150> of<00:01:34.299> be<00:01:34.390> in<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
the null object layer kind of be in the

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.230 
the null object layer kind of be in the
center<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.409> scene<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.159> I<00:01:36.640> know<00:01:36.700> this<00:01:36.969> boy

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
center of the scene and I know this boy

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.870 
center of the scene and I know this boy
is<00:01:37.420> about<00:01:37.450> four<00:01:38.170> thousand<00:01:38.829> pixels<00:01:39.039> back<00:01:39.520> from

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
is about four thousand pixels back from

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.580 
is about four thousand pixels back from
the<00:01:40.030> front<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.600> he's<00:01:40.750> about<00:01:41.049> what<00:01:41.350> nine

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
the front and he's about what nine

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.109 
the front and he's about what nine
thousand<00:01:42.070> pixels<00:01:42.250> let's<00:01:42.549> take<00:01:42.759> a<00:01:42.789> look<00:01:43.000> and

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
thousand pixels let's take a look and

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.899 
thousand pixels let's take a look and
see<00:01:43.359> boy<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:44.140> dog<00:01:44.409> we'll<00:01:45.159> just<00:01:45.430> click<00:01:45.579> on<00:01:45.729> him

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
see boy and dog we'll just click on him

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.029 
see boy and dog we'll just click on him
and<00:01:46.030> go<00:01:46.149> P<00:01:46.420> for<00:01:46.659> position<00:01:47.109> see<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:47.920> he's

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
and go P for position see that he's

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.849 
and go P for position see that he's
about<00:01:48.189> nine<00:01:48.340> thousand<00:01:48.939> pixels<00:01:49.149> back<00:01:49.659> on<00:01:50.530> up

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
about nine thousand pixels back on up

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.440 
about nine thousand pixels back on up
with<00:01:50.950> an<00:01:51.100> object<00:01:51.250> layer<00:01:51.640> right<00:01:51.850> around<00:01:52.030> forty

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
with an object layer right around forty

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.179 
with an object layer right around forty
five<00:01:52.600> hundred<00:01:52.630> pixels<00:01:53.170> back<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:53.799> it's<00:01:53.950> toward

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
five hundred pixels back so it's toward

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.249 
five hundred pixels back so it's toward
the<00:01:54.369> center<00:01:54.700> so<00:01:55.179> I<00:01:55.240> click<00:01:55.450> on<00:01:55.539> this<00:01:55.719> and<00:01:56.020> press

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
the center so I click on this and press

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.499 
the center so I click on this and press
P<00:01:56.560> for<00:01:56.770> position<00:01:57.219> I'm<00:01:57.850> going<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.090> type<00:01:58.270> in

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
P for position I'm going to type in

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.260 
P for position I'm going to type in
about<00:01:58.719> forty<00:01:59.109> five<00:01:59.259> hundred<00:01:59.320> here<00:01:59.829> for<00:01:59.979> this

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
about forty five hundred here for this

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.730 
about forty five hundred here for this
now<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.630> null<00:02:01.810> object<00:02:02.079> later<00:02:02.259> will<00:02:02.380> be<00:02:02.499> back

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
now that null object later will be back

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.599 
now that null object later will be back
where<00:02:03.009> it<00:02:03.100> belongs

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
where it belongs

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.819 
where it belongs
notice<00:02:04.179> it<00:02:04.299> carried<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.780> camera<00:02:05.229> back<00:02:05.469> with

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
notice it carried the camera back with

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.319 
notice it carried the camera back with
it<00:02:05.979> because<00:02:06.070> it's<00:02:06.249> connected<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.880> camera

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
it because it's connected to the camera

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.260 
it because it's connected to the camera
so<00:02:07.960> how<00:02:08.140> do<00:02:08.200> we<00:02:08.289> pull<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.710> camera<00:02:08.950> back<00:02:09.270> well

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
so how do we pull the camera back well

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.730 
so how do we pull the camera back well
this<00:02:10.390> may<00:02:10.570> seem<00:02:10.630> counterintuitive<00:02:11.110> but<00:02:11.590> you

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
this may seem counterintuitive but you

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.740 
this may seem counterintuitive but you
increase<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.460> null<00:02:12.640> object<00:02:12.670> layers<00:02:13.150> scale

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
increase the null object layers scale

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.840 
increase the null object layers scale
okay<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.560> could<00:02:14.830> use<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.190> camera<00:02:15.550> kind<00:02:15.790> of

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
okay you could use the camera kind of

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.950 
okay you could use the camera kind of
pull<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.060> back<00:02:16.210> that<00:02:16.360> way<00:02:16.510> but<00:02:16.660> it's<00:02:16.780> much

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
pull it back that way but it's much

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.360 
pull it back that way but it's much
easier<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.350> use<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.710> null<00:02:17.890> object<00:02:17.920> layers

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
easier to use the null object layers

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.480 
easier to use the null object layers
scale<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.690> click<00:02:19.870> on<00:02:19.960> null<00:02:20.230> press<00:02:20.560> shift<00:02:20.980> s<00:02:21.220> to

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
scale so click on null press shift s to

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.790 
scale so click on null press shift s to
add<00:02:21.610> scale<00:02:22.030> there<00:02:22.360> we<00:02:23.020> want<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.290> increase<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
add scale there we want to increase the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.170 
add scale there we want to increase the
scale<00:02:24.040> now<00:02:24.340> I'm<00:02:24.430> going<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.640> do<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:24.880> near<00:02:25.090> to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
scale now I'm going to do this near to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.400 
scale now I'm going to do this near to
see<00:02:25.390> what<00:02:25.540> happens<00:02:25.930> but<00:02:26.140> let<00:02:26.260> me<00:02:26.350> explain

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
see what happens but let me explain

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.040 
see what happens but let me explain
what's<00:02:26.890> going<00:02:26.950> on<00:02:27.220> here<00:02:27.460> if<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:28.630> think<00:02:28.900> that

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
what's going on here if you think that

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.590 
what's going on here if you think that
this<00:02:29.170> camera<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.770> at<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.190> end<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.760> long<00:02:31.060> pole

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
this camera is at the end of a long pole

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.170 
this camera is at the end of a long pole
pointing<00:02:32.590> into<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.920> scene<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:34.030> null

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
pointing into the scene and the null

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.820 
pointing into the scene and the null
object<00:02:34.210> layer<00:02:34.630> is<00:02:34.750> some<00:02:34.900> invisible<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.500> camera

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
object layer is some invisible a camera

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.100 
object layer is some invisible a camera
man<00:02:36.010> holding<00:02:36.520> on<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.850> pole<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:37.990> get

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
man holding on to that pole and you get

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.780 
man holding on to that pole and you get
a<00:02:38.140> sense<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.500> how<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.769> works<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.370> cameras

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
a sense of how this works the cameras

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.149 
a sense of how this works the cameras
being<00:02:40.000> controlled<00:02:40.599> from<00:02:41.019> deep<00:02:41.349> inside<00:02:41.620> the

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
being controlled from deep inside the

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.740 
being controlled from deep inside the
scene<00:02:42.430> but<00:02:42.670> it's<00:02:42.819> out<00:02:42.970> here<00:02:43.209> at<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.450> end<00:02:43.569> of<00:02:43.659> a

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
scene but it's out here at the end of a

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.309 
scene but it's out here at the end of a
stick

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
stick

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.259 
stick
and<00:02:44.439> it's<00:02:45.010> going<00:02:45.159> to<00:02:45.220> be<00:02:45.280> swinging<00:02:45.670> around<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
and it's going to be swinging around the

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.940 
and it's going to be swinging around the
entire<00:02:46.569> scene<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.170> now<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.319> want<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.560> open<00:02:47.620> up<00:02:47.830> a

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
entire scene so now I want to open up a

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.860 
entire scene so now I want to open up a
rotation<00:02:48.519> for<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.730> null<00:02:48.879> object<00:02:48.970> later<00:02:49.329> so

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
rotation for the null object later so

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.080 
rotation for the null object later so
they<00:02:49.959> go<00:02:50.110> EFT<00:02:50.560> are<00:02:50.829> for<00:02:51.010> rotation<00:02:51.519> of<00:02:51.700> course

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
they go EFT are for rotation of course

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.179 
they go EFT are for rotation of course
we<00:02:52.180> get<00:02:52.269> XY<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.810> Z<00:02:53.079> we<00:02:53.560> want<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.799> rotate<00:02:53.920> around

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:54.189 
we get XY and Z we want to rotate around

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.000 
we get XY and Z we want to rotate around
the<00:02:54.459> y<00:02:54.489> axis<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:55.299> vertical<00:02:55.659> axis<00:02:56.349> so<00:02:56.950> I'm

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
the y axis the vertical axis so I'm

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.059 
the y axis the vertical axis so I'm
gonna<00:02:57.129> put<00:02:57.310> keyframes<00:02:57.700> on<00:02:57.909> for<00:02:58.120> Y<00:02:58.980> going<00:02:59.980> a

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
gonna put keyframes on for Y going a

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.800 
gonna put keyframes on for Y going a
little<00:03:00.159> ways<00:03:00.280> here<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.909> well<00:03:01.510> let's<00:03:01.720> say

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
little ways here and well let's say

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.600 
little ways here and well let's say
rotate<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.290> twice<00:03:02.590> so<00:03:02.620> I'll<00:03:02.860> go<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.220> here<00:03:03.430> for

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
rotate it twice so I'll go to here for

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.699 
rotate it twice so I'll go to here for
2x<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.209> rotate<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.599> twice<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.110> click<00:03:05.230> away<00:03:05.379> I

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
2x to rotate it twice and click away I

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.559 
2x to rotate it twice and click away I
press<00:03:06.430> home<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.819> go<00:03:06.909> to<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.090> beginning<00:03:07.390> and

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
press home to go to the beginning and

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.960 
press home to go to the beginning and
now<00:03:08.319> we're<00:03:08.530> going<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.769> rotate<00:03:09.159> around<00:03:09.640> the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
now we're going to rotate around the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.309 
now we're going to rotate around the
entire<00:03:10.329> scene<00:03:10.720> we're<00:03:10.870> going<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.049> take<00:03:11.200> the

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
entire scene we're going to take the

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.990 
entire scene we're going to take the
camera<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.890> whip<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:12.099> around<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.609> outside<00:03:12.970> of

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
camera and whip it around the outside of

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.819 
camera and whip it around the outside of
the<00:03:13.180> seniors<00:03:13.599> here<00:03:13.840> we<00:03:13.900> go<00:03:14.049> we're<00:03:14.680> ripping

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
the seniors here we go we're ripping

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.680 
the seniors here we go we're ripping
around<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:15.459> scene<00:03:15.700> notice<00:03:15.970> how<00:03:16.090> I'll<00:03:16.299> set<00:03:16.659> it

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
around the scene notice how I'll set it

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.050 
around the scene notice how I'll set it
up<00:03:16.840> around<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.230> object<00:03:17.739> layer<00:03:17.890> there<00:03:18.099> as<00:03:18.220> if

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
up around the object layer there as if

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.869 
up around the object layer there as if
it<00:03:19.209> were<00:03:19.329> on<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.480> long<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:20.019> visible<00:03:20.379> stick<00:03:20.879> and

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
it were on a long and visible stick and

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.039 
it were on a long and visible stick and
that's<00:03:21.970> how<00:03:22.180> that<00:03:22.239> works<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.780> as<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:22.930> go

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
that's how that works and as you go

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.500 
that's how that works and as you go
along<00:03:23.170> here<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:23.650> course<00:03:23.920> if<00:03:24.639> you<00:03:24.790> want<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.120> take

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
along here of course if you want to take

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.140 
along here of course if you want to take
your<00:03:25.690> camera<00:03:25.989> tool<00:03:26.409> and<00:03:26.709> then<00:03:27.340> change<00:03:27.639> its<00:03:27.909> Y

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
your camera tool and then change its Y

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.729 
your camera tool and then change its Y
value<00:03:28.599> lift<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.930> up<00:03:29.049> bring<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.290> down<00:03:29.530> whatever

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
value lift it up bring it down whatever

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.920 
value lift it up bring it down whatever
you<00:03:29.980> can<00:03:30.099> animate<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.639> separately<00:03:31.269> from<00:03:31.629> the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
you can animate that separately from the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.250 
you can animate that separately from the
spinning<00:03:32.530> object<00:03:32.980> layer<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:34.209> that's<00:03:34.420> one<00:03:34.930> use

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
spinning object layer so that's one use

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.990 
spinning object layer so that's one use
of<00:03:35.470> an<00:03:35.560> object<00:03:35.980> layer<00:03:36.129> when<00:03:36.549> you're<00:03:36.670> working

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
of an object layer when you're working

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.369 
of an object layer when you're working
with<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.209> camera<00:03:37.450> I'm<00:03:37.720> going<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.019> get<00:03:38.170> rid<00:03:38.349> of

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
with the camera I'm going to get rid of

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.599 
with the camera I'm going to get rid of
that<00:03:38.530> though<00:03:38.680> now<00:03:38.859> by<00:03:39.040> selecting<00:03:39.099> and

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
that though now by selecting and

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.119 
that though now by selecting and
pressing<00:03:39.639> delete<00:03:40.349> there's<00:03:41.349> one<00:03:41.650> other<00:03:41.859> use

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
pressing delete there's one other use

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.800 
pressing delete there's one other use
for<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.459> null<00:03:42.639> object<00:03:42.670> layer<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.329> that<00:03:43.480> is<00:03:43.659> to

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
for the null object layer and that is to

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.839 
for the null object layer and that is to
connect<00:03:44.139> an<00:03:44.260> object<00:03:44.709> layer<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.489> point<00:03:45.760> of

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
connect an object layer to the point of

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.190 
connect an object layer to the point of
interest<00:03:46.090> because<00:03:46.359> the<00:03:46.629> point<00:03:46.840> of<00:03:46.930> interest

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
interest because the point of interest

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.110 
interest because the point of interest
is<00:03:47.409> hard<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.950> see<00:03:48.220> sometimes<00:03:48.760> because<00:03:49.000> it

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
is hard to see sometimes because it

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.970 
is hard to see sometimes because it
blends<00:03:49.449> in<00:03:49.750> with<00:03:49.959> all<00:03:50.169> the<00:03:50.260> other<00:03:50.410> keyframes

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
blends in with all the other keyframes

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.129 
blends in with all the other keyframes
and<00:03:51.220> it's<00:03:51.609> the<00:03:51.730> same<00:03:51.970> color<00:03:52.329> as<00:03:52.599> the<00:03:52.780> camera

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
and it's the same color as the camera

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.140 
and it's the same color as the camera
track<00:03:53.410> so<00:03:54.220> I'm<00:03:54.280> going<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.489> open<00:03:54.549> up<00:03:54.669> the<00:03:54.819> camera

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
track so I'm going to open up the camera

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.369 
track so I'm going to open up the camera
just<00:03:55.299> to<00:03:55.419> show<00:03:55.599> you<00:03:55.660> that<00:03:55.720> I'll<00:03:56.019> go<00:03:56.169> over<00:03:56.199> here

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
just to show you that I'll go over here

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.849 
just to show you that I'll go over here
to<00:03:56.440> two<00:03:56.739> views<00:03:57.129> like<00:03:57.790> this<00:03:58.030> and<00:03:58.709> I'll<00:03:59.709> just

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
to two views like this and I'll just

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.289 
to two views like this and I'll just
click<00:04:00.069> on<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.280> camera<00:04:00.639> so<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:00.819> can<00:04:00.940> see<00:04:01.209> it

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
click on the camera so you can see it

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.879 
click on the camera so you can see it
here<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:01.629> there's<00:04:01.840> that<00:04:02.049> little<00:04:02.230> purple<00:04:02.500> line

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
here and there's that little purple line

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.949 
here and there's that little purple line
if<00:04:03.489> i<00:04:03.549> zoom<00:04:03.579> out<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:04.030> bit<00:04:04.090> by<00:04:04.359> going<00:04:04.599> to<00:04:04.660> control

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
if i zoom out a bit by going to control

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.720 
if i zoom out a bit by going to control
-<00:04:05.199> there<00:04:05.560> let's<00:04:06.069> click<00:04:06.220> on<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.400> camera<00:04:06.699> again

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
- there let's click on the camera again

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.089 
- there let's click on the camera again
and<00:04:07.299> boy<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.199> point<00:04:08.379> of<00:04:08.440> interest<00:04:08.620> is<00:04:08.739> way<00:04:08.980> up

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
and boy the point of interest is way up

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.319 
and boy the point of interest is way up
there<00:04:09.220> because<00:04:09.310> that's<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.609> last<00:04:09.819> place<00:04:10.150> we

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
there because that's the last place we

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.360 
there because that's the last place we
used<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:10.720> so<00:04:11.410> sometimes<00:04:11.799> if<00:04:11.949> it's<00:04:12.069> let's<00:04:12.310> say

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
used it so sometimes if it's let's say

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.830 
used it so sometimes if it's let's say
move<00:04:12.609> someplace<00:04:12.940> else<00:04:13.180> if<00:04:13.389> we<00:04:13.449> got<00:04:13.599> it<00:04:13.720> down

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
move someplace else if we got it down

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.599 
move someplace else if we got it down
here<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.139> it's<00:04:14.290> tucked<00:04:14.650> away<00:04:14.799> inside<00:04:15.160> the

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
here and it's tucked away inside the

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.879 
here and it's tucked away inside the
camera<00:04:16.049> let's<00:04:17.049> say<00:04:17.169> you're<00:04:17.320> near<00:04:17.650> one<00:04:17.859> of

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
camera let's say you're near one of

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.770 
camera let's say you're near one of
these<00:04:18.039> points<00:04:18.519> it's<00:04:19.030> kind<00:04:19.209> of<00:04:19.269> hard<00:04:19.449> to<00:04:19.510> pick

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
these points it's kind of hard to pick

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.330 
these points it's kind of hard to pick
it<00:04:19.930> out<00:04:20.109> sometimes<00:04:20.620> from<00:04:20.889> all<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.099> various

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
it out sometimes from all the various

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.610 
it out sometimes from all the various
keyframes<00:04:21.760> as<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.090> make<00:04:22.270> a<00:04:22.300> track<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.530> to

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
keyframes as you make a track so to

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.020 
keyframes as you make a track so to
simplify<00:04:23.949> that<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.370> can<00:04:24.520> create<00:04:24.760> a<00:04:24.820> null

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
simplify that you can create a null

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.760 
simplify that you can create a null
object<00:04:25.060> layer<00:04:25.539> and<00:04:25.750> then<00:04:25.840> use<00:04:25.990> an<00:04:26.139> expression

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
object layer and then use an expression

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.770 
object layer and then use an expression
to<00:04:26.919> connect<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.550> camera<00:04:27.970> point<00:04:28.419> of<00:04:28.510> interest

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
to connect the camera point of interest

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.870 
to connect the camera point of interest
to<00:04:28.990> that<00:04:29.199> no<00:04:29.320> object<00:04:29.710> layer<00:04:29.860> so<00:04:30.610> on<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:30.729> right

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
to that no object layer so on the right

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.170 
to that no object layer so on the right
click<00:04:31.060> here<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.300> say<00:04:31.780> new<00:04:32.610> null<00:04:33.610> object<00:04:33.639> there

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
click here and say new null object there

interest it's important to do that it's

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.990 
interest it's important to do that it's
best<00:04:47.770> to<00:04:47.860> get<00:04:47.979> that<00:04:48.159> thing<00:04:48.310> connected<00:04:48.849> to

best to get that thing connected to
exactly<00:04:49.389> where<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.599> point<00:04:49.810> of<00:04:49.840> interest<00:04:50.050> is

exactly where the point of interest is

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.950 
exactly where the point of interest is
now<00:04:50.590> so<00:04:51.159> it's<00:04:51.280> more<00:04:51.430> intuitive<00:04:51.760> later<00:04:52.120> so<00:04:52.870> I'm

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
now so it's more intuitive later so I'm

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.480 
now so it's more intuitive later so I'm
going<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.110> wave<00:04:53.530> interest<00:04:53.860> for<00:04:53.979> the<00:04:54.039> camera<00:04:54.370> by

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
going to wave interest for the camera by

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.909 
going to wave interest for the camera by

going a which is Anchor Point normally

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.100 
going a which is Anchor Point normally

there<00:06:04.889> it<00:06:05.009> is<00:06:05.190> it's<00:06:06.029> easy<00:06:06.210> to<00:06:06.360> pick<00:06:06.599> that<00:06:06.810> out

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020

from the background layer it's probably

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.890 
from the background layer it's probably
better<00:06:08.729> to<00:06:08.909> use<00:06:09.000> something<00:06:09.180> besides<00:06:09.360> blue

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
better to use something besides blue

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.480 
better to use something besides blue
since<00:06:10.169> that<00:06:10.349> more<00:06:10.560> or<00:06:10.620> less<00:06:10.710> matches<00:06:11.190> we've

it's<00:06:16.110> easier<00:06:16.379> to<00:06:16.469> track<00:06:16.680> down<00:06:16.889> a<00:06:17.129> null<00:06:17.430> object

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
it's easier to track down a null object

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.700 
it's easier to track down a null object
layer<00:06:17.969> than<00:06:18.240> it<00:06:18.330> is<00:06:18.449> to<00:06:18.599> track<00:06:18.839> down<00:06:18.870> the<00:06:19.319> point
