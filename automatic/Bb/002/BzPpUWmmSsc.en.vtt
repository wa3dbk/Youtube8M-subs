you<00:02:44.630> can<00:02:44.810> get<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:44.989> feel<00:02:45.380> for<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.709> in<00:02:45.890> context<00:02:46.520> but

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
you can get a feel for it in context but

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.560 
you can get a feel for it in context but
I<00:02:46.670> just<00:02:46.820> want<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.000> show<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.239> couple

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
I just want to show you a couple

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.890 
I just want to show you a couple
different<00:02:47.720> tonal<00:02:48.140> options<00:02:48.680> right<00:02:48.920> now<00:02:48.950> it's

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
different tonal options right now it's

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.440 
different tonal options right now it's
set<00:02:50.900> at<00:02:51.110> about<00:02:51.200> about<00:02:51.890> three<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:52.820> a<00:02:52.910> half<00:02:52.940> it's

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
set at about about three and a half it's

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.210 
set at about about three and a half it's
got<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.600> little<00:02:53.780> knob<00:02:54.200> on<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.680> with<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.980> amount

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
got a little knob on it with the amount

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.550 
got a little knob on it with the amount
of<00:02:55.310> boost<00:02:55.519> that<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.910> need<00:02:56.180> with<00:02:56.750> there<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.410> it

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
of boost that you need with there is it

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.500 
of boost that you need with there is it
does<00:02:57.709> pull<00:02:57.980> out<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.459> does<00:02:58.610> have<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.820> kind<00:02:59.420> of

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
does pull out so it does have a kind of

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.949 
does pull out so it does have a kind of
extra<00:02:59.900> boost<00:03:00.170> thing<00:03:00.910> let's<00:03:01.910> click<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.330> in<00:03:02.540> just

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
extra boost thing let's click it in just

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:30.480 
extra boost thing let's click it in just
to<00:03:03.019> see<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.260> difference

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.950 

so<00:03:31.490> even<00:03:31.760> if<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:31.970> in<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.300> does<00:03:32.420> make<00:03:32.600> a<00:03:32.630> really

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
so even if it in it does make a really

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.690 
so even if it in it does make a really
like<00:03:33.110> subtle<00:03:33.500> nice<00:03:33.920> kind<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.310> difference

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
like subtle nice kind of difference

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.690 
like subtle nice kind of difference
alternatively<00:03:35.540> what<00:03:35.840> we<00:03:35.960> can<00:03:36.140> do<00:03:36.260> is<00:03:36.410> we<00:03:36.530> can

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
alternatively what we can do is we can

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.090 
alternatively what we can do is we can
crank<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:38.090> guy<00:03:38.240> up<00:03:38.600> a<00:03:38.810> lot<00:03:39.110> in<00:03:39.350> this<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:39.860> I'm

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
crank the guy up a lot in this and I'm

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.740 
crank the guy up a lot in this and I'm
gonna<00:03:40.340> need<00:03:40.520> to<00:03:40.640> adjust<00:03:40.760> my<00:03:41.030> aunt<00:03:41.300> volume

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
gonna need to adjust my aunt volume

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.900 
gonna need to adjust my aunt volume
because<00:03:41.990> it's<00:03:42.140> gonna<00:03:42.350> boost<00:03:42.890> you<00:03:43.670> know<00:03:43.790> the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
because it's gonna boost you know the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.340 
because it's gonna boost you know the
hell<00:03:44.060> out<00:03:44.240> of<00:03:44.270> the<00:03:44.450> signal<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:44.960> we<00:03:44.990> need<00:03:45.200> to

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
hell out of the signal so we need to

00:03:45.350 --> 00:04:01.800 
hell out of the signal so we need to
account<00:03:45.950> for<00:03:46.100> that

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.300 

right<00:04:02.810> now<00:04:02.960> this<00:04:03.110> guy's<00:04:03.320> completely<00:04:03.710> cranked

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
right now this guy's completely cranked

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.890 
right now this guy's completely cranked
this<00:04:04.460> is<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.700> most<00:04:05.000> boost<00:04:05.390> that<00:04:05.660> you're<00:04:05.810> gonna

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
this is the most boost that you're gonna

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.660 
this is the most boost that you're gonna
possibly<00:04:06.560> get<00:04:06.740> out<00:04:06.770> of<00:04:06.980> this<00:04:07.100> pedal<00:04:07.490> and<00:04:07.610> I

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
possibly get out of this pedal and I

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.130 
possibly get out of this pedal and I
have<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:07.970> aunt<00:04:08.120> accounted<00:04:08.690> so<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:08.870> might<00:04:08.990> be<00:04:09.110> a

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
have the aunt accounted so it might be a

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:39.149 
have the aunt accounted so it might be a
little<00:04:09.530> bit<00:04:09.680> softer<00:04:10.160> than<00:04:10.190> normal<00:04:10.670> but

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.859 

so<00:04:40.159> what<00:04:40.309> that's<00:04:40.429> doing<00:04:40.699> is<00:04:40.969> just<00:04:41.149> distorting

00:04:41.859 --> 00:04:41.869 
so what that's doing is just distorting

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:43.809 
so what that's doing is just distorting
the<00:04:41.989> front<00:04:42.229> end<00:04:42.379> of<00:04:42.499> the<00:04:42.589> amp<00:04:42.769> which<00:04:43.459> is<00:04:43.609> pretty

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
the front end of the amp which is pretty

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.429 
the front end of the amp which is pretty
cool<00:04:44.089> actually<00:04:44.389> I<00:04:44.779> mean<00:04:44.929> you<00:04:45.049> can<00:04:45.169> get<00:04:45.289> some

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:45.439 
cool actually I mean you can get some

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.289 
cool actually I mean you can get some
unique<00:04:45.709> sounds<00:04:46.219> out<00:04:46.369> of<00:04:46.489> it<00:04:46.639> I<00:04:46.789> personally

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:47.299 
unique sounds out of it I personally

00:04:47.299 --> 00:04:50.139 
unique sounds out of it I personally
probably<00:04:47.779> wouldn't<00:04:48.319> play<00:04:48.799> it<00:04:48.829> that<00:04:49.249> you<00:04:50.029> know

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:50.149 
probably wouldn't play it that you know

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:52.599 
probably wouldn't play it that you know
aggressively<00:04:51.129> but<00:04:52.129> if<00:04:52.309> you're<00:04:52.429> playing

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:52.609 
aggressively but if you're playing

00:04:52.609 --> 00:04:54.879 
aggressively but if you're playing
really<00:04:52.909> soft

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
really soft

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.219 
really soft
nice<00:04:55.520> kind<00:04:55.819> of<00:04:55.909> broken<00:04:56.180> up<00:04:56.419> tones<00:04:56.720> out<00:04:56.930> of<00:04:56.990> it

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
nice kind of broken up tones out of it

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:06.399 
nice kind of broken up tones out of it
too<00:05:04.539> kind<00:05:05.539> of<00:05:05.629> let's<00:05:05.780> dial<00:05:05.930> it<00:05:06.110> back<00:05:06.139> to

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.409 
too kind of let's dial it back to

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:07.809 
too kind of let's dial it back to
somewhere<00:05:06.680> a<00:05:06.740> little<00:05:06.830> more<00:05:06.949> reasonable<00:05:07.400> let's

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
somewhere a little more reasonable let's

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:10.390 
somewhere a little more reasonable let's
play<00:05:08.330> with<00:05:08.539> the<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:09.319> tracks<00:05:09.650> very<00:05:09.979> simple

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
play with the the tracks very simple

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.589 
play with the the tracks very simple
pedal<00:05:10.699> so<00:05:10.819> I<00:05:10.879> didn't<00:05:11.090> feel<00:05:11.210> like<00:05:11.240> you<00:05:11.389> know

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
pedal so I didn't feel like you know

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.559 
pedal so I didn't feel like you know
really<00:05:11.840> doing<00:05:12.139> too<00:05:12.319> much<00:05:12.349> in<00:05:12.770> this<00:05:12.949> video<00:05:13.569> you

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
really doing too much in this video you

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:15.760 
really doing too much in this video you
guys<00:05:14.690> kind<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.080> get<00:05:15.199> the<00:05:15.319> point

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
guys kind of get the point

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.260 
guys kind of get the point
let's<00:05:16.370> play<00:05:16.490> something<00:05:16.729> with<00:05:16.940> a<00:05:16.970> little<00:05:17.120> bit

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
let's play something with a little bit

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.760 
let's play something with a little bit
of<00:05:17.449> a<00:05:17.590> kind<00:05:18.590> of<00:05:18.740> blue<00:05:19.099> grassy<00:05:19.759> type<00:05:20.440> track<00:05:21.440> and

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
of a kind of blue grassy type track and

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.950 
of a kind of blue grassy type track and
you<00:05:22.370> know<00:05:22.460> we'll<00:05:22.610> see<00:05:22.819> if<00:05:22.940> I<00:05:23.060> can<00:05:23.240> I<00:05:23.539> can<00:05:23.720> kind

you know we'll see if I can I can kind
of<00:05:24.020> show<00:05:24.409> what<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.800> pedal<00:05:25.069> might<00:05:25.190> sound<00:05:25.430> like

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
of show what the pedal might sound like

00:05:25.550 --> 00:06:17.100 
of show what the pedal might sound like
in<00:05:25.759> context

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.810

more of a flavor of kind of what this
petal<00:06:24.770> is<00:06:24.860> gonna<00:06:25.040> be<00:06:25.160> used<00:06:25.400> for<00:06:25.580> and
