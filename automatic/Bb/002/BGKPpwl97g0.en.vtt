hit one rep of 225 but regardless that
is<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> standardized<00:01:08.370> test<00:01:08.490> once<00:01:09.090> they<00:01:09.330> get<00:01:09.510> on

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
is a standardized test once they get on

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.140 
is a standardized test once they get on
campus<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.860> frequency<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.549> which<00:01:11.760> they're

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
going to use that test obviously

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.070 
going to use that test obviously
initially<00:01:15.060> when<00:01:15.210> they<00:01:15.360> when<00:01:15.570> they<00:01:15.690> get<00:01:15.900> to

is to increase the amount of reps you
can<00:02:08.280> get<00:02:08.429> for<00:02:08.610> 225<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.899> once<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.710> focus

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
can get for 225 so once you focus
