makes this unique is this is what's

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.700 
makes this unique is this is what's
called<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.289> flex<00:00:28.890> 3401<00:00:29.630> forced<00:00:30.630> rotation<00:00:31.199> dual

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
I want you to grab the back of this with

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.200 
I want you to grab the back of this with
your<00:00:35.430> hand<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:35.969> rotate<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.540> pad<00:00:38.210> you

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
your hand here and rotate that pad you

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.940 
your hand here and rotate that pad you
notice<00:00:39.510> they're<00:00:39.690> whole<00:00:40.170> geared<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:40.559> okay

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
notice they're whole geared up okay

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.520 
notice they're whole geared up okay
that's<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.250> direct-drive<00:00:41.700> tool<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:43.020> what's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
that's a direct-drive tool but what's

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.380 
that's a direct-drive tool but what's
unique<00:00:43.829> about<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.489> rotating<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
unique about it is this rotating in a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.330 
unique about it is this rotating in a
circle<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> same<00:00:46.410> time<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.770> oscillating

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
circle at the same time it's oscillating

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.100 
circle at the same time it's oscillating
inside<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.989> mean

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
inside that so I can see that I mean

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.660 
inside that so I can see that I mean
that's<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.469> straight<00:00:49.770> round<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.579> wrong

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
that's not a straight round and wrong

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.130 
that's not a straight round and wrong
there's<00:00:50.969> there's<00:00:51.210> extra<00:00:51.449> movement<00:00:51.809> day<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
there's there's extra movement day and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.020 
there's there's extra movement day and
so<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> benefit<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> power<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
so the benefit is you get the power of a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.580 
so the benefit is you get the power of a
direct<00:00:54.239> drive<00:00:54.390> tool<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> safety<00:00:55.320> of

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
direct drive tool but the safety of

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.889 
direct drive tool but the safety of
orbital<00:00:56.010> action<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.879> these<00:00:57.420> are<00:00:57.629> basically

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
orbital action and these are basically

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.630 
orbital action and these are basically
the<00:00:58.050> same<00:00:58.079> type<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.649> tools<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.160> what<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.430> have

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the same type of tools but what I have

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.279 
the same type of tools but what I have
here<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.030> have<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.239> different<00:01:00.629> backing<00:01:00.870> plate

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
here is I have a different backing plate

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.110 
here is I have a different backing plate
just<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> show<00:01:02.100> how<00:01:02.219> versatile<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:02.879> are<00:01:02.910> you

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
just to show how versatile they are you

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.299 
just to show how versatile they are you
can<00:01:03.270> get<00:01:03.390> different<00:01:03.660> sized<00:01:03.989> pads<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:05.100> match

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
can get different sized pads to match

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.500 
can get different sized pads to match
the<00:01:05.519> panel's<00:01:05.850> you're<00:01:05.939> trying<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> buff<00:01:06.330> out

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
the panel's you're trying to buff out

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.210 
the panel's you're trying to buff out
well<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.110> know<00:01:07.200> actually<00:01:07.619> pulled<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:07.920> one<00:01:08.189> of

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
well you know actually pulled out one of

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.370 
well you know actually pulled out one of
my<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.729> newer<00:01:08.939> cars<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.210> Gen<00:01:09.479> 1<00:01:09.810> SH<00:01:10.260> oh

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
my one of my newer cars a Gen 1 SH oh

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.539 
my one of my newer cars a Gen 1 SH oh
it's<00:01:10.500> always<00:01:10.619> fun<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.860> play<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.369> I

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
it's always fun to play with and I

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.070 
it's always fun to play with and I
thought<00:01:11.640> maybe<00:01:11.820> we'd<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> little<00:01:12.510> bit<00:01:12.780> then

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
thought maybe we'd do a little bit then

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.750 
thought maybe we'd do a little bit then
with<00:01:13.200> some<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.439> stuff<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.310> guess<00:01:14.610> we'll

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
with some of the stuff and I guess we'll

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.370 
with some of the stuff and I guess we'll
use<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> Wolfgang<00:01:15.299> wine<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.900> brought<00:01:16.200> some

want to be up around the 5 or 6 there's

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.910 
want to be up around the 5 or 6 there's
the<00:02:39.330> five<00:02:39.540> I'm<00:02:40.140> gonna<00:02:40.320> make<00:02:40.470> overlapping

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
the five I'm gonna make overlapping

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:49.140 
the five I'm gonna make overlapping
passes<00:02:41.490> turn<00:02:41.730> off<00:02:41.850> wipe<00:02:42.180> off<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.480> residue

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.050 

I<00:02:49.470> think<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.560> can<00:02:50.740> see<00:02:50.950> it's<00:02:51.100> really<00:02:51.430> easy<00:02:51.610> to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
I think you can see it's really easy to

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.020 
I think you can see it's really easy to
operate<00:02:52.150> his<00:02:52.540> tool<00:02:52.860> okay<00:02:53.860> so<00:02:54.610> let's<00:02:54.730> come<00:02:54.850> down

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
operate his tool okay so let's come down

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.130 
operate his tool okay so let's come down
here<00:02:55.210> I<00:02:55.240> think<00:02:55.480> what<00:02:55.600> you're<00:02:55.720> gonna<00:02:55.780> see<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.110> a

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
here I think what you're gonna see is a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.020 
here I think what you're gonna see is a
bright<00:02:56.470> white<00:02:56.770> in<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.400> one<00:02:57.580> little<00:02:57.760> section

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
bright white in this one little section

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
bright white in this one little section
that<00:02:58.270> I<00:02:58.360> bugged<00:03:00.360> can<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.420> see<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.720> difference
