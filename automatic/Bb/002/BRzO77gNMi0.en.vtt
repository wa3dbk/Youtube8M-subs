dream I was having well that werewolf

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.479 
dream I was having well that werewolf
was<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> bigger<00:00:40.950> version<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.580> thing<00:00:42.290> ready

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
was a bigger version of this thing ready

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:51.229 
was a bigger version of this thing ready
I'm<00:00:44.489> talking<00:00:44.850> about<00:00:49.430> okay<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.700> weird<00:00:50.730> I

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
think I got some forgot to mention is

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.180 
think I got some forgot to mention is
that

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.939 

I<00:00:56.280> saw<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.359> this<00:00:57.539> stuff<00:00:57.750> up<00:00:57.899> here<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
I saw like this stuff up here it's a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.720 
I saw like this stuff up here it's a
this<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.699> my<00:01:00.120> level<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.010> this<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> energy

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
this is my level and this is the energy

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.380 
this is my level and this is the energy
that<00:01:02.760> you're<00:01:03.120> supposed<00:01:03.360> to<00:01:03.480> use<00:01:05.330> okay<00:01:06.330> so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
that you're supposed to use okay so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.550 
that you're supposed to use okay so
let's<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.680> redo<00:01:08.280> everything<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.560> down

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
let's just redo everything in this down

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.850 
let's just redo everything in this down
here<00:01:11.030> I<00:01:12.030> think<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.990> replenish<00:01:13.259> your<00:01:13.470> energy<00:01:13.530> i

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
here I think to replenish your energy i

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.859 
here I think to replenish your energy i
think<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.280> jelly<00:01:14.549> beans<00:01:14.880> or<00:01:15.180> something<00:01:15.360> loose

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
think it jelly beans or something loose

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
think it jelly beans or something loose
just<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.440> apparently<00:01:17.159> some<00:01:17.310> sort<00:01:17.460> of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
just like that apparently some sort of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.180 
just like that apparently some sort of
hack<00:01:17.850> into<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> second<00:01:18.509> yes

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
hack into the second yes

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.720 
hack into the second yes
very<00:01:20.370> nice

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
very nice

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.730 
very nice
so<00:01:23.330> now<00:01:23.450> we<00:01:23.630> head<00:01:23.750> down<00:01:23.930> to<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.050> force<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:24.620> go

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
so now we head down to the force to go

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.190 
so now we head down to the force to go
in<00:01:24.890> battle<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:25.430> my<00:01:25.640> monsters<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.120> raised<00:01:27.050> at

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
stuff like that and now all it really is

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.470 
stuff like that and now all it really is
is<00:02:05.600> strategy<00:02:06.820> basically<00:02:07.820> these<00:02:07.940> are<00:02:08.000> two<00:02:08.240> fire

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.480 
is strategy basically these are two fire

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.760 
is strategy basically these are two fire
types<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:11.630> know<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:11.990> if<00:02:12.080> they<00:02:12.230> do<00:02:12.290> use

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
types so you know that if they do use

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.860 
types so you know that if they do use
like<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.070> fire<00:02:13.490> attack<00:02:13.910> it's<00:02:14.180> not<00:02:14.390> going<00:02:14.600> to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
like a fire attack it's not going to

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.320 
like a fire attack it's not going to
really<00:02:15.230> impact<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.040> other<00:02:16.220> person<00:02:16.640> unless

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
really impact the other person unless

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.000 
really impact the other person unless
they<00:02:17.660> have<00:02:17.810> weak<00:02:18.050> defense<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:18.740> far<00:02:18.980> I

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
they have weak defense and so far I

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.830 
they have weak defense and so far I
don't<00:02:19.100> really<00:02:19.370> see<00:02:19.490> where<00:02:19.820> your<00:02:20.000> animals<00:02:20.570> have

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
don't really see where your animals have

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.670 
don't really see where your animals have
weak<00:02:21.740> defense<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.900> I'm<00:02:23.990> gonna<00:02:24.110> he'll<00:02:24.290> go<00:02:24.530> ahead

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
weak defense so I'm gonna he'll go ahead

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
and also you can get a clue just like if

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.060 
and also you can get a clue just like if
you<00:02:34.670> play<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.120> other<00:02:35.210> monster<00:02:36.020> training<00:02:36.440> RPGs

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
you play the other monster training RPGs

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.910 
you play the other monster training RPGs
if<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.180> like<00:02:38.510> hold<00:02:38.750> your<00:02:38.960> mouse<00:02:39.110> over<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
if you like hold your mouse over the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.500 
if you like hold your mouse over the
different<00:02:40.190> attacks<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.610> can<00:02:40.760> see<00:02:41.060> what<00:02:41.420> the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
different attacks you can see what the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.920 
different attacks you can see what the
power<00:02:41.720> is<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.770> accuracy<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.540> here<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.840> is

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
power is and the accuracy so here it is

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.150 
power is and the accuracy so here it is
his<00:02:45.140> powers<00:02:45.610> seven<00:02:46.900> accuracy<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:47.930> 99<00:02:48.410> this<00:02:48.890> is

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
his powers seven accuracy is 99 this is

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.790 
his powers seven accuracy is 99 this is
accuracies<00:02:49.880> 100<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.540> power<00:02:50.720> is<00:02:50.990> nothing<00:02:51.170> now

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
accuracies 100 and power is nothing now

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.440 
accuracies 100 and power is nothing now
the<00:02:51.860> reason<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:52.280> says<00:02:52.430> power<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.850> nothing<00:02:53.030> is

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
the reason it says power is nothing is

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.360 
the reason it says power is nothing is
because<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:54.230> won't<00:02:54.470> do<00:02:54.710> anything<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.160> the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
because it won't do anything to the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
because it won't do anything to the
person<00:02:55.790> it's<00:02:56.390> just<00:02:56.750> what<00:02:56.960> you<00:02:56.990> call<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:58.390> magic

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
person it's just what you call a magic

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.450 
person it's just what you call a magic
attack<00:02:59.690> or<00:02:59.960> you<00:03:00.200> know<00:03:00.320> some<00:03:00.680> kind<00:03:01.010> of<00:03:01.130> attack

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
attack or you know some kind of attack

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.790 
attack or you know some kind of attack
that<00:03:01.490> doesn't<00:03:02.180> it's<00:03:02.900> not<00:03:03.050> a<00:03:03.080> physical<00:03:03.470> attack

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
that doesn't it's not a physical attack

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.550 
that doesn't it's not a physical attack
there<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.190> go<00:03:04.600> so<00:03:05.600> I<00:03:05.630> want<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.050> use<00:03:06.140> physical

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.650 
there you go so I want to use physical
attacks<00:03:06.890> because<00:03:07.400> unless<00:03:07.640> i<00:03:07.790> know<00:03:07.850> i<00:03:08.000> have<00:03:08.120> HP

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
attacks because unless i know i have HP

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.080 
attacks because unless i know i have HP
to<00:03:08.750> play<00:03:08.930> with<00:03:09.340> if<00:03:10.340> one<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.820> strategies

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
to play with if one of the strategies

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.910 
to play with if one of the strategies
that<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.600> could<00:03:11.870> actually<00:03:11.900> use<00:03:12.230> this<00:03:12.590> first

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
that you could actually use this first

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
you know so that even if he hits you

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.440 
you know so that even if he hits you
first<00:03:15.170> after<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:15.800> use<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.280> at<00:03:16.580> least<00:03:17.240> you

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
first after you use that at least you

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.450 
first after you use that at least you
know<00:03:17.600> that<00:03:17.840> his<00:03:18.020> accuracy<00:03:18.560> will<00:03:18.800> be<00:03:18.890> down<00:03:19.070> or

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
know that his accuracy will be down or

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.100 
know that his accuracy will be down or
his<00:03:19.580> defense<00:03:19.910> will<00:03:20.090> be<00:03:20.180> down<00:03:20.360> so<00:03:20.690> you're<00:03:20.870> kind

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
his defense will be down so you're kind

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.060
