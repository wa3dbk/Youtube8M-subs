this whole big beginning ends you go

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.810 
this whole big beginning ends you go
into<00:01:06.200> something<00:01:06.590> completely<00:01:06.800> different<00:01:07.520> it's

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
into something completely different it's

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.680 
into something completely different it's
as<00:01:08.210> if<00:01:08.330> it's<00:01:08.479> a<00:01:08.570> change<00:01:08.990> on<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:10.580> set<00:01:11.060> if<00:01:11.509> you

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
as if it's a change on a set if you

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.070 
as if it's a change on a set if you
think<00:01:11.810> about<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.380> ballet<00:01:12.590> or<00:01:12.979> in<00:01:13.460> a<00:01:13.550> theater

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
think about the ballet or in a theater

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.810 
think about the ballet or in a theater
there<00:01:15.080> is<00:01:15.170> a<00:01:15.200> moment<00:01:15.650> when<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.920> light<00:01:16.130> dims<00:01:16.580> a

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
there is a moment when the light dims a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.219 
there is a moment when the light dims a
little<00:01:17.119> bit<00:01:17.300> and<00:01:17.479> you're<00:01:17.600> not<00:01:17.720> really<00:01:17.869> sure

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
little bit and you're not really sure

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.710 
little bit and you're not really sure
where<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.830> next<00:01:19.250> set<00:01:19.880> is<00:01:19.910> going<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.360> be<00:01:20.509> and

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
where the next set is going to be and

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:42.990 
where the next set is going to be and
this<00:01:21.050> is<00:01:21.289> where<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.680> comes<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.070> beautifully

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.210 

and<00:01:44.000> I<00:01:44.390> think<00:01:44.630> Jay<00:01:44.750> Koskov<00:01:45.229> really<00:01:45.530> introduces

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
and I think Jay Koskov really introduces

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.160 
and I think Jay Koskov really introduces
you<00:01:46.369> into<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:46.670> completely<00:01:47.390> different<00:01:48.020> world

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
you into a completely different world

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.620 
you into a completely different world
very<00:01:49.039> very<00:01:49.369> different<00:01:49.670> than<00:01:50.240> at<00:01:50.479> the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
very very different than at the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:02:00.940 
very very different than at the
beginning<00:01:50.750> when<00:01:51.590> it's<00:01:51.770> just<00:01:52.099> so<00:01:52.310> heroic

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.120 

now<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> first<00:02:02.370> movement<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:03.210> very<00:02:04.050> long<00:02:04.500> it's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
now the first movement is very long it's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.920 
now the first movement is very long it's
more<00:02:05.340> than<00:02:05.400> 20<00:02:05.790> minutes<00:02:05.970> long<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.600> very

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
more than 20 minutes long it's very

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.040 
more than 20 minutes long it's very
demanding<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.980> changes<00:02:08.670> from<00:02:08.910> very<00:02:09.780> big

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
demanding it changes from very big

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.070 
demanding it changes from very big
chords<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.830> quite<00:02:11.250> small<00:02:11.520> technique<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.420> you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
chords to quite small technique and you

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.050 
chords to quite small technique and you
need<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.350> have<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.530> lot<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.710> stamina<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.520> energy

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
need to have a lot of stamina and energy

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.850 
need to have a lot of stamina and energy
