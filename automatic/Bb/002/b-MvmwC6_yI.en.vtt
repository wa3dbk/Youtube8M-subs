 what does its interface look like 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:25.990

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.960
 t we have 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.460
 five desktops 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.430
 where you can post

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.890
 are added 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.500
 a year later such a simple menu 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.120
 here you can change the background image 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.550

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.200
 I will sell you cook 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.090
 on the desktop 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.650
 such here 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.320
 icons of applications of kleban it can 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.280
 be 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.890
 percentage of apples 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.300
 and for the browser 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.420
 links to specific sites 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.220
 percent 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.890
 means 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.930
 notice the interface which 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.160
 right away 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.630
 interest left to companies 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.580
 these are four such icons located 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.480
 in the corners 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.600
 they are all customizable 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.049
 In this case, the place and phone book 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.049
 probably grat player 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.110

 All icons are customizable. 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.350
 you can put any of them 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.840
 interest at its discretion and here 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.900
 such is the crust below which 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.500
 starts up 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.840
 which launches a menu with a list 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.280
 applications 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.830
 the default is 4 here like before 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.299
 as 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.049
 but after it was before 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.950
 installed by management 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.390
 5 more appeared 3 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.390
 it all works the same way 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.360
 horizontal reputation 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.649
 can search 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:18.969
 and desktops and just as you can 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.279
 flipping through 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:22.529
 screens 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.269
 application menu 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.209
 hiding in the same way 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.579
 similar 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.119
 everything works like any other 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.020
 andrologists 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.089
 three keys hardware 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:34.689
 one is for return 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.259
 previous level analogue escape 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:39.269
 one nomination 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.889
 returns 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.959
 main menu and long press 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.939
 shows 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.989
 running applications and here not 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.319
 more than six 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.369
 and one more this contextual is displayed 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:52.369
 menu 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:53.979
 that is, like this, with three buttons 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:54.979
 controlled 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.169
 power profiles come true power button 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.080
 Here you can turn on flight mode 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.540
 that is, disable electronic means 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.949
 when eating 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.739
 either mute 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.739
 and a list of tickets to be honest 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.599
 not that much upset but he 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.169
 obviously small 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.439
 that is, there is an application for 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.279
 here it is 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:21.360
 application for pressure themselves so it is 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.589
 times craig 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.559
 there is a favor google there is 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:26.079
 such a cool thing that 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:26.940
 allows 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.239
 but with one touch 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.900
 turn on and turn off the Internet 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.560
 it is very convenient if he is with me 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.169
 by the way exactly there used to eat here 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.029
 so here 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:39.029
 hour and what you can add see 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.279
 mean facebook 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.209
 android 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.159
 it can deliver an auction 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.689
 google calendar locator 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.040
 power management digital watch list 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.799
 honestly very modest 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.029
 muddy 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:58.439
 but what good 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.519
 worth knowing about this phone bond 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.429
 recession 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:04.589
 he is extremely simple and it is cool 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:06.739
 he is extremely comfortable here, look at all 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.109
 I'm jumping the camera 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.569
 and see 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.569
 what the camera interface looks like 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.419
 all the same four and konkin 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:15.250
 but 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.099
 including disables 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.899
 flash rather backlight 

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:20.930
 LED light 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.680
 another choose twilight autofocus mode 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.099
 sport maca auto 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.360
 the third toggles the photo 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.059
 and video 

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:33.030
 nothing more 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.230
 you can choose nothing else this 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.809
 just great 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:39.460
 that is, that's all you need to press the trigger 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.110
 to take a photo 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.110
 here you can see the gallery 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.669
 will be back 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.849
 here he is in trust 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.809
 all just great 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:56.349
 honestly yahoo fan like setting 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:57.900
 everything else but 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.990
 given the target audience of this 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.759
 the phone's just ingenious to come up 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.290
 such a simple interface which is not 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.309
 only actually will not 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:08.919
 bother with this of course there is everything 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.029
 settings 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:11.339
 android 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:13.830
 they are of course available 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.039
 here are the settings 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.279
 and here we see the usual standard menu 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:20.669
 android 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.529
 lead 1 6 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:24.620
 Let's see 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.940
 lot number model 20 and if this program is 1.6 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.490
 update 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.319
 expected in the fall when fall 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:33.659
 unclear 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.769
 let's hope that he will be together with 

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:37.800
 update for the main 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.360
 flagship of 10 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.520
 here is such a nice phone 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.110
 probably afk rats is all that could be him 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.990
