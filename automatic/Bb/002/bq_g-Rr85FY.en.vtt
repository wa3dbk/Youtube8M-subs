00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.700
 farther 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:58.030
 the shell, I do not take off this one because 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.450
 so you can bring down these roots too 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.450

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.159
 my peat here is perlite 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.380
 neat roots are obtained when 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.380
 rained down 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:03.370
 this way I added landmarks here 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.370
 I'll spill it a little 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:13.340
 not much needed because there is no 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:18.320
 drain hole and this cup 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:29.740
 will stand back the same 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:33.289
 Now fill bags when on earth 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.229
 already with extra nutritional 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:39.130
 elements of the roots will already be taken 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:44.320
 from there everything they need and 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:51.070
 Violet will start to water so the kids will 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.070
 gradually grow here in this way 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.010
 then get bigger 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:04.259
 then they can already be planted so that 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.520

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.620

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.540
 already fed from it need to survive 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.540
 excess water 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:23.670
