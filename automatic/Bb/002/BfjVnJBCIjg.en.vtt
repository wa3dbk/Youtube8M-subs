technique does is these two false cuts
and<00:00:27.210> shuffles<00:00:27.630> will<00:00:28.470> let<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.800> integrate<00:00:29.400> them

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and shuffles will let you integrate them

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.389

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
and basically it makes the card trick a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.740 
and basically it makes the card trick a
lot<00:00:36.989> more<00:00:37.200> believable<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.790> makes<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.420> just

and it's that easy and can be viewed

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.120 
and it's that easy and can be viewed
when<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.239> going<00:03:39.480> fast<00:03:39.750> from<00:03:40.670> virtually<00:03:41.959> any

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
when it's going fast from virtually any

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.500 
when it's going fast from virtually any
position<00:03:44.130> if<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.880> know<00:03:44.910> what<00:03:45.239> you're<00:03:45.360> looking

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
position if you know what you're looking

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.630 
position if you know what you're looking

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
for it's easier to see it but if you

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.080 
for it's easier to see it but if you
don't<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:48.360> looks<00:03:48.570> just<00:03:48.690> like<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.900> normal<00:03:48.989> cut

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090

don't it looks just like a normal cut
now<00:03:51.090> we're<00:03:51.959> gonna<00:03:52.080> end<00:03:52.350> it<00:03:52.530> with<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:53.130> easiest

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
now we're gonna end it with the easiest

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.960 
now we're gonna end it with the easiest
one<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:56.400> one<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.610> you're<00:03:56.730> less<00:03:56.940> likely

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
one and the one that you're less likely

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.100 
one and the one that you're less likely
