00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 whenever they ask me what it was that 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.500
 we did 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.020
 a government that stood out 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.639
 the local response policy always 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.240
 it's the same we did not do anything 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.000
 extraordinary we follow our work 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.710
 we are proposing a scheme first 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.970
 to ensure that students can 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.340
 finish high school and where we have 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.869
 the main bottleneck four of 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.939
 every ten young people who enter the prepa 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.119
 they finish it and we need it first 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.380
 guarantee that with a scholarship scheme 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.539
 for high school students 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.070
 universal public schools and we're going to 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.710
 develop from that already achieving 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.019
 overcome that problem of desertion to 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.019
 level of upper middle level we are going to 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.510
 generate an educational offer that can 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.370
 First create the University of Jalisco 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.440
 a public university that articulates 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.879
 the entire system and unraveled the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.850
 polytechnic technology universities 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.860
 excessive broom we will try to 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.019
 increase the university budget 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.670
 Guadalajara of 16 thousand pesos per student to 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.339
 25 thousand pesos per average student per year 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.650
 which is the national average but trying 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.180
 that the University of Guadalajara 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.909
 resume your substantive function is very 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.110
 well that makes festivals fairs 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.790
 concerts but first you have to educate 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.590
 to young people of ideas that at the end of 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.750
 sexenio there is not a single rejected in the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.010
 public institutions in Jalisco that do not 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.900
 we have but not link with the 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.690
 universities take advantage 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.950
 the creative capital the work that 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.660
 they have institutions particularly 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.260
 private universities to do 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.310
 a joint agenda we can not be 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.660
 building a research agenda 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.710
 development that is not linked to the 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.660
 agenda that are building the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.490
 universities then that route what 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.690
 we want is after the election to be 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.130
 make a work agenda with the 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.840
 public and private universities 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.580
 jalisco to be precisely an agenda 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.890
 in this matter we have to make a 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.260
 social policy that has two axes a 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.670
 axis of social development where there 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.930
 issues related to health with the 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.119
 education with the recovery of 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.530
 public spaces a policy that we 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.970
 allows you to pick up little by little 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.010
 social fabric but we have to have 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.140
 also an assistance policy or 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.820
 social solidarity where we see supports 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.170
 direct from the program of 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.600
 austerity that we are going to create the government 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.810
 we can save money that today is going 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.760
 away four billion pesos 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.080
 that we will use for programs like 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.030
 support for single mothers heads of 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.470
 family in poverty the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.260
 adult pension programs 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.060
 older programs related to 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.980
 uniforms and free school supplies 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.510
 in short the social programs who 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.500
 will allow and little by little understanding the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.540
 most unprotected sectors 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.820
 a balanced social policy I insist 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.580
 with an axis of social development and with a 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.320
 axis of assistance and social solidarity 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.760
 that are free to transform 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.760
