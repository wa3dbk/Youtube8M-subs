00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.590 
volume and in this case the volume is
still<00:01:24.649> very<00:01:25.039> very<00:01:25.280> low<00:01:25.399> so<00:01:26.119> I'm<00:01:26.270> gonna<00:01:26.390> crank

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
still very very low so I'm gonna crank

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.029 
still very very low so I'm gonna crank

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.630 
it up a little bit from the drive back
some

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.610 

so<00:01:31.150> about<00:01:31.450> half<00:01:31.690> way<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:31.990> which<00:01:32.290> is<00:01:32.380> gonna<00:01:32.500> be

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
so about half way and which is gonna be

00:01:32.620 --> 00:02:05.730

straight<00:02:13.790> end<00:02:13.970> platform<00:02:14.209> if<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:14.780> want<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.050> use

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
straight end platform if you want to use

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.290 
straight end platform if you want to use
a<00:02:15.200> pedal<00:02:15.590> board<00:02:15.740> or<00:02:15.950> effect<00:02:16.300> processor

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
a pedal board or effect processor

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.090 
a pedal board or effect processor
especially<00:02:17.720> Weaver<00:02:18.020> with<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.410> because<00:02:18.920> it's

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
especially Weaver with it because it's

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.340 
especially Weaver with it because it's
just<00:02:19.310> straightforward<00:02:19.959> powerful<00:02:20.959> two<00:02:21.110> hands

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
just straightforward powerful two hands

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.140 
just straightforward powerful two hands
so<00:02:21.650> I'm<00:02:22.010> going<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.160> crank<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.489> up<00:02:22.580> again<00:02:22.880> all

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
so I'm going to crank it up again all

00:02:23.150 --> 00:03:22.990 
so I'm going to crank it up again all
the<00:02:23.330> way<00:02:23.450> see<00:02:23.810> what<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.020> does<00:02:24.170> fall<00:02:24.470> out

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.190 

so<00:03:24.000> that's<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.510> month<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.930> dr.<00:03:25.409> CM<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:27.200> they

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
so that's the month of dr. CM and they

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.829 
so that's the month of dr. CM and they
can<00:03:28.379> check<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.680> out
