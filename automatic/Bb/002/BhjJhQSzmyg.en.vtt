 I have to activate the blocks of 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.850
 command to make the portals 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.780
 of the portals 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.280

 I reward an expensive paper that is here 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.470
 put the number of server and here if 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.789
 you want new and just those who do 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.200

 only you when you pull out the version that 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.860
 you want 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.560
 he who wants cabanillas and

 the guests mentioned to place 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.210
 running the three points to plugins 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.670
 cravings plugin tickets 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.100
 to see for a while that I do not have as a car 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.300
 Blog 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.300
 in kansas for a long time 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:40.760
 in prose perml lml and of ml 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.940
 now 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.230
 and here in Brazil in arms 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.340
 apart from those who put this 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.340
 a time that is better 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.800
 they let us the inscription copied with the 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.800
 hardware 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.129
 it has to be even if both are not 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.639
 will work if they have to be at 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.639
 same time 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.849
 seen here and here we are going to create a 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.579
 blue server to more than 10 people 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.620
 train station with know a server 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.450
 and yes or yes it has to be for a 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.530
 person so that as a person there 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.530
 you can save the server 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:36.550
 to all about how to have it to a server 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.769
 and now we 're going to minecraft for 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.410
 teach them how to create the portals 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.080
 we are against micro we are with a 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.110
 called friend I do not know his name but every 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.630
 server I do not know how and level 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.100
 we are in control we go to the pam 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.100
 to whom I 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.879
 once here for the portals by 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.830
 example you have created your being of 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:10.900
 giant for a big pretty 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.340
 so that the portals simply in 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.220
 form of portal this to deliver the 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.070
 feint that it is a portal and end with 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.070
 this for example I think 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.860
 little bit 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.460
 face 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.389
 just with the word and you put here and 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:41.410
 here and we put the set 137 which is the 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:44.380
 command block and here your support 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.920
 for example, guard is 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.490
 ward cow 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.599
 that would be the pair for here 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.020
 a normal test local servers 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:01.470
 cow 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:07.790
 ibaka at radio 1 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.790
 dogs equal to 2 radio 2 and mixed 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.330
 the great caracas 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.190
 ah 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.390
 in a big way 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.150
 now or not but what has worked at 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.150
 spam 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.680
 visited to run a test place 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.569
 is that we enjoy a place but not 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.969
 it worked for our 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.369
 Youtube 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.989
 producers of your neighborhood I owe everything and here 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:06.589
 we change him from a man he 

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:06.589
 automatic 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.919
 and we close and this 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:25.860
 transports the uar I got now 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.630
 we import here and we all try here 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.800
 how 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:34.770
 here and here you saw for that they were 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.660
 the portals the portals especially to 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.030
 Caesar and everything then be taught to 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.670
 create the portals and install them 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.560
 infinities that want them to want 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.840
 learn how to create a fast server 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.180
 in less than 15 in less than an hour the 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.740
 screws relate now well our 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.240
 the server you build that the one 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.520
 We made the staff the most 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.180
 recommended for this server to 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:59.240
 that you can be a little more like being what 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.240
