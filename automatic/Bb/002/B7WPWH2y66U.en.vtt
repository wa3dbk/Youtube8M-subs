00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
you know it gives pretty well does it

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.609 
you know it gives pretty well does it
really<00:01:18.420> cause<00:01:19.420> any<00:01:19.659> issues<00:01:20.079> or<00:01:20.110> anything<00:01:20.380> like

00:01:20.619 --> 00:02:01.360 
really cause any issues or anything like
that<00:01:20.680> as<00:01:20.890> far<00:01:21.040> as<00:01:21.130> that<00:01:21.220> goes

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.090
