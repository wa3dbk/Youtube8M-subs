hey guys how are you my name is Conda
and<00:00:07.109> today<00:00:07.590> we're<00:00:07.770> going<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.160> be<00:00:08.280> doing<00:00:08.460> lens

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
and today we're going to be doing lens

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.930 
and today we're going to be doing lens
flares<00:00:09.380> so<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.740> first<00:00:10.950> thing<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.400> need<00:00:11.610> is

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
flares so the first thing you need is

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.279 
flares so the first thing you need is
the<00:00:12.360> light<00:00:12.900> source<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.500> will<00:00:13.950> be<00:00:14.900> maybe<00:00:15.900> can

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
the light source that will be maybe can

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.749 
the light source that will be maybe can
be<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.530> Sun<00:00:16.860> can<00:00:17.369> be<00:00:17.550> some<00:00:17.880> light<00:00:18.210> whatever<00:00:19.759> so

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
be the Sun can be some light whatever so

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:27.249 
be the Sun can be some light whatever so
you<00:00:21.390> need<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:23.330> to<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.449> flat<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.050> really

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
you need it to be flat and really

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.870 
you need it to be flat and really
defined<00:00:28.699> so<00:00:29.699> I'm<00:00:29.999> going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.330> copy<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.810> layer<00:00:31.050> I

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
defined so I'm going to copy the layer I

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.740 
defined so I'm going to copy the layer I
made<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> copy<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.450> layer<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:35.180> I'm<00:00:36.180> going

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
made a copy of that layer and I'm going

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.950 
made a copy of that layer and I'm going
to<00:00:36.780> put<00:00:37.080> a<00:00:37.260> blur<00:00:37.560> on<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:39.210> go<00:00:39.330> to<00:00:39.360> filters

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
to put a blur on it you go to filters

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.570 
to put a blur on it you go to filters
blur<00:00:40.640> Gaussian<00:00:41.640> blur<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:43.070> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.220> a<00:00:44.250> glow

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
blur Gaussian blur and this is a glow

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.190 
blur Gaussian blur and this is a glow
glowing<00:00:45.210> effect<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.930> most

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
glowing effect so this is the the most

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.270 
glowing effect so this is the the most
easy<00:00:49.410> way<00:00:49.650> to<00:00:49.710> make<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> glow<00:00:50.310> effect<00:00:51.260> and

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
easy way to make a glow effect and

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.310 
easy way to make a glow effect and
seperated<00:00:53.280> will<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.790> this<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.900> you<00:00:55.110> want

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
seperated will be like this if you want

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.750 
seperated will be like this if you want
a<00:00:55.380> Lancer<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.420> two<00:00:58.290> things<00:00:58.610> you<00:00:59.610> can

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
a Lancer you can do two things you can

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.050 
a Lancer you can do two things you can
take<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.210> same<00:01:00.510> layer<00:01:01.020> again<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.770> copy<00:01:02.060> and

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
take the same layer again and copy and

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.740 
take the same layer again and copy and
you<00:01:03.990> can<00:01:04.019> make<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.640> be<00:01:06.200> flat<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.770> scale<00:01:08.430> it

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
you can make it be flat like scale it

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.510 
you can make it be flat like scale it
from<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.410> side<00:01:12.950> can<00:01:13.950> look<00:01:14.160> something<00:01:14.490> like

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
from on one side can look something like

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.060 
from on one side can look something like
this

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.310 

that's<00:01:19.730> one<00:01:19.970> way<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:22.600> maybe<00:01:23.600> winning<00:01:23.990> another

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
that's one way and maybe winning another

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.360 
that's one way and maybe winning another
one<00:01:24.790> smaller<00:01:25.790> because<00:01:26.120> the<00:01:26.890> source<00:01:27.890> light<00:01:28.190> is

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
one smaller because the source light is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.160 
one smaller because the source light is
to<00:01:28.550> define<00:01:31.060> something<00:01:32.060> like<00:01:32.210> this<00:01:32.510> maybe

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
to define something like this maybe

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.720 
to define something like this maybe
yeah<00:01:34.240> okay<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.840> real<00:01:36.200> trick<00:01:36.530> here<00:01:36.560> is<00:01:37.100> the

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
yeah okay so the real trick here is the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.780 
yeah okay so the real trick here is the
colors<00:01:38.120> that<00:01:38.150> you<00:01:38.540> use<00:01:39.250> because<00:01:40.250> like<00:01:40.550> this

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
colors that you use because like this

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.550 
colors that you use because like this
doesn't<00:01:41.210> look<00:01:41.330> it<00:01:41.840> doesn't<00:01:42.170> look<00:01:42.260> too<00:01:42.410> great

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
doesn't look it doesn't look too great

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.190 
doesn't look it doesn't look too great
so<00:01:43.270> let's<00:01:44.270> try<00:01:44.420> something<00:01:44.690> else

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
so let's try something else

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.800 
so let's try something else
let's<00:01:45.470> make<00:01:46.160> let's<00:01:47.030> make<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.270> with<00:01:47.510> little

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
let's make let's make it with little

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.640 
let's make let's make it with little
lights<00:01:49.540> it's<00:01:50.540> me<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:51.050> know<00:01:51.830> something<00:01:53.650> like

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
lights it's me I know something like

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.680 
lights it's me I know something like
three<00:01:54.920> lights<00:01:55.220> or<00:01:55.580> something<00:01:55.790> like<00:01:56.030> that<00:01:56.090> like

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
three lights or something like that like

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.960 
three lights or something like that like
a<00:01:56.720> stadium<00:01:59.020> so<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.680> want<00:02:01.280> this<00:02:01.400> light<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.850> be

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
a stadium so I want this light to be

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.859 
a stadium so I want this light to be
kind<00:02:02.210> of<00:02:02.330> jell-o<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.590> first<00:02:03.890> one<00:02:04.869> I'm

kind of jell-o so the first one I'm

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.840 
kind of jell-o so the first one I'm
going<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.200> be<00:02:06.320> yellow<00:02:07.720> kind<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:08.899> orange<00:02:09.259> maybe

something like this

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.850 
something like this
so<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.140> copy<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.739> layer<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:17.170> make<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.200> blue<00:02:20.860> and

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
so I copy that layer and make a blue and

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.830 
so I copy that layer and make a blue and
this<00:02:22.850> one<00:02:23.090> needs<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.540> be<00:02:23.750> in<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.910> kind<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.120> of

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
this one needs to be in the kind of of

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.380 
this one needs to be in the kind of of
layer<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.590> you're<00:02:27.709> using<00:02:27.950> here<00:02:28.130> is<00:02:29.060> going<00:02:29.300> to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
layer that you're using here is going to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.140 
layer that you're using here is going to
be<00:02:29.630> linear<00:02:30.050> dodge<00:02:30.530> is<00:02:31.130> going<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.610> burn<00:02:31.850> that

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
be linear dodge is going to burn that

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.420 
be linear dodge is going to burn that
one<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.850> can<00:02:35.180> copy<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.570> again<00:02:36.430> basically

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
one and I can copy it again basically

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.009 
one and I can copy it again basically
you<00:02:37.610> just<00:02:37.640> need<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.000> do<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.299> what<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.600> looks

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
you just need to do that what it looks

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.440 
you just need to do that what it looks
what<00:02:39.799> it<00:02:39.950> looks<00:02:40.220> like<00:02:40.459> it's<00:02:40.700> burning<00:02:40.970> like

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
what it looks like it's burning like

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.789 
what it looks like it's burning like
it's<00:02:42.100> really<00:02:43.100> dance<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.870> really<00:02:45.110> intense<00:02:45.560> I

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
it's really dance it really intense I

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.740 
it's really dance it really intense I
mean<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:47.420> then<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:47.989> can<00:02:48.230> just<00:02:48.410> copy<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:49.750> and

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
mean and then I can just copy that and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.640 
mean and then I can just copy that and
put<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:51.019> like<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.350> on<00:02:51.799> top<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:54.200> can<00:02:54.350> do<00:02:54.500> it

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
put it like this on top you can do it

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.050 
put it like this on top you can do it
that<00:02:54.830> way<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:56.060> can<00:02:56.209> do<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:56.360> each<00:02:56.660> one<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.880> can

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
that way you can do it each one you can

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.670 
that way you can do it each one you can
also<00:02:59.980> take<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.670> another<00:03:02.540> brush<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.380> soft

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
also take the another brush the soft

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.460 
also take the another brush the soft
ones<00:03:03.950> this<00:03:04.310> ones<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.630> can<00:03:05.780> make<00:03:05.989> some

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
ones this ones and you can make some

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.259 
ones this ones and you can make some
variations<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.519> color<00:03:09.580> maybe<00:03:10.580> something<00:03:11.090> like

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
variations in color maybe something like

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.949 
variations in color maybe something like
this<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.840> put<00:03:12.200> in<00:03:12.470> another<00:03:12.980> color

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.979 

and<00:03:17.829> to<00:03:17.950> be<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.069> little<00:03:18.370> bit<00:03:18.459> darker<00:03:18.989> maybe

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
and to be a little bit darker maybe

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.349 
and to be a little bit darker maybe
something<00:03:20.409> with<00:03:20.650> red<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.159> then<00:03:21.579> put<00:03:21.969> it<00:03:22.090> like

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
something with red and then put it like

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.720 
something with red and then put it like
the<00:03:23.260> lair<00:03:23.469> the<00:03:23.769> kind<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.040> layer<00:03:24.219> is<00:03:24.400> gonna<00:03:24.519> be

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
the lair the kind of layer is gonna be

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.559 
the lair the kind of layer is gonna be
linear<00:03:25.239> dodge<00:03:25.719> tool<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.030> can<00:03:28.269> be<00:03:28.390> something

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
linear dodge tool so it can be something

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:37.979 
linear dodge tool so it can be something
like<00:03:28.719> this<00:03:30.540> that's<00:03:31.540> one<00:03:31.780> way<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:31.989> do<00:03:32.319> it<00:03:36.989> and

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
like this that's one way to do it and

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.080 
like this that's one way to do it and
then<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.739> can<00:03:38.889> play<00:03:39.069> with<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.430> intensity<00:03:39.939> of

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
then you can play with the intensity of

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.110 
then you can play with the intensity of
everything<00:03:41.049> just<00:03:41.650> have<00:03:41.859> to<00:03:42.010> be<00:03:42.219> that<00:03:42.659> intense

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
everything just have to be that intense

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.890 
everything just have to be that intense
okay<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:46.359> that's<00:03:46.870> one<00:03:47.170> thing<00:03:47.909> but<00:03:48.909> that's<00:03:49.629> not

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
okay so that's one thing but that's not

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.929 
okay so that's one thing but that's not
the<00:03:50.079> only<00:03:50.139> thing<00:03:50.590> if<00:03:50.829> you<00:03:51.040> have<00:03:51.250> this<00:03:51.549> kind<00:03:51.819> of

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
the only thing if you have this kind of

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.300 
the only thing if you have this kind of
light<00:03:52.209> looking<00:03:52.840> like<00:03:53.019> this<00:03:53.260> really<00:03:54.129> really

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
light looking like this really really

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.110 
light looking like this really really
bright<00:03:54.700> in<00:03:55.480> your<00:03:55.900> camera<00:03:56.620> is<00:03:57.159> going<00:03:57.549> to<00:03:57.730> happen

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
bright in your camera is going to happen

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.250 
bright in your camera is going to happen
is<00:03:58.510> that<00:03:59.609> that<00:04:00.609> same<00:04:01.000> pattern<00:04:01.480> is<00:04:01.840> going<00:04:02.139> to

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
is that that same pattern is going to

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.690 
is that that same pattern is going to
repeat<00:04:02.620> itself<00:04:06.989> something<00:04:07.989> like<00:04:08.319> this<00:04:08.560> on<00:04:09.430> the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
repeat itself something like this on the

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.170 
repeat itself something like this on the
sides<00:04:09.969> that<00:04:10.450> happens<00:04:11.349> if<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:11.950> watch<00:04:12.430> the

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
layer that's come on the screen that

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.350 
layer that's come on the screen that
looks<00:04:25.479> kind<00:04:26.020> of<00:04:26.110> like<00:04:26.169> this<00:04:26.940> stuff<00:04:27.940> like<00:04:28.150> that

her shape of the lights already like

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.450 
her shape of the lights already like
something<00:04:43.330> square<00:04:43.870> let's<00:04:44.409> see<00:04:44.650> that<00:04:44.979> these

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
something square let's see that these

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.580 
something square let's see that these
are<00:04:45.669> some<00:04:45.849> lights<00:04:46.090> are<00:04:46.509> on<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.990> ceiling<00:04:47.440> or

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
are some lights are on the ceiling or

something<00:04:47.979> like<00:04:48.099> that

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
something like that

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:57.700 
something like that
let's<00:04:50.050> make<00:04:50.259> it<00:04:50.289> like<00:04:50.560> little<00:04:50.949> squares

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.180 

so<00:04:58.280> he's<00:04:58.520> taking<00:04:58.850> so<00:04:59.030> long<00:04:59.680> this<00:05:00.680> is<00:05:00.770> recording

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
so he's taking so long this is recording

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:08.129 
so he's taking so long this is recording
his<00:05:01.310> life<00:05:04.360> okay<00:05:05.360> so<00:05:05.500> we<00:05:06.500> have<00:05:06.650> this<00:05:06.830> little

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
his life okay so we have this little

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:16.300 
his life okay so we have this little
square<00:05:09.139> looking<00:05:09.560> lights<00:05:13.630> and<00:05:14.889> I<00:05:15.889> want<00:05:16.130> them

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
square looking lights and I want them

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:23.219 
square looking lights and I want them
with<00:05:16.910> flair<00:05:17.240> so<00:05:17.660> let's<00:05:18.080> make<00:05:18.500> these<00:05:18.979> blue<00:05:19.340> ones

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.029 

so<00:05:24.229> let's<00:05:24.560> say<00:05:24.860> something<00:05:25.400> like<00:05:25.580> this<00:05:25.759> right

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
so let's say something like this right

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.129 
so let's say something like this right
another<00:05:28.039> way<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.250> do<00:05:28.520> it<00:05:28.550> is<00:05:29.030> let's<00:05:29.570> make<00:05:30.110> a

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
another way to do it is let's make a

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:38.469 
another way to do it is let's make a
glow<00:05:30.650> effect<00:05:33.550> like<00:05:34.550> big<00:05:37.090> is<00:05:38.090> there<00:05:38.270> going<00:05:38.389> to

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
glow effect like big is there going to

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.379 
glow effect like big is there going to
be<00:05:38.570> a<00:05:38.690> nice<00:05:38.930> way<00:05:39.110> I'm<00:05:39.289> gonna<00:05:39.410> have<00:05:39.590> to<00:05:39.740> copy

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
be a nice way I'm gonna have to copy

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.140 
be a nice way I'm gonna have to copy
maybe<00:05:41.389> I<00:05:41.510> can<00:05:42.050> put<00:05:42.889> it<00:05:42.979> together<00:05:43.150> something

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
maybe I can put it together something

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.050 
maybe I can put it together something
like<00:05:44.449> this<00:05:44.830> and<00:05:45.830> then<00:05:46.479> take<00:05:47.479> this<00:05:47.750> one<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:48.320> put

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
like this and then take this one and put

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:55.300 
like this and then take this one and put
let's<00:05:50.060> make<00:05:50.330> it<00:05:51.070> blur<00:05:52.070> and<00:05:54.010> directional<00:05:55.010> blur

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
let's make it blur and directional blur

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.990 
let's make it blur and directional blur
motion<00:05:56.270> blur<00:05:56.539> is<00:05:56.750> called<00:05:57.169> in<00:05:57.410> Photoshop<00:05:58.370> so

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
motion blur is called in Photoshop so

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.719 
motion blur is called in Photoshop so
it's<00:05:59.150> something<00:05:59.300> like<00:05:59.539> this<00:05:59.780> see<00:06:00.289> and<00:06:00.729> that

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
it's something like this see and that

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.100 
it's something like this see and that
way<00:06:01.880> you<00:06:01.940> can<00:06:02.240> just<00:06:02.570> make<00:06:03.560> it<00:06:04.360> it<00:06:05.360> comes<00:06:05.720> it

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
way you can just make it it comes it

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.990 
way you can just make it it comes it
comes<00:06:06.199> out<00:06:06.620> with<00:06:06.860> little<00:06:06.979> variations<00:06:07.729> and<00:06:07.940> you

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
comes out with little variations and you

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.370 
comes out with little variations and you
can<00:06:08.810> do<00:06:08.960> it<00:06:09.760> something<00:06:10.760> like<00:06:11.060> this<00:06:11.380> looks

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
can do it something like this looks

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.850 
can do it something like this looks
really<00:06:12.650> cool<00:06:13.599> I<00:06:14.599> need<00:06:15.380> I<00:06:15.830> need<00:06:15.889> it<00:06:16.130> to<00:06:16.250> be<00:06:16.460> I

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
really cool I need I need it to be I

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.560 
really cool I need I need it to be I
need<00:06:18.860> to<00:06:18.919> borrow<00:06:19.340> a<00:06:19.490> little<00:06:19.520> more<00:06:19.940> Sun<00:06:20.150> go<00:06:20.330> I'm

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
need to borrow a little more Sun go I'm

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.219 
need to borrow a little more Sun go I'm
going<00:06:20.840> to<00:06:20.960> copy<00:06:21.169> the<00:06:21.380> original<00:06:21.800> ones<00:06:22.070> and<00:06:23.229> make

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
going to copy the original ones and make

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:29.409 
going to copy the original ones and make
it<00:06:25.510> put<00:06:26.510> some<00:06:26.720> glue<00:06:26.930> on<00:06:26.960> them<00:06:27.320> again<00:06:28.090> but<00:06:29.090> less

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
it put some glue on them again but less

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.379 
it put some glue on them again but less
something<00:06:29.960> like<00:06:30.110> this<00:06:30.639> will<00:06:31.639> be<00:06:31.760> good<00:06:31.940> okay

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:32.389 
something like this will be good okay

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.800 
something like this will be good okay
and<00:06:32.900> make<00:06:33.349> it<00:06:33.560> linear<00:06:34.099> dodge<00:06:34.490> again<00:06:34.810> yeah

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
and make it linear dodge again yeah

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.520 
and make it linear dodge again yeah
something<00:06:36.260> like<00:06:36.289> that

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:48.059 

maybe<00:06:39.530> a<00:06:39.680> big<00:06:40.010> one<00:06:41.169> with<00:06:42.169> a<00:06:42.229> soft<00:06:42.710> brush

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:48.069 

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:50.399 

it's<00:06:48.639> really<00:06:48.969> until<00:06:49.270> until<00:06:49.839> it<00:06:49.960> looked<00:06:50.199> like

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:50.409 
it's really until until it looked like

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.420 
it's really until until it looked like
like<00:06:50.740> you<00:06:50.979> want<00:06:51.189> like<00:06:51.490> you<00:06:51.669> wanted<00:06:52.059> to<00:06:52.150> look

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
like you want like you wanted to look

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.999 
like you want like you wanted to look
but<00:06:54.430> you<00:06:54.879> can<00:06:55.029> see<00:06:55.210> how<00:06:55.619> simple<00:06:56.619> techniques

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:57.009 
but you can see how simple techniques

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:01.980 
but you can see how simple techniques
can<00:06:57.430> make<00:06:57.699> this<00:06:57.939> look<00:06:59.909> well<00:07:00.939> not<00:07:01.419> believable

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
can make this look well not believable

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.139 
can make this look well not believable
because<00:07:02.499> it<00:07:02.860> still<00:07:03.189> doesn't<00:07:03.729> look<00:07:03.849> like<00:07:04.029> a

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:04.149 
because it still doesn't look like a

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:08.639 
because it still doesn't look like a
real<00:07:04.389> fair<00:07:04.809> but<00:07:05.110> it<00:07:06.099> gives<00:07:06.369> you<00:07:06.490> some<00:07:07.649> some

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:08.649 
real fair but it gives you some some

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:12.779 
real fair but it gives you some some
idea<00:07:09.270> is<00:07:10.270> nice<00:07:11.139> for<00:07:11.409> concept<00:07:11.889> is<00:07:12.009> really<00:07:12.460> quick

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:12.789 
idea is nice for concept is really quick

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:21.019 
idea is nice for concept is really quick
to<00:07:12.939> use<00:07:12.969> and<00:07:14.309> then<00:07:15.309> you<00:07:15.639> can<00:07:15.789> take<00:07:16.680> this<00:07:17.680> same

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:21.029 

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:25.950
