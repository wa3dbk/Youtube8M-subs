00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
to do a lot of the things we usually do

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.849

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
snow drift and then possibly go to the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.980 
snow drift and then possibly go to the
sled<00:04:44.340> dog<00:04:44.490> race<00:04:44.670> the<00:04:44.910> next<00:04:45.300> day<00:04:45.480> but<00:04:45.900> we

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
sled dog race the next day but we

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.300

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
eyes probably look horrible because I'm

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.580

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
yet

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.760 
yet
but<00:04:57.390> it's<00:04:57.540> almost<00:04:57.690> over<00:04:57.990> it's<00:04:58.230> getting<00:04:58.500> it's
