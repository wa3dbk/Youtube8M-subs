00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.640
 so hello everybody first of all 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.200
 good start of the summer I received several 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.700
 messages go on fire boutin I have not 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.130
 saw something on my room I 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.270
 am really sorry I was busy 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.320
 as if it were how I told myself 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.390
 a capsule in natural light 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.340
 recovery is then very simple 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.500
 Today I went up stuff a 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.410
 Exposure to slip on spot metering 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.510
 the idea is going to be to detach a subject 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.640
 principal in the sun of a work in 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.280
 gross got a kind of textures 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.230
 a canvas away then the fleet to anyone 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.190
 to photograph them the subject is worth 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.530
 really come out 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.120
 we will play explains the break m I 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.730
 got some explanations after his 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.870
 catching catane perso personally I 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.629
 invite him to practice this technique 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.949
 water every morning as soon as a 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.440
 really softer sun or in the end 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.629
 by noon near what I will be at 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.089
 golden sun that will really give a 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.409
 beautiful rendering it is that at noon one o'clock 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.350
 which is what it is up stronger 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:17.649
 it's more complicated the pixels the fault 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:19.060
 to technical data so first 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.820
 to do is to look for the subject 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.020
 admit to the sun like this one see 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.479
 branch with leaves 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.619
 there is some teaching on 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.060
 if we look back there this is 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.799
 completely to the shepherds 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.820
 the idea is going to be one now with the 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.890
 programming I showed you 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.049
 business a measure sent his 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.619
 collimator on the leaf makes it its 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.810
 focus 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.450
 so the collimator state the little collar 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.890
 red that you see appear in 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.990
 your device that makes it a 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.240
 point 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.740
 when you put the pardon the button to 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.420
 halfway it's a beep beep and a 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.780
 red collimator that turns on him 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.220
 shows me 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.740
 he's doing his development so that she has 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.600
 done here be nine years this morning on 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.070
 measure spot the collimator the voice 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.580
 calculated only the light that 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.080
 go back to the sheet 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.860
 if I will put on the evaluative measure 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.259
 what would happen is that a 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.259
 would calculate and age and sun shade 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:12.410
 who would try to make me a total of 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.790
 2 to have an exhibition anyway 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.470
 adequate what he would do so that 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.709
 as he take into consideration the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.569
 shadows well I 'll see the fund in 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.430
 bespoke spot that have me 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.750
 clogging on the sheet to make sure that 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.880
 a few the enemy has so far he's not going 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.290
 consider the fund as a great 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.540
 difference in lighting between the two 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.940
 squares view is that the format become 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.680
 completely black or almost so at this 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.220
 moment there my leaf arm completely 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.110
 out batch detach from the funds and 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.760
 can I have a really 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.200
 awesome you can do too with a 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.730
 no one are you putting the person in front of 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.950
 sun and then make sure that 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.850
 background is engaged you put 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.410
 custom spot 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.480
 it 'll give you exactly the same 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.470
 photo not happy it's the pair must 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.150
 everything I climbed technical 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.220
 so here I wish to install 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.989
 very simple all given 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.519
 specifications that I did ok I got 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.079
 I am at 100 iso bravo the most beautiful 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.670
 light possible so avoid having 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.299
 noise way it's a nice day 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.610
 sunny 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.930
 so I started at 6.3 because 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.630
 it's the depth of field that I 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.420
 wanted to have for to make out my 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.430
 subject actually I 'm really influential 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.320
 in the background I'm close so my 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.730
 opening a person that is not too much 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.579
 dark then I like to keep a little bit 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.040
 maneuvering for me speed here you 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.380
 see people pose but less three more 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.290
 three and then 0 so a portal is 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:31.130
 very simple if I'm at -3 I'm under 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.170
 exposed if I'm a +3 the photo is going 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.959
 to be his presentation would I give myself some 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:42.200
 examples overexposure under exposure 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.670
 do not know what is looking so the idea is going 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.049
 to be with my speeds I keep myself when 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.970
 even a little maneuver because there is 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.620
 ten years in the photo left the one 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.200
 focus the idea is very nervous to 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.019
 0 but what I want is to do 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.000
 take out my leaf from my bottom of the coffee there 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.980
 is in the sun then the fund is committed 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.770
 the one in focus but I 'm going to go 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.390
 a tick below 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.860
 the diptychs is that this universe there 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.290
 also we must not forget that the point 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.270
 important of the capsule is that I 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.580
 am tailor made spot so the goes 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.380
 calculate that for that light or 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.970
 almost returning on my sheet in this 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.190
 is happy long all that is in 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.170
 governed backwards if I would have started 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.660
 evaluative measure the squer effect there 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.280
 would have calculated about 60% on my subject 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.650
 hot water has developed but there 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.000
 would have as a calculation and shading 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.170
 gabon 10 calculated we speak of the pole mail 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.060
 reveals him the client light 60% middle 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.090
 40% auto but that's because I want 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.430
 so come back to expats like this here 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.200
 path in focus I am a bar 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.590
 below zero what he will do in 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.710
 so she did it go out go see 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.750
 to this complement detach from this fund and 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.770
 then my child and shady here I am 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.290
 found that everything 5 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:05:00.460
 then you can practice it very very 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:13.440
 very easily if you have any 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:19.150
 questions you can subscribe to 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.560
 ask questions of this video in 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.150
 the comments I guarantee I 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.800
 answer this app 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.350
 it's worth it but also health 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.180
 refusing so thank you is killed 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.980
 promised I will strive for reports 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.790
 coming because according to aline very soon 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.790
 have a good day
