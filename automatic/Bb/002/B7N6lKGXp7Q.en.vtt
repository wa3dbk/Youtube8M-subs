00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.439 

when<00:00:13.290> we<00:00:13.410> started<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.860> 918<00:00:14.429> spyder<00:00:14.880> project

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.120 

we<00:00:18.449> decided<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.230> will<00:00:19.650> try<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:19.980> keep<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.520> secret

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
we decided we will try to keep it secret

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.660 
we decided we will try to keep it secret
it<00:00:24.130> is<00:00:25.860> for<00:00:26.860> the<00:00:27.040> future<00:00:27.250> of<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:28.300> brand<00:00:28.570> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
it is for the future of the brand the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.670 
it is for the future of the brand the
importance<00:00:30.670> of<00:00:30.850> this<00:00:31.029> car<00:00:31.390> was<00:00:31.840> that<00:00:32.290> due<00:00:32.619> to

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
importance of this car was that due to

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.390 
importance of this car was that due to
the<00:00:32.980> environmental<00:00:33.580> discussion<00:00:35.250> there<00:00:36.250> were

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
the environmental discussion there were

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.750 
the environmental discussion there were
big<00:00:37.090> big<00:00:37.360> question<00:00:37.570> marks<00:00:38.380> about<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.250> future

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
big big question marks about the future

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.549 
big big question marks about the future
of<00:00:40.120> this<00:00:40.420> type<00:00:40.809> of<00:00:40.840> cars

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:01:01.060 

of<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:45.070> future<00:00:45.489> of<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:45.699> portion<00:00:46.149> brain

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.160 

so<00:01:01.790> therefore<00:01:02.240> we<00:01:02.390> wanted<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:02.840> have<00:01:03.020> this

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
so therefore we wanted to have this

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:29.960 
so therefore we wanted to have this
symbol<00:01:03.470> that<00:01:04.190> there<00:01:04.489> is<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.760> future

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.730 

we<00:01:30.970> are<00:01:31.090> using<00:01:31.299> a<00:01:31.600> technology<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.530> is

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
we are using a technology that is

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.500 
we are using a technology that is
pointing<00:01:33.220> out<00:01:33.340> what<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:33.850> could<00:01:34.030> be<00:01:34.240> in<00:01:34.360> the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
pointing out what it could be in the

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.020 
pointing out what it could be in the
future<00:01:34.690> but<00:01:34.930> is<00:01:35.350> still<00:01:35.650> realistic<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.729> have<00:01:36.909> it

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
future but is still realistic to have it

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:46.590 
future but is still realistic to have it
already<00:01:37.240> today<00:01:37.960> in<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.619> car<00:01:44.850> we've<00:01:45.850> tested<00:01:46.240> in

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
already today in the car we've tested in

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.350 
already today in the car we've tested in
the<00:01:46.750> race<00:01:46.930> I'm<00:01:47.470> only<00:01:47.649> sure<00:01:48.040> that<00:01:48.310> is<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:49.180> right

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
the race I'm only sure that is the right

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.630 
the race I'm only sure that is the right
technology<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.290> right<00:01:50.490> combination<00:01:51.490> of

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
technology the right combination of

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.410 
technology the right combination of
components<00:01:52.470> when<00:01:53.470> we<00:01:53.619> go<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:54.070> next<00:01:54.100> step<00:01:54.420> into

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
components when we go the next step into

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.210 
components when we go the next step into
the<00:01:55.630> production<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:59.440> most<00:01:59.590> important

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
the production the most important

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.639 
the production the most important
message<00:02:00.640> is<00:02:00.850> that<00:02:01.200> there<00:02:02.200> is<00:02:02.410> no

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
message is that there is no

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.260 
message is that there is no
contradiction<00:02:03.070> anymore<00:02:03.850> between

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
contradiction anymore between

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.200 
contradiction anymore between
performance<00:02:05.020> between<00:02:05.710> having<00:02:06.160> fun<00:02:06.520> driving<00:02:06.970> a

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
performance between having fun driving a

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.419 
performance between having fun driving a
car<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:08.350> whole<00:02:08.590> environmental

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
car and this whole environmental

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.690 
car and this whole environmental
discussion

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.910 

it<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.270> me<00:02:17.420> combining<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.319> backdrop<00:02:18.890> of

it is me combining the backdrop of
