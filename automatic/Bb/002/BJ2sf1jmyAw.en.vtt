going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> go<00:01:56.579> straight<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:57.210> there<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.570> I

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
going to go straight up there and if I

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.950 
going to go straight up there and if I
turn<00:01:57.960> these<00:01:58.200> over<00:01:58.549> they<00:01:59.549> should<00:01:59.790> already<00:02:00.000> have

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
turn these over they should already have

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.750 
turn these over they should already have
I<00:02:00.990> mean<00:02:01.530> they're<00:02:01.680> already<00:02:01.950> getting<00:02:02.220> griddle

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
I mean they're already getting griddle

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.120 
I mean they're already getting griddle
but<00:02:03.330> if<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.020> now<00:02:04.170> turn<00:02:04.500> them<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> other<00:02:05.010> way

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
but if you now turn them the other way

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.010 
but if you now turn them the other way
they're<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.299> end<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:06.600> with<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.840> really

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
they're going to end up with a really

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.559 
they're going to end up with a really
nice<00:02:07.290> lattice<00:02:07.860> by<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.160> end<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.490> it<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.539> that

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
nice lattice by the end of it so that

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.240 
nice lattice by the end of it so that
goes<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.380> you<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.340> maybe<00:02:11.990> so<00:02:13.250> however

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
goes on for you know maybe so however

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.040 
goes on for you know maybe so however
hot<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.300> case<00:02:15.540> it's<00:02:15.870> only

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
hot it is but in this case it's only

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.830 
hot it is but in this case it's only
going<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.380> matter<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.830> seconds<00:02:17.840> it's

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
going to be a matter of seconds it's

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.120 
going to be a matter of seconds it's
always<00:02:19.020> best<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.440> put<00:02:20.130> these<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.610> wire<00:02:21.239> rack

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
always best to put these on a wire rack

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.210 
always best to put these on a wire rack
and<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.280> reason<00:02:23.580> we<00:02:23.670> do<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:25.220> because

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
and the reason we do that is because

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.500 
and the reason we do that is because
there's<00:02:26.400> quite<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.580> lot<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.819> steam<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.150> they'll

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
there's quite a lot of steam and they'll

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.510 
there's quite a lot of steam and they'll
just<00:02:27.690> go<00:02:27.870> soggy<00:02:28.170> put<00:02:28.770> them<00:02:28.860> flush<00:02:29.069> on<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
just go soggy put them flush on the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.360 
just go soggy put them flush on the
table<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.239> next<00:02:30.540> part<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.959> this<00:02:31.080> job<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.680> work

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
table the next part of this job is work

bend over so what I've got here are the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.850 
bend over so what I've got here are the
peppers<00:02:40.920> ah<00:02:41.130> yes<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.880> peppers<00:02:42.560> see<00:02:43.560> if<00:02:43.620> we<00:02:43.680> can

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
peppers ah yes the peppers see if we can

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.240 
peppers ah yes the peppers see if we can
get<00:02:43.980> those<00:02:44.269> here<00:02:45.269> we<00:02:45.360> go<00:02:45.830> now<00:02:46.830> what<00:02:47.040> should

practically just pinch off that outer

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.990 
practically just pinch off that outer
skin<00:02:54.989> which<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.530> no<00:02:55.680> use<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:56.100> anyone<00:02:56.400> and

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000

now what we'll do see funny now I've
changed<00:03:22.080> my<00:03:22.260> mind<00:03:22.290> i<00:03:22.680> think<00:03:22.890> what<00:03:23.340> what's<00:03:23.580> even

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
changed my mind i think what what's even

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.690 
changed my mind i think what what's even
nicer<00:03:24.030> if<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:25.110> just<00:03:25.349> spread<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.680> go<00:03:26.099> to<00:03:26.160> make

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
nicer if you just spread that go to make

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.449 
nicer if you just spread that go to make
down<00:03:26.940> I'm<00:03:27.209> making<00:03:27.450> this<00:03:27.750> up<00:03:27.810> as<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.200> go<00:03:28.230> along<00:03:28.459> if

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
down I'm making this up as I go along if

down I'm making this up as I go along if
you<00:03:29.580> spread<00:03:29.849> that<00:03:29.910> goat<00:03:30.300> cheese<00:03:30.660> on<00:03:30.870> much

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
you spread that goat cheese on much

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.320 
you spread that goat cheese on much
nicer<00:03:31.830> isn't<00:03:32.099> it<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.550> now<00:03:32.670> we<00:03:32.730> can<00:03:32.970> just<00:03:33.000> roll

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
nicer isn't it and now we can just roll

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.059 
nicer isn't it and now we can just roll
that<00:03:33.480> are<00:03:34.220> like<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:36.690> over<00:03:36.930> here<00:03:37.200> what

I've done is I've got some toothpicks
which<00:03:42.330> I've<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:42.660> left<00:03:42.870> in<00:03:43.230> some<00:03:43.890> water<00:03:44.340> and
