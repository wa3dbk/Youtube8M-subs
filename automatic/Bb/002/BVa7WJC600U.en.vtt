is<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.299> package<00:02:26.480> but<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.989> bunch<00:02:27.230> of

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
is in the package but a bunch of

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.740 
is in the package but a bunch of
mumbo-jumbo<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.400> will<00:02:28.670> take<00:02:29.269> a<00:02:29.299> look<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:29.720> i

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
mumbo-jumbo I will take a look so i

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.509

guess<00:02:29.989> it's<00:02:30.230> for<00:02:30.560> exclusive<00:02:31.099> single-player

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
guess it's for exclusive single-player

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.699 
guess it's for exclusive single-player
missions<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:32.090> playstation<00:02:32.690> 3<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.110> there<00:02:33.620> you

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
cool but this is looks like basically

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.759 
cool but this is looks like basically
what<00:03:28.609> you<00:03:28.819> would<00:03:28.970> get<00:03:29.209> if<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:30.440> bought<00:03:30.620> the

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
what you would get if you bought the

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.479 
what you would get if you bought the
game<00:03:30.889> normally<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:32.079> little<00:03:33.079> pamphlet<00:03:33.410> here<00:03:33.530> so

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
game normally a little pamphlet here so

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.699 
game normally a little pamphlet here so
this<00:03:34.669> is<00:03:34.819> what<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.209> new<00:03:35.569> playstation<00:03:36.319> slim

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
this is what the new playstation slim

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.309 
this is what the new playstation slim
looks<00:03:36.980> like<00:03:37.190> it's<00:03:37.760> pretty<00:03:38.030> interesting<00:03:38.419> not

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
looks like it's pretty interesting not

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.460 
looks like it's pretty interesting not
so<00:03:39.680> sure<00:03:39.919> if<00:03:40.069> I<00:03:40.160> like<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.700> style<00:03:41.000> of<00:03:41.269> it<00:03:41.480> it's

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
so sure if I like the style of it it's

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.089 
so sure if I like the style of it it's
definitely<00:03:42.769> lighter<00:03:43.690> definitely<00:03:44.690> lighter

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
definitely lighter definitely lighter

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.009 
definitely lighter definitely lighter
smaller<00:03:46.099> I<00:03:46.849> actually<00:03:47.449> had<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.930> original

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
smaller I actually had the original

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.849 
smaller I actually had the original
version<00:03:48.859> that<00:03:49.310> big<00:03:49.549> old<00:03:49.730> bulky<00:03:50.209> ones<00:03:50.389> so<00:03:50.859> this

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
version that big old bulky ones so this

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.740 
version that big old bulky ones so this
is<00:03:52.040> nice<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.459> have<00:03:52.639> that<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:53.180> then<00:03:53.449> I<00:03:53.569> guess

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
is nice to have that and then I guess
