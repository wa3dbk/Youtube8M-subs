one<00:00:35.379> I<00:00:35.410> actually<00:00:35.649> took<00:00:35.950> out<00:00:36.160> of<00:00:36.190> that<00:00:36.460> one<00:00:36.700> was

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
one I actually took out of that one was

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.860 
one I actually took out of that one was
crushed<00:00:37.480> and<00:00:38.410> it<00:00:38.950> was<00:00:39.129> not<00:00:39.390> letting<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.629> cam

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
crushed and it was not letting the cam

timing advanced correctly and the actual

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.060 
timing advanced correctly and the actual
car<00:00:44.949> actually<00:00:45.430> shook<00:00:46.230> causing<00:00:49.710> causing<00:00:50.710> it<00:00:50.980> to

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
car actually shook causing causing it to

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.740 
car actually shook causing causing it to
throw<00:00:51.309> that<00:00:51.520> code<00:00:51.820> so<00:00:52.420> it<00:00:52.510> didn't<00:00:52.750> run<00:00:52.870> right

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
throw that code so it didn't run right

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.819 
throw that code so it didn't run right
this<00:00:55.750> one<00:00:56.020> is<00:00:56.320> out<00:00:56.890> of<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.280> turbo<00:00:57.789> banjo<00:00:58.269> and

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
this one is out of the turbo banjo and

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.099 
this one is out of the turbo banjo and
you<00:00:59.829> can<00:01:00.039> see<00:01:00.309> I<00:01:00.670> can<00:01:01.090> kind<00:01:01.329> of<00:01:01.390> see<00:01:01.570> there's<00:01:01.960> a

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
you can see I can kind of see there's a

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.540 
you can see I can kind of see there's a
little<00:01:02.350> bit<00:01:02.469> of<00:01:02.620> debris<00:01:02.980> in<00:01:03.129> there<00:01:03.309> it's<00:01:03.460> not

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
little bit of debris in there it's not

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.350 
little bit of debris in there it's not
too<00:01:03.820> bad<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:05.140> that<00:01:05.170> is<00:01:05.650> not<00:01:05.890> why<00:01:06.220> this<00:01:06.910> turbo

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
too bad so that is not why this turbo

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.180 
too bad so that is not why this turbo
here

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
here

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.660 
here
was<00:01:09.190> shot<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.990> that's<00:01:11.380> definitely<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.980> reason

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
was shot but that's definitely a reason

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.080 
was shot but that's definitely a reason
why<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:12.880> can<00:01:13.300> be<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:17.430> lot<00:01:18.430> of<00:01:18.520> times<00:01:18.760> guys<00:01:19.030> will

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
why it can be a lot of times guys will

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.030 
why it can be a lot of times guys will
replace<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.930> up<00:01:20.080> pipes<00:01:20.380> in<00:01:20.590> these<00:01:20.740> cars

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
replace the up pipes in these cars

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.500 
replace the up pipes in these cars
because<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:23.110> oh<00:01:23.470> five<00:01:23.710> 207<00:01:24.430> legacies<00:01:24.970> of<00:01:25.000> pipe

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
because the oh five 207 legacies of pipe

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.450 
because the oh five 207 legacies of pipe
actually<00:01:26.110> contained<00:01:26.650> a<00:01:26.830> catalytic<00:01:27.310> converter

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
actually contained a catalytic converter

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.750 
actually contained a catalytic converter
and<00:01:29.760> that<00:01:30.760> is<00:01:30.910> an<00:01:31.090> eg<00:01:31.600> teeth<00:01:32.280> sensor<00:01:33.280> I<00:01:33.310> believe

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
and that is an eg teeth sensor I believe

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.640 
and that is an eg teeth sensor I believe
for<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.180> cat<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:35.160> a<00:01:36.160> few<00:01:36.790> things<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:38.380> these

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
for the cat and a few things with these

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:47.120 
for the cat and a few things with these
is<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:42.100> cat<00:01:42.340> can<00:01:42.580> actually<00:01:42.970> break<00:01:43.240> apart

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.240 

there<00:01:48.130> it<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.400> there<00:01:48.730> and<00:01:49.830> if<00:01:50.830> you<00:01:50.920> think<00:01:51.130> about

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
there it is there and if you think about

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.760 
there it is there and if you think about
it<00:01:51.550> if<00:01:51.700> that<00:01:51.880> breaks<00:01:52.180> apart<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.840> there<00:01:53.050> it's

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
it if that breaks apart in there it's

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.430 
it if that breaks apart in there it's
gonna<00:01:54.040> blow<00:01:54.340> straight<00:01:54.910> into<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.540> turbo<00:01:55.930> which

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
gonna blow straight into the turbo which

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.860 
gonna blow straight into the turbo which
will<00:01:57.190> definitely<00:01:57.540> blow<00:01:58.540> it<00:01:58.780> I<00:02:00.510> replaced<00:02:01.510> the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
will definitely blow it I replaced the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:09.940 
will definitely blow it I replaced the
stock<00:02:02.800> with<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.160> parent<00:02:04.380> catalyst<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.590> pipe

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.590 

now<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.220> replaced<00:02:11.940> my<00:02:12.150> turbo<00:02:12.690> yesterday

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
now I just replaced my turbo yesterday

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.660 
now I just replaced my turbo yesterday
this<00:02:15.600> being<00:02:15.930> why<00:02:16.200> when<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:16.830> did<00:02:17.069> my<00:02:17.220> out<00:02:17.400> pipe

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
this being why when I did my out pipe

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.930 
this being why when I did my out pipe
install<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:19.250> thought<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.280> would<00:02:20.550> check<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
install I thought I would check the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.830 
install I thought I would check the
shaft<00:02:21.209> play<00:02:21.510> well<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:24.209> look<00:02:24.330> at<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.570> blades

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
shaft play well you look at the blades

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.500 
shaft play well you look at the blades
in<00:02:25.050> there<00:02:26.870> they're<00:02:27.870> actually<00:02:27.990> curled<00:02:28.650> over

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
in there they're actually curled over

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
in there they're actually curled over
and<00:02:31.880> that<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.360> not<00:02:34.050> normal<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:36.350> don't<00:02:37.350> know<00:02:37.440> if

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
and that is not normal I don't know if

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.770 
and that is not normal I don't know if
you<00:02:37.620> can<00:02:37.800> see<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.310> video<00:02:38.430> but<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.480> blades

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
you can see in the video but the blades

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:48.590 
you can see in the video but the blades
actually<00:02:40.320> shaved<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:41.070> inside<00:02:41.610> housing<00:02:47.600> the

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
actually shaved the inside housing the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:57.890 
actually shaved the inside housing the
exhaust<00:02:48.959> side<00:02:52.970> didn't<00:02:53.970> look<00:02:54.090> damaged<00:02:56.570> as<00:02:57.570> much

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
exhaust side didn't look damaged as much

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:08.540 
exhaust side didn't look damaged as much
but<00:03:00.530> obviously<00:03:01.940> not<00:03:02.940> good<00:03:04.670> also<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:08.280> shaft

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
but obviously not good also the shaft

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.729 
but obviously not good also the shaft
pushes<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.450> out<00:03:09.570> which<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.670> very<00:03:11.670> bad<00:03:11.910> a

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
pushes in and out which is very bad a

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.069 
pushes in and out which is very bad a
good<00:03:13.739> turbo<00:03:14.130> will<00:03:14.870> slightly<00:03:15.870> move<00:03:18.079> probably

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
good turbo will slightly move probably

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.199 
good turbo will slightly move probably
that<00:03:19.950> much<00:03:20.360> not<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:22.970> because<00:03:23.970> these<00:03:24.150> are

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
that much not that because these are

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.590 
that much not that because these are
floating<00:03:24.840> bearings<00:03:26.060> so<00:03:27.060> they<00:03:27.180> will<00:03:27.360> always

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
floating bearings so they will always

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.789 
floating bearings so they will always
have<00:03:28.340> some<00:03:29.340> shaft<00:03:29.850> play<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:31.560> didn't

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
have some shaft play but you didn't

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.910

really<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.100> to<00:03:32.250> look<00:03:32.340> closely<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:34.590> still

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920

play<00:04:04.709> in<00:04:04.859> my<00:04:05.010> opinion<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:06.019> down<00:04:07.019> side<00:04:07.320> side

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
play in my opinion is a down side side

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.160 
play in my opinion is a down side side
just<00:04:09.690> remove<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.200> down<00:04:10.440> pipe<00:04:10.890> and<00:04:11.840> just<00:04:12.840> stick

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
just remove the down pipe and just stick

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.710 
just remove the down pipe and just stick
your<00:04:13.290> hand<00:04:13.350> down<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.180> feel<00:04:15.180> for<00:04:15.360> any<00:04:15.420> shaft

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
your hand down and feel for any shaft

your hand down and feel for any shaft
play<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.940> there's<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.030> couple<00:04:18.209> bolts<00:04:18.479> on<00:04:18.720> the

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
play and there's a couple bolts on the

and a couple bolts on a bracket holding
the<00:04:22.580> exhaust<00:04:22.910> so<00:04:23.120> you're<00:04:23.240> gonna<00:04:23.360> have<00:04:23.480> to

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
the exhaust so you're gonna have to

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.750 
the exhaust so you're gonna have to
remove<00:04:23.840> those<00:04:24.080> underneath<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.650> car<00:04:24.889> and<00:04:25.190> then

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
remove those underneath the car and then

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.670 
remove those underneath the car and then
you<00:04:25.850> can<00:04:26.000> just<00:04:26.240> slide<00:04:26.510> down<00:04:26.840> pipe<00:04:27.290> right<00:04:27.500> off

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
you can just slide down pipe right off

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.150 
you can just slide down pipe right off
and<00:04:27.889> just<00:04:28.070> drop<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:28.460> down<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:29.800> another<00:04:30.800> thing

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
and just drop it down and another thing

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.800 
and just drop it down and another thing
you<00:04:32.169> just<00:04:33.169> want<00:04:33.290> to<00:04:33.350> make<00:04:33.530> sure<00:04:34.449> that<00:04:35.449> this

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
you just want to make sure that this

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.580 
you just want to make sure that this
hose

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
hose

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.370 
hose
it's<00:04:36.740> a<00:04:36.830> coolant<00:04:37.160> line<00:04:37.479> and<00:04:38.479> make<00:04:38.810> sure<00:04:39.080> it's

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
it's a coolant line and make sure it's

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.080 
it's a coolant line and make sure it's
tight<00:04:39.760> because<00:04:41.500> what<00:04:42.500> I<00:04:42.530> found<00:04:42.889> was<00:04:43.340> it<00:04:43.880> was

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
tight because what I found was it was

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.450 
tight because what I found was it was
actually<00:04:44.270> leaking<00:04:44.900> slowly<00:04:45.290> and<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.310> was

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
actually leaking slowly and it was

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.570 
actually leaking slowly and it was
dripping<00:04:46.880> down<00:04:47.060> onto<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:47.720> inlet<00:04:48.110> hose<00:04:48.490> and<00:04:49.490> it

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
dripping down onto the inlet hose and it

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.790 
dripping down onto the inlet hose and it
actually<00:04:49.760> ate<00:04:50.180> away<00:04:50.360> at<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:51.229> rubber<00:04:51.470> or

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
actually ate away at the rubber or

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.840 
actually ate away at the rubber or
something<00:04:52.430> and<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:53.780> clamp<00:04:54.139> actually<00:04:54.850> was

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
something and the clamp actually was

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.020 
something and the clamp actually was
clamped<00:04:56.270> on<00:04:56.389> the<00:04:56.479> rubber<00:04:56.720> right<00:04:57.470> here<00:04:58.030> clamped

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
clamped on the rubber right here clamped

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.640 
clamped on the rubber right here clamped
onto<00:04:59.150> metal<00:04:59.419> right<00:04:59.810> here<00:04:59.870> because<00:05:00.530> it

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
onto metal right here because it

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.280 
onto metal right here because it
completely<00:05:01.250> split<00:05:01.639> and<00:05:01.970> that's<00:05:02.389> a<00:05:02.570> that's<00:05:02.930> a

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
completely split and that's a that's a

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.190 
completely split and that's a that's a
really<00:05:03.650> bad<00:05:04.210> leak<00:05:05.210> right<00:05:05.450> there<00:05:05.510> the<00:05:06.050> mass

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
really bad leak right there the mass

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.990 
really bad leak right there the mass
