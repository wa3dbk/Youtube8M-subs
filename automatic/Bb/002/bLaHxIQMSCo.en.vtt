00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.876
 You cast your eyes on this sea of ​​mountains around you 

00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:13.960
 and suddenly you feel so small 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.167
 As if you were nothing 

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:19.875
 David Gottler - Bergsteiger / Alpinist 

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.085
 At the same time it's so good to feel that. 

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:24.250
 It does not scare me. 

00:00:24.918 --> 00:00:26.419
 Now more and more 

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:29.210
 I want to climb on paths that no one has touched. 

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:35.419
 UNKNOWN TERRITORIES 

00:00:40.584 --> 00:00:42.460
 What a grandiose view. 

00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:50.042
 Since 2002 I have made 26 expeditions. 

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:53.125
 I climbed five of the highest peaks in the world 

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:54.918
 without artificial oxygen. 

00:00:55.584 --> 00:00:57.543
 Namaste we are at the top 

00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:04.460
 Something like this is before you 

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:05.918
 and you feel that it attracts you. 

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:09.834
 That's the exploration, I think. 

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.876
 But almost anything you can imagine can go wrong. 

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:24.667
 I was with a Japanese friend, Kazuya. 

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:28.918
 We climbed three days on the north face of Ama Dablam 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:30.501
 and it was really difficult. 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.293
 We suddenly got stuck on this ridge 

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:38.417
 because the snow was so different from what we thought. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.083
 November 6, 2010 

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:45.334
 So we called the helicopter and they came to take me 

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:49.042
 then they went back to get Kazuya. 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.459
 The rotor struck the ridge and the helicopter crashed 

00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:55.960
 and the pilot and co-pilot are dead. 

00:01:56.834 --> 00:02:01.668
 Sabin Basnet and Puna Awale died by the impact. 

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:09.667
 I am still alive thanks to these guys. 

00:02:10.417 --> 00:02:13.459
 To change this story 

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:15.377
 I would do anything 

00:02:15.417 --> 00:02:17.959
 but it's not possible and I have to accept it. 

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:22.084
 Even if it's the darkest moment of my life. 

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:28.084
 Kazuya is saved the next day 

00:02:29.334 --> 00:02:32.751
 We returned to Kathmandu to see their families 

00:02:32.792 --> 00:02:37.001
 The mother told me "OK David, live a happy life ... 

00:02:37.042 --> 00:02:41.376
 but you must now live the lives of others. " 

00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:43.126
 And you look in the eyes of the mother, and you think ... 

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:55.918
 Of course this accident will always be part of my life. 

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:03.376
 But now I want to see more because 

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:04.834
 I have to live for two. 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.875
 This year David will return to the Himalayas 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.668
 And try an off-road route to Everest 

00:03:17.918 --> 00:03:19.836
 Climb Everest by a new way it's 

00:03:19.876 --> 00:03:23.418
 a new stage for me, a whole new level of exploration. 

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.083
 The road to Everest begins now.
