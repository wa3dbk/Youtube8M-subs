00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.230 
might want to go out and purchase an LCD
screen<00:00:23.609> for<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.880> back<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.180> your<00:00:24.240> GoPro<00:00:24.570> camera

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240

screen for the back of your GoPro camera
the<00:00:27.240> biggest<00:00:27.449> drawback<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.320> LCD<00:00:28.740> screen

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the biggest drawback to the LCD screen

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.400 
the biggest drawback to the LCD screen
is<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.490> does<00:00:29.699> at<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.150> fair<00:00:30.660> bit<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.840> mass<00:00:31.109> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
is that it does at a fair bit of mass to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.290 
is that it does at a fair bit of mass to
the<00:00:31.500> back<00:00:31.680> of<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.859> camera<00:00:32.129> the<00:00:32.850> two<00:00:33.000> camera

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the back of the camera the two camera

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.790 
the back of the camera the two camera
side<00:00:33.480> by<00:00:33.629> side<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:34.019> can<00:00:34.199> see<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.559> back

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
side by side we can see that the back

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.340 
side by side we can see that the back
door<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.219> bigger<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.790> there<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.809> little<00:00:37.230> bit

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
door is bigger and there is a little bit

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.420 
door is bigger and there is a little bit
more<00:00:38.210> camera<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> back<00:00:39.920> now<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.340> other

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
more camera on the back now the other

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.100 
more camera on the back now the other
drawback<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.360> doesn't<00:00:42.660> always<00:00:42.899> work

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
drawback is that it doesn't always work

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.560 
drawback is that it doesn't always work
with<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> mouse<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:45.090> another<00:00:45.270> video

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
with all the mouse I have another video

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.299 
with all the mouse I have another video
up<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.079> talks<00:00:46.320> about<00:00:46.440> how<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> chest<00:00:47.129> mount

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
up that talks about how to chest mount

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.840 
up that talks about how to chest mount
with<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.750> LCD<00:00:49.170> screen<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
with the LCD screen because with the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.069 
with the LCD screen because with the
normal<00:00:51.090> chest<00:00:51.329> mount<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.660> use<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> j-hook

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
normal chest mount we use the j-hook

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.819 
normal chest mount we use the j-hook
buckle<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.840> it<00:00:54.840> folds<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.350> against<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> back

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
buckle and it folds up against the back

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
buckle and it folds up against the back
of<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> camera<00:00:56.190> however<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.000> LCD

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
of the camera however with the LCD

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.389 
of the camera however with the LCD
screen<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> more<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.710> more<00:00:58.860> bulk<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
screen and the more the more bulk on the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.880 
screen and the more the more bulk on the
back<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.699> camera<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.660> J<00:01:00.930> buckle<00:01:01.320> doesn't

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
back of the camera the J buckle doesn't

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.160 
back of the camera the J buckle doesn't
work<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.489> same<00:01:02.520> way<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.629> would<00:01:04.050> be<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
work the same way so that would be the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.010 
work the same way so that would be the
drawback<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:05.330> benefits<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.660> it<00:01:06.840> is

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
drawback to it benefits to it is it is

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.390 
drawback to it benefits to it is it is
very<00:01:07.320> nice<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.830> able<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> frame<00:01:08.159> your<00:01:08.340> shot

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
very nice to be able to frame your shot

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.780 
very nice to be able to frame your shot

use it like more like a traditional

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.240 
use it like more like a traditional
video<00:01:35.520> camera<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.299> LCD<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.290> LCD<00:01:37.860> screen<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.189> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
video camera the LCD the LCD screen is a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.890 
video camera the LCD the LCD screen is a
huge<00:01:38.670> help<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.210> situations<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:39.810> that

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
huge help in situations like that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.080 
huge help in situations like that
because<00:01:40.259> i<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.590> actually<00:01:40.890> see<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.970> i'm

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
because i can actually see what i'm

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.590 
because i can actually see what i'm
shooting<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.860> i<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.360> you're<00:01:45.509> just

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
shooting so i think that if you're just

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.950 
shooting so i think that if you're just
using<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> camera<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
using it the camera just as a as a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.300 
using it the camera just as a as a
action<00:01:48.960> camera<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> point<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.979> view

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.980 
action camera or as a point of view
camera<00:01:50.759> you're<00:01:51.329> just<00:01:51.479> going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> mount<00:01:51.840> on

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
camera you're just going to mount on

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.149 
camera you're just going to mount on
yourself<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.500> leave<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.829> one<00:01:53.009> position

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
yourself and leave it in one position

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.160 
yourself and leave it in one position
all<00:01:53.460> day<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.630> fairly<00:01:54.869> good<00:01:54.990> idea

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
all day if you have a fairly good idea

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.050 
all day if you have a fairly good idea
of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.649> shot<00:01:56.280> you're<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.640> get<00:01:56.820> if

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
of the shot you're going to get if

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.999 
of the shot you're going to get if
you've<00:01:57.240> recorded<00:01:57.810> them<00:01:58.049> before<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.860> have

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
you've recorded them before and you have

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.740 
you've recorded them before and you have
a<00:01:59.040> pretty<00:01:59.340> good<00:01:59.399> idea<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.939> what<00:02:00.450> your<00:02:00.570> shots

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
a pretty good idea of what your shots

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.120 
a pretty good idea of what your shots
can<00:02:00.930> look<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.200> probably<00:02:01.799> don't<00:02:02.040> need

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
can look like you probably don't need

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.859 
can look like you probably don't need
the<00:02:02.280> LCD<00:02:02.640> screen<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.540> if<00:02:03.630> you're<00:02:03.689> going<00:02:03.810> to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the LCD screen but if you're going to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.630 
the LCD screen but if you're going to
experiment<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.439> new<00:02:04.649> positions<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.490> mount

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
experiment with new positions to mount

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.429 
experiment with new positions to mount
your<00:02:05.729> camera<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.869> want<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.259> what<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
your camera and you want to see what the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.139 
your camera and you want to see what the
shot<00:02:07.590> looks<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.070> LCD<00:02:08.459> screen<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.820> great

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
shot looks like the LCD screen is great

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.110 
shot looks like the LCD screen is great
for<00:02:09.390> looking<00:02:09.630> at<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.890> or<00:02:10.890> if<00:02:11.849> you're<00:02:12.030> going

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
for looking at that or if you're going

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.360 
for looking at that or if you're going
to<00:02:12.180> use<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.450> as<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.660> traditional<00:02:13.530> video<00:02:13.980> camera

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
to use it as a traditional video camera

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.920 
to use it as a traditional video camera
and<00:02:14.550> use<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:14.879> shoot<00:02:15.150> like

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and use it to shoot like

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.599 
and use it to shoot like
hold<00:02:16.079> it<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.409> move<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.560> around<00:02:16.650> then<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.129> LCD

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
hold it and move it around then the LCD

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.440 
hold it and move it around then the LCD
screen<00:02:17.849> is<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.060> huge<00:02:18.599> benefit<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.079> you<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.640> LCD

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
screen is a huge benefit to you the LCD

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.410 
screen is a huge benefit to you the LCD
screen<00:02:21.629> itself<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.319> find<00:02:22.829> to<00:02:23.250> be<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.609> bit<00:02:24.120> slow

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
screen itself I find to be a bit slow

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.050 
screen itself I find to be a bit slow
especially<00:02:24.959> on<00:02:25.349> hero<00:02:25.620> one<00:02:25.859> the<00:02:26.489> hero<00:02:26.700> 2<00:02:26.879> has

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
especially on hero one the hero 2 has

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.599 
especially on hero one the hero 2 has
made<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.450> better<00:02:27.599> if<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.049> boots<00:02:28.170> up<00:02:28.439> the<00:02:29.159> button

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
made it better if it boots up the button

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.069 
made it better if it boots up the button
response<00:02:29.939> and<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.120> LCD<00:02:30.450> screen<00:02:30.659> is<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.019> a

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
response and the LCD screen is it a

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.690 
response and the LCD screen is it a
little<00:02:31.200> slow<00:02:31.530> as<00:02:31.739> well<00:02:32.010> as<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.189> resolution<00:02:32.639> of

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
little slow as well as the resolution of

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.660 
little slow as well as the resolution of
the<00:02:32.790> LCD<00:02:33.209> screen<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.659> not<00:02:33.719> that<00:02:34.319> great<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.950> I

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
the LCD screen is not that great and I

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.220 
the LCD screen is not that great and I
don't<00:02:35.849> let<00:02:35.939> the<00:02:36.030> color<00:02:36.239> accuracy<00:02:36.569> on<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.019> LCD

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
don't let the color accuracy on the LCD

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.080 
don't let the color accuracy on the LCD
screen<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.709> very<00:02:37.980> good<00:02:38.639> at<00:02:38.730> all<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:38.969> don't

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
screen is very good at all so don't

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.699 
screen is very good at all so don't
expect<00:02:39.269> your<00:02:39.629> pictures<00:02:39.959> on<00:02:40.079> the<00:02:40.170> LCD<00:02:40.409> screen

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
expect your pictures on the LCD screen

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.949 
expect your pictures on the LCD screen
to<00:02:40.799> actually<00:02:41.189> look<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:41.730> what<00:02:42.629> your<00:02:42.750> video

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
to actually look like what your video

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.959 
to actually look like what your video
file<00:02:43.170> looks<00:02:43.379> like<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:44.099> it<00:02:44.370> does<00:02:44.609> give<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:44.939> a

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:44.969 
file looks like but it does give you a

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.129 
file looks like but it does give you a
very<00:02:45.180> good<00:02:45.389> idea<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.780> what<00:02:46.109> you're<00:02:46.290> shooting

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
very good idea of what you're shooting

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.929 
very good idea of what you're shooting
playback<00:02:49.139> on<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.470> LCD<00:02:49.709> screen<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.280> never<00:02:50.700> use

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
playback on the LCD screen I never use

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.390 
playback on the LCD screen I never use
it<00:02:50.970> some<00:02:51.450> people<00:02:51.720> do<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:52.139> I<00:02:52.409> just<00:02:52.980> find<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
it some people do but I just find the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.509 
it some people do but I just find the
screen<00:02:53.609> it's<00:02:53.760> way<00:02:53.849> too<00:02:53.909> small<00:02:54.180> for<00:02:55.280> any<00:02:56.280> sort

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
screen it's way too small for any sort

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.640 
screen it's way too small for any sort
of<00:02:56.639> playback<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.359> get<00:02:58.049> a<00:02:58.079> good<00:02:58.230> idea<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.500> what

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
of playback to get a good idea of what

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.640 
of playback to get a good idea of what
you're<00:02:58.769> shooting<00:02:59.750> the<00:03:00.750> battery<00:03:01.200> life<00:03:01.379> with

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
you're shooting the battery life with

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.750 
you're shooting the battery life with
the<00:03:02.280> LCD<00:03:02.669> screen<00:03:02.879> without<00:03:03.389> the<00:03:03.569> LCD<00:03:04.049> screen<00:03:04.379> I

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
the LCD screen without the LCD screen I

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.309 
the LCD screen without the LCD screen I
don't<00:03:05.760> notice<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.060> huge<00:03:06.239> difference<00:03:06.329> but

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
don't notice a huge difference but

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.629 
don't notice a huge difference but
definitely<00:03:08.040> there<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.549> difference<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.379> I

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
definitely there is a difference and I

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.039 
definitely there is a difference and I
set<00:03:11.639> my<00:03:11.760> LCD<00:03:12.060> screen<00:03:12.299> up<00:03:12.389> to<00:03:12.569> automatically

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
set my LCD screen up to automatically

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.440 
set my LCD screen up to automatically
turn<00:03:13.319> off<00:03:13.349> after<00:03:14.010> about<00:03:14.040> 30<00:03:14.639> seconds<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:15.419> it

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
turn off after about 30 seconds so it

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.690 
turn off after about 30 seconds so it
means<00:03:15.689> that<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.900> can<00:03:16.139> turn<00:03:16.349> it<00:03:16.469> on<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.829> can<00:03:17.489> frame

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
means that I can turn it on I can frame

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.280 
means that I can turn it on I can frame
my<00:03:17.879> shot<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.389> then<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.540> LCD<00:03:18.900> screen<00:03:19.139> just

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
my shot and then the LCD screen just

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.319 
my shot and then the LCD screen just
turns<00:03:19.560> off<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.790> find<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.180> be

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329
