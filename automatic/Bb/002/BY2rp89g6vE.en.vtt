00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
and earlier I had actually filmed a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.530 
and earlier I had actually filmed a
really<00:00:37.440> cool<00:00:37.710> video<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.730> then<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.149> camera

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
really cool video but then the camera

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.360 
really cool video but then the camera
guys<00:00:39.719> told<00:00:40.020> me<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.469> mic<00:00:40.649> had<00:00:40.829> failed<00:00:41.100> now

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
guys told me that the mic had failed now

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.100 
guys told me that the mic had failed now
I<00:00:41.610> had<00:00:42.149> thought<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.660> worked

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
I had thought that it worked

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.610 
I had thought that it worked
fifty<00:00:43.469> percent<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> time<00:00:44.100> all<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.000> time<00:00:45.239> I

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
fifty percent of the time all the time I

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.479 
fifty percent of the time all the time I
guess<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:46.800> wasn't<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.309> those

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
guess it just wasn't one of those

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.639 
guess it just wasn't one of those

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
the base of this 3d monitor oh also it

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.980 
the base of this 3d monitor oh also it
says<00:03:28.550> 3d<00:03:28.790> see<00:03:29.270> I<00:03:29.680> am<00:03:30.680> 3d<00:03:31.490> I<00:03:31.790> am<00:03:32.300> 3d<00:03:33.460> look<00:03:34.460> at<00:03:34.580> me

alright and then last not least wires to

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.960 
alright and then last not least wires to
make<00:03:41.210> these<00:03:41.480> we<00:03:42.200> get<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:43.220> actual<00:03:43.400> monitor

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
make these we get the actual monitor

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.080 
make these we get the actual monitor
itself<00:03:44.440> well<00:03:45.440> toss<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.370> box<00:03:46.550> you<00:03:46.760> guys<00:03:46.910> need

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
itself well toss the box you guys need

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.270 
itself well toss the box you guys need
it<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.810> background<00:03:48.200> so<00:03:48.980> now<00:03:49.040> I'm<00:03:49.100> going<00:03:49.190> to

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
it in the background so now I'm going to

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.890 
it in the background so now I'm going to
show<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.430> guys<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.790> monitor<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:50.630> thing<00:03:50.810> is

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
show you guys the monitor this thing is

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.660 
show you guys the monitor this thing is
actually<00:03:51.050> very<00:03:51.410> heavy<00:03:51.710> parts<00:03:52.160> me<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.370> hold<00:03:52.490> on

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
actually very heavy parts me to hold on

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.980 
actually very heavy parts me to hold on
to<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.510> connections<00:03:53.990> are<00:03:54.110> all<00:03:54.170> under<00:03:54.380> here

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
to the connections are all under here

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.090 
to the connections are all under here
and<00:03:56.990> it's<00:03:57.170> probably<00:03:57.410> hard<00:03:57.560> to<00:03:57.620> focus<00:03:57.770> in<00:03:57.980> these

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
and it's probably hard to focus in these

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.199 
and it's probably hard to focus in these
angles<00:03:58.430> there's<00:03:58.610> actually<00:03:58.910> some<00:03:59.090> more

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
angles there's actually some more

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.699 
angles there's actually some more
controllers<00:03:59.630> underneath<00:04:00.170> here<00:04:00.440> which<00:04:00.590> I

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
controllers underneath here which I

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.050 
controllers underneath here which I
can't<00:04:00.890> see<00:04:01.010> because<00:04:01.160> of<00:04:01.250> some<00:04:01.430> plastic<00:04:01.850> here

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
can't see because of some plastic here

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.810 
can't see because of some plastic here
and<00:04:02.240> there's<00:04:02.900> more<00:04:03.380> control<00:04:03.770> buttons<00:04:04.130> right

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
and there's more control buttons right

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.600 
and there's more control buttons right
here<00:04:04.880> on<00:04:05.300> the<00:04:05.390> bottom<00:04:05.570> I<00:04:06.250> know<00:04:07.250> it's<00:04:07.400> kind<00:04:07.550> of

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
here on the bottom I know it's kind of

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.890 
here on the bottom I know it's kind of
hard<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.820> see<00:04:08.030> if<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.180> zoom<00:04:08.330> box<00:04:08.510> now<00:04:08.720> go<00:04:08.870> over

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
hard to see if the zoom box now go over

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.210 
hard to see if the zoom box now go over
those<00:04:09.230> features<00:04:09.530> everything<00:04:09.740> in<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:09.950> monitor

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
those features everything in the monitor

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.360 
those features everything in the monitor
when<00:04:10.310> we<00:04:10.430> do<00:04:10.610> more<00:04:10.850> so<00:04:11.780> put<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.800> magic<00:04:13.070> video

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
when we do more so put the magic video

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.730 
when we do more so put the magic video
here<00:04:13.820> you<00:04:13.850> guys<00:04:14.030> see<00:04:14.300> the<00:04:14.420> base<00:04:14.570> and<00:04:15.530> the

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
here you guys see the base and the

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.360 
here you guys see the base and the
monitor<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:17.320> okay<00:04:18.320> so<00:04:18.380> now<00:04:18.769> that<00:04:18.859> we've<00:04:19.070> seen

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370
