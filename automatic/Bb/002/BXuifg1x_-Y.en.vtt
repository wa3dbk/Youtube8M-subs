it<00:02:52.820> right<00:02:52.940> down<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.450> could<00:02:53.750> have<00:02:53.840> easily

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
it right down I could have easily

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:54.850 
it right down I could have easily
grabbed<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.380> rope

you<00:02:55.220> can<00:02:55.340> easily<00:02:55.459> fish<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.970> rope<00:02:56.120> through<00:02:56.360> if

effortless<00:03:01.340> absolutely<00:03:02.209> effortless<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:04.340> is

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
effortless absolutely effortless this is

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.740 
effortless absolutely effortless this is
actually<00:03:04.819> pretty<00:03:04.940> disappointing

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
actually pretty disappointing

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.199 
actually pretty disappointing
that<00:03:06.350> that's<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:06.709> easy<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.310> they<00:03:07.940> have<00:03:08.090> them

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
that that's so easy that they have them

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.030 
that that's so easy that they have them
designed<00:03:08.569> something<00:03:08.840> else<00:03:09.019> you<00:03:09.830> could

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
designed something else you could

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.309 
designed something else you could
actually<00:03:10.370> probably<00:03:10.970> make<00:03:11.450> more<00:03:11.630> difficult<00:03:11.840> I

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
actually probably make more difficult I

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.800 
actually probably make more difficult I
could<00:03:12.830> take<00:03:12.980> these<00:03:13.100> screws<00:03:13.400> out<00:03:13.610> move<00:03:14.569> this

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
could take these screws out move this

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.930 
could take these screws out move this
assembly<00:03:15.440> up<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.100> this<00:03:16.250> was<00:03:16.430> actually<00:03:16.610> moved

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
assembly up so this was actually moved

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.110 
assembly up so this was actually moved
probably<00:03:17.480> back<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.660> about<00:03:17.959> here<00:03:18.350> adjust<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.430> so

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
probably back to about here adjust it so

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.410 
probably back to about here adjust it so
that's<00:03:20.329> where<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.660> closed<00:03:22.209> maybe<00:03:23.209> we<00:03:23.329> just

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
that's where it closed maybe we just

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.819 
that's where it closed maybe we just
have<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.660> use<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:23.870> longer<00:03:24.110> hanger<00:03:24.500> they<00:03:24.650> might

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
have to use a longer hanger they might

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.460 
have to use a longer hanger they might
not<00:03:24.920> be<00:03:25.040> able<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.250> see<00:03:25.430> as<00:03:25.579> well<00:03:25.610> but<00:03:26.450> here<00:03:27.380> we

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
not be able to see as well but here we

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.120 
not be able to see as well but here we
go<00:03:27.560> this<00:03:27.769> is<00:03:27.920> my<00:03:28.070> idea<00:03:29.799> what<00:03:30.799> I've<00:03:30.890> come<00:03:31.070> up

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
like this right into the top that's it

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.319 
like this right into the top that's it
that<00:03:53.120> won't<00:03:53.329> that<00:03:53.690> will<00:03:53.900> not<00:03:54.590> only<00:03:54.739> will<00:03:55.040> it

inches<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:16.280> can<00:04:16.370> do<00:04:16.549> whatever<00:04:17.419> but<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.590> idea

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
inches you can do whatever but the idea

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.080 
inches you can do whatever but the idea
is<00:04:18.919> you<00:04:18.979> want<00:04:19.039> to<00:04:19.190> screw<00:04:19.370> it<00:04:19.430> at<00:04:19.519> an<00:04:19.640> angle<00:04:19.789> I

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
is you want to screw it at an angle I

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.350 
is you want to screw it at an angle I
actually<00:04:20.390> have<00:04:21.520> kind<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.580> a<00:04:22.700> ridge<00:04:22.970> right<00:04:23.000> here

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
actually have kind of a ridge right here

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.260 
actually have kind of a ridge right here
where<00:04:23.510> I<00:04:23.539> don't<00:04:23.599> have<00:04:23.960> to

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
where I don't have to

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.749 
where I don't have to
bable<00:04:25.259> this<00:04:25.440> or<00:04:25.620> anything<00:04:26.009> I<00:04:26.250> can<00:04:26.400> just<00:04:26.550> screw

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
bable this or anything I can just screw

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.610 
bable this or anything I can just screw
it<00:04:26.849> down<00:04:27.000> in<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.389> I<00:04:27.449> can<00:04:27.599> just<00:04:27.780> I<00:04:28.080> can<00:04:28.440> just

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
it down in and I can just I can just

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.070 
it down in and I can just I can just
angle<00:04:28.949> my<00:04:29.039> screws<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.550> got<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.060> hold<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.449> square

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
angle my screws and got a hold it square

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.619 
angle my screws and got a hold it square
in<00:04:31.379> there<00:04:31.919> at<00:04:32.129> this<00:04:32.370> angle<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:32.819> then<00:04:33.419> there's

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
in there at this angle and then there's

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.600 
in there at this angle and then there's
no<00:04:33.750> longer<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:34.139> way<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:35.069> know<00:04:35.159> you<00:04:35.460> can

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
no longer a way to you know you can

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.339 
no longer a way to you know you can
wedge<00:04:35.759> it<00:04:35.789> and<00:04:36.120> hang<00:04:36.270> her<00:04:36.360> up<00:04:36.479> in<00:04:36.629> here<00:04:36.810> there's

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
wedge it and hang her up in here there's

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.640 
wedge it and hang her up in here there's
no<00:04:37.409> longer<00:04:38.250> way<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.810> make<00:04:39.810> it<00:04:39.960> get<00:04:40.139> that<00:04:40.289> angle

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
no longer way to make it get that angle

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.619 
no longer way to make it get that angle
and<00:04:40.740> even<00:04:40.979> when<00:04:41.159> you<00:04:41.250> do<00:04:41.430> now<00:04:42.030> you're<00:04:42.210> pulling

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
and even when you do now you're pulling

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:45.409 
and even when you do now you're pulling
such<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:42.870> force<00:04:43.259> just<00:04:43.470> pulling<00:04:43.860> down<00:04:44.419> there's

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
such a force just pulling down there's

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.850 
such a force just pulling down there's
so<00:04:45.569> much<00:04:45.690> friction<00:04:45.930> you're<00:04:46.470> not<00:04:46.590> going<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:46.770> be

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
so much friction you're not going to be

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.830 
so much friction you're not going to be
able<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.099> unlock<00:04:47.370> it<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:48.180> let's<00:04:48.659> set<00:04:48.810> that

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
able to unlock it so let's set that

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.570 
able to unlock it so let's set that
there<00:04:49.199> I'll<00:04:49.440> drill<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.800> couple<00:04:49.919> holes<00:04:50.099> we'll

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
there I'll drill a couple holes we'll

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:59.629 
there I'll drill a couple holes we'll
screw<00:04:50.789> this<00:04:50.909> down<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.479> I'll<00:04:51.870> try<00:04:52.080> again<00:04:58.639> just

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
screw this down and I'll try again just

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.529 
screw this down and I'll try again just
screw<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.360> along<00:05:01.370> give<00:05:02.370> you<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.580> good<00:05:03.150> beer<00:05:03.330> the

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
screw it along give you a good beer the

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.689 
screw it along give you a good beer the
angle<00:05:03.840> I've<00:05:04.680> got<00:05:04.889> one<00:05:05.069> two<00:05:05.190> three<00:05:05.370> four<00:05:05.520> five

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
angle I've got one two three four five

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:06.999 
angle I've got one two three four five
screws<00:05:06.000> in<00:05:06.210> it

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
screws in it

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.350 
screws in it
sits<00:05:08.009> right<00:05:08.099> there<00:05:10.909> the<00:05:11.909> nice<00:05:12.090> thing<00:05:12.300> about

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
sits right there the nice thing about

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.200 
sits right there the nice thing about
this<00:05:12.630> is<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:12.930> doesn't<00:05:13.050> actually<00:05:13.229> rub<00:05:13.590> up<00:05:13.800> but

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
this is it doesn't actually rub up but

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.249 
this is it doesn't actually rub up but
you<00:05:15.210> see<00:05:15.389> it<00:05:15.479> sits<00:05:15.659> at<00:05:15.780> that<00:05:15.900> angle

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
you see it sits at that angle

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.860 
you see it sits at that angle
nice<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:16.830> tight<00:05:16.979> but<00:05:17.400> when<00:05:17.639> it's<00:05:17.759> closed<00:05:18.030> it

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
nice and tight but when it's closed it

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.249 
nice and tight but when it's closed it
sits<00:05:19.169> right<00:05:19.349> against<00:05:19.650> there<00:05:20.120> if<00:05:21.120> you<00:05:21.360> wedge<00:05:21.780> it

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
sits right against there if you wedge it

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.909 
sits right against there if you wedge it
out<00:05:22.909> now<00:05:23.909> you<00:05:23.969> know<00:05:24.509> because<00:05:24.750> my<00:05:24.960> face<00:05:25.710> my

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
out now you know because my face my

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.309 
out now you know because my face my
garage<00:05:26.069> sure<00:05:26.250> comes<00:05:26.460> down<00:05:26.639> there<00:05:26.909> the<00:05:27.750> wood<00:05:27.990> so

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
garage sure comes down there the wood so

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.050 
garage sure comes down there the wood so
before<00:05:28.919> you're<00:05:29.069> only<00:05:29.190> looking<00:05:29.520> at<00:05:29.759> this<00:05:29.880> high

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
before you're only looking at this high

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.360 
before you're only looking at this high
up<00:05:30.389> being<00:05:31.229> able<00:05:31.319> to<00:05:31.440> get<00:05:31.590> it<00:05:31.710> in<00:05:31.919> at<00:05:32.159> that<00:05:32.310> angle

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
up being able to get it in at that angle

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.839 
up being able to get it in at that angle
now<00:05:33.210> you<00:05:33.780> got<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:34.020> come<00:05:34.440> up<00:05:34.469> you<00:05:35.340> can't<00:05:35.550> get<00:05:35.699> it

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
now you got to come up you can't get it

00:05:35.849 --> 00:06:05.809 
now you got to come up you can't get it
into<00:05:36.000> that<00:05:36.120> angle<00:05:36.569> let<00:05:37.319> me<00:05:37.380> go<00:05:37.469> try<00:05:37.680> it

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.260

to show you all the ten well probably
five<00:06:12.190> seven<00:06:12.970> minutes<00:06:13.240> that<00:06:13.419> I<00:06:14.050> played<00:06:14.319> around

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
five seven minutes that I played around

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.320 
five seven minutes that I played around
with<00:06:14.680> trying<00:06:15.009> to<00:06:15.039> give<00:06:15.220> this<00:06:15.370> yeah<00:06:15.940> you<00:06:16.180> just

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
with trying to give this yeah you just

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.379 
with trying to give this yeah you just
can't<00:06:16.569> I<00:06:16.930> tried<00:06:17.590> putting<00:06:18.400> a<00:06:18.550> prebend<00:06:18.970> in<00:06:19.240> it

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
can't I tried putting a prebend in it

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:21.570 
can't I tried putting a prebend in it
for<00:06:20.169> the<00:06:20.259> garage<00:06:20.380> door<00:06:20.770> is<00:06:20.860> flat<00:06:21.130> so<00:06:21.159> you<00:06:21.370> try

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
for the garage door is flat so you try

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.460 
for the garage door is flat so you try
to<00:06:21.610> get<00:06:21.849> it<00:06:21.970> up<00:06:22.090> and<00:06:22.330> then<00:06:22.449> you're<00:06:23.199> trying<00:06:23.349> to

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
to get it up and then you're trying to

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.050 
to get it up and then you're trying to
wing<00:06:23.680> it<00:06:23.710> out<00:06:23.949> and<00:06:24.370> you<00:06:24.430> don't<00:06:24.460> know<00:06:24.669> how<00:06:24.819> far

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
wing it out and you don't know how far

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.570 
wing it out and you don't know how far
back<00:06:25.240> in<00:06:25.479> you<00:06:25.630> need<00:06:25.780> to<00:06:25.870> go<00:06:26.080> you<00:06:26.440> would<00:06:27.370> need<00:06:27.490> to

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
back in you need to go you would need to

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.480 
back in you need to go you would need to
know<00:06:27.639> the<00:06:27.880> exact<00:06:28.210> depth<00:06:28.620> and<00:06:29.620> then<00:06:30.310> you'd<00:06:30.460> have

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
know the exact depth and then you'd have
