00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
this is the video about the Santa Fe

a<00:00:07.200> garbage<00:00:07.710> can<00:00:07.980> some<00:00:08.309> weeks<00:00:08.550> ago

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
a garbage can some weeks ago

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.509 
a garbage can some weeks ago
unfortunately<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.500> was<00:00:10.710> missing<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.219> tracks

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
unfortunately it was missing the tracks

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.240 
unfortunately it was missing the tracks
the<00:00:11.849> charger<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.780> caboose<00:00:13.110> absorber<00:00:13.830> battery

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
the charger the caboose absorber battery

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.550 
the charger the caboose absorber battery
and<00:00:14.549> worst<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.150> all<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.660> front<00:00:15.929> axle<00:00:16.350> and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
and worst of all the front axle and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.370 
and worst of all the front axle and
wheels<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.730> had<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.180> modify<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.810> slightly<00:00:19.020> to

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
wheels so I had to modify it slightly to

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.330 
wheels so I had to modify it slightly to
get<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.980> work<00:00:20.130> again<00:00:21.650> here<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.830> can<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.189> my

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
get it to work again here you can see my

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.300 
get it to work again here you can see my
solution<00:00:23.939> as<00:00:24.300> for<00:00:24.869> front<00:00:25.140> axle<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.800> fixed<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
solution as for front axle we fixed a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.550 
solution as for front axle we fixed a
shopping<00:00:26.730> trolley<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.420> locomotive<00:00:28.230> so

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
shopping trolley to the locomotive so

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.040 
shopping trolley to the locomotive so
that<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.859> acts<00:00:29.070> as<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> front<00:00:29.670> axle<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.810> works

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
that it acts as a front axle this works

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.990 
that it acts as a front axle this works
reasonably<00:00:31.590> well<00:00:31.710> though<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.730> rolling

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
reasonably well though the rolling

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.360 
reasonably well though the rolling
resistance<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.140> front<00:00:34.440> axle<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.100> still

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
resistance of that front axle is still

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.850 
resistance of that front axle is still
remarkably<00:00:35.969> higher<00:00:36.270> than<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.649> rear

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
remarkably higher than that of the rear

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.760 
remarkably higher than that of the rear
axle<00:00:38.309> which<00:00:38.850> means<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.780> vehicle<00:00:39.989> slows

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
axle which means that the vehicle slows

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.400 
axle which means that the vehicle slows
down<00:00:41.040> if<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.460> lean<00:00:41.670> forward<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.300> speeds<00:00:43.050> up<00:00:43.200> if

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
down if I lean forward and speeds up if

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.459 
down if I lean forward and speeds up if
I<00:00:43.620> lean<00:00:43.829> backwards<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> look<00:00:49.020> into<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
I lean backwards this is a look into the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.040 
I lean backwards this is a look into the
Santa<00:00:49.680> Fe's<00:00:49.950> battery<00:00:50.520> compartment<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.480> you

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
Santa Fe's battery compartment as you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.810 
Santa Fe's battery compartment as you
can<00:00:52.199> see<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.340> stock<00:00:53.550> battery

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
can see this is not the stock battery

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.260 
can see this is not the stock battery
that<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.480> newly<00:00:54.780> about<00:00:54.989> 6<00:00:55.559> volts<00:00:56.039> 10<00:00:56.430> empowers

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that are newly about 6 volts 10 empowers

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.930 
that are newly about 6 volts 10 empowers
one<00:00:57.600> which<00:00:58.320> happens<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.890> fairly<00:00:59.309> cheap<00:00:59.730> at

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
one which happens to be fairly cheap at

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.389 
one which happens to be fairly cheap at
13<00:01:00.510> euros<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> fits<00:01:01.739> into<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.129> compartment

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
nicely the connector also has been

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.460 
nicely the connector also has been

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
modded the start connector has been

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.320 
modded the start connector has been
removed<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.100> two<00:01:08.340> cable<00:01:08.760> shoes<00:01:08.939> attached

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
to the battery this corresponds the way

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.149 
to the battery this corresponds the way
the<00:01:14.880> batteries<00:01:15.330> are<00:01:15.600> wired<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.020> my<00:01:16.200> e<00:01:16.229> scooter

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.499 

now<00:01:20.159> let's<00:01:20.580> hear<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> sound<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.299> makes

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
now let's hear the sound it makes

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:30.650 
now let's hear the sound it makes
without<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> load<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660
