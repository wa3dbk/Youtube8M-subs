00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
see get these requirements you craft it

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.910 
see get these requirements you craft it
with<00:00:28.830> coal<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:30.000> an<00:00:30.119> iron<00:00:30.480> ingot<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.050> you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
with coal and just an iron ingot and you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.830 
with coal and just an iron ingot and you
get<00:00:32.070> iron<00:00:32.340> infused<00:00:32.880> coal<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.480> see<00:00:33.660> how<00:00:33.809> it

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
get iron infused coal you can see how it

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.240 
get iron infused coal you can see how it
looks<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:35.280> has<00:00:35.630> 20<00:00:36.630> cold<00:00:37.140> um<00:00:37.440> smelting

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
looks and this has 20 cold um smelting

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.780 
looks and this has 20 cold um smelting
uses<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:40.230> pretty<00:00:40.559> good<00:00:40.800> now<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.340> can

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
uses so it's it's pretty good now we can

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.840 
uses so it's it's pretty good now we can
talk<00:00:42.000> about<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.510> Redstone<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.920> Redstone

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
we have the lapis infused coal which is

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.670 
we have the lapis infused coal which is
pretty<00:01:08.880> cool<00:01:09.150> because<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.290> don't<00:01:10.409> know

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
pretty cool because it's I don't know

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
thinking it has 120 smelting uses I'm

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.789 
thinking it has 120 smelting uses I'm
only<00:01:56.340> sure<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.329> if<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.450> go<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.110> Emerald
