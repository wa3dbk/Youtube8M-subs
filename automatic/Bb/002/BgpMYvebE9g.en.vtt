 Tobias century nude number 16 protector date 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.910
 Birthday May 8, 1986 height 1 meter 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.400
 eighty one centimeter 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.670
 weight eighty nine kilos grip 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.820
 putters left true Aryan character 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.500
 approaching critical rack with 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.720
 fellow workers supported 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.600
 good attitude has excellent 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.860
 performance in working with the piston merciless 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.200
 to enemies canvas 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.290
 Not every club Khl boasts 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.180
 Swedes have a team in their league of 25 to 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.050
 be a bright debuted in motorists 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.330
 last season 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.250
 then he scored 26 points and in this 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.199
 regular season scored seven gears and 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.240
 three goals not many fans know 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.490
 that the viscount could score not the puck Omsk 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.530
 since only 15 years old preferred football 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.720
 hockey like a true swede without love 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.370
 meatballs and fairy tales about Carlson blue 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.060
 and yellow and he is very 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.060
 laconic 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.830
 let's bend your knees from me 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.810
 just a good impression after all this 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.310
 the second most powerful league in the world in my opinion 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.930
 there are a lot of good teams and more 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.790
 more good athletes so 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.530
 hockey players want to play here of course 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.090
 only if they no longer play nhl 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.800
 I like an offer to play in a club 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.690
 Continental League arrived through 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.490
 agent you know how it happens you 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.810
 play and play well serve 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.970
 hopes and you in the end 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.500
 be sure to notice when I received 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.670
 offer to play for motorists 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.890
 consulted with his buddies 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.900
 Received good reviews of work in Russia 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:02:00.810
 about this city team so the choice for 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:02:02.860
 I was obvious like a long time 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.420
 Russian hockey is different from that 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.040
 who are you used to in sweden here 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.200
 more play defense here more 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.179
 technicality and feints this heavier 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.950
 ok still an interesting point here 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.989
 many different coaches there are specialists 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.310
 from Finland and Sweden from Russia and you 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.080
 end up constantly facing 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.270
 completely different people and everyone has their own 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.130
 This approach is probably the main difference to 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.720
 hello swedish league with regard to 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.640
 swedish players you their getting 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.500
 More in Khl although Finns for example on as 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.190
 much more I donâ€™t know why 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.720
 it turns out 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.519
 maybe because finland is closer to 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.739
 Russia future I think Swedish players 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.480
 there will be more it is good religion 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.489
 and of course I would like to KHL 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.260
 joined any of the club in sweden 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.269
 about it periodically speak but 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.080
 while nothing changes it seems to me that 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.080
 it would be great 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.670
 team play of course very difficult 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.440
 after all there are the best players of the country with 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.450
 other side it's great to compete 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.190
 with the best of the best in Europe at the tournament 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.810
 good teams play who will win 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.520
 The next stage of the European tour is really 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.020
 interesting but I think we will have a hard time 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.020
 still Russia plays at home 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:16.100
 he is now near Polivanov wanna do is 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.140
 my life 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.610
 I would not like to talk about how 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.770
 everything was Khanty Mansiysk but I can say 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.750
 sure it was one of the best days in my 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.190
 the lives of me and the other guys who 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.900
 got sick was very hard 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.880
 part of the disease has receded and now I 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.350
 much better i can eat at last 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.690
 more and I am glad that everything went pretty 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.670
 fast we really spend a lot 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.170
 time yourself not only on the ice 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.670
 he is a good guy but we certainly 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:51.080
 communicate with Russian players for 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:52.940
 motorists rarely change them with me 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.360
 girl we are engaged to what fair 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.459
 brides 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.320
 it's not for me his name is Elizabeth we 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.910
 ten years together 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.910
 since high school and I'm fine with her 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.750
 being away from home is hard 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.760
 last season there were more breaks and 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.709
 accordingly, we often went home to 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.480
 this year have not been able to 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.220
 the other side if you play hockey players 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.989
 you like some not so important where 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.739
 you are true there are problems with 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.570
 in Russian 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.160
 everything I learned when we were taught 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.290
 narrow is some simple expressions 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.669
 who can help where you go for a walk 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.410
 or when you need to call a taxi 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.419
 In short, I know not so much how would I 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.130
 I wanted core with these much better 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.870
 copes so he sometimes speaks for 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.490
 I like us in general Yekaterinburg 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.470
 although it's time to go wrong 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.360
 a lot i like walking mall me 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.280
 like to go grocery shopping 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.450
 but usually I rest at home just looking 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.450
 movie or playing on the wor 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:53.969
 understand verygames how cis on you 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.039
 the team has changed a lot in the current 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.840
 season since fees probably all 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.699
 noticed that the chemistry inside the team was 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.409
 not like that year but we have changed 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.180
 and began to play better though to me personally 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.900
 it seems that we can no longer we 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.669
 at maximum 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.560
 I think we will try because we 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:13.460
 not only can but must get play 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.460
 love of 3 no help power stream 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.860
 storm we played 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.849
 Timakova watch the show about yourself with 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.849
 too behind the back and 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.260
 not Stotskaya 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.900
 just banned 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.900
 that's how I liked a little a4
