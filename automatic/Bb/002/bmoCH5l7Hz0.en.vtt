they're 18 my brain oh they don't matter

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.090 
they're 18 my brain oh they don't matter
force<00:00:42.660> field<00:00:43.730> yeah<00:00:44.730> that's<00:00:45.480> how<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.750> works<00:00:46.100> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
force field yeah that's how it works and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.810 
force field yeah that's how it works and
let's<00:00:47.700> kill<00:00:48.090> them<00:00:51.800> okay<00:00:52.800> you're<00:00:53.430> safe<00:00:53.640> yea

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you open the door at the fence that it

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.289 
you open the door at the fence that it
could<00:01:36.750> probably<00:01:37.439> happen<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.430> pig<00:01:38.909> escape

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299

oh<00:01:40.790> yeah<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> force<00:01:42.630> field<00:01:42.899> you're

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
oh yeah and with the force field you're

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.469 
oh yeah and with the force field you're
safe<00:01:44.030> very<00:01:45.030> cool<00:01:46.009> yeah<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.280> yeah<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.329> next

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
safe very cool yeah and yeah the next

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it's just a force field wall and yeah

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.770 
it's just a force field wall and yeah
works<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.240> same<00:02:00.619> just<00:02:01.619> as<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> big<00:02:02.820> wall<00:02:03.060> you

works just some wine cards and derail
and<00:03:10.450> yeah<00:03:11.450> let's<00:03:11.900> show<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:12.200> how<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.739> build<00:03:13.069> it

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
and yeah let's show you how to build it

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:23.559 
and yeah let's show you how to build it
to<00:03:13.340> as<00:03:13.549> my<00:03:13.730> chest<00:03:20.139> so<00:03:21.139> yeah<00:03:21.829> you<00:03:22.400> need<00:03:22.940> just<00:03:23.299> one

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
to as my chest so yeah you need just one

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.580 
to as my chest so yeah you need just one
rail<00:03:24.579> we<00:03:25.579> use<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.970> power<00:03:26.180> trail<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:27.290> can<00:03:27.380> even

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
rail we use the power trail you can even

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.830 
rail we use the power trail you can even
use<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:28.130> non<00:03:28.340> rail<00:03:28.669> or<00:03:29.030> detector<00:03:29.419> rail<00:03:29.599> or

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
use a non rail or detector rail or

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.309 
use a non rail or detector rail or
whatever<00:03:30.609> then<00:03:31.609> a<00:03:31.819> minecart<00:03:32.299> will<00:03:32.750> come<00:03:33.079> as

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
whatever then a minecart will come as

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.839 
whatever then a minecart will come as
something<00:03:33.709> in<00:03:34.840> chest<00:03:35.840> furnance<00:03:36.849> opportunity

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
something in chest furnance opportunity

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.220 
something in chest furnance opportunity
whatever<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:39.109> a<00:03:39.680> block<00:03:39.889> or<00:03:40.069> slab<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:41.230> yes

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
whatever and a block or slab and yes

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.439 
whatever and a block or slab and yes
simply<00:03:42.980> place<00:03:43.780> rail<00:03:45.129> then<00:03:46.129> we<00:03:46.489> used<00:03:46.730> for<00:03:47.209> the

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449
