00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.110
 when filling the hs tears 30 l with the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.830
 Radial brake handle is the following 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.150
 note 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.760
 only on is the lower 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.770
 then loosen fixing screws 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.720
 on whether they now left or right 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.840
 is mounted is always to pay attention 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.510
 that they always screw the ebc 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.370
 highest point in the system is from 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.559
 The right side becomes easy with the ones 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.900
 step forward on the left side 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.989
 demonstrate to the rear that the ept 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.600
 the highest point is then 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.780
 Just quote again afterwards 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.949
 screw out ept screw and here 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.500
 He feels then even if I then 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.280
 take this syringe again then 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.940
 30 again the hole then has easy 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.780
 Insert the top and then the oil from 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.670
 down to the top by pressing what 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.740
 generally closed will see it 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.659
 have to note that this manual 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.030
 lining wear adjustment always 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.040
 completely turned back is speak of 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.230
 Pistons should be in position 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.900
 so that I can count on the entire volume of 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.590
 Filling the brake can now be easy 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.520
 go the oil from bottom to top 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.520
 by pressing 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.570
 because then no air at the top arrives 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.590
 Can I top the top again 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.990
 remove 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.220
 to remove the syringe simply over 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.200
 go with the hole and finger 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.530
 and then I can practically do that 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.409
 Peel off the top without the oil here 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.210
 out of the system and go out of injection 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.159
 before you put it aside again 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.539
 close the hole again and then 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.670
 I can also inject this without oil 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.319
 spilled to the side then set 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.540
 also look if robben in the ept 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.069
 chart run is if they are 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.470
 required again briefly on the 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.410
 syringe on it really press the top 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.640
 wants to be pending and then here again 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:28.030
 bbc before closing cautious whole 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.730
 easily turn by hand would be really up 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.730
 it is flush or a torque 05 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.130
 then the brake took hold again 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:45.609
 turn back and just go back with 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.950
 the lower screw with the correct one 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.620
 torque four newtonmeter the braking distance 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.100
 then to close down syringe 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:58.260
 Slimming system close up 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.260
 Check tightness and you're done
