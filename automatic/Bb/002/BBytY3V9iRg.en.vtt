I<00:00:30.830> this<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.980> interesting<00:00:32.309> comparison

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
I this is interesting comparison

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.310 
I this is interesting comparison
concered<00:00:33.559> these<00:00:34.559> caps<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.480> more<00:00:36.480> than<00:00:36.630> twice

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
concered these caps are more than twice

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.729 
concered these caps are more than twice
as<00:00:37.380> expensive<00:00:37.710> as<00:00:38.340> those<00:00:39.440> so<00:00:40.440> we're<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
as expensive as those so we're going to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.639 
as expensive as those so we're going to
see<00:00:40.860> how<00:00:40.980> they<00:00:41.129> compare<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.730> sound<00:00:42.030> down<00:00:42.649> and

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
see how they compare and sound down and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.590 
see how they compare and sound down and
all<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.010> guys<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:44.550> or<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> word<00:00:45.090> about<00:00:45.270> my

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
all that you guys are or a word about my

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.240 
all that you guys are or a word about my
positions<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.860> we're<00:00:47.489> using<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:48.030> one

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
positions and so on so we're using a one

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.630 
positions and so on so we're using a one
near<00:00:50.250> mic<00:00:50.520> Peluso<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.780> mike<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.250> one<00:00:53.250> by

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
near mic Peluso to mike and one by

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.939 
near mic Peluso to mike and one by
dynamic<00:00:54.180> reborn<00:00:55.129> for<00:00:56.129> room<00:00:56.399> sound<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> I'm

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
dynamic reborn for room sound so I'm

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.510 
dynamic reborn for room sound so I'm
going<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.219> use<00:00:59.760> both<00:01:00.030> mics<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:01.100> one<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> time

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
going to use both mics and one at a time

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.210 
going to use both mics and one at a time
so<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.629> mic<00:01:04.530> positioning

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
so you can see that mic positioning

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.520 
so you can see that mic positioning
doesn't<00:01:06.180> account<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.229> least

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
doesn't account for it at least

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:19.730 
doesn't account for it at least
everything<00:01:07.860> okay<00:01:08.760> let's<00:01:09.750> go
