00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.470
 Then 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.390
 How do cookies work? 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:19.909
 Cookies are moved using this crosshair 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:24.020
 First of all , the x-axis brings the grandfather with the cookie lecche cross button you want to move 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:27.770

 I hope this game never clears the cookie this way 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:43.179
 The more you go forward, the harder it gets 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.179
 Is it possible to go to 10 stages of 10 faces which is the most difficult for me personally 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.780
 I 'm still painting now 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.420

 Yoshi's cookies also have a way to enjoy love score 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:10.319
 The more cookies you put out at one time, the higher the score. 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:13.499
 Moreover, if you use the technique of continuous erasing, the top 10 will stop at 2 times 4 times 8 times 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.530
 Let's show you the ultimate continuous erase here 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.530

 It is Yoshino cookie 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.420
 If you play one person, the cookie of Yoshi is almighty 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.420
 I will delete cookies more and more 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.700
 Every time 15 pieces of the same cookie are erased, 1 cookie comes out 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.020
 If you want Yoshino Air quickly, you should look at this graph and turn off many returns 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:09.319
 And I save Yoshino cookies and erase them all at once

 In match-up play, one Yoshi's cookie comes out to get rid of the return in the city 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:45.720
 And if you have Yoshi's cookie, it is a surprise cooperation item

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.950
 Because the names of various items come out here in the order of falling apart 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.300
 I Orchestra 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.249
 You should just have Yoshi's cookies in the moment the item you think comes out 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:35.709
 The 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:37.729
 But it's important to have sweaty cookies, as it may cost you a disadvantage. 

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:43.949
 Note 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:45.240

 In this game you get the best fun when you win the Yoshino Ku-class 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.590
 I'm glad Yoshi 's cookie can be enjoyed by Gameboy 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:19.620
 Playing one is exactly the same fun as it is now 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.620
 You aim for the most difficult 10 clear 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.030
 Or do you change the record of love score 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.699

 You can enjoy up to 4 people playing match with the run and communication cable 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:30.680
 The attacking partner changes randomly, so I don't know when or by whom 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.680
 It's a great thrill 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:39.030
