00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.570
 the third generation of the ford focus 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.159
 of those halfway through his life cycle 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.150
 it's forte sign for a big one 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.980
 update 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.180
 Well the studios tackled with a real one 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.370
 facelift 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.690
 car has a whole new front 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.640
 nose of the car is now completely in 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.620
 be in line with the ts 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.870
 new mondeo yes little imagination needed 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.670
 to even see it as an afte martin 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.230
 well and that is not the only thing under either 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.640
 a lot has happened in the bonnet 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.650
 just like the chassis the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.060
 numerous new steering equipment 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.660
 electronic functionality 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.370
 added 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.660
 and not unimportantly the whole 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.660
 dashboard has been revised 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.540
 when generation 3 came on the market then 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.280
 he was blessed with a brain of buttons on 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.720
 the center console really came the wash 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.160
 without going through an instruction book 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.660
 come 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
 criticism of it they have to continue to 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.720
 let it take and they have the eraser there 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.650
 We are going over again 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.230
 to draw 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.739
 and the result is almost doing 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.050
 minimalistic 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.510
 center console operation is now free 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.890
 simple and last but not least 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.420
 books with him in the buttons are just 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.890
 also because the very many functions in one 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.610
 are in between and that makes it one 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.340
 much easier 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.320
 oh and if that's not enough then too 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.520
 voice control 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.350
 that may sound a bit easier and 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.790
 it must be the right one 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.500
 commands from you keep knowing different 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.490
 system is not responding but well that is 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.950
 learn a row 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.540
 now you get there so very beautiful 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.020
 that minimalism on that center console 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.960
 and the steering wheel has also been redrawn 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.009
 but those buttons there is a bit small 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.009
 work a bit unpleasant 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.020
 Also on the motorcycle front is a news 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.220
 the existing 1.6 liter engines 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.330
 before replacing with 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.370
 versions with one and a half liters 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.410
 engine capacity 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.140
 not only gasoline but also diesel 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.760
 a tdci diesel in an eco boost 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.830
 gasoline engine 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.490
 we are on the road with the 180 hp version of 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.070
 the latter 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.740
 gasoline engine and therefore good to keep out 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.780
 the machine that is nice and elastic 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.640
 w give me about the gas pedal this i have 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.250
 always enough in the house 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.930
 the only thing you have to pay attention to is you 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.760
 sit acceleration gear too high as you 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.530
 then yes so to the buyer yes then 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.540
 you really have to switch back 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.860
 mechanics off the engine but well that is 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.900
 no problem at all 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.850
 gearbox shifts nice and light 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.540
 but very accurate of the one 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.620
 gear and the others 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.620
 nothing wrong actually 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.569
 first two generations of focus that 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.319
 were known for their great 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.000
 chassis 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.970
 careful benchmark for the rest of the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.409
 car industry the generation 3 came when i 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.569
 ahead anyway 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.629
 murder piece shrunk that they have with 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.190
 fort seriously attracted and they have 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.120
 the car at that point completely 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.220
 revised 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.140
 she at the car for a piece 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.709
 stiffer made stiff and rubbers too 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.620
 used 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.780
 now you go with 3 adjusted yes that the 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.280
 results in a car that is nice and firm 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.409
 the road is 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.480
 but not unimportantly always tasty 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.739
 comfortable is very nice combination 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.739
 so yes they did very well 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.910
 now we are a bit hungry 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.070
 become a company 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.630
 filming and driving the monument on one 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.630
 voice control scat you test out 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.120
 choose a month 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.120
 ai bridge 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.780
 and why would you like a 6 more than one 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.700
 lamp red neo destination 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.700
 ear and it is more bearable 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:04:00.940
 clothes another war why why i use the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.680
 bosch and dune vcz destination 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.060
 from site where you come to be whole 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.599
 appoint 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.599
 set the destination ' 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.690
 move is the girl 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.690
 the red guy verhofstadt well 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.949
 so 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.990
 which voice commands are true or 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.000
 but of course what this old one is about 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.340
 is going to improve chassis 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.210
 a new engine for that matter 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.009
 for this car 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.870
 absolutely prepared for a great 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.870
 second half now time tapas
