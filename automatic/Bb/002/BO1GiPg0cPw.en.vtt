vegetable crops will be planted so the

we<00:01:32.200> like<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.950> let<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:33.490> get<00:01:33.640> at<00:01:34.090> least<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.510> foot

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
we like to let it get at least a foot

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.350 
we like to let it get at least a foot
high<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.290> then<00:01:35.650> we<00:01:36.040> mo<00:01:36.250> with<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.640> flail<00:01:37.030> mower

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
high and then we mo with the flail mower

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.200 
high and then we mo with the flail mower
that<00:01:38.229> chops<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:38.799> up<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.100> makes<00:01:39.310> it<00:01:39.549> break<00:01:39.970> down

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
that chops it up and makes it break down

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.630 
that chops it up and makes it break down
more<00:01:40.450> quickly<00:01:40.659> so<00:01:41.560> it's<00:01:41.740> incorporated<00:01:42.430> more

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
more quickly so it's incorporated more

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.640 
more quickly so it's incorporated more
easily<00:01:43.000> then<00:01:43.960> we'll<00:01:44.259> use<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.400> rotavator<00:01:45.939> and

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
easily then we'll use the rotavator and

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.410 
easily then we'll use the rotavator and
fill<00:01:47.650> it<00:01:47.770> under<00:01:48.070> normally<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.850> succession

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
fill it under normally the succession

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.330 
fill it under normally the succession
that<00:01:49.450> we<00:01:49.689> use<00:01:49.960> because<00:01:50.380> these<00:01:50.710> beds<00:01:51.040> would<00:01:51.220> be

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
that we use because these beds would be

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.520 
that we use because these beds would be

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
ready to plant in july's then we would

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.190 
ready to plant in july's then we would
follow<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:54.070> with<00:01:54.189> a<00:01:54.250> transplanted<00:01:55.200> brassica
