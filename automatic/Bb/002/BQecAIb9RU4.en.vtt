okay here's what we're going to do easy

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.400 
okay here's what we're going to do easy
test<00:00:22.519> to<00:00:22.699> the<00:00:22.910> quick<00:00:23.119> one<00:00:23.300> right<00:00:23.900> now<00:00:24.079> I<00:00:24.109> have

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
test to the quick one right now I have

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.120 
test to the quick one right now I have
this<00:00:24.529> camera<00:00:24.890> set<00:00:25.369> to<00:00:25.630> 3840<00:00:26.630> by<00:00:26.660> 2160<00:00:27.289> thirty

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
this camera set to 3840 by 2160 thirty

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.429 
this camera set to 3840 by 2160 thirty
frames<00:00:28.399> per<00:00:28.579> second<00:00:29.119> this<00:00:29.210> is<00:00:29.269> the<00:00:29.449> default<00:00:29.840> so

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
frames per second this is the default so

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.860 
frames per second this is the default so
call<00:00:30.649> let's<00:00:30.919> call<00:00:31.189> it<00:00:31.309> a<00:00:31.340> 4k<00:00:31.789> setting<00:00:32.239> I'm

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
call let's call it a 4k setting I'm

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.259 
call let's call it a 4k setting I'm
going<00:00:33.019> to<00:00:33.079> start<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.410> engines<00:00:33.940> I'm<00:00:34.940> going<00:00:35.180> to

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
going to start the engines I'm going to

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.130 
going to start the engines I'm going to
take<00:00:35.420> a<00:00:35.449> note<00:00:35.750> of<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.960> altitude<00:00:37.989> and<00:00:38.989> we're

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
take a note of the altitude and we're

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.040 
take a note of the altitude and we're
going<00:00:39.290> to<00:00:39.350> get<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.589> camera<00:00:39.980> set<00:00:40.010> up<00:00:41.019> when<00:00:42.019> I

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
going to get the camera set up when I

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:50.100 
going to get the camera set up when I
say<00:00:42.350> set<00:00:42.649> up<00:00:42.769> tilt<00:00:43.070> it<00:00:43.250> forward

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
now let's go ahead and set an altitude

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.259 
now let's go ahead and set an altitude
here<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:03.800> you'll<00:01:04.339> see<00:01:04.610> what<00:01:04.760> I'm<00:01:04.879> talking

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
about when we get to the test and we'll

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.240 
about when we get to the test and we'll
set<00:01:07.700> an<00:01:07.850> altitude<00:01:11.380> we<00:01:12.380> don't<00:01:12.560> need<00:01:12.620> to<00:01:12.740> tie<00:01:12.950> out

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
set an altitude we don't need to tie out

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.500 
set an altitude we don't need to tie out
to<00:01:13.430> total<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:14.030> about<00:01:14.330> 75<00:01:15.050> feet<00:01:15.350> I<00:01:15.410> guess<00:01:16.510> okay

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
change my camera settings to HD 1920 by

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.730 
change my camera settings to HD 1920 by
1080<00:02:50.430> at<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:51.030> hundred<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.750> twenty<00:02:52.140> frames<00:02:52.350> per

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
1080 at a hundred and twenty frames per

1080 at a hundred and twenty frames per
second<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.280> watch<00:02:53.700> what<00:02:54.120> happens<00:02:54.710> this<00:02:55.710> is

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
second and watch what happens this is

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.650 
second and watch what happens this is
the<00:02:56.040> same<00:02:56.250> altitude<00:02:56.460> same<00:02:57.150> distance<00:02:57.600> from

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
the same altitude same distance from

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.010 
the same altitude same distance from
what<00:02:57.960> we<00:02:58.080> left<00:02:58.290> off<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:59.430> look<00:02:59.910> at<00:03:00.210> how<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.780> is

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
what we left off but look at how it is

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.170 
what we left off but look at how it is
automatically<00:03:01.560> off<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.070> sensor<00:03:02.370> on<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.940> here

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
automatically off the sensor on you here

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.410 
automatically off the sensor on you here
now<00:03:03.720> let's<00:03:03.959> go<00:03:04.170> on<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.320> fly<00:03:04.500> er<00:03:05.000> up<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.300> the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
now let's go on and fly er up to the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.780 
now let's go on and fly er up to the
