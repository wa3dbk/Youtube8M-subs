00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
got sorry guys but anyhow it took me

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.410 
got sorry guys but anyhow it took me
probably<00:01:36.299> about<00:01:37.280> 5<00:01:38.280> hours<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:39.119> do<00:01:39.240> this

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
probably about 5 hours to do this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.749 
probably about 5 hours to do this
because<00:01:39.720> number<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:40.950> never<00:01:41.430> done<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
because number one I have never done it

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.450 
because number one I have never done it
before<00:01:42.079> so<00:01:43.079> getting<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.680> first<00:01:43.920> one<00:01:44.250> done

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
before so getting that first one done

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.580 
before so getting that first one done
was<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> true<00:01:45.119> struggle<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.750> tried<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.229> use

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
was a true struggle and I tried to use

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.679 
was a true struggle and I tried to use
the<00:01:46.619> invisible<00:01:47.610> roots<00:01:47.850> method<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:50.390> which<00:01:51.390> I

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
the invisible roots method and which I

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.760 
the invisible roots method and which I
should<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.079> worn<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.350> headband<00:01:52.649> because

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
should have worn this headband because

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.719 
should have worn this headband because
you<00:01:52.950> can't<00:01:53.159> really<00:01:53.310> see<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:56.340> makes<00:01:56.549> it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
you can't really see but it makes it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.240 
you can't really see but it makes it
just<00:01:56.909> look<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:57.810> my<00:01:58.680> hair<00:01:58.920> like

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
just look like it's really my hair like
