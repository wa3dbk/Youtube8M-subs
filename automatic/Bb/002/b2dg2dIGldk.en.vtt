00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:41.960 

so<00:03:33.380> target<00:03:33.620> now<00:03:34.010> go<00:03:34.310> three

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970

that you spend on new weaponry the racer
mode<00:03:53.530> however<00:03:53.769> is<00:03:54.160> far<00:03:54.430> more<00:03:54.610> challenging

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
mode however is far more challenging

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.449 
mode however is far more challenging
because<00:03:55.959> they<00:03:56.200> give<00:03:56.349> you<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.530> multiplier<00:03:57.160> so

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
because they give you a multiplier so

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.520 
because they give you a multiplier so
you<00:03:57.549> can<00:03:57.700> earn<00:03:57.790> lots<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.330> SP<00:03:58.840> but<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.200> moment

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
you can earn lots of SP but the moment

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.119 
you can earn lots of SP but the moment
you're<00:03:59.650> busted<00:04:00.129> you<00:04:00.970> lose<00:04:01.209> all<00:04:01.420> of<00:04:01.569> it<00:04:01.750> and

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
you're busted you lose all of it and

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.860 
you're busted you lose all of it and
that's<00:04:03.129> just<00:04:03.400> infuriating<00:04:04.269> because<00:04:04.569> you<00:04:04.720> have

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
that's just infuriating because you have

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.470 
that's just infuriating because you have
to<00:04:05.019> buy<00:04:05.140> your<00:04:05.379> own<00:04:05.410> cars<00:04:05.890> and<00:04:06.480> performance

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
heat level goes up so does the intensity

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.310 
heat level goes up so does the intensity
of<00:04:21.639> the<00:04:21.790> police<00:04:22.120> chase<00:04:22.419> following<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:23.139> they

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
will you can fly through a gas station

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.730 
will you can fly through a gas station
