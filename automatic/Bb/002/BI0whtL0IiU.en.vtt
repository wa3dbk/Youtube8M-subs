00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
size so how big should are carbs of

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.700 
size so how big should are carbs of
protein<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.820> fat<00:00:12.000> sources<00:00:12.420> be<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.990> will<00:00:13.440> let<00:00:13.679> me

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
protein and fat sources be I will let me

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.010 
protein and fat sources be I will let me
take<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.400> off<00:00:14.580> those<00:00:14.880> get<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.299> wrong<00:00:15.420> so

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.439 
should look like so don't kind of
overestimate<00:01:02.730> make<00:01:02.850> sure<00:01:02.969> your<00:01:03.059> portion<00:01:03.390> is

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449

just<00:01:03.629> kind<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.809> simple<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.320> they're<00:01:04.409> not

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
just kind of simple and they're not

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.380 
just kind of simple and they're not
massive<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.339> about<00:01:05.460> having<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.970> portion

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
massive it's about having a portion

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.700 
massive it's about having a portion
control<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:06.960> gotta<00:01:07.170> remember<00:01:07.350> you're

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
control because gotta remember you're

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.710 
control because gotta remember you're
going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.250> again<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.790> two<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> half

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
going to be again in two and a half

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.320 
going to be again in two and a half
three<00:01:09.930> hours<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.950> portion<00:01:11.670> size<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.850> hugely

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
three hours so portion size is hugely

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.120 
three hours so portion size is hugely
important<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.350> where<00:01:13.560> people<00:01:13.860> tend<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
important and this where people tend to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.980 
important and this where people tend to
take<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.490> extra<00:01:14.909> calories<00:01:15.270> not<00:01:15.479> realize<00:01:15.810> how

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
take in extra calories not realize how

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.810 
take in extra calories not realize how
much<00:01:16.140> they<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.470> reading<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.369> really<00:01:17.610> pay

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
much they are reading so really pay

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.850 
much they are reading so really pay
attention<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.240> your<00:01:18.360> portion<00:01:18.780> size<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.409> I

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
attention to your portion size and I

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.219 
attention to your portion size and I
think<00:01:20.159> also<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.420> seismic<00:01:21.900> plate

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
think also like like the seismic plate

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.800 
think also like like the seismic plate
yeah<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.509> makes<00:01:24.720> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
yeah it's just like that that makes a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.840 
yeah it's just like that that makes a
huge<00:01:25.110> difference<00:01:25.439> or<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:26.040> I'm<00:01:26.280> eating<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
huge difference or what I'm eating and

have our normal size place um there was
a<00:01:32.850> time<00:01:33.119> when<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.540> used<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.900> big<00:01:34.110> place<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> lot

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
a time when we used a big place a lot

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.609 
a time when we used a big place a lot
and<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.700> realized<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.720> was<00:01:36.960> slowly<00:01:37.259> putting

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
and I realized that I was slowly putting

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.560 
and I realized that I was slowly putting
on<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:38.009> away<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:39.150> were<00:01:39.270> looking<00:01:39.360> at

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
on a bit away and we were looking at

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.120 
on a bit away and we were looking at
what<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.810> were<00:01:39.900> eating<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.799> were<00:01:40.920> eating

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
what we were eating we were eating

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.120 
what we were eating we were eating
sometimes<00:01:41.840> 500<00:01:42.840> grams<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.380> minced<00:01:43.740> meat

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
sometimes 500 grams of minced meat

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.850 
sometimes 500 grams of minced meat
between<00:01:44.549> two<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.270> us<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.869> hell<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.710> lot

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
between two of us and that hell of a lot

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.440 
between two of us and that hell of a lot
of<00:01:46.890> meats<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.790> because<00:01:48.030> our<00:01:48.060> plates

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
of meats but it's because our plates

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.719 
of meats but it's because our plates
were<00:01:48.750> big<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.409> we<00:01:49.740> wanted<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.130> fill<00:01:50.369> them<00:01:50.549> up

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
were big and we wanted to fill them up

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.510 
were big and we wanted to fill them up
then<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.479> downsized<00:01:52.020> our<00:01:52.259> plates<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.310> got

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
then we downsized our plates and we got

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.160 
then we downsized our plates and we got
three<00:01:53.790> meals<00:01:54.119> out<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.600> than<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.930> next

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
three meals out of this than the next

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.830 
three meals out of this than the next
day<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.530> took<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.950> work<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:57.030> we

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
day you took it to work and then we

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.209 
day you took it to work and then we
automatically<00:01:58.350> cut<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> third<00:01:58.829> from<00:01:59.100> our

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
automatically cut a third from our

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.730 
automatically cut a third from our
calorie<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.700> fat<00:01:59.759> intake<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:01.320> correctly

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
calorie and fat intake and we correctly

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.430 
calorie and fat intake and we correctly
ate<00:02:01.920> our<00:02:02.130> portion<00:02:02.520> sizes<00:02:02.729> and

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
ate our portion sizes and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.050 
ate our portion sizes and
I<00:02:03.500> think<00:02:03.830> especially<00:02:04.460> when<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:04.940> go<00:02:05.000> to

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
I think especially when you go to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.490 
I think especially when you go to
restaurants<00:02:05.540> restaurants<00:02:05.690> of<00:02:05.960> huge<00:02:06.230> plates

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
restaurants restaurants of huge plates

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.720 
restaurants restaurants of huge plates
and<00:02:06.680> they<00:02:06.980> tend<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.250> give<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.520> massive

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
and they tend to give you massive

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.340 
and they tend to give you massive
portions<00:02:08.150> of<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.540> cheap<00:02:08.750> stuff<00:02:08.900> which<00:02:09.170> being

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
portions of the cheap stuff which being

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.870 
portions of the cheap stuff which being
carbohydrates<00:02:09.979> are<00:02:10.100> cheaper<00:02:10.369> than<00:02:10.460> protein

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
carbohydrates are cheaper than protein

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.520 
carbohydrates are cheaper than protein
so<00:02:11.030> when<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.210> go<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.450> restaurant<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:12.230> tense

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
so when you go to a restaurant you tense

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.080 
so when you go to a restaurant you tense
that<00:02:12.710> you<00:02:12.950> have<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.190> ask<00:02:13.310> for<00:02:13.580> X<00:02:13.700> approaching

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
that you have to ask for X approaching

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.310 
that you have to ask for X approaching
oh<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.240> got<00:02:14.360> like<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.540> tiny<00:02:14.810> bit<00:02:15.050> of<00:02:15.140> protein

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
oh you got like a tiny bit of protein

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.840 
oh you got like a tiny bit of protein
that<00:02:15.620> we're<00:02:15.770> praying<00:02:15.920> rarely<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.460> generous

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
that we're praying rarely the generous

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.090 
that we're praying rarely the generous
on<00:02:16.970> protein<00:02:17.300> because<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.540> costs<00:02:17.840> more<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:18.980> this

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
on protein because it costs more so this

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.470 
on protein because it costs more so this
time<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.310> give<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.490> like<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.060> starchy

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
time to give you like this the starchy

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.390 
time to give you like this the starchy
carbs<00:02:20.840> are<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:20.990> cheap<00:02:21.320> stuff<00:02:21.470> low<00:02:21.830> like<00:02:22.040> so

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
carbs are the cheap stuff low like so

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.920 
carbs are the cheap stuff low like so
