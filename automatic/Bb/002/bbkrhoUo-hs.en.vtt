00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.510
 being but me 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.800
 I believe that fat people is not that one day 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.460
 we were sleeping 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.680
 we woke up we said 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:24.020
 I already know that I want to be 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.020
 I want to be a short dongo 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.420
 my dreams have the biggest belly of the 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.420
 world 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:38.720
 you're fat and that's like wanting to be 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.370
 child in the neighborhood of the boy 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.540
 that is when one was carajillo and 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.990
 I played in the neighborhood of the guy 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.890
 one did not want to be a child 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.050
 I did not want to do kiko or the guy and it was 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.810
 very hard I do not know if you played 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.460
 I love that and the hardest thing is 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:02.390
 that one already told him who had to be 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.770
 to adriÃ¡n who wants to be cast ok on 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.770
 guy and kevin who wants to be the teacher 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.100
 giraffe kiko godin is ready for you 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.100
 boy 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.090
 If I wanted to make the chilindrina 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.340
 there is no right to me this time from the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.740
 fat I find it very interesting because 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.659
 people who are not short think they know 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.659
 what a fat person has to do 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.190
 not to be short and then what 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.440
 advise one 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.900
 the first advice that one gives them do 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.780
 exercise 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.659
 then I'm like this because I do not exercise 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.620
 and it's because the fat man does not get along 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.990
 with sport it is not related 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.520
 there is no way to mount a fat man in a 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.520
 bicycle how much that seat holds 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.360
 you know a fat man in liter 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.140
 put one of those watches that measures you 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.140
 to one the heart does not have the band 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.910
 then the sport for the fat ones does not 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.990
 the first advice not after is not so 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.080
 what you occupy is a diet 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.100
 or food plan as he calls now that 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.680
 It is a food plan 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.730
 that's a stick that they put it to eat 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.970
 as a bird 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.760
 and it's not like he's going to eat a little 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.909
 literally going to eat like a bird 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.110
 oatmeal cookies sesame sticks 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.110
 almonds and water his mother 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.130
 one is not filled with that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.370
 to that diet it is what they do not pass 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.100
 thinking about food all day 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.020
 one is talking about the morning 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.020
 I already have 100 grams of almonds 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.420
 and while you are eating the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.349
 almonds you are thinking about the 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.739
 lunch or salad with 150 grams of 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.739
 fish 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.850
 but some food zombie then 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.410
 that does not help those diets do not work 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.600
 for nothing 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.850
 you end up sending that diet for a 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.080
 tube and the first thing a fat man does 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.270
 after sending the diet through a tube 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.640
 to look for sugar 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.620
 the contact of sugar with fat 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.220
 makes the monster that is inside the 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.220
 fat out 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.960
 the seven demons of emily rose is 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.640
 put one 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.820
 300 pounds devastating everything that is in 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.820
 the kitchen 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.300
 burritos 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.300
 that the exorcist mentions seriously 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.599
 being but better
