00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.510 

so<00:00:02.020> I<00:00:02.050> pulled<00:00:02.470> apart<00:00:02.710> this<00:00:02.860> motor<00:00:03.159> and<00:00:03.280> I<00:00:03.399> was

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:03.520 
so I pulled apart this motor and I was

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.980 
so I pulled apart this motor and I was
looking<00:00:03.790> at<00:00:03.909> it<00:00:03.970> and<00:00:04.000> I<00:00:04.120> was<00:00:04.210> just<00:00:04.359> playing

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:04.990 
looking at it and I was just playing

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.480 
looking at it and I was just playing
with<00:00:05.109> it<00:00:05.350> a<00:00:05.410> little<00:00:05.589> bit<00:00:05.799> I<00:00:05.829> was<00:00:05.979> like<00:00:06.160> hey<00:00:06.309> you

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:06.490 
with it a little bit I was like hey you

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.769 
with it a little bit I was like hey you
guys<00:00:06.640> might<00:00:06.849> actually<00:00:07.059> like<00:00:07.329> something<00:00:07.720> about

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:07.779 
guys might actually like something about

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.340 
guys might actually like something about
this<00:00:08.139> so<00:00:09.270> this<00:00:10.270> down<00:00:10.480> here<00:00:10.780> this<00:00:11.050> is<00:00:11.230> the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350 
this so this down here this is the

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.140 
this so this down here this is the
carburetor<00:00:11.680> and<00:00:12.070> it's<00:00:12.340> very<00:00:12.520> small<00:00:12.820> it<00:00:13.120> fits

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
carburetor and it's very small it fits

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.239 
carburetor and it's very small it fits
over<00:00:13.690> here<00:00:14.490> yeah<00:00:15.490> like<00:00:15.640> so<00:00:15.850> and<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.650> this<00:00:17.890> pipe

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:18.249 
over here yeah like so and so this pipe

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:23.040 
over here yeah like so and so this pipe
here<00:00:18.669> like<00:00:19.179> runs<00:00:19.480> across<00:00:20.579> this<00:00:21.579> is<00:00:21.849> the<00:00:22.480> gas

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
here like runs across this is the gas

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.919 
here like runs across this is the gas
import<00:00:23.679> this<00:00:24.400> is<00:00:24.609> the<00:00:24.789> exhaust<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.659> this<00:00:25.779> is

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
import this is the exhaust and this is

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.599 
import this is the exhaust and this is
the<00:00:26.079> piston<00:00:26.529> so<00:00:27.279> this<00:00:28.169> cover<00:00:29.169> here<00:00:29.679> is<00:00:30.339> kind<00:00:30.550> of

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
the piston so this cover here is kind of

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.370 
the piston so this cover here is kind of
covered<00:00:30.999> it<00:00:31.119> right<00:00:31.239> there<00:00:31.480> and<00:00:32.050> you<00:00:32.169> can<00:00:32.260> see

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
covered it right there and you can see

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.610 
covered it right there and you can see
the<00:00:32.500> spark<00:00:32.830> plug<00:00:33.070> hole<00:00:33.280> right<00:00:33.490> there<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:35.500> a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
the spark plug hole right there it's a

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.270 
the spark plug hole right there it's a
little<00:00:35.770> bit<00:00:35.920> concave<00:00:36.790> too<00:00:37.540> that<00:00:37.690> way<00:00:37.840> you<00:00:37.900> can

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
little bit concave too that way you can

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.250 
little bit concave too that way you can
get<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.400> spark<00:00:39.730> in<00:00:39.880> the<00:00:39.970> gas<00:00:40.120> over<00:00:40.360> there<00:00:40.570> so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
get the spark in the gas over there so

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.630 
get the spark in the gas over there so
there's<00:00:41.560> a<00:00:41.620> little<00:00:41.800> bit<00:00:41.920> of<00:00:42.040> room<00:00:42.280> in<00:00:42.460> here<00:00:42.490> for

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
there's a little bit of room in here for

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.920 
there's a little bit of room in here for
compression<00:00:43.150> till<00:00:43.570> now<00:00:44.560> I<00:00:44.860> got<00:00:45.340> up<00:00:45.550> there

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
compression till now I got up there

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.380 
compression till now I got up there
something<00:00:46.930> holding<00:00:47.260> this<00:00:47.470> brake<00:00:47.860> here<00:00:48.390> so

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
something holding this brake here so

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.490 
something holding this brake here so
that<00:00:49.600> way<00:00:49.990> I<00:00:50.020> can<00:00:50.280> spin<00:00:51.280> this<00:00:51.490> freely<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.500> show

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
that way I can spin this freely and show

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.630 
that way I can spin this freely and show
you<00:00:53.560> guys<00:00:53.680> how<00:00:53.830> this<00:00:54.070> thing<00:00:54.250> works

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
you guys how this thing works

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.210 
you guys how this thing works
so<00:00:55.030> this<00:00:55.150> is<00:00:55.240> a<00:00:55.270> four-stroke<00:00:55.930> so<00:00:56.140> it's<00:00:56.290> got<00:00:56.530> it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
so this is a four-stroke so it's got it

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.980 
so this is a four-stroke so it's got it
goes<00:00:57.370> up<00:00:57.520> and<00:00:57.670> down<00:00:57.700> four<00:00:58.060> times<00:00:58.270> before<00:00:58.840> it

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
goes up and down four times before it

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.020 
goes up and down four times before it
actually<00:00:59.170> to<00:00:59.680> make<00:00:59.860> one<00:01:00.460> power<00:01:00.820> cycle<00:01:01.360> so<00:01:02.880> if<00:01:03.880> I

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
actually to make one power cycle so if I

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.320 
actually to make one power cycle so if I
turn<00:01:04.420> it<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.890> way<00:01:05.950> what<00:01:06.940> it's<00:01:07.030> gonna<00:01:07.120> do

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
turn it this way what it's gonna do

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.210 
turn it this way what it's gonna do
first<00:01:07.780> is<00:01:08.050> it's<00:01:08.260> gonna<00:01:08.350> open<00:01:08.590> this<00:01:08.920> valve

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
first is it's gonna open this valve

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.530 
first is it's gonna open this valve
which<00:01:09.990> sucks<00:01:10.990> in<00:01:11.230> the<00:01:11.380> gas<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:13.240> then<00:01:13.420> it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
which sucks in the gas and then it

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.719 
which sucks in the gas and then it
closes<00:01:13.780> at<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.350> very<00:01:14.620> ends<00:01:15.190> it's<00:01:15.520> kind<00:01:15.700> of

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
closes at the very ends it's kind of

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.930 
closes at the very ends it's kind of
dark<00:01:15.970> in<00:01:16.120> there<00:01:16.270> she<00:01:16.450> can't<00:01:16.690> see<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:18.909> has

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
dark in there she can't see so it it has

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.260 
dark in there she can't see so it it has
quite<00:01:19.390> a<00:01:19.420> stroke<00:01:19.870> on<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.140> that's<00:01:20.710> huge<00:01:21.159> so<00:01:21.460> then

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
quite a stroke on it that's huge so then

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.610 
quite a stroke on it that's huge so then
it<00:01:22.390> compresses<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.140> gas<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:24.250> then<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:26.229> sucks

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
it compresses the gas and then it sucks

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.270 
it compresses the gas and then it sucks
in<00:01:26.860> air<00:01:27.010> here<00:01:29.640> which

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.170 

actually<00:01:34.280> I'll<00:01:34.370> probably<00:01:34.430> suck<00:01:34.790> in<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:35.030> gas

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
actually I'll probably suck in the gas

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.710 
actually I'll probably suck in the gas
in<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.420> air<00:01:35.540> at<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:35.780> same<00:01:35.960> time<00:01:36.350> so<00:01:37.310> it's<00:01:37.460> just

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
in the air at the same time so it's just

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.660 
in the air at the same time so it's just
coming<00:01:38.720> out<00:01:38.810> again<00:01:39.230> I<00:01:39.440> know<00:01:40.190> that<00:01:40.220> that's<00:01:40.520> the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
coming out again I know that that's the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.880 
coming out again I know that that's the
ignition<00:01:40.850> step<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:41.900> up<00:01:42.650> here<00:01:43.010> is<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:45.290> igniter

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
ignition step so up here is the igniter

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.550 
ignition step so up here is the igniter
coil<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:46.430> then<00:01:46.730> this<00:01:46.970> is<00:01:47.150> what<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:48.230> does<00:01:48.320> is

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
coil and then this is what it does is

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.650 
coil and then this is what it does is
when<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:48.800> runs<00:01:48.950> past<00:01:49.220> it<00:01:49.490> creates<00:01:49.850> voltage<00:01:50.360> and

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
when it runs past it creates voltage and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.370 
when it runs past it creates voltage and
follows<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:51.590> spark<00:01:52.250> plug<00:01:52.450> so<00:01:53.450> at<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:54.080> point

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
follows this spark plug so at this point

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.770 
follows this spark plug so at this point
when<00:01:54.980> it's<00:01:55.190> passing<00:01:55.580> this<00:01:55.730> it's<00:01:55.970> igniting<00:01:56.540> and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
when it's passing this it's igniting and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.650 
when it's passing this it's igniting and
this<00:01:56.960> is<00:01:57.110> already<00:01:57.380> going<00:01:58.130> in<00:01:58.430> slightly<00:01:59.000> as<00:01:59.210> you

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
this is already going in slightly as you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.090 
this is already going in slightly as you
can<00:01:59.960> see<00:02:00.760> so<00:02:01.760> it<00:02:02.090> starts<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.230> it<00:02:03.290> ignites<00:02:03.800> and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
can see so it starts and it ignites and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.300 
can see so it starts and it ignites and
then<00:02:05.290> when<00:02:06.290> it<00:02:06.410> gets<00:02:06.560> all<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.710> way<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:06.980> ends

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
then when it gets all the way the ends

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.730 
then when it gets all the way the ends
exhaust<00:02:07.910> opens<00:02:08.330> up<00:02:08.510> and<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.750> pumps<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.110> out<00:02:09.260> and

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
exhaust opens up and it pumps it out and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.350 
exhaust opens up and it pumps it out and
then<00:02:10.369> that's<00:02:10.610> full<00:02:11.090> for<00:02:11.870> revolutions<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:14.330> I

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
then that's full for revolutions so I

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.460 
then that's full for revolutions so I
thought<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:14.720> was<00:02:14.780> interesting<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.380> you

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
thought that was interesting and you

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.920 
thought that was interesting and you
guys<00:02:15.620> might<00:02:15.830> like<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.910> kind<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.420> was<00:02:17.540> pulling

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
guys might like it I kind of was pulling

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.910 
guys might like it I kind of was pulling
apart<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.990> you<00:02:20.990> know<00:02:21.080> this<00:02:21.440> thing<00:02:21.500> bit<00:02:21.890> me

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
apart and and you know this thing bit me

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.590 
apart and and you know this thing bit me
and<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.370> bled<00:02:22.640> on<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.940> already<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.330> I'm<00:02:23.510> just

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
and so I bled on it already so I'm just

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.840 
and so I bled on it already so I'm just
gonna<00:02:23.720> put<00:02:23.960> it<00:02:24.050> back<00:02:24.080> together<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:25.190> looks<00:02:25.460> fine

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
gonna put it back together it looks fine

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.520 
gonna put it back together it looks fine
as<00:02:26.060> far<00:02:26.240> as<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.480> can<00:02:26.540> tell<00:02:26.840> as<00:02:26.990> far<00:02:27.170> as<00:02:27.320> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
as far as I can tell as far as the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.780 
as far as I can tell as far as the
timing<00:02:27.800> which<00:02:28.070> is<00:02:28.190> what<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.370> thought<00:02:28.580> was<00:02:28.760> a

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
timing which is what I thought was a

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.020 
timing which is what I thought was a
major<00:02:29.030> problem<00:02:29.500> but<00:02:30.500> it's<00:02:31.280> probably<00:02:31.580> this

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
major problem but it's probably this

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.970 
major problem but it's probably this
carburetor<00:02:32.600> now<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.990> I'm<00:02:33.080> what<00:02:33.290> thinking

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
carburetor now that I'm what thinking

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.440 
carburetor now that I'm what thinking
you<00:02:34.190> know<00:02:34.310> or<00:02:35.120> now<00:02:35.270> that<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.540> looked<00:02:36.050> at<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.440> it's

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
you know or now that I looked at it it's

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.370 
you know or now that I looked at it it's
probably<00:02:38.450> something<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.750> do<00:02:38.810> with<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.020> chokes

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
probably something to do with the chokes

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.870 
probably something to do with the chokes
but<00:02:39.800> I'm<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.100> thinking<00:02:40.280> since<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.790> already

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
but I'm just thinking since I already

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.490 
but I'm just thinking since I already
took<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.180> apart<00:02:41.450> it's<00:02:41.720> probably<00:02:41.989> fixed<00:02:42.200> by<00:02:42.320> now

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
took it apart it's probably fixed by now

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.690 
took it apart it's probably fixed by now
so<00:02:42.800> I'm<00:02:42.860> just<00:02:42.890> gonna<00:02:43.070> put<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.370> back<00:02:43.459> together

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
so I'm just gonna put it back together

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.370 
so I'm just gonna put it back together
and<00:02:44.180> try<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.420> run<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.750> again<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.260> it'll

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
and try to run it again and it'll

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.920 
and try to run it again and it'll
probably<00:02:45.680> work<00:02:45.940> just<00:02:46.940> how<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.330> works<00:02:47.480> with<00:02:47.750> me

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
probably work just how it works with me

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.790 
probably work just how it works with me
so<00:02:48.530> we'll<00:02:48.890> see<00:02:49.040> how<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.250> goes<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:50.260> yeah<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.709> I

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
so we'll see how it goes and yeah and I

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.870 
so we'll see how it goes and yeah and I
thought<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.040> was<00:02:52.250> interesting<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:52.790> you

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
thought that was interesting and you

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.220 
thought that was interesting and you
guys<00:02:53.000> might<00:02:53.180> like<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.830> inside
