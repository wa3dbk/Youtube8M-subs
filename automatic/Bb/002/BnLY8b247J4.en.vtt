the<00:05:40.500> deck<00:05:40.710> really<00:05:41.900> really<00:05:42.900> works<00:05:43.830> better<00:05:44.190> when

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
the deck really really works better when

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
different version of this deck and I

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.240 
different version of this deck and I
like<00:05:57.419> the<00:05:57.599> speed<00:05:57.900> that<00:05:58.050> it<00:05:58.200> afforded<00:05:58.650> me<00:05:58.800> but<00:05:59.039> I

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
like the speed that it afforded me but I

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.370 
like the speed that it afforded me but I
don't<00:05:59.610> play<00:05:59.820> it<00:05:59.880> right<00:06:00.030> now<00:06:00.270> it's<00:06:01.050> the<00:06:01.200> same

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
don't play it right now it's the same

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.779 
don't play it right now it's the same
reason<00:06:01.530> I<00:06:01.650> don't<00:06:01.800> play<00:06:02.010> fiendish<00:06:02.340> chain<00:06:02.370> in

the deck because of the boars
I<00:06:04.020> really<00:06:04.710> do<00:06:04.889> like<00:06:05.039> boars<00:06:05.370> maybe<00:06:05.940> I<00:06:06.060> won't<00:06:06.330> cut

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
it but I'm gonna do some more tests and

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.800 
it but I'm gonna do some more tests and
see<00:06:08.400> if<00:06:08.460> I<00:06:08.520> can<00:06:08.669> squeeze<00:06:08.910> return<00:06:09.330> in<00:06:09.510> there<00:06:09.690> and
