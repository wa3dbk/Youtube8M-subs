00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.290

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.160
 is an indian reconnaissance drone 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.490
 Solar power could be a whole women 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.059

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.680
 has made nothing 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.980
 They are a studied cow and one 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.570
 Trained pilot and engineer 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.570
 The world no longer needs engineers 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.910
 and are not the planes or 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.510
 TV went out but the 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.510
 foods 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.330
 Why did you me anything 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.190
 Bad murphy's have called bad 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.150
 law does not say that something bad 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.000
 will happen 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.330
 It says that everything can happen 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.330
 will happen 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:56.140
 we have to look the fact in the eye 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.010
 that nothing in our solar system us 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.230
 can help 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.860
 Now they have to tell me how they do that 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.860
 want to save the world 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.700
 we should not save the world at all 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.790
 let them leave and for this 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.830
 mission they were trained I have 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.280
 kids professor then you go out there 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.840
 and save her 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.840
 you do not all come back 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.090
 I could testify 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.910
 we'll have to talk about our own soon 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.910
 to think beyond life 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.850
 we must not think as individuals 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.350
 but as species 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.110
 we have the possibilities 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.110
 use interstellar travel 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.750
 I love you 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.960
