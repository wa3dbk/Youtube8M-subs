00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.850
 In the beginning I can get away from this up here 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:31.920
 made the living area 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:33.300
 well ok so so and stand here 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:47.550
 I sent all of them away now 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:50.760
 memory up there so far is still 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.770
 Harder and doctors later is the camp 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.399
 come on it now leads and 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.140
 Field man in 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.020
 the problem is too fast 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:07.580
 down or too fast then runs high 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:07.580
 fold it exactly so 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:17.670
 Here is a mountain inserted with it 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:18.840
 you do not get it and it gets in here 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:30.079
 blog did not even insert 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:32.130
 both sides come faster you 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.640
 do you have anything else that you learn from 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.420
 you in the environment and then come 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:46.159
 Here's a very deep minecraft 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.159
 has and he just leads to the two 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:57.560
 suggestions before at neighbor now if 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.560
 You can laugh about it I may you are allowed 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.759
 Be my coach and now explain it 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.979
 further then namely a hole thus comes 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.880
 you had to build relatively simple 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.700
 with the simple so I think it's awesome 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.230
 I've aligned that too 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.540
 trained on board takes in the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.290
 pick and need her blog and have 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.420
 always deeper 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.560
 now comes the clou on the matter all the more 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.980
 deeper all the more wrong than 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:32.160
 probably apply 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:43.020
 then the module went hello me 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:45.170
 am park the farmer of course that is 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.170
 heavy
