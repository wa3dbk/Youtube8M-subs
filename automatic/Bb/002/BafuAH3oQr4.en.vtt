00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
more flour because then it's gonna be

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.230 
more flour because then it's gonna be
really<00:01:49.039> really<00:01:49.159> crunchy<00:01:49.759> and<00:01:49.789> it's<00:01:49.969> not<00:01:50.119> gonna

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
really really crunchy and it's not gonna

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
work and so what we do is a little bit

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.219 
work and so what we do is a little bit
fridge<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:53.240> come<00:01:53.359> back<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:53.749> now<00:01:53.929> we<00:01:53.990> will

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
fridge and come back to it now we will

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
it's not fantastic but in theory you

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.580 
it's not fantastic but in theory you
know<00:04:02.940> if<00:04:03.090> I'd<00:04:03.180> kind<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:03.720> set<00:04:03.930> out<00:04:04.050> to<00:04:04.230> do<00:04:04.380> that

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
know if I'd kind of set out to do that

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.130 
know if I'd kind of set out to do that
and<00:04:05.360> research<00:04:06.360> perhaps<00:04:06.660> who<00:04:06.750> I<00:04:06.810> was<00:04:06.959> supposed

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
and research perhaps who I was supposed

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.360 
and research perhaps who I was supposed
to<00:04:07.230> do<00:04:07.380> it<00:04:07.500> might<00:04:07.650> have<00:04:07.770> flipped<00:04:07.980> out

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
to do it might have flipped out

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.440 
to do it might have flipped out
they<00:04:08.490> look<00:04:08.640> really<00:04:08.819> effective<00:04:09.270> when<00:04:09.390> they're

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
they look really effective when they're

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.530 
they look really effective when they're
done<00:04:09.569> correctly<00:04:09.870> but<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.680> was<00:04:10.890> not<00:04:11.480> but<00:04:12.480> I

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
done correctly but that was not but I

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.760 
done correctly but that was not but I
did<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.720> few<00:04:12.840> of<00:04:12.959> them<00:04:13.080> I've<00:04:13.200> not<00:04:13.319> tasted<00:04:13.500> them

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
yet I don't know how many they'll

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.020 
yet I don't know how many they'll
actually<00:04:15.900> be<00:04:16.109> but<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.799> know<00:04:16.829> you<00:04:17.820> know<00:04:17.910> you're
