00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.349 

the<00:00:04.500> rules<00:00:04.740> for<00:00:04.859> 2013<00:00:05.730> have<00:00:05.970> not<00:00:06.120> changed

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
the rules for 2013 have not changed

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.600 
the rules for 2013 have not changed
fundamentally<00:00:06.740> were<00:00:07.740> in<00:00:07.859> for<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.099> same<00:00:08.309> rules

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
fundamentally were in for the same rules

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.570 
fundamentally were in for the same rules
that<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:08.940> had<00:00:09.090> last<00:00:09.630> year<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.769> means<00:00:11.040> if

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
that we had last year and that means if

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.879 
that we had last year and that means if
anything<00:00:12.090> it'll<00:00:12.660> be<00:00:12.840> even<00:00:13.019> more<00:00:13.290> competitive

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
anything it'll be even more competitive

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.310 
anything it'll be even more competitive
there'll<00:00:14.130> be<00:00:14.219> even<00:00:14.610> more<00:00:14.730> bunching<00:00:15.299> up<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
there'll be even more bunching up of the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.950 
there'll be even more bunching up of the
teams<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.920> think<00:00:17.220> you'll<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.880> top<00:00:18.330> tier<00:00:18.690> of

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
teams I think you'll have a top tier of

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.170 
teams I think you'll have a top tier of
four<00:00:19.170> or<00:00:19.289> five<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.859> then<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.310> midfield<00:00:20.730> section

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
four or five and then a midfield section

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.480 
four or five and then a midfield section
and<00:00:22.080> then<00:00:22.350> you'll<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.740> Caterham<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
and then you'll have Caterham and

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.400 
and then you'll have Caterham and
Marussia<00:00:23.730> bringing<00:00:24.300> up<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.539> rear<00:00:24.570> just

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
Marussia bringing up the rear just

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.890 
Marussia bringing up the rear just
behind<00:00:25.680> Toro<00:00:26.369> Rosso<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.970> 2014<00:00:27.539> there<00:00:27.720> are

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
behind Toro Rosso in 2014 there are

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.689 
behind Toro Rosso in 2014 there are
major<00:00:28.439> role<00:00:28.740> changes<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.279> single<00:00:29.580> biggest

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
major role changes the single biggest

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.479 
major role changes the single biggest
one<00:00:30.000> being<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.890> normally<00:00:31.890> aspirated<00:00:32.099> v8

replaced<00:00:34.440> by<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> turbocharged<00:00:35.309> v6<00:00:35.550> which<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
replaced by a turbocharged v6 which is a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.020 
replaced by a turbocharged v6 which is a
big<00:00:37.020> change<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.980> at<00:00:38.100> some<00:00:38.340> point<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.760> season

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
big change so at some point this season

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.700 
big change so at some point this season
teams<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> make<00:00:40.260> decisions

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
teams going to have to make decisions

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.319 
teams going to have to make decisions
about<00:00:40.770> when<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.370> start<00:00:41.670> shifting<00:00:41.910> their

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
about when they start shifting their

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.560 
about when they start shifting their
focus<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.590> next<00:00:43.829> year's<00:00:44.129> car<00:00:44.430> it'll<00:00:45.120> mean<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
focus on to next year's car it'll mean a

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.229 
focus on to next year's car it'll mean a
lot<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.170> teams<00:00:46.410> deploying<00:00:46.950> half<00:00:47.910> their

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
lot of teams deploying half their

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.959 
lot of teams deploying half their
personnel<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.170> work<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.980> 2014<00:00:50.610> engine

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
personnel to work on the 2014 engine

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.250 
personnel to work on the 2014 engine
halfway<00:00:51.390> through<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.780> 2013<00:00:52.530> season<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.670> I

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
halfway through the 2013 season so I

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
halfway through the 2013 season so I
think<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.440> could<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:56.010> could<00:00:56.070> mean<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> very

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
think it could it could mean a very

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.959 
think it could it could mean a very
competitive<00:00:57.539> very<00:00:57.989> exciting<00:00:58.590> year<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.280> 2013

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
competitive very exciting year in 2013

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
competitive very exciting year in 2013
the<00:01:00.420> lack<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.690> technical<00:01:01.230> edge<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.649> going<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the lack of technical edge is going to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.770 
the lack of technical edge is going to
force<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.460> drivers<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.390> much<00:01:03.750> more

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
force that drivers to be much more

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.000 
force that drivers to be much more
competitive<00:01:04.320> with<00:01:04.530> each<00:01:04.589> other<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.890> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
competitive with each other and it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.850 
competitive with each other and it
really<00:01:05.369> will<00:01:05.729> show<00:01:06.450> us<00:01:06.600> quite<00:01:07.140> possibly<00:01:07.500> who

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
really will show us quite possibly who

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.580 
really will show us quite possibly who
has<00:01:08.280> got<00:01:09.090> an<00:01:09.180> edge<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> very<00:01:09.900> level<00:01:10.350> playing

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590

championship the expectations are there
people<00:01:37.979> expect<00:01:38.400> something<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.659> than

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that we expect ourselves to do well

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.570 
that we expect ourselves to do well
again<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.030> there's<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> lot<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.960> pressure

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
again so there's a lot of pressure

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.800 
again so there's a lot of pressure

that he can do this again it's going to
be<00:03:12.549> exciting<00:03:12.850> I<00:03:13.180> think<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.510> first<00:03:13.660> time<00:03:13.989> we

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
be exciting I think the first time we

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.979 
be exciting I think the first time we
see<00:03:14.530> Lewis<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.430> Jensen<00:03:16.360> they're<00:03:16.810> now<00:03:16.959> in

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
see Lewis and Jensen they're now in

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.930 
see Lewis and Jensen they're now in
different<00:03:17.380> cars<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:17.769> both<00:03:17.950> will<00:03:18.519> once<00:03:18.670> better

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
different cars of both will once better

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.180 
different cars of both will once better
prove<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.330> point<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.290> other<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.709> think

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
prove a point to the other I think

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.979 
prove a point to the other I think
McLaren<00:03:21.610> can<00:03:21.820> stay<00:03:22.060> ahead<00:03:22.180> of<00:03:22.269> Mercedes<00:03:22.840> I

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
McLaren can stay ahead of Mercedes I

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.180 
McLaren can stay ahead of Mercedes I
think<00:03:23.170> they<00:03:23.260> might<00:03:23.440> have<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.709> fall<00:03:23.950> back<00:03:23.980> on

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
think they might have to fall back on

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.410 
think they might have to fall back on
their<00:03:24.549> legendary<00:03:25.350> resources<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.680> manpower

their legendary resources and manpower

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.130 
their legendary resources and manpower
Mercedes<00:03:28.420> may<00:03:28.600> well<00:03:28.810> find<00:03:29.019> themselves
