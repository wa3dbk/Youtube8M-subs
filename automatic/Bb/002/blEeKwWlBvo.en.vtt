00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.370 

now<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.790> previous<00:00:03.149> house<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.870> garage<00:00:04.140> was

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
now the previous house the garage was

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.340 
now the previous house the garage was
about<00:00:04.589> 420<00:00:05.339> square<00:00:05.580> feet<00:00:05.660> this<00:00:06.660> one<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.080> about

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
about 420 square feet this one is about

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.879 
about 420 square feet this one is about
300<00:00:08.189> in<00:00:08.370> 30<00:00:08.940> now<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.690> may<00:00:09.929> not<00:00:10.170> sound<00:00:10.559> like<00:00:10.769> a

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
300 in 30 now that may not sound like a

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.560 
300 in 30 now that may not sound like a
big<00:00:10.980> difference<00:00:11.219> but<00:00:11.910> when<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.179> put<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.480> in

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
big difference but when you put it in

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.350 
big difference but when you put it in
terms<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:13.110> vertical<00:00:13.860> space<00:00:13.980> as<00:00:14.400> well<00:00:15.000> as<00:00:15.120> floor

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
terms of vertical space as well as floor

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.650 
terms of vertical space as well as floor
space<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:16.529> adds<00:00:16.800> up<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.820> my<00:00:17.940> solution<00:00:18.449> was<00:00:18.600> to

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
space it adds up so my solution was to

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.210 
space it adds up so my solution was to
eliminate<00:00:19.260> some<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> things<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.160> I

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
eliminate some of the things that I

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.310 
eliminate some of the things that I
normally<00:00:20.279> would<00:00:20.910> store<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.359> garage<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
normally would store in the garage the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.590 
normally would store in the garage the
bicycles<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.340> lawn<00:00:23.550> equipment<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
bicycles the lawn equipment and the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.689 
bicycles the lawn equipment and the
garden<00:00:24.869> supplies<00:00:25.230> all<00:00:25.619> went<00:00:26.130> into<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> shed

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
garden supplies all went into a shed

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.470 
garden supplies all went into a shed
that<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.970> built<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:28.050> backyard<00:00:29.240> that<00:00:30.240> was

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
that I built in the backyard that was

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.810 
that I built in the backyard that was
good<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.470> still<00:00:31.710> wasn't<00:00:31.890> good<00:00:32.070> enough<00:00:32.460> I

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
good but it still wasn't good enough I

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.340 
good but it still wasn't good enough I
still<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> lot<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.570> things<00:00:33.809> sitting<00:00:34.230> on

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
still have a lot of things sitting on

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.319 
still have a lot of things sitting on
the<00:00:34.440> floor<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.399> no<00:00:35.550> place<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.820> go<00:00:36.090> I

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the floor that have no place to go I

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.030 
the floor that have no place to go I
felt<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.079> did<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> pretty<00:00:37.469> good<00:00:37.590> job<00:00:37.800> at

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
felt like I did a pretty good job at

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.010 
felt like I did a pretty good job at
utilizing<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.910> vertical<00:00:39.480> space<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
utilizing the vertical space at the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.990 
utilizing the vertical space at the
other<00:00:40.140> garage<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.800> one<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.610> ways<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.790> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
other garage and one of the ways that I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.540 
other garage and one of the ways that I
did<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.480> was<00:00:42.750> by<00:00:42.960> building<00:00:43.320> these<00:00:44.219> two

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
did that was by building these two

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.490 
did that was by building these two
cabinets<00:00:44.850> these<00:00:45.570> are<00:00:45.719> made<00:00:45.840> out<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.020> pegboard

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
cabinets these are made out of pegboard

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.920 
cabinets these are made out of pegboard
both<00:00:46.680> front<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.190> back<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.570> did<00:00:48.780> that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
both front and back and I did that

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.619 
both front and back and I did that
because<00:00:49.050> at<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> time<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.739> thought<00:00:50.629> pegboard

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
because at the time I thought pegboard

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.740 
because at the time I thought pegboard
was<00:00:51.930> really<00:00:52.649> cool<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:54.329> could<00:00:54.449> never<00:00:54.600> get

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
was really cool and you could never get

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.990 
was really cool and you could never get
enough<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.500> hey<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:56.250> all<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.760> things

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
enough of it but hey we all have things

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.970 
enough of it but hey we all have things
in<00:00:57.210> our<00:00:57.329> past<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.750> we're<00:00:57.989> not<00:00:58.559> proud<00:00:58.739> of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
in our past that we're not proud of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.220 
in our past that we're not proud of
I<00:00:59.420> thought<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.719> would<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> really

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
I thought that this would be a really

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.840 
I thought that this would be a really
good<00:01:01.410> idea<00:01:01.559> because<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.280> come<00:01:02.489> get<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.820> I

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
good idea because I just come get what I

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.490 
good idea because I just come get what I
wanted<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:03.660> put<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.960> back<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.290> as

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
wanted and then put it back just as

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.980 
wanted and then put it back just as
easily<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.549> found<00:01:05.850> was<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.570> these

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
easily but what I found was that these

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.570 
easily but what I found was that these
hooks<00:01:07.290> tend<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> fall<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> ground<00:01:08.100> and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
hooks tend to fall to the ground and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.190 
hooks tend to fall to the ground and
then<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.820> never<00:01:09.090> wanted<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.570> search<00:01:09.869> form

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
then I never wanted to go search form

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.990 
then I never wanted to go search form
and<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:10.470> put<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.770> back<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.040> where<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.220> was<00:01:11.369> so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
and then put it back to where it was so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.929 
and then put it back to where it was so
what<00:01:12.180> ended<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.540> happening<00:01:13.460> was<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.729> right

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
what ended up happening was this right

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.179 
what ended up happening was this right
here<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.540> stopped<00:01:16.140> hanging<00:01:16.470> things<00:01:16.890> all

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
here I just stopped hanging things all

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.240 
here I just stopped hanging things all
together<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:18.259> started<00:01:19.259> stacking<00:01:19.500> them<00:01:19.740> here

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.859 

so<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.670> side<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.119> see<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.689> gave

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
so on this side you can see that I gave

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.570 
so on this side you can see that I gave
up<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> hooks<00:01:25.350> all<00:01:25.500> together<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.369> just

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
up the hooks all together and I just

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.399 
up the hooks all together and I just
stuck<00:01:26.970> some<00:01:27.180> shelves<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.259> always

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
stuck some shelves in here and I always

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.240 
stuck some shelves in here and I always
found<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.520> lot<00:01:29.939> better<00:01:30.450> than<00:01:31.250> this

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
found this to be a lot better than this

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.280 
found this to be a lot better than this
like<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> lot<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.150> things<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.570> life<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.780> learn

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
like a lot of things in life you learn

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.109 
like a lot of things in life you learn
about<00:01:34.439> yourself<00:01:34.680> when<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.579> build<00:01:35.880> things

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
about yourself when you build things

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.940 
about yourself when you build things
like<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.780> don't<00:01:37.110> exactly<00:01:37.409> live<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.920> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
like this that don't exactly live up to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.210 
like this that don't exactly live up to
expectations<00:01:38.700> what<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> learned<00:01:39.689> about<00:01:39.869> me<00:01:40.350> was

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
expectations what I learned about me was

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.819 
expectations what I learned about me was
that<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.579> had<00:01:41.610> more<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.470> box<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> wall

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
that I had more of a box on the wall

have tested my measurement on a piece of

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.039 
have tested my measurement on a piece of
scrap<00:04:07.109> but<00:04:07.829> I<00:04:07.859> got<00:04:08.040> lucky<00:04:08.189> all<00:04:08.670> right<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:09.209> some

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
scrap but I got lucky all right so some

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:18.069 
scrap but I got lucky all right so some
glue

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
I don't get a lot of use out of these

I don't get a lot of use out of these
right-angled<00:04:20.689> clamps<00:04:21.079> I<00:04:21.259> find<00:04:21.620> them<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.829> be

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
right-angled clamps I find them to be

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.040 
right-angled clamps I find them to be
clumsy<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:22.639> hard<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.090> set<00:04:23.300> up<00:04:23.419> I<00:04:23.599> always<00:04:23.780> feel

so bent and warp I need something to

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.629 
so bent and warp I need something to
hold<00:04:29.780> these<00:04:29.990> sides<00:04:30.379> static<00:04:31.039> so<00:04:31.189> I<00:04:31.219> can<00:04:31.430> tack

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
hold these sides static so I can tack

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:49.899 
hold these sides static so I can tack
everything<00:04:32.060> together<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:49.400> top<00:04:49.610> and<00:04:49.819> bottom
