00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.240
 Guitar strings are on top of the head 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.300
 plate and corpus since I am bizarre 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.759
 the web is distinguished 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.949
 classic knÃ¼pp bridge and the modern 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.300
 stands at the strings with the bridge 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.310
 be attached to plugs 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.869
 especially on the dock will be the pages 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.769
 vibration on the guitar cover 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.769
 transfer 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.530
 because the pages each with several 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.110
 kilogram traction on this important 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.360
 the part of the guitar must be decorated with the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.030
 of the web on the ceiling verleihung iTAN 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.280
 be particularly durable 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.860
 at cheap titanium the bridge often 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.720
 In addition, although not screwed high 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.879
 but construction art fulfills this 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.559
 certainly its purpose the screws 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.230
 become discreet with small caps 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.510
 Covered one looks from the corpus 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.910
 side should be between steak and lies 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.760
 does not cover a clearly visible air gap 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.640
 its processing volume at this point 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.610
 are done at cheaper times more often 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.100
 find if it is still in the frame 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.600
 and that is not half free 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.760
 then hovering in the air can be so 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.220
 Lack of try and flea market 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.979
 to be accepted 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.690
 Possibility is the jetty breaks off later 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.619
 but the probability for this is 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.619
 not everyone should be so attentive 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.450
 done buyers check whether the colorful bars 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.440
 These are the inserted rods 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.590
 fingerboard sideways on the fingerboard edge 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.320
 protrude 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.820
 that can be felt faster than 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.550
 check with the eye 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.890
 The guitar buyer covers the done 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.470
 as with thumbs and forefingers and checks 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.560
 so on both sides of the fingerboard edge 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.120
 between the head plate and the body 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.580
 protruding bund bars are considered fine 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.550
 clearly felt peak resistance 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.290
 such a finding is no indication 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.790
 a fundamentally flawed 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.060
 processing the guitar 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.280
 He is also not a criterion when buying 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.739
 because the colorful bars in the specialty shop 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.550
 can be easily reworked 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.860
 The cause is almost always that the wood 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.390
 dried after processing 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.420
 and thereby shrunk 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.120
 while the colorful bars of metal themselves 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.129
 have not changed normal apartment 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.260
 falls comes the further dry out the 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.629
 woods of the budget standstill for 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.519
 but it should be strictly avoided 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.860
 the instrument near stronger 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:39.230
 heat sources such as stoves 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.230
 or radiator permanently store 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.950
 when the titan buyer finally out 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.350
 the different models of one 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.240
 specific price range a closer 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.340
 choice has started 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.530
 play a sample 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.050
 usually the selection is now only on 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.140
 limited to two or three instruments 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.730
 differ done the remaining 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.400
 of course, in the clear 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.020
 but they also differ in the 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.530
 so-called playability of the 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.570
 instruments who are the very first guitar 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.550
 do not buy and therefore do not try it yourself 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.440
 he should be able to play 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.050
 Salesman on the different guitars 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.230
 audition the narrower choice 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.140
 then the buyer should change the seller 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.560
 his personal assessment to everyone 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.080
 ask the done done ask 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.120
 Great influence on how easy it is 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.130
 has a guitar playing 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.340
 distance between sides and fingerboard 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.290
 This is called the lateral position 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.390
 a small gap does provide for a 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.550
 easy playability but under 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.800
 circumstances with unwanted annoying 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.750
 Noises are expensive to buy 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.480
 the other extreme one too high 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.480
 Seitenlage makes it difficult to grasp the 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.340
 instruments quite considerably if one 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.470
 obviously playing mistakes due 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.239
 possible nervousness aside 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.030
 eventually turns different 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.040
 you can ask the listened 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.100
 done easier than the old one 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.250
 guitar at home which guitar lets itself 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.519
 best game which title sounds rather 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.340
 bright which rather dark which matt 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:31.810
 which strong which guitar is the 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:34.090
 loudest tab is the decision for 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.940
 a guitar pleases itself 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.760
 Good last the question after the necessarily 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.830
 necessary titan listener 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.140
 guitar student can be his first 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.140
 try on the fingerboard only then 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.630
 check if the instrument 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.699
 is tuned properly 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.610
 a voice of my guitar only after 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:57.780
 But hearing is much harder than that 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.250
 Feeding the first few handles and strokes 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.740
 For this reason, the purchase is 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:07.110
 a done tuner english that did 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:09.910
 young without if and to be recommended 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.460
 for the transport of the guitar becomes one 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.370
 guitar bag or english goes beck 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.410
 Needed bags are done today 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.360
 usually always more or less thick 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.270
 upholstery with circumferential zipper 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.669
 provided and with backpack the straps 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.490
 carrying the guitar in the bus or too 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.919
 on the bike easier 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.289
 to store the guitar at home 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:35.259
 However, a guitar stand needed 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.569
 Both kick back and stand serve 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:39.340
 In addition, the security damages 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.169
 almost always arise on the guitar 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.979
 during the transport or through 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.690
 careless storage 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.880
 who think of that early on something 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.130
 harder games to play with 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.349
 would like to get used to a suspended guitar 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.099
 should also have a guitar boat 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.159
 to buy 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:59.259
 in the shop should be checked if the 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.539
 guitar possibly on its underside 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:04.150
 still with a belt button retrofitted 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:07.120
 must be done classic also children 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:10.289
 I usually do not do a good job 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.289
 already assembled ex factory
