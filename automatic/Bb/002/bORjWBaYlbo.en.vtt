you<00:00:51.390> know<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.719> did<00:00:51.960> before<00:00:52.079> he<00:00:52.410> was<00:00:52.590> quite<00:00:52.829> quite

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.119 
difference and I realized I didn't make
a<00:01:03.480> huge<00:01:03.750> difference<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.110> mean<00:01:04.290> when<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:04.979> was

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and I think that's what comes from the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.350 
and I think that's what comes from the
fight<00:01:19.860> even<00:01:20.580> though<00:01:20.670> still<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.939> went<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.330> there

everything and then was up in your money

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.069 
everything and then was up in your money
why<00:01:29.759> he<00:01:29.909> didn't<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.570> hundred<00:01:30.990> percent

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
why he didn't do that a hundred percent

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.350 
why he didn't do that a hundred percent
at<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> time<00:01:31.680> yeah<00:01:32.369> exactly<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.030> think<00:01:33.240> or

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
at the time yeah exactly and I think or

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.359 
at the time yeah exactly and I think or
just<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> way<00:01:33.720> that's<00:01:33.990> kept<00:01:34.530> me<00:01:34.590> he<00:01:34.950> was<00:01:35.100> much

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
just the way that's kept me he was much

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.370 
just the way that's kept me he was much
stronger<00:01:35.610> than<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.939> was<00:01:36.119> he<00:01:36.299> yeah<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> mean<00:01:37.170> I

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
stronger than you was he yeah I mean I

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.660 
stronger than you was he yeah I mean I
think<00:01:37.409> physically<00:01:37.979> he<00:01:38.159> was<00:01:38.250> stronger<00:01:38.460> than<00:01:38.520> me

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
think physically he was stronger than me

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.039 
think physically he was stronger than me
I<00:01:38.729> mean<00:01:38.850> he's<00:01:38.970> punch<00:01:39.240> power<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.600> took<00:01:39.659> all<00:01:39.960> his

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
I mean he's punch power I took all his

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.170 
I mean he's punch power I took all his
all<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.680> best<00:01:40.829> shots<00:01:41.040> he<00:01:41.189> had<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.549> took<00:01:41.850> all<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
all the best shots he had I took all the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.310 
all the best shots he had I took all the
shots<00:01:42.329> he's<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> one<00:01:42.720> who<00:01:42.840> went<00:01:42.960> down<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
shots he's the one who went down the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.770 
shots he's the one who went down the
early<00:01:43.560> rounds<00:01:43.680> he's<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.579> one<00:01:44.729> who<00:01:44.909> was<00:01:45.390> her<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
early rounds he's the one who was her a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.060 
early rounds he's the one who was her a
few<00:01:45.930> times<00:01:46.110> even<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> towards<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> end

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
few times even in the towards the end

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.490 
few times even in the towards the end
but<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.820> think<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.780> way<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.350> way

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
but I just think the way in the way

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.520 
but I just think the way in the way
making<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.009> did<00:01:50.189> was<00:01:50.659> just<00:01:51.659> unprofessional<00:01:52.079> I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
making I did was just unprofessional I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.260 
making I did was just unprofessional I
think<00:01:52.740> that's<00:01:52.860> what<00:01:52.979> cost<00:01:53.189> me<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> fight<00:01:53.610> even

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
think that's what cost me the fight even

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.260 
think that's what cost me the fight even
though<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.450> know<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.840> timed<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> fight<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.340> was

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
though you know I timed in a fight I was

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.730 
though you know I timed in a fight I was
to<00:01:57.390> fight<00:01:57.570> about<00:01:57.659> ten<00:01:57.990> times<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.409> I've<00:01:58.530> scored

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
to fight about ten times and I've scored

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.530 
to fight about ten times and I've scored
in<00:01:58.890> myself<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.399> I'm<00:01:59.759> not<00:01:59.909> being<00:02:00.060> biased<00:02:00.420> as

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
