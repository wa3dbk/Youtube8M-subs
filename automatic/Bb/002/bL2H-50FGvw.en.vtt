 small screws 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.030
 here 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.560
 nthe 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:59.410
 it was not harder than that and that's it 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.070
 your iphone 4 the new hull 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.400
 I had at the same time you ready for 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.690
 introduce you to the different types of a 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.880
 protection group that we can 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.230
 find 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.140
 we first have the hulls in 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.250
 plastic who are not who are 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.670
 not very practical easy to put very 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.450
 pretty all that but quite difficult with 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.750
 you have to have nails to scratch 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.610
 like this here and in addition to his claw 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.350
 a little bit read them on the side 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.890
 can find these is the 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.430
 plastic heat that is very flexible 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:46.760
 Calcium but it's called rubber 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:52.570
 which is very convenient to the adventur 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:55.400
 has the kinds of movies like these 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:04:01.510
 it's very easy to put your iphone 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:05.330
 and remove the top and it smells 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:09.500
 we have the transparent plastic behind 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.480
 with rubber on the sides not bad 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.070
 as well 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.800
 but all these popcorn does not protect 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:22.630
 really the only copy portrait 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:27.650

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.690
 it's just a group of 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:41.210
 something plastics protects 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:44.560
 screen so you slip like that 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.560
