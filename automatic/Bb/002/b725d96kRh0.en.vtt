00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.509
 hi hello everyone and today a video that 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.160
 Maria Esther was good 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.880
 and that for me is one of the weapons 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.039
 favorites we talk about the 917 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.640
 the td model 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:25.050
 a double sure for me this is the 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:29.630
 safest gun out there from the market 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.630
 without having any manual eye insurance 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.820
 although they put the manual that triggers the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.300
 simple double action is by normal 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.440
 shot is just bone on chip the 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.410
 action because we once 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.510
 we load the weapon as you see and it enters 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.340
 simple action now I'm going to teach you 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.400
 how is there a way in this model 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.800
 we do not in this model of power 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.840
 move to double action and throw there 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.180
 be very careful and rehearse before 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.980
 because if you can not escape a shot and 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.490
 I also want you to go I'm going to 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.540
 teach how the two are effective 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.540
 insurance look 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.390
 9 in makeup the weapon that can be made 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.780
 and now we would pass 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.780
 to double action we are going to disassemble it 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.890
 look at the hammer right now 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.880
 as you see is cast is mounted 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.759
 I would be ready to shoot what 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.420
 we pull the trigger but not the 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.750
 lever 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.280
 look what it does 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.000
 but it does not shoot 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.450
 that is, the first insurance works 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.320
 perfectly 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.170
 now let's simulate 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.770
 and that it was a hammer fall 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.330
 although if we had the finger and not 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.890
 we had a good grip of the soul if not 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.390
 it was a shot that we 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:08.509
 We want to look at how the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.590
 second sure and the hammer has been 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.590
 halfway braked 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.820
 then the two work now I'm going to 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.730
 teach the way to remove make-up and 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.600
 in this way if I would already have in the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.170
 bedroom 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.330
 a cartridge like being able to shoot in double 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.380
 action look 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:38.330
 you have to press very hard back 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:40.100
 and the and the trigger very carefully 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.200
 we 're going to tighten it back up 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.200
 pass the force of the trigger 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.540
 now let's move up 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.469
 look, I have already passed the force of 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.880
 trigger 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:13.690
 now I look slowly releasing 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.330
 Now you see the hammer is already 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.520
 rested and we would have the cartridge in 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.090
 the chamber now we could shoot 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.540
 double action look 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.959
 you see 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.470
 shoot and masters in double action look at 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.220
 it came but we would have to do the same 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:39.210
 we are in safe 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:42.630
 We passed the city to the castle and let go 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:45.620
 and we would be ready for again in 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.620
 double action 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.770
 to get and look at it well then this 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.290
 bando trick first what did you want that 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.930
 see how the two systems work 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.560
 of security and how we can be worth 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.840
 both systems to remove the weapon 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.080
 It is very important that you never leave 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.819
 no cocking since the dock 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.880
 is losing pressure over time 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.099
 as long as it is left to hammer the 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.889
 soul and the other way that I wanted you 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.229
 teaching is like with her with this model 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.010
 specifically, you can shoot in 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.010
 double action 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.230
 we continue for other 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:37.869
 we would mount it I repeat it for me this is 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:37.869
 one of the favorites 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.130
 and for hammering we would do this 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.430
 we skip the second one and we would do what 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:54.000
 we have done before now we are only the 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.280
 trigger and look already has pressure 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 in response to sin hammered 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.000
 how to do it with those who do not have the 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.010
 sure back as there is a way and it is 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.840
 the next you just have to take a 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.080
 cartridge that is already thrown that is 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.410
 used only once 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.410
 we take 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.770
 we put in the charger 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:30.370
 you get inside we move to the bedroom 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:30.370
 and we make the shot 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.810
 the soul is already cleansed and there is no 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.380
 danger of the rod breaking 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:43.790
 because although the cartridge is already used 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:46.970
 on the piston as it never bites any 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.350
 any right in the center stings a 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.180
 little bit of the left up to the 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.830
 right down 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.570
 we're not going to see it right in 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.180
 the position he has given and even though 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.669
 let's get in 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.759
 he always has a little more left 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.740
 to the slack piston to brake the 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.580
 rod and do not hit dry and we were 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.530
 break 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.250
 it's just I have a way of 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.400
 remove the makeup and now I'm going to show you 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.900
 other 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.700
 from the makeup artist but for this 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.110
 you need 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.110
 13 80 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.400
 here you already have 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.920
 which is called relieves springs and is 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.530
 exactly for that with this one 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.000
 we would exactly look at the same 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.000
 simply with doing so 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.520
 and put it in the bedroom 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:43.510
 there is only slowly and we simply do 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.510
 we shoot 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:52.570
 and that was what it contains is a 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.490
 spring on the piston that when they stick the 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.860
 piston the spring is contracted is very 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:01.840
 strong and does not let the percussion needle 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:03.070
 stick empty this is another way in the 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.650
 that do not have the possibility of 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:09.040
 hammer as I do so from this 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:13.440
 way or with a cartridge already used or 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:16.650
 buying point 280 to Libya docks 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.540
 Well I hope you liked friends 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.750
 and even the video 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.750
 bye
