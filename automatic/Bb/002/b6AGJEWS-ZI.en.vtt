00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:09.960
 due to course the fun man 11 né 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.269
 what will be covered in the course, let's go 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.240
 have some doubts here is is the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.940
 Frequently Asked Questions 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.390
 streets of totally cool people - 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.910
 who does not know the program is still 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.920
 knowing the program by setting the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.810
 program by configuring with the 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.450
 configuring with the contact and running 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.360
 rhythms editing and correcting rhythms 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.420
 creating and saving rhythms creating me and 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.210
 recording playback 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.739
 is returned knowing the program you 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:53.190
 will know what the program is for 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:56.670
 the program does and how does it configure 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.440
 with the controller by setting the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.890
 program you set up in the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.660
 program you will learn step by step 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.090
 How to properly configure the program 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.530
 already left at the point of execution is 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.930
 configuring with the controller here 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.770
 will learn how to configure configure the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.030
 with your controller 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.420
 no matter what the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.580
 controller by configuring with the contact 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.939
 here we will configure the program 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.460
 the scaffold with the contact correctly 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.100
 all the channels step by step and you 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.350
 I really learned here from scratch to do 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.000
 that 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.299
 performing rhythms here after 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.720
 configuration to use the program 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:47.070
 step by step completing this is total 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.350
 knowledge here in part yields to the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.659
 part 8 editing and correcting rhythms 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.310
 here you already know how to operate the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.439
 program and now you will learn how to 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.479
 correct and rhythms 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.090
 many times you pick up a pace puts 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.700
 in the program and he does not play it does not come out 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.469
 only the program changes completely 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.479
 sometimes performs but does not just leave people 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.910
 can be some then you will learn 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.849
 to correct the errors rhythms rhythms 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.810
 you put into the program and you do not 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.690
 only one out 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.770
 this program he only specifically 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.170
 the sty file is the file and ties 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.700
 keyboards and mooring then it's no use 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.760
 put another type of file that he 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.430
 You will not run will catch does not work 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.319
 is creating and saving rhythms will you 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.560
 create from scratch a pace your bid goes 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.319
 save will modify here is totally 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.620
 something new that will never learn 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.019
 from scratch to create a rhythm your own 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.400
 within the program without the 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:49.830
 keyboards with only the program is creating 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.069
 a file measuring 10 you will learn 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.800
 create a mid within the program and by 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.910
 recording a sequence by recording a 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.440
 playback right 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.030
 and you'll learn there touch you will 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.220
 playing and singing a song will learn to 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.409
 record this song within the program and 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.640
 saved soon after executing your 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.930
 playback and take measurements and then 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.530
 against 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:19.920
 good're here because the message is for the course 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.860
 the fun atmosphere 11 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.849
 I'm going to cover some parts in version 10 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.530
 that actually version 7 in version 10 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.580
 and there are some things in the version 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.640
 11 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.040
 certainly version 11 I recommend if 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.790
 to see if you're up to date I 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.769
 I recommend 11 very good version 11 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:47.010
 so there is some detail that in 7 and 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:50.040
 in 10 years and in the 10 to 7 naná 7 to 10 already 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.739
 then has version 7 and 10 pardon in 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.439
 version 10 has some feature I think it is 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.900
 a resource editing feature I 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:01.500
 I think it kind of defines it, it's not here. 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.450
 It is a means business that you missed and then 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.959
 I'll correct with you show the 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:10.530
 You 're like setting up 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.599
 very interesting program here that 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.730
 you will not be able to do it without opening 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.040
 without running version 10 I do not recommend 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.699
 low program operation of the other ne 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.699
 make a 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.300
 it is a knowledge of some things 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.710
 because it will be approached with some 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.190
 things of version 10 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.190
 so that's it and until the first class
