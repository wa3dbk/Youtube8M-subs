these apps have been compared to one

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.920 
these apps have been compared to one
another<00:00:18.490> but<00:00:18.730> in<00:00:19.000> reality<00:00:19.540> there<00:00:19.720> are<00:00:19.750> two

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
another but in reality there are two

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.390 
another but in reality there are two
completely<00:00:20.230> different<00:00:20.470> amps<00:00:21.040> different

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
completely different amps different

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.850 
completely different amps different
preamps<00:00:21.850> different<00:00:22.210> power-ups<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:23.680> only

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
preamps different power-ups the only

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.530 
preamps different power-ups the only
thing<00:00:24.070> that<00:00:24.250> is<00:00:24.370> similar<00:00:24.730> about<00:00:24.970> them<00:00:25.030> is<00:00:25.360> the

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
thing that is similar about them is the

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.660 
thing that is similar about them is the
design<00:00:25.900> aesthetics<00:00:26.680> and<00:00:26.860> that<00:00:27.490> they're
