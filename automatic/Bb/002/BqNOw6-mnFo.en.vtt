00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.769
 hey people here is nemesis hd heartily 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:16.490
 Welcome to our next preview 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.320
 today it's about ribéry 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.800
 before we had crawls and this time 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.720
 it's about ribery so robbery already 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.090
 times commented ribéry is ours 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.790
 opinion of one of the best players 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.430
 at all in the game so the guy is 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.570
 just unbelievably good 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.710
 but let's start at his pace 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.410
 this 91 pace I can tell you are 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.720
 extremely fast but felt they are lying 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.870
 rather at 87 or 88 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.020
 and that is due to be through his 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.300
 93 dribbling is the closer to the ball 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.130
 dribbles the slower felt 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.440
 so if you send him then you feel 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.149
 the 91 if he is on the ball then rather like 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.479
 87 88 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.640
 then I want something to his best 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.310
 say he is the second best third 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.830
 play after the game and after 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.690
 lionel messi and that's how it feels 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.619
 the guy is an incredible hammer 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.360
 strong dribbler you can with him 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.360
 start and if the defender 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.220
 only 50 centimeter vms will be the despite 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.760
 will make it still deliver from 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.650
 and run past him is so strong 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.280
 he's dribbling so that's unbelievable 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.400
 Well 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.320
 in our opinion also the the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.450
 only one of the really lena moderate 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 arrives can from dribbling ago so the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.430
 really almost identical 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.170
 then I would like something for you 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.240
 shot say his 78 are shot 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.500
 Well it's nothing special I can 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.330
 tell you 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.220
 then please do not promise so 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.860
 So much for an arjen robben 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.900
 on the left everything looks much better 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.510
 off and my marco reus from the left will be 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.149
 that also better from the shot but 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.970
 its flanks in the 4 3 3 system 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.250
 I wish him missing with the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.640
 striker strong game striker his 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.930
 flanks are incredibly good 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.040
 just perfect on you 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.300
 played upside down again and again 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.060
 so you can always do it anyway 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.370
 send triple strong his shots are 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.500
 okay is nothing special 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.270
 I have to give you his attached ones 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.830
 say but are better than the long ones 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.010
 protection in any case because in shop power 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.220
 he only has 76 and that is ours 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.360
 opinion not good 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.000
 then I wanted to tell you something else 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.070
 is pretty weak so he 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.870
 could also be caught by a rocker 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.940
 be shoved off and off 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.390
 that is a little bit of every now and then 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.980
 annoying but he really is the true one 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.110
 ribéry r is really playing 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.209
 unbelievably good and the four stars 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.200
 to make wegfurt and five stars sketch 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:13.230
 him a lot more dangerous on the 16th 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.459
 is small agile he is ribery ours 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.850
 Final rating is 9 8 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.680
 of 10 and the price performance ratio 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.640
 unfortunately only at a 75 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.200
 because a million for a left outside 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.390
 and there is one more in the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.620
 bundesliga already alone a marco reus 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.940
 or a lavezzi sally carr the 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.290
 can not provide similar 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.440
 strong are like ribery therefore 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.890
 understandable but similarly strong and for 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:48.260
 one tenth of the price so explain 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.260
 that was it from us we are out
