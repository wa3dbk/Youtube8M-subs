00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.670
 so we are in the program for 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.940
 erase cultural clues so the goal is 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.519
 to completely erase the data 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.870
 use since the first day we 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.930
 started working on the disks 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.580
 hard and until today is so the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.470
 purpose it's actually having a hard drive 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.650
 yesterday for nobody to recover 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.029
 the data and so in fact that can 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.210
 to erase data 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.579
 confidential or else to resell at 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.559
 sculptures without having photos of 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.590
 support documents 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.469
 so that's ready for midnight 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.790
 surprises so that's how it feels 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.420
 works so here we are in a 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.969
 software that is very serious so we 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.340
 does a low level formatting this is at 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.629
 that we will recover the disk as 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.390
 like the outputs of the sinn 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.280
 and so here is a little bit 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.770
 complicated finally a bit complicated 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210
 products not know but finally me I 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.940
 will give you my method for them 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.140
 facades sculpture quickly done well done 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.280
 so in fact what you need to know is 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.110
 that if you have one or more 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.220
 mechanical what is in most 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.720
 computers a tetra to maybe that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.729
 puts more or less 20 hours for three 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.799
 passages so that gives you an idea 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.670
 so if you want to completely erase 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.229
 hard drive does six or eight passages 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.659
 you will see the show you 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.939
 different types of passage that has and the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.229
 different no I prefer two 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.820
 passages three passages because I 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.009
 think of bugeat two basins three 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.810
 passages with desertification it's already 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.079
 not bad so then we will start to 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.430
 select a hard drive so there in 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.920
 do we are in a virtual machine 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.409
 where I do my tests it takes twice 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.409
 I use so it's a little bit 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.549
 complicated for me so here we go 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.829
 select a small memory card 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.250
 you can select a hard drive 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.780
 of 160 1 4 to 2 work maybe this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.420
 so depends on me I'm doing a tesla for 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.110
 show you how it works so 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.290
 there we are in a small studio 270 kg I 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.290
 thought 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.819
 I use a mouse actually on the 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:15.300
 laptop 770k zone this one so 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.849
 so we're going to look a little at the ra 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.459
 paul disk is reached so it serves 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.940
 completely erase a disc and that 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.310
 it's use erased 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.810
 unused space what a little space 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.269
 even here is the real face and all the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.780
 disc we click on it so admit it 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.810
 in the small window of the passages so 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.700
 if you have points 2 assists 0 a 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.230
 safe passage with zero entries 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.459
 one pass secundum ie and write 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.769
 randomly on the disk to erase 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.780
 so there you see usd on death the 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.970
 Ministry of Defense but is 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.420
 American so I propose three 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.730
 checking passages the cdu and got 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.400
 handed three passages so check there 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.709
 it's all standards of disarmed countries 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.120
 who use this software for with 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.829
 this certification to erase it 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.720
 completely a sculpture that 's where 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.910
 allows you to if you work a 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.970
 sensitive sector in a study office 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.680
 where you are administrator of this 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.430
 computer you manipulate data 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.530
 confidential 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.900
 it allows you to clear near sale 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.269
 or deliver this disc 1 game to 0 and from 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.209
 reuse them elsewhere so the new bond 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.400
 I use this one I have 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.639
 studied that one is then I have 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.840
 use that one so we'll do the one 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.340
 there so do not forget when you're there 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.530
 make record of sectioning what 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:43.049
 will pay confirmation so here we will do 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.970
 a hue is what you see you I 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:49.200
 will not all the way to that it 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:53.090
 takes at least twelve hours so then 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.090
 click start and here we go 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.980
 you see it's gone there's some 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.170
 name she will calculate the method I'm going 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.880
 put a little full will grow a little bit 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.680
 window on my mind 13h and 15h 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.900
 normally they have to give their 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.670
 remaining 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.990
 so here's actually here you do not have 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.600
 still 6h16 to the for two passages on 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.150
 a 160 gigabyte hard drive so you 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.730
 see it's not bad so it erases 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.870
 really really really really for 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.150
 low level formatting is 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.370
 really beautiful here that's me I want you 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.880
 I use to tell erase 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.520
 customer sculptures I said for 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.800
 erase the excluded ribbon we first 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.230
 national customers whose ing 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.860
 we still know we ate the 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.810
 bank 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.449
 we have 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.729
 hospitals 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.559
 we erase data not that these ten 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.360
 which are found on the market and that 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:51.879
 clever little recovers the data so 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.860
 that's what the customers are they are 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:55.599
 satisfied and to anyone who recovers the 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.360
 data and we can reuse the 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.279
 sculptures elsewhere so here we are 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.279
 will stop the video so when you 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:04.449
 do you think you're ok then here's the 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.339
 taker but tells you he has everything 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.050
 cleared there is nothing here bah 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:12.629
 can reuse your sculpture 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.629
 elsewhere so that's goodbye
