Institute of Technology for many years
people<00:00:14.690> had<00:00:15.170> thought<00:00:15.650> of<00:00:15.820> microbes<00:00:16.820> as<00:00:17.000> these

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
people had thought of microbes as these

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.090 
people had thought of microbes as these
insidious<00:00:17.539> little<00:00:17.750> creatures<00:00:18.590> that<00:00:18.769> only

insidious little creatures that only

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.590 
insidious little creatures that only
cause<00:00:19.310> disease<00:00:19.760> but<00:00:20.000> i<00:00:20.060> think<00:00:20.300> that<00:00:20.330> there's

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
cause disease but i think that there's

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.019 
cause disease but i think that there's
been<00:00:20.810> an<00:00:21.289> appreciation<00:00:21.829> in<00:00:22.160> recent<00:00:22.550> years<00:00:22.579> of

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
been an appreciation in recent years of

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.929 
been an appreciation in recent years of
their<00:00:23.570> beneficial<00:00:24.050> effects<00:00:24.679> and<00:00:24.890> at<00:00:25.669> the<00:00:25.759> same

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
their beneficial effects and at the same

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.880 
their beneficial effects and at the same
time<00:00:25.999> we've<00:00:26.359> come<00:00:26.570> to<00:00:26.689> realize<00:00:27.079> that<00:00:27.109> through

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
time we've come to realize that through

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.920 
time we've come to realize that through
modern<00:00:28.599> hygienic<00:00:29.599> and<00:00:29.749> sanitary<00:00:30.380> antibiotic

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
modern hygienic and sanitary antibiotic

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.690 
modern hygienic and sanitary antibiotic
practices<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.110> use<00:00:33.290> that<00:00:33.560> we've<00:00:34.130> probably

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
practices and use that we've probably

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.970 
practices and use that we've probably
changed<00:00:35.480> our<00:00:35.630> association<00:00:36.410> with<00:00:36.590> indigenous

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
changed our association with indigenous

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.620 
changed our association with indigenous
microbes<00:00:37.670> microbes<00:00:38.060> that<00:00:38.150> live<00:00:38.390> in<00:00:38.540> our

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
microbes microbes that live in our

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.460 
microbes microbes that live in our
intestine<00:00:39.200> and<00:00:39.430> i<00:00:40.430> think<00:00:40.670> that<00:00:40.790> the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
intestine and i think that the

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.930 
intestine and i think that the
consequence<00:00:42.470> of<00:00:42.590> this<00:00:42.740> has<00:00:43.040> been<00:00:43.220> an<00:00:43.400> increase

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
consequence of this has been an increase

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.860 
consequence of this has been an increase
in<00:00:44.890> several<00:00:45.890> allergic<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:46.640> immune<00:00:47.000> disorders

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
in several allergic and immune disorders

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.430 
in several allergic and immune disorders
such<00:00:48.140> as<00:00:48.170> asthma<00:00:48.800> type<00:00:49.700> 1<00:00:49.910> diabetes

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
such as asthma type 1 diabetes

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.240 
such as asthma type 1 diabetes
inflammatory<00:00:51.440> bowel<00:00:51.710> disease<00:00:52.040> multiple

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
inflammatory bowel disease multiple

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.580 
inflammatory bowel disease multiple
sclerosis<00:00:52.520> and<00:00:53.330> so<00:00:53.870> i<00:00:53.900> think<00:00:53.960> it's<00:00:54.140> important

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
sclerosis and so i think it's important

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.110 
sclerosis and so i think it's important
to<00:00:54.650> study<00:00:54.860> beneficial<00:00:55.460> organisms<00:00:55.610> because

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
to study beneficial organisms because

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.480 
to study beneficial organisms because
they're<00:00:56.450> conferring<00:00:57.020> health<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.560> we'd<00:00:58.370> like

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
they're conferring health and we'd like

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.400 
they're conferring health and we'd like
to<00:00:58.640> think<00:00:58.850> perhaps<00:00:59.390> in<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.630> absence<00:01:00.110> of<00:01:00.260> these

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
to think perhaps in the absence of these

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.179 
to think perhaps in the absence of these
organisms<00:01:00.860> disease<00:01:01.610> may<00:01:01.910> ensue<00:01:02.920> we're<00:01:03.920> still

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
organisms disease may ensue we're still

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.740 
organisms disease may ensue we're still
at<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.339> early<00:01:04.369> stages<00:01:04.909> of<00:01:05.059> understanding

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
at the early stages of understanding

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.030 
at the early stages of understanding
this<00:01:05.840> association<00:01:06.380> I<00:01:06.590> think<00:01:06.799> there<00:01:06.920> are

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
this association I think there are

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.850 
this association I think there are
critical<00:01:07.460> ties<00:01:07.640> between<00:01:07.970> microbes<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:08.869> both

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860

disease was uncertain several years ago

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.660 
disease was uncertain several years ago
we<00:01:26.390> published<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:27.470> report<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:28.010> showed<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:28.340> a

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
we published a report that showed that a

we published a report that showed that a

disease and animal models and that work
has<00:01:37.460> shown<00:01:37.700> that<00:01:37.970> these<00:01:38.180> bacteria<00:01:38.720> actively

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
has shown that these bacteria actively

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.560 
has shown that these bacteria actively
suppress<00:01:39.830> an<00:01:40.040> inflammatory<00:01:40.549> response<00:01:40.940> and

suppress an inflammatory response and

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.060 
suppress an inflammatory response and
this<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.170> critical<00:01:42.560> in<00:01:42.650> crohn's<00:01:42.950> disease
