00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.780
 head erect focus the more difficult they are 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.790
 practice the day of the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.560
 people with faith with courage the people 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:05.120
 knows that you will be able to conquer this 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:08.380
 god cattle challenge plus a workout 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.380
 done let's go 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.050
 the ultra marathon requires a style of 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.750
 A slightly different life has to wake up. 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.630
 early is several hours of training every 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.880
 days and the weekend due to the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.010
 training also think the province hard 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.979
 on the day to wake up training 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.050
 early training and conciliatory work is the 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.580
 For me it's the hardest of all this is 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.470
 the guy has to have willpower 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.850
 to train every day 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.850
 danny boyle 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.600
 my routine was very familiar with 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.060
 My children always had breakfast 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.399
 with them lunch with the trainings really 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.280
 we can not have this 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.140
 routine 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.840
 he is a present father 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.840
 take care of their food, huh? 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.190
 to the sound of jesus silva rs 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.980
 But you, who is a passenger, is the same. 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.380
 period only and that at the end of 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.970
 bills will stay is going to be all positive 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.800
 this even influences the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.530
 positive way so it's always in the 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:32.870
 good vibes sticker 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:35.540
 that's the man he's kinda crazy for 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.970
 train 10 hours of his morning cometh 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.700
 that steel chat talking about the cerrado and 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.820
 So I 'm going to train at 10 o'clock in the morning if 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.880
 with her I'm from the cerrado 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.420
 It seems to me that it still supplies 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.420
 more energy 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.560
 renato marcelo and history you are 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.700
 willing to leave in order to attend any 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.340
 time of day 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.290
 without this in're not loose're cold 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.300
 helping his workout is any 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.280
 time to go out to practice I woke up 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.320
 early to run for its owner 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.320
 Look, I'll run the same way. 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.549
 i 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.310
 I know the running man will tell you 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.769
 I do not see myself doing this and I have 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.260
 even get surprised with people 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.120
 who put it as a goal because it is 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.829
 too much distance to pedal is already 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.079
 It's kind of hard to get excited about 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.819
 day can give if you imagine something without it 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.579
 a test of 100 kilometers you 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.430
 really try to face 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.620
 because there you will have a fight is 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.489
 during the race between body and 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.290
 mind is 80% the head 20% let's say 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.129
 so the body that you have to be well 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.709
 prepared for sure but the head you 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.099
 What is the human head in the body? 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.099
 understood 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.210
 so you have to be disciplined 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.810
 You have to be sleeping well have to okay 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:27.540
 eating well have to be training right 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.670
 because otherwise you come in the day and break 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.740
 This is frustrating, right? 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.770
 I think every athlete fears when he 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.900
 part for a challenge is common as this 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.600
 is to run 100 kilometers that more 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.030
 It's scary, it's the fact that he did not finish 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.890
 that challenge is to break for example 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.260
 What do we call it then, really? 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.730
 It's a thing that scares me a little. 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.620
 so when I feel a little tired 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.570
 of the workout will do a longer workout 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.440
 40 and 50 kilometers 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.000
 Do you feel that tired thinking of you? 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.150
 will be 100 kilometers will I go 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.150
 get 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.580
 the goal
