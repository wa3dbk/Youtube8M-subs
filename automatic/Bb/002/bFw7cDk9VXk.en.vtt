00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 gta san andreas besides hiding 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.790
 various mysteries it also brings a 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.440
 very large assortment of easter eggs 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.840
 that for those who do not know if they will be 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.969
 those hidden messages that make 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.519
 reference to something a parody 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.590
 something of the kind and how the GPS map says it is 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.539
 big big you always end up finding 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.250
 some of these terex that some are well 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.359
 obvious to find and others are more 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.670
 hidden 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.289
 then it is already prepared from its liquid 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.170
 video because today we will see and review 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.920
 several easter eggs by gta san andreas 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.899
 [Music] 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.579
 and to start with that easter list 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.989
 eggs by gta san andreas good to start with 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.730
 more class because I already have 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.980
 some other videos but I can not 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.440
 leave out and the easter egg of the time is the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.059
 that you find on the bridge bridge and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 There at the top of this bridge you will 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.440
 find next message there is not 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 stress here goes away and is a donation of 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.699
 rockstar but it's still an easter 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.410
 egg another easter egg too much 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.449
 known and those dolls that you 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.210
 finds Tony and series and milk 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.100
 vegetables and siriri and also james 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.990
 environment that you find in a 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.990
 shop called 10 rc shop 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.300
 and in your wardrobe is it possible for you 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.220
 find a board with the image 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.200
 devices actually go just a few 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.320
 but it is a clear reference to the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.820
 gta will be and who knows the area 69 that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.200
 that desert that hides several 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.210
 mysteries and everything else 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.760
 because then it is a parody of the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.920
 area 51 it was also based on black 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.990
 same moment it's barn of rock life 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.360
 there is also a large hole nearby 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.610
 of area 69 where you find some 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.070
 bags that look like bodies in there 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.900
 more or less close to area 69 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.150
 and a little closer to that hole you 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.310
 find the bobcats that probably is 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.880
 a car that was used to attack these 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.260
 bodies inside the hole 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.260
 [Music] 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.830
 people are tired of knowing that 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.870
 rockstar really likes pinto because 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.150
 every game she does she always puts 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.040
 something like that in games and everything else 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.500
 and here in gta san andreas it repeats itself 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.930
 but in a different way in the form of 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.330
 stone only in colossal size and this 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.680
 You find more or less there in peace. 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.260
 God I think that's what 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.820
 calls near Boni Count is a stop 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.010
 well scrawny and tasteless but we 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.170
 have to respect and laugh at the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.450
 Rockstar tastes is why do what? 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.370
 [Music] 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.650
 if you go from the department of 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.660
 planning for there adventures is possible 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.940
 you find a mansion project 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.310
 that it is a mansion that has in the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.410
 half ante is another rockstar game 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.000
 another striking reference are some 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.650
 images you can find 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.140
 los angeles police department 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.300
 where they say they are looking for 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.800
 James who is the protagonist of the game and 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.540
 also if you go in the bathroom of your 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.000
 apartment you will find a large 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.290
 giant purple vibrator and then you 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.280
 I think I'm joking that the rockstar 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:04.560
 is obsessed with pinto now has a 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.299
 statue that you can find in and 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.790
 saints who is doing a thing well 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.799
 well scrotum so only by the image 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.810
 You can already understand what it is I go 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.519
 stop showing these obscene terex 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.829
 in this video here because why the fuck 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.690
 bug that arrives arrives at this in one more 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.340
 reference to the game well before the 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.530
 expenses that you can find in 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.500
 some gas cylinders with the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.170
 logo written gaza prison and this in the middle 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.880
 ante there is a city called jail 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.010
 then it is a clear reference to this 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.959
 another rockstar game and knows idr 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.190
 that plane out of the game the most 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.290
 quick then 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.420
 in it you can find next acronym 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.280
 on his side was enrolled dna 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.690
 and for those who do not know dna was the old 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.389
 rockstar name 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.489
 if you go to the barbearia ries face defendant 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:50.010
 studios you will find on the wall 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.470
 photos of the members of the band jackson 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.870
 five and I particularly think that this 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.120
 easter egg one of the coolest 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.120
 [Music] 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.550
 because in the window of the gas station of the 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.650
 mission has to command you can 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.780
 find a small plaque written in 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.640
 down so max bank is another 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.410
 rockstar franchise and also a 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.300
 message saying that this glass is 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.430
 but despite the message 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.079
 you can see a hole in the 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.060
 a shot in this window 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.400
 Now something very bizarre about you. 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:28.890
 take a rifle and aim for the moon to take it 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:31.020
 It will change its size and something else legal. 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.760
 also that you can only see the night is 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.890
 a constellation that forms long 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.570
 Good rockstar these are some of the 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.070
 I narrowed down that you 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.020
 know some more easter egg cool 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.090
 interesting to show you enjoy 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.810

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.120
 The system is that you sent me well. 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.800
 of the time and you send your message is that 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.840

 I liked it because it helps a lot in 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.760
 disclosure and also if possible 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.680
