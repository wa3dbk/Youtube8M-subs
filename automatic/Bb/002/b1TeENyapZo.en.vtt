for Carlos Condit in terms of what's
going<00:05:57.380> to<00:05:57.440> be<00:05:57.500> expected<00:05:57.590> of<00:05:58.099> him<00:05:58.190> when<00:05:58.370> he

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
going to be expected of him when he

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.909 
going to be expected of him when he
comes<00:05:58.580> back<00:05:58.810> no<00:05:59.810> question<00:06:00.410> an<00:06:00.530> elite

team<00:06:06.500> is<00:06:06.680> smart<00:06:07.039> the<00:06:07.250> people<00:06:07.490> that<00:06:07.580> he

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
team is smart the people that he

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.279 
team is smart the people that he
surrounds<00:06:08.150> himself<00:06:08.150> with<00:06:08.599> they're<00:06:09.110> all

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
surrounds himself with they're all

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.050 
surrounds himself with they're all
intelligent<00:06:09.949> Carlos<00:06:10.280> Condit<00:06:10.610> isn't<00:06:10.849> going<00:06:10.970> to

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
intelligent Carlos Condit isn't going to

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.670 
intelligent Carlos Condit isn't going to
Russia<00:06:11.240> anything<00:06:11.780> we're<00:06:12.349> talking<00:06:12.590> about

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
Russia anything we're talking about

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.010 
Russia anything we're talking about
former<00:06:13.250> UFC<00:06:13.550> champion<00:06:13.820> so<00:06:14.479> I<00:06:14.539> think<00:06:14.780> from<00:06:14.900> a

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
former UFC champion so I think from a

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.629 
former UFC champion so I think from a
financial<00:06:15.380> standpoint<00:06:15.770> I<00:06:16.099> know<00:06:16.250> we<00:06:16.490> all<00:06:16.520> want

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
financial standpoint I know we all want

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.820 
financial standpoint I know we all want
more<00:06:17.030> money<00:06:17.180> but<00:06:17.389> I<00:06:17.449> think<00:06:17.720> he'll<00:06:17.960> be<00:06:17.990> taken

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
more money but I think he'll be taken

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.040 
more money but I think he'll be taken
care<00:06:19.070> of<00:06:19.099> but<00:06:19.729> I<00:06:19.789> think<00:06:20.090> when<00:06:20.479> it<00:06:20.570> comes<00:06:20.750> to

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
care of but I think when it comes to

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.260 
care of but I think when it comes to
making<00:06:21.320> his<00:06:21.590> return<00:06:21.740> to<00:06:22.039> the<00:06:22.070> Octagon<00:06:22.490> we<00:06:23.090> have

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
making his return to the Octagon we have

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.000 
making his return to the Octagon we have
to<00:06:23.419> get<00:06:23.510> away<00:06:23.630> from<00:06:23.810> just<00:06:24.169> looking<00:06:24.289> at<00:06:24.560> titles

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
to get away from just looking at titles

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.710 
to get away from just looking at titles
because<00:06:25.190> that<00:06:25.460> really<00:06:25.639> is<00:06:25.910> irrelevant<00:06:26.389> when

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
because that really is irrelevant when

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.180 
because that really is irrelevant when
you<00:06:26.780> look<00:06:26.930> at<00:06:27.050> the<00:06:27.139> welterweight<00:06:27.470> picture<00:06:27.979> and

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
you look at the welterweight picture and

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.070 
you look at the welterweight picture and
think<00:06:28.610> about<00:06:28.849> all<00:06:29.060> the<00:06:29.300> matchups<00:06:29.810> that<00:06:29.930> you

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
think about all the matchups that you

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.600 
think about all the matchups that you
could<00:06:30.260> all<00:06:30.800> the<00:06:30.979> fights<00:06:31.219> you<00:06:31.340> could<00:06:31.490> put

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
could all the fights you could put

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.120 
could all the fights you could put
Carlos<00:06:32.000> Condit<00:06:32.450> and<00:06:32.510> I<00:06:33.409> think<00:06:33.680> that<00:06:33.890> is<00:06:33.919> the

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
Carlos Condit and I think that is the

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.340 
Carlos Condit and I think that is the
most<00:06:34.280> exciting<00:06:34.940> part<00:06:35.180> not<00:06:35.390> sure<00:06:35.599> that

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
most exciting part not sure that

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.350 
most exciting part not sure that
I think<00:06:36.650> what<00:06:36.800> fans<00:06:37.100> should<00:06:37.370> look<00:06:37.580> at<00:06:37.760> a<00:06:37.970> fight

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
I think what fans should look at a fight

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.390 
I think what fans should look at a fight
with<00:06:38.540> robbie<00:06:38.810> lawler<00:06:39.170> and<00:06:39.530> carlos<00:06:39.890> condit<00:06:40.280> a

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
with robbie lawler and carlos condit a

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.550 
with robbie lawler and carlos condit a
rematch<00:06:41.000> with<00:06:41.240> Rory<00:06:41.510> MacDonald<00:06:42.110> and<00:06:42.200> Carlos

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
rematch with Rory MacDonald and Carlos

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.500 
rematch with Rory MacDonald and Carlos
Condit<00:06:42.890> or<00:06:43.280> you<00:06:43.430> just<00:06:43.610> go<00:06:43.820> down<00:06:44.060> the<00:06:44.270> line<00:06:44.300> I

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
Condit or you just go down the line I

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.660 
Condit or you just go down the line I
think<00:06:44.930> it's<00:06:45.110> just<00:06:45.380> an<00:06:45.710> intriguing<00:06:46.100> time<00:06:46.460> for

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
think it's just an intriguing time for

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.040 
think it's just an intriguing time for
the<00:06:46.730> welterweight<00:06:47.000> division<00:06:47.120> and<00:06:47.870> when

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
the welterweight division and when

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.860 
the welterweight division and when
you're<00:06:48.170> as<00:06:48.650> elite<00:06:49.460> as<00:06:49.490> Carlos<00:06:50.180> Condit<00:06:50.570> the<00:06:50.840> I

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
you're as elite as Carlos Condit the I

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.990 
you're as elite as Carlos Condit the I
think<00:06:51.320> the<00:06:51.470> possibilities<00:06:52.340> are<00:06:52.370> endless<00:06:52.520> my<00:06:52.970> I

think the possibilities are endless my I

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.150 
think the possibilities are endless my I
