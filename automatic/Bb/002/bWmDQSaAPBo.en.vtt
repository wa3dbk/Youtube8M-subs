00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.259
 welcome to my channel today prepare salsa 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.630
 green they're going to see that it's going to be fine 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.000
 easy to do and I'll show you right away 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.830
 my way of making it, these are the 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.730
 ingredients that we are going to occupy 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.630
 I have here 8 tomatillos 3 chiles 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.930
 jalapeños a chile california and a chile 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.309
 güerito a piece of onion salt and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.160
 pepper to taste and a twig without 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.019
 finely chopped cilantro nothing alone 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.970
 the only thing we're going to do is we're going to 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.290
 put to boil our tomatillos and 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.059
 our chilies until they are 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:54.629
 soft and change color and we're going 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.570
 to liquefy later with also with the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.489
 piece of onion and after the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.070
 liquefied only we are going to add 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.839
 our pepper salt and stir a 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.210
 little coriander cilantro we're not going 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.240
 to grind 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.810
 then the sauce preparation 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.810
 green 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.210
 Y 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.290
 Y 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.110
 because as they saw we already liquefied our 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.869
 sauce 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.740
 very easy to do and now only 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.509
 let's add our cilantro and if 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.850
 like here you can also add the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.530
 finely chopped onion only that in 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.540
 this time I will not do it but 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.700
 I'm only adding cilantro 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.909
 this is the result of how we were left 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.979

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.549
 I wanted to make some tacos of roasted meat 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:10.800
 to accompany our green sauce well 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:13.590
