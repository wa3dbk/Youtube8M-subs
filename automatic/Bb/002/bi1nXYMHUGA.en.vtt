00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.510 
and you know so I don't know what to
make<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.380> guess<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.890> had<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.220> pick<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
make of this I guess if I had to pick a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.929 
make of this I guess if I had to pick a
side<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.270> would<00:01:46.259> take<00:01:46.759> cleveland<00:01:47.759> as<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
side here I would take cleveland as the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.359 
side here I would take cleveland as the
home<00:01:48.210> dog<00:01:48.479> what<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.380> think

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
home dog what do you like here I think

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.190
