00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.230
 the upa is a compact power plant and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.789
 transportable to make water drinkable was 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.560
 developed by technicians of the 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.320
 administration of sanitary works 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.349
 of the jose state and the national army 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.030
 Uruguayan water purification unit 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.640
 water is a utility model 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.890
 standardized in the design the production 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.170
 the installation and operation that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.109
 allows to obtain maximum results in 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.600
 extreme conditions is built in 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:39.059
 stainless steel guaranteeing a life 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.120
 Long operative useful and a minimum 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.769
 maintenance cost the upa covers 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.379
 all the traditional stages of 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.749
 purification process working with 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.649
 a wide variety of water qualities 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:54.539
 gross among its applications stand out 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.120
 reduction or elimination in the medium and 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.039
 short - term deficit problems 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.649
 production in supply systems of 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.959
 water execution of projects 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.420
 production of safe drinking water in 

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:09.330
 very short periods of time in countries 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.880
 regions or groups of towns 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.110
 replacement of treatment plants 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.940
 traditional during eventual 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.030
 maintenance work avoiding 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.950
 investments in civil works increase 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.280
 of the total production capacity in 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.020
 existing water treatment plants 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.400
 Among its advantages are the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.130
 support of a state company 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.380
 Uruguayan with more than 60 years of 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.860
 experience in water potabilization 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.390
 the technical support and know-how of oce the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.160
 Quick installation and start-up 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.320
 operating the dimensions 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.060
 outside of the upa and its weight are 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.520
 adapted in the means of transport 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.370
 international maritime and air land 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.010
 and facilitate the geographical relocation of 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.530
 the same the possibility of installation 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.510
 in parallel allows to satisfy a 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.400
 increase in demand have been 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.410
 marketed more than a hundred 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.660
 units many of which are 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.000
 being used in peace missions of 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.650
 the United Nations - they have also been 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.630
 donated to countries in situation of 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.010
 emergency because of catastrophes 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.869
 natural 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.870
 there are currently water treatment units 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.569
 of water working in several countries of 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.989
 South America and Central America 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.849
 and africa uruguay ranks first 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.590
 in latin america in coverage of 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.599
 drinking water supply of the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.060
 nucleated population reaching 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.269
 practically 100 percent of the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.709
 very much of that achievement is due to 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.099
 the installation of the plants 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.109
 upa that they allowed in a short term 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.540
 extend the potable water service to 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.689
 small and medium-sized populations 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.689
