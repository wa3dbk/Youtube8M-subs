which is you know i just downloaded this
app<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.830> i<00:03:58.920> know<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.520> from<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.790> website<00:04:00.270> but<00:04:00.570> i

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
app and i know it from the website but i

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.390 
app and i know it from the website but i
haven't<00:04:01.170> really<00:04:01.380> used<00:04:01.560> this<00:04:01.709> app<00:04:01.920> too<00:04:02.160> much

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
haven't really used this app too much

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.790 
haven't really used this app too much
it's<00:04:03.330> kind<00:04:03.570> of<00:04:03.630> like<00:04:03.780> in<00:04:03.900> beta<00:04:04.170> mode<00:04:04.320> i<00:04:04.590> guess

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
it's kind of like in beta mode i guess

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.860 
it's kind of like in beta mode i guess
because<00:04:05.010> i<00:04:05.250> cannot<00:04:05.550> even<00:04:05.700> set<00:04:06.060> this<00:04:06.300> which<00:04:06.750> is

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
because i cannot even set this which is

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.449 
because i cannot even set this which is
kind<00:04:07.050> of<00:04:07.080> weird<00:04:07.500> i<00:04:07.800> mean<00:04:09.860> yeah<00:04:10.860> i<00:04:10.890> cannot<00:04:11.220> even

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
kind of weird i mean yeah i cannot even

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.670 
kind of weird i mean yeah i cannot even
save<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.760> well<00:04:12.030> okay<00:04:12.330> so<00:04:12.390> for<00:04:12.959> this<00:04:13.110> this

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
save it well okay so for this this

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.590 
save it well okay so for this this
doesn't<00:04:13.980> really<00:04:14.100> work<00:04:14.250> yet<00:04:14.880> i<00:04:15.060> guess<00:04:15.120> i<00:04:15.540> think

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
doesn't really work yet i guess i think

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.199 
doesn't really work yet i guess i think
this<00:04:15.840> app<00:04:16.109> is<00:04:16.320> just<00:04:16.650> new<00:04:16.980> and<00:04:17.760> i<00:04:17.850> thought<00:04:18.030> i'd

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
this app is just new and i thought i'd

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.510 
this app is just new and i thought i'd
download<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:18.870> but<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.620> website<00:04:19.770> it<00:04:20.190> also

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
download it but the website it also

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.099 
download it but the website it also
would<00:04:20.940> work<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.419> know<00:04:21.539> if<00:04:21.690> you're<00:04:21.840> not<00:04:21.870> going

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
would work you know if you're not going

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.960 
would work you know if you're not going
to<00:04:22.229> be<00:04:22.289> spending<00:04:22.500> $0.99<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.490> can<00:04:23.640> just<00:04:23.820> go

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
to be spending $0.99 you can just go

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.250 
to be spending $0.99 you can just go
ahead<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.360> go<00:04:24.690> over<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.310> clash<00:04:26.310> of<00:04:26.460> clans<00:04:26.789> for

ahead and go over to clash of clans for
canister<00:04:27.620> dot-com<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:29.330> can<00:04:29.420> also<00:04:29.540> check

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
out this entire thing it's almost the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.720 
out this entire thing it's almost the
same<00:04:31.970> like<00:04:32.270> it's<00:04:32.510> it's<00:04:33.020> exactly<00:04:33.730> it's

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
same like it's it's exactly it's

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.640 
same like it's it's exactly it's
actually<00:04:35.120> just<00:04:35.330> you<00:04:35.690> know<00:04:35.780> exactly<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.290> same

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
actually just you know exactly the same

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.070 
actually just you know exactly the same
but<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.970> know<00:04:38.060> it's<00:04:38.180> nice<00:04:38.390> just<00:04:38.420> to<00:04:38.720> have<00:04:38.930> it

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
but you know it's nice just to have it

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.650 
but you know it's nice just to have it
just<00:04:39.200> in<00:04:39.320> an<00:04:39.470> app<00:04:39.650> form<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.310> think<00:04:41.060> personally

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
just in an app form I think personally

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.330 
just in an app form I think personally
but<00:04:41.930> say<00:04:42.230> it's<00:04:42.380> not<00:04:42.470> really<00:04:42.590> working<00:04:43.070> right

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
but say it's not really working right

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
now hmm I don't know kind of weird

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
now hmm I don't know kind of weird
maybe<00:04:47.420> we<00:04:47.630> start<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.020> app<00:04:48.170> I<00:04:48.500> don't<00:04:49.460> know

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
maybe we start the app I don't know

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.420 
maybe we start the app I don't know
let's<00:04:51.440> see<00:04:51.710> we<00:04:52.010> start<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.430> app<00:04:52.610> or<00:04:53.570> like<00:04:54.310> do<00:04:55.310> it

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.540 
let's see we start the app or like do it
off<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.910> then<00:04:56.090> have<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:56.480> on<00:04:56.570> again<00:04:57.310> let's<00:04:58.310> see

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
off and then have it on again let's see

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.370 
off and then have it on again let's see
I'm<00:04:58.670> gonna<00:04:58.940> do<00:04:59.180> it<00:04:59.270> right<00:04:59.300> now<00:04:59.630> no<00:04:59.930> okay<00:04:59.960> that

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380

I'm gonna do it right now no okay that
seems<00:05:00.590> to<00:05:00.740> be<00:05:00.770> bucked<00:05:01.190> for<00:05:01.460> some<00:05:01.610> reason<00:05:01.940> maybe

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
seems to be bucked for some reason maybe

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.480 
seems to be bucked for some reason maybe
we<00:05:02.210> do<00:05:02.330> it<00:05:02.420> like<00:05:02.540> this<00:05:02.600> maybe<00:05:03.230> I<00:05:03.380> can<00:05:03.620> then<00:05:03.860> okay

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
we do it like this maybe I can then okay

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.550 
we do it like this maybe I can then okay
so<00:05:04.850> I<00:05:04.880> don't<00:05:05.240> know<00:05:05.330> like<00:05:05.630> hopefully<00:05:06.230> the<00:05:06.440> guy

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
so I don't know like hopefully the guy

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.740 
so I don't know like hopefully the guy
that<00:05:06.830> made<00:05:06.980> this<00:05:07.100> video<00:05:07.430> or<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:08.300> made<00:05:08.510> this

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
that made this video or that made this

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.840 
that made this video or that made this
app<00:05:09.050> will<00:05:09.800> watch<00:05:10.010> this<00:05:10.160> video<00:05:10.340> and<00:05:10.610> you<00:05:10.730> will

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
app will watch this video and you will

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.660 
app will watch this video and you will
see<00:05:11.810> that<00:05:12.050> this<00:05:12.290> is<00:05:12.410> not<00:05:12.590> working<00:05:12.890> clearly

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
see that this is not working clearly

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.000 
see that this is not working clearly
maybe<00:05:14.510> it's<00:05:14.690> just<00:05:14.810> for<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.050> Apple<00:05:15.290> 6<00:05:15.470> plus

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
maybe it's just for the Apple 6 plus

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.690 
maybe it's just for the Apple 6 plus
maybe<00:05:16.550> just<00:05:16.850> for<00:05:16.970> iOS<00:05:17.510> 8<00:05:17.750> points<00:05:18.350> 3<00:05:19.190> that<00:05:19.520> this

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
maybe just for iOS 8 points 3 that this

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.090 
maybe just for iOS 8 points 3 that this
happens<00:05:20.180> or<00:05:20.480> I<00:05:20.510> don't<00:05:20.780> know<00:05:20.990> but<00:05:21.950> I<00:05:21.980> just

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
happens or I don't know but I just

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.400 
happens or I don't know but I just
cannot<00:05:22.460> seem<00:05:22.730> to<00:05:22.760> use<00:05:23.240> this<00:05:23.480> I<00:05:23.690> cannot<00:05:23.960> SAP<00:05:24.230> it

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410

p.m.<00:05:55.400> and<00:05:55.630> 8:00<00:05:56.630> p.m.<00:05:56.990> you<00:05:57.470> don't<00:05:57.650> want<00:05:57.770> to<00:05:57.830> be

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
p.m. and 8:00 p.m. you don't want to be

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.770 
p.m. and 8:00 p.m. you don't want to be
checking<00:05:58.100> the<00:05:58.760> times<00:05:59.150> that<00:05:59.300> you're<00:05:59.480> seeing

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
checking the times that you're seeing

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.960 
checking the times that you're seeing
right<00:06:00.080> here<00:06:00.140> are<00:06:00.650> forced<00:06:01.190> for<00:06:01.550> my<00:06:01.700> time<00:06:01.940> zone

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
right here are forced for my time zone

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.270 
right here are forced for my time zone
which<00:06:02.420> is<00:06:02.570> the<00:06:02.660> Netherlands<00:06:03.170> and<00:06:03.350> I<00:06:03.380> think

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
which is the Netherlands and I think

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.880 
which is the Netherlands and I think
that's<00:06:04.460> GMT<00:06:05.180> plus<00:06:05.600> 1<00:06:06.020> and<00:06:06.350> of<00:06:06.440> course<00:06:06.650> if<00:06:06.830> you

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
that's GMT plus 1 and of course if you

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.460 
that's GMT plus 1 and of course if you
live<00:06:07.070> in<00:06:07.220> est<00:06:07.840> then<00:06:08.840> you<00:06:08.990> have<00:06:09.110> to<00:06:09.260> of<00:06:09.320> course

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
live in est then you have to of course

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.520 
live in est then you have to of course
do<00:06:09.800> minus<00:06:10.310> 5<00:06:10.550> hours<00:06:10.970> and<00:06:11.180> if<00:06:11.300> you<00:06:11.390> live<00:06:11.570> in<00:06:11.840> PST

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
do minus 5 hours and if you live in PST

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.510 
do minus 5 hours and if you live in PST
is<00:06:12.590> minus<00:06:13.010> 9<00:06:13.670> or<00:06:13.970> 7<00:06:14.180> hours<00:06:14.540> I<00:06:14.630> guess

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
is minus 9 or 7 hours I guess

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.070 
is minus 9 or 7 hours I guess
I<00:06:16.520> don't<00:06:16.820> really<00:06:17.060> know<00:06:17.240> for<00:06:17.270> sure<00:06:17.420> but<00:06:17.810> I<00:06:17.870> think

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
I don't really know for sure but I think

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.250 
I don't really know for sure but I think
it's<00:06:18.170> like<00:06:18.200> 9<00:06:18.620> 7<00:06:19.460> hours<00:06:19.700> something<00:06:19.880> like<00:06:20.030> that

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
it's like 9 7 hours something like that

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.450 
it's like 9 7 hours something like that
so<00:06:21.260> of<00:06:21.320> course<00:06:21.470> you<00:06:21.710> have<00:06:21.740> to<00:06:21.980> do<00:06:22.100> all<00:06:22.280> these

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
so of course you have to do all these

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.710 
so of course you have to do all these
time<00:06:22.790> -<00:06:23.390> you<00:06:23.780> know<00:06:23.810> your<00:06:24.140> time<00:06:24.410> zone<00:06:24.680> and<00:06:25.720> yeah
