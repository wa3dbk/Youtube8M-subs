half a meter above the floor and it can
be<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.530> one<00:01:46.710> meter<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.159> well<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.610> will<00:01:47.759> be

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
be up to one meter as well it will be

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.569 
be up to one meter as well it will be
fine<00:01:48.210> however<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.590> need<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> find<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.430> best

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
fine however you need to find the best

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.340 
fine however you need to find the best
location<00:01:50.759> depending<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> distance<00:01:52.229> to

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
location depending on the distance to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.840 
location depending on the distance to
the<00:01:52.439> ceiling<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.159> too<00:01:53.310> close<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the ceiling if it's too close to the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.450 
the ceiling if it's too close to the
ceiling<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:55.200> light<00:01:55.380> will<00:01:55.590> not<00:01:55.799> bounce<00:01:56.070> back

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
ceiling the light will not bounce back

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.240 
ceiling the light will not bounce back
from<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.540> very<00:01:57.719> wide<00:01:57.960> area<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> very<00:01:58.860> kind

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
from the very wide area on the very kind

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.980 
from the very wide area on the very kind
of<00:01:59.369> narrow<00:01:59.640> area<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.390> might<00:02:00.509> not<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.869> very

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
of narrow area so it might not be very

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.450 
of narrow area so it might not be very
good<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:01.770> too<00:02:01.979> low

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
good if it's too low

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.539 
good if it's too low
it<00:02:03.000> might<00:02:03.299> blind<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.070> no<00:02:05.340> good

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
it might blind you and this is no good

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.859 
it might blind you and this is no good
at<00:02:05.700> all<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.210> let's<00:02:06.930> see<00:02:07.140> what<00:02:07.290> happens

you<00:02:34.599> might<00:02:34.810> want<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.230> do<00:02:35.440> once<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.769> have<00:02:36.010> a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
you might want to do once you have a

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.220 
you might want to do once you have a
halogen<00:02:36.580> lamp<00:02:36.760> or<00:02:37.180> any<00:02:37.390> other<00:02:37.629> source<00:02:38.140> of

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
halogen lamp or any other source of

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.020 
halogen lamp or any other source of
light<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.980> might<00:02:39.129> experiment<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:39.880> for

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
light you might experiment and for

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.000 
light you might experiment and for
example<00:02:40.390> cover<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:41.200> window<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:41.680> let's<00:02:41.890> see

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
example cover the window so let's see

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.630 
example cover the window so let's see
what<00:02:42.130> happens<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.569> cover<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.019> windows

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
what happens and I cover the windows

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.330 
what happens and I cover the windows
okay<00:02:45.640> now<00:02:45.790> there<00:02:46.000> is<00:02:46.150> much<00:02:47.110> less<00:02:47.500> natural

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
okay now there is much less natural

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.949 
okay now there is much less natural
light<00:02:48.519> coming<00:02:48.819> into<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.239> room<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.660> as<00:02:49.840> you

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
light coming into the room and as you

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.180 
light coming into the room and as you
can<00:02:50.079> see<00:02:50.140> there<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.590> little<00:02:50.860> bit<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.099> a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
can see there is a little bit of a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.800 
can see there is a little bit of a
difference<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.090> need<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.360> experiment

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
difference so you need to experiment

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.550 
difference so you need to experiment
quite<00:02:53.349> a<00:02:53.379> lot<00:02:53.709> okay

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
quite a lot okay

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.930 
quite a lot okay
the<00:02:56.560> other<00:02:56.680> problem<00:02:57.099> is<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.670> Sun

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
the other problem is that the Sun

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.880 
the other problem is that the Sun
changes<00:02:58.360> its<00:02:58.780> intensity<00:02:59.349> so<00:02:59.590> there<00:02:59.739> will<00:02:59.829> be

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
changes its intensity so there will be

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.520 
changes its intensity so there will be
clouds<00:03:00.250> coming<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.329> going<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.019> that's<00:03:02.440> a

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
clouds coming and going so that that's a

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.979 
clouds coming and going so that that's a
factor<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:02.980> consider<00:03:03.160> as<00:03:03.549> well<00:03:03.930> now<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
factor to consider as well now the

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.080 
factor to consider as well now the
background<00:03:05.349> for<00:03:06.099> me<00:03:06.220> actually<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.640> have<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.819> blue

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
background for me actually I have a blue

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.229 
background for me actually I have a blue
wall<00:03:07.299> which<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.019> my<00:03:08.620> favorite<00:03:09.160> color<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.970> works

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
wall which is my favorite color it works

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.330 
wall which is my favorite color it works
for<00:03:10.420> me<00:03:10.569> very<00:03:10.690> well<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.620> what<00:03:11.859> you<00:03:11.889> can<00:03:12.160> also

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
for me very well and what you can also

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.940 
for me very well and what you can also
add<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:13.139> bolsters<00:03:14.139> make<00:03:14.440> sure<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:14.769> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
add is bolsters make sure that the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.410 
add is bolsters make sure that the
poster<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.579> add<00:03:15.760> kind<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.180> are

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
give to people you can also use some

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.490 
give to people you can also use some
other<00:03:22.060> small<00:03:22.420> objects<00:03:22.780> maybe<00:03:22.959> something<00:03:23.349> like

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
other small objects maybe something like

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.910 
other small objects maybe something like
this<00:03:23.680> no<00:03:24.639> it<00:03:24.760> doesn't<00:03:25.030> really<00:03:25.150> work<00:03:25.359> now<00:03:25.959> it's

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
this no it doesn't really work now it's

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.970 
this no it doesn't really work now it's
up<00:03:27.099> to<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.810> then<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:29.109> message<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.859> message

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
up to you then the message the message

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.680 
up to you then the message the message
is<00:03:30.310> very<00:03:30.489> important<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.120> message<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.569> you

is very important the message that you

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.839 
is very important the message that you
give<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:31.900> other<00:03:32.170> people<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:32.709> for<00:03:33.130> example<00:03:33.190> if
