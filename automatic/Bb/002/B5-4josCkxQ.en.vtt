00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
know a few few months before the season

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.230 
know a few few months before the season
just<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> few<00:01:24.960> drop<00:01:25.140> feeds<00:01:25.440> and<00:01:26.000> just<00:01:27.000> getting

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
just a few drop feeds and just getting

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.699 
just a few drop feeds and just getting
the<00:01:27.300> movements<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.140> know<00:01:28.229> getting<00:01:28.470> into<00:01:28.560> that

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:28.709 
the movements you know getting into that

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.740 
the movements you know getting into that
rhythm<00:01:29.069> of<00:01:29.190> going<00:01:29.459> forward<00:01:29.789> getting<00:01:30.450> into<00:01:30.660> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
rhythm of going forward getting into the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.330 
rhythm of going forward getting into the
ball<00:01:30.929> and<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.160> good<00:01:32.280> way<00:01:32.459> to<00:01:32.490> start<00:01:37.340> shot

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
ball and it's a good way to start shot

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.760 
ball and it's a good way to start shot
Joe<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:39.990> there<00:01:40.259> he's<00:01:40.380> got<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> nice

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
Joe as you can see there he's got a nice

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.609 
Joe as you can see there he's got a nice
stride<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.459> not<00:01:41.610> too<00:01:41.819> big<00:01:42.149> these<00:01:43.110> bats<00:01:43.410> goes

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
stride in not too big these bats goes

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.440 
stride in not too big these bats goes
right<00:01:43.860> through<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.220> line<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.030> ball<00:01:45.209> into

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
right through the line of the ball into

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.440 
right through the line of the ball into
the<00:01:45.679> target<00:01:46.679> --top'<00:01:47.459> hands<00:01:47.729> leading<00:01:48.179> but<00:01:48.330> with

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
the target --top' hands leading but with

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.999 
the target --top' hands leading but with
a<00:01:48.479> nice<00:01:48.660> direction<00:01:48.959> with<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> bomber<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
a nice direction with the bomber but the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.440 
a nice direction with the bomber but the
most<00:01:50.160> important<00:01:50.640> thing<00:01:50.789> is<00:01:50.940> this<00:01:51.060> head<00:01:51.300> is

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
most important thing is this head is

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.930 
most important thing is this head is
over<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> front<00:01:52.020> part<00:01:52.459> that<00:01:53.459> allows<00:01:53.700> him<00:01:53.910> to

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
over the front part that allows him to

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.609 
over the front part that allows him to
control<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.450> ball<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.840> his<00:01:54.959> head<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.410> back

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
control the ball of his head was back

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.070 
control the ball of his head was back
here<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:57.060> wouldn't<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:57.330> able<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.569> control<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
here you wouldn't be able to control the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.389 
here you wouldn't be able to control the
ball<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.440> you'd<00:01:58.590> probably<00:01:58.800> find<00:01:59.190> that<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
ball and you'd probably find that the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.160 
ball and you'd probably find that the
ball<00:01:59.550> would<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.849> edged<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.599> the<00:02:00.720> square<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
ball would get edged to the square the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.699 
ball would get edged to the square the

and long before the season you'd do the

you<00:02:22.970> have<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.270> 22<00:02:23.840> yards<00:02:24.200> 10<00:02:24.440> yards<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:25.430> in

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
you have in 22 yards 10 yards just in

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.920 
you have in 22 yards 10 yards just in
front<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.850> stumps<00:02:26.180> or<00:02:26.510> they<00:02:26.660> can<00:02:26.810> come

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
front of the stumps or they can come

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.600 
front of the stumps or they can come
closer<00:02:27.230> just<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.650> sharpen<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.100> up<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.250> bit<00:02:28.460> just

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
closer just to sharpen you up a bit just

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.840 
closer just to sharpen you up a bit just
mixing<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.630> up<00:02:29.690> different<00:02:30.110> lines<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.790> you

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
mixing it up different lines and so you

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.220 
mixing it up different lines and so you
know<00:02:32.270> you're<00:02:32.450> checking<00:02:32.630> your<00:02:32.810> balance<00:02:32.960> as

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
know you're checking your balance as

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.800 
know you're checking your balance as
well<00:02:33.550> making<00:02:34.550> sure<00:02:34.700> your<00:02:35.180> weights<00:02:35.360> going<00:02:35.630> down

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810

the<00:02:35.900> ground<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.700> from<00:02:37.880> there<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.240> can<00:02:38.330> even

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
the ground and from there you can even

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.580 
the ground and from there you can even
progress<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.930> into<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.200> bowling<00:02:39.470> machine

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
progress it into the bowling machine

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.390 
progress it into the bowling machine
crank<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.700> up<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.880> bit<00:02:40.910> get<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.390> speed<00:02:41.630> going<00:02:42.400> so

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
crank it up a bit get the speed going so

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.070 
crank it up a bit get the speed going so
it<00:02:43.490> really<00:02:43.670> sharpens<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.180> up<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.930> get<00:02:45.050> you

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
it really sharpens you up and get you

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.760 
it really sharpens you up and get you
any<00:02:45.320> toes
