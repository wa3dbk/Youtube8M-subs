00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
air fuel mixture will get compressed one

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.310 
air fuel mixture will get compressed one
thing<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.850> should<00:01:18.030> note<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:19.049> air

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
thing you should note is that this air

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.760 
thing you should note is that this air
fuel<00:01:19.650> mixture<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> lean<00:01:20.670> fuel<00:01:21.659> mixture<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
fuel mixture is a lean fuel mixture the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.880 
fuel mixture is a lean fuel mixture the
air<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.820> fuel<00:01:24.060> ratio<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.840> much<00:01:25.259> high<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.710> this

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
air to fuel ratio is much high in this

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.399 
air to fuel ratio is much high in this
so<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.880> compression<00:01:27.240> happens<00:01:27.840> due<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
so as the compression happens due to the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.399 
so as the compression happens due to the
heat<00:01:28.770> involved<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.090> process

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
heat involved in this process

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.890 
heat involved in this process
it<00:01:31.740> burns<00:01:32.220> or<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.909> combustion<00:01:33.689> happens

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
it burns or the combustion happens

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.940 
it burns or the combustion happens
that's<00:01:34.439> how<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.640> power<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.060> being<00:01:36.270> generated

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
that's how the power is being generated

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.160 
that's how the power is being generated
so<00:01:37.950> due<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> combustion<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.479> pressure<00:01:39.930> is

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
so due to the combustion a pressure is

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.649 
so due to the combustion a pressure is
being<00:01:40.409> exerted<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.460> top<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:42.030> these

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
being exerted on the top of these

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.130 
being exerted on the top of these
Pistons<00:01:43.200> which<00:01:44.189> will<00:01:44.399> actually<00:01:44.610> push<00:01:45.329> this

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
Pistons which will actually push this

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.160 
Pistons which will actually push this
Pistons<00:01:46.740> down<00:01:47.210> from<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.329> top<00:01:48.540> dead<00:01:48.780> center

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
Pistons down from the top dead center

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.649 
Pistons down from the top dead center

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
towards the bottom dead center so that's

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.200 
towards the bottom dead center so that's
a<00:01:51.840> combustion<00:01:52.200> stroke<00:01:52.710> both<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.759> inlet<00:01:54.060> to

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.410 
well efficiency can be achieved in its
CCI<00:02:17.160> engines<00:02:17.910> because<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:20.240> like<00:02:21.240> a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
CCI engines because it is like a

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.170 
CCI engines because it is like a
flameless<00:02:22.190> ignition<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.310> actually<00:02:23.730> happening

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
flameless ignition is actually happening

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.860 
flameless ignition is actually happening
over<00:02:24.810> here<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:26.310> full<00:02:26.580> combustion<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.480> also

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
over here and a full combustion is also

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.550 
over here and a full combustion is also
been<00:02:28.050> ensured<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:29.160> we<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:29.940> more<00:02:30.870> fuel

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
been ensured so we have more fuel

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.130 
been ensured so we have more fuel
efficiency<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.340> due<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.570> flameless

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
efficiency and due to the flameless

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.760 
efficiency and due to the flameless
ignition<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:35.630> toxic<00:02:36.630> gases<00:02:37.140> being<00:02:37.500> produced

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
ignition the toxic gases being produced

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.920 
ignition the toxic gases being produced
will<00:02:38.130> be<00:02:38.250> less<00:02:38.460> so<00:02:38.760> emission<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.330> be<00:02:39.540> reduced

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
will be less so emission can be reduced

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.960 
will be less so emission can be reduced
and<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.680> combustion<00:02:41.070> process<00:02:41.370> actually

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
and the combustion process actually

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
and the combustion process actually
happens<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.630> 700<00:02:43.590> degree<00:02:44.300> Celsius<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.480> that

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
happens in 700 degree Celsius so that

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.030 
happens in 700 degree Celsius so that
reduces<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.280> formation<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.940> NOx<00:02:48.240> also<00:02:49.040> so

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
reduces the formation of NOx also so

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.070 
reduces the formation of NOx also so
that's<00:02:50.370> how<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:51.150> HCCA<00:02:52.020> engine<00:02:52.410> actually<00:02:52.590> works
