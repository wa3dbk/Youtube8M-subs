00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Talk to me, welcome to another one. 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.460
 registered this week and this 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.950
 video will show the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.349
 inscribed breno birth is the psd number 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.170
 181 of the channel and let's one more 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.299
 configuration for you in this image 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.730
 we can see part of what smoking and the effect 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.800
 which in fact due to the source is very 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.960
 impaired it does not have long cables 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.550
 as you can see and could not 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.529
 make a good housekeeping on account 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.170
 only source since the cabinet and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.650
 supports that when handling very clean milk 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.600
 the motherboard is an 85 m model is r 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.210
 Asus motherboard very good 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.370
 the excellent benefit and that supports two 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.309
 amd video cards doing crossfire 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 its processor is intel closed intel 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.719
 g34 30 dual-core processor for still 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.309
 fourth generation 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.469
 this makes his performance not 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.719
 It's so bad, it's actually a great 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.520
 cpu for pc gamer input on 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.920
 memory start we are only one 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.180
 4GB memory tank of the steed 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.949
 model sells itself 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.899
 then surely he will have to put 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.800
 four more days to run games 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.189
 good 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.930
 the hds sharing photo burner and 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.700
 so I'll put a general picture of the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.680
 his office so you can see this 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.479
 and have a good cable formation . 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.229
 this room storage in 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.210
 drawer 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.420
 in the case he put in the description that has 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.570
 a ssd of 122 on Thursday or a hd of 1 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.280
 terabyte that the tone sr the video card 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.520
 it's a video card that I do not 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.259
 I recommend you buy it, it's a gtx. 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.509
 610 and many people think that performance 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.970
 of the video card is measured by the size 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.250
 of memory in if this is true galera 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.020
 there is a video card with a comic book is 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.759
 much better than a video card of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.479
 two levels, for example, we have a 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.479
 of gtx in 110 with 2 gb and on the other 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.430
 Today we have 650 children who have 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.670
 only 1 GB of memory that being 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.530
 This is the unfortunate massacre of gt 610 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.420
 so be careful with these stores that 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.610
 do not put the video card model 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.200
 themselves and say only that the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.689
 video has 2gb of memory 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.590
 the source is also another problem to 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.600
 people saw there 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.350
 in case it has a stream model source 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.130
 450 watts a source you do not have and 80 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.990
 plus probably did not get active 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.160
 one of the necessary protections as pc 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.250
 incoming gamer 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.070
 I recommend at least one region is 430 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.290
 watts for a more basic configuration 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.720
 the cabinet the configuration is a ex vec 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.090
 It's a very good environment to have this 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.980
 visual appearance that is differentiated in the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.600
 market we have few cabinet with 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.730
 this drop can make a relocation 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.130
 very good combination with a source with 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.230
 Extensive cables in addition it has a good 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.910
 design must be acrylic on the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.130
 Very pretty side I see 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.440
 and also has a great air flow then 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.750
 cabinet recommended for you 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.550
 It was the breno configuration. 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.860
 see that it is incomplete in the back in a 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.870
 good video card and also a source 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.840
 for this configuration would recommend there 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.110
 an elegy 430 as had already spoken and 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.910
 a gtx 750 tpi there yes the configuration 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.580
 It's going to run all the games and it goes 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.870
 get very good thing we are the most 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.180
 a video I hope you have enjoyed 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.760
 liked it since its start up a 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.760
 hug to all and until the next and ruy
