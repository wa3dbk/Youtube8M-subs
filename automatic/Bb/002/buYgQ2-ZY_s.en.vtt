00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.529
 here comes mid autumn as you 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.499
 all is well see many are starting to think 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.500
 about the heating season but how are you well 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:11.790
 know our country oz apartments come 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.469
 earlier than heating 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.350
 so we start looking 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.570
 alternative heat my name is 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.630
 Alexander today I will talk about one of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.530
 them let's go today's review want 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.770
 present to your attention 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:30.330
 ves mx 5 mikthermic heater 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:33.600
 Now and then it looks quite cumbersome 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.320
 packaging can be seen taken care then with them 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.320
 nothing along the way happened in the knead 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:01:02.609
 let's start with unpacking 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:01:04.350
 let's see what's inside so nice that 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:11.150
 trademark in this thread she was 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.150
 developed in Spain are not products 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:30.610
 we see quite simple packaging 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.490
 his packages 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:00.619
 Here is such a heater 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:03.360
 very interesting hi-tech style very 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:09.049
 looks modern 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:12.450
 although from it quite simply see 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:14.660
 sheet metal all hole 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.340
 perforated gland so we see 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.660
 let's turn it on 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.780
 let's turn it on let's see how it is 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.780
 works 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:30.810
 good power wire 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:35.099
 it's not cheap some kind of tea 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:39.180
 let's see how it works so not 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:41.670
 why does not work and why 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.510
 he has a system against 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.569
 tipping 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.359
 there is such a special button for now 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:53.180
 she is not pressing on the heater is not 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.180
 turn on to give it and click and on 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.250
 We see on the power indicator light up 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.670
 it burns red unfortunately in 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.209
 This model does not have a timer no 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:13.280
 thermostat but basically here's if 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:16.079
 letting go then stops working principle 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.329
 in my opinion the thermostat is not here 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.630
 it is necessary because it is heated up to a maximum 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:25.260
 60 degrees that is burn your hands 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.500
 almost impossible and time 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:33.919
 heating the room you sleep at night hardly 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:37.680
 you will burn something else interesting 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:39.450
 power consumption is 1300 watts what 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.210
 pretty good but 30 percent 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.210
 to this 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.990
 nothing on the same convector oil 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.770
 heater 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:51.460
 or how everyone knows such a little 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:55.150
 blowing server this put rooms but 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.480
 here you canâ€™t cover it again 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:03.060
 draw your attention can not touch 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:07.240
 and this part does not cover it is written 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:11.830
 left here but if it covered it 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.010
 another one will automatically shut down 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.980
 The advantage of this heater is that 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.430
 silent that is if you are bad 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.890
 fall asleep or annoys you possible 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.680
 noise some sound and as i said 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.450
 earlier in will not be anything I want to pay 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.760
 your attention is what harry morgan needs 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.550
 environmentally safe that is only 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.610
 as he warms the air she does not harm our 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.370
 health do not survive oxygen is not 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.440
 it comes to life therefore our nasopharynx she 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.260
 does not dry out 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.020
 it also weighs quite a bit of that 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:52.380
 well especially older people here 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.580
 such a knowledge handle can be raised 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.120
 but how much is it all ? 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.120
 we'll see 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:16.480
 put on the scales know his weight see weight 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:21.490
 5 point one kilogram what 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.930
 pretty good now I want to draw 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.780
 your attention what he has 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.030
 disadvantages disadvantages is that 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.670
 when this is first turned on, warm it up 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.610
 or he can fill your apartment or 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.240
 entered your office unpleasant smell 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.870
 space 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.510
 the reason for the odor is 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.940
 choosing a lubricant that covers 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.520
 heating element of this unit 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.770
 but when the Ottoman look will disappear and 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.650
 smell from my personal experience 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.050
 the smell disappears after 12 hours still 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.990
 maybe not everyone will like the design 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:59.110
 because as you see i have said 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:02.740
 he used to have such a hole like a colander 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:06.460
 and so summarize the data 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.960
 heater it is quite as powerful in 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.160
 it has a temperature sensor 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.300
 security 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.680
 button against tipping he 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:19.150
 ecologically safe and does not emit 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:22.120
 no harmful substances burn oxygen 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.850
 delivery can be called the smell of burning 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.200
 plastic when first turned on as well 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.390
 small heating area 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:32.050
 this heater is rated maximum 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:34.450
 on 13 square well, and design someone like 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.850
 like who like who don't like 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:40.180
 maybe it can have drawbacks 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:45.240
 electric prosperity you have tried well 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.240
 I recommend it thanks for watching
