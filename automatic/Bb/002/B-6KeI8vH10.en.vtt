00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
still get at ww 14 and it should be a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.549 
still get at ww 14 and it should be a
smooth<00:00:59.879> transition<00:01:00.449> because<00:01:00.809> apparently

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
smooth transition because apparently

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.789 
smooth transition because apparently
uke's<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.100> already<00:01:02.579> working<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.270> ww<00:01:03.960> 14<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
uke's was already working on ww 14 and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.950 
uke's was already working on ww 14 and
if<00:01:05.700> they<00:01:05.939> went<00:01:06.240> because<00:01:06.479> when<00:01:06.659> i<00:01:06.689> went<00:01:06.900> ahead

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
if they went because when i went ahead

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.899 
if they went because when i went ahead
and<00:01:07.140> terminated<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> uc's<00:01:08.070> contracts<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
and terminated the uc's contracts and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.969 
and terminated the uc's contracts and
the<00:01:08.939> w/e<00:01:09.360> contracts<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.170> allowed<00:01:10.710> them<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the w/e contracts it allowed them to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.800 
the w/e contracts it allowed them to
restart<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:11.790> their<00:01:11.939> relationship<00:01:12.570> together

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
restart up their relationship together

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.899 
restart up their relationship together
so<00:01:13.619> most<00:01:13.830> likely<00:01:13.950> we're<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> still<00:01:14.790> get

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
so most likely we're going to still get

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.390 
so most likely we're going to still get
the<00:01:15.060> same<00:01:15.090> style<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.930> game<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.530> we're<00:01:17.280> going

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.499 
build it from the ground up for next
year<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:50.189> don't<00:01:50.310> know<00:01:50.490> any<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.299> I

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
year we don't know any of that and I

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.690 
year we don't know any of that and I
think<00:01:51.780> that's<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.170> huge<00:01:52.470> shock<00:01:52.770> right<00:01:53.130> now<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
think that's a huge shock right now and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.240 
think that's a huge shock right now and
you<00:01:54.479> know<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.780> realizing<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.799> were<00:01:56.009> so

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
you know just realizing that we were so

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.789 
you know just realizing that we were so
close<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.790> having<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.119> my<00:01:57.270> career<00:01:57.659> mode<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.049> w14

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
close to having to my career mode in w14

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.160 
close to having to my career mode in w14
i<00:01:59.060> think<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.270> there's<00:02:00.659> still<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.930> possibility

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
i think that there's still a possibility

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.719 
i think that there's still a possibility
that<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.799> could<00:02:01.979> get<00:02:02.130> some<00:02:02.310> awesome<00:02:02.640> stuff

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
that we could get some awesome stuff

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.760 
that we could get some awesome stuff
