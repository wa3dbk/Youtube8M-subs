would<00:00:30.510> get<00:00:30.630> one<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.140> then<00:00:31.230> after<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.740> waited

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340

a<00:00:32.399> couple<00:00:32.430> seconds<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.239> would<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.840> well

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.520 
a couple seconds you would get to well
now<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:36.090> better<00:00:36.630> version<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.469> that

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
now we have a better version of that

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.880 
now we have a better version of that
glitch<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.520> what<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:40.230> instead<00:00:40.739> of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
glitch and what that is is instead of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.729 
glitch and what that is is instead of
just<00:00:41.100> punching<00:00:41.579> at<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> air<00:00:42.090> when<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.020> drive

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.719 
and it won't be too long after that
you're<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.200> walk<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.619> here<00:01:43.920> pull<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.700> a

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
you're going to walk in here pull out a

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.550 
you're going to walk in here pull out a
weapon<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.329> you're<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.259> four

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
weapon and you're going to get four

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.830 
weapon and you're going to get four
stars<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.399> you're<00:01:47.579> getting<00:01:47.790> 400<00:01:48.390> RP

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
stars and so now you're getting 400 RP

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.319 
stars and so now you're getting 400 RP
every<00:01:49.259> single<00:01:49.619> time<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.860> do<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.399> instead<00:01:51.270> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
every single time you do this instead of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.359 
every single time you do this instead of
the<00:01:51.509> 200<00:01:52.079> RP<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.770> were<00:01:52.950> getting<00:01:53.189> before

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the 200 RP that we were getting before

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.819 
the 200 RP that we were getting before
you<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.630> mean<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.170> double<00:01:55.619> you're

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you know so I mean it's double you're

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.920 
you know so I mean it's double you're
getting<00:01:56.130> double<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.520> RP<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.450> you're<00:01:57.719> getting

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
getting double the RP so you're getting

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.139 
getting double the RP so you're getting
it<00:01:58.020> twice<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:58.500> fast<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.850> glitch<00:02:00.119> is

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
it twice as fast so this this glitch is

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.240 
it twice as fast so this this glitch is
actually<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.930> know<00:02:01.110> actually<00:02:01.469> somewhat

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
actually you know actually somewhat

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.910 
actually you know actually somewhat
useful<00:02:02.549> now<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.750> you're<00:02:03.960> getting<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.439> decent

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
useful now that you're getting a decent

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.310 
useful now that you're getting a decent
sum<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.670> RP<00:02:06.149> from<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.630> instead<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.290> know

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
sum of RP from it instead of you know

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.320 
sum of RP from it instead of you know
just<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> 200<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.030> were<00:02:09.209> getting

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
just the 200 that you were getting

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.999 
just the 200 that you were getting
before<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:10.050> wasn't<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.679> know<00:02:10.770> worth

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
before it really wasn't you know worth

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.660 
before it really wasn't you know worth
it<00:02:11.190> too<00:02:11.340> much<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.700> do<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.150> mean

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
it too much to do it and I mean

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.120 
it too much to do it and I mean
oh<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:13.420> know<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.380> kind<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.709> worth<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.040> to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
oh you know is it is kind of worth it to

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.710 
oh you know is it is kind of worth it to
do<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.370> now<00:02:15.520> I<00:02:15.550> mean<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.000> especially<00:02:16.540> if<00:02:16.599> you

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
do it now I mean is especially if you

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.270 
do it now I mean is especially if you
get<00:02:16.870> some<00:02:16.930> sort<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.470> rhythm<00:02:17.770> down<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.190> you

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
get some sort of a rhythm down and you

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.280 
get some sort of a rhythm down and you
can<00:02:18.400> get<00:02:18.580> doing<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.940> fast<00:02:19.150> enough<00:02:19.270> i<00:02:19.540> mean<00:02:19.720> my

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
can get doing it fast enough i mean my

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.350 
can get doing it fast enough i mean my
fastest<00:02:20.770> attempt<00:02:21.099> was<00:02:21.310> 20<00:02:21.670> seconds<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.209> know

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
fastest attempt was 20 seconds you know

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.570 
fastest attempt was 20 seconds you know
so<00:02:22.599> that's<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.680> guy<00:02:23.860> was<00:02:24.040> able<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.340> get<00:02:24.430> it

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
so that's a you guy was able to get it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.850 
so that's a you guy was able to get it
three<00:02:24.790> times<00:02:25.000> every<00:02:25.270> minute<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:26.440> see<00:02:26.680> however

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
three times every minute you see however

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.490 
three times every minute you see however
right<00:02:27.250> there<00:02:27.459> though<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.910> I'm<00:02:28.000> level<00:02:28.300> of<00:02:28.510> 87

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
right there though that I'm level of 87

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.770 
right there though that I'm level of 87
and<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:30.040> did<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.459> all<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.910> way<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.090> level<00:02:31.390> 88

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
and I did this all the way to level 88

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.320 
and I did this all the way to level 88
and<00:02:32.170> unfortunately<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.220> does<00:02:33.430> not<00:02:33.580> go<00:02:33.910> above

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
and unfortunately it does not go above

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.960 
and unfortunately it does not go above
four<00:02:34.690> stars<00:02:34.989> so<00:02:35.739> no<00:02:36.190> matter<00:02:36.340> how<00:02:36.580> many<00:02:36.730> times

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
four stars so no matter how many times

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.309 
four stars so no matter how many times
you<00:02:37.209> do<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.390> you're<00:02:37.660> still<00:02:37.870> just<00:02:37.989> going<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.200> get

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
you do it you're still just going to get

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.910 
you do it you're still just going to get
400<00:02:38.920> rp4<00:02:39.280> that'll<00:02:39.940> be<00:02:40.030> your<00:02:40.239> your<00:02:40.660> max<00:02:40.959> but<00:02:41.800> it
