death<00:03:06.130> grip<00:03:06.280> action<00:03:06.580> yeah<00:03:06.760> we<00:03:06.910> do<00:03:07.030> baby<00:03:07.319> okay

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
death grip action yeah we do baby okay

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.390

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
so if we take them a little bit more in

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.670 
so if we take them a little bit more in
the<00:03:09.459> middle<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:10.300> will<00:03:10.480> allow<00:03:10.660> us<00:03:10.900> melee<00:03:11.410> folks

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
the middle it will allow us melee folks
