if<00:00:01.979> you<00:00:02.129> have<00:00:02.250> an<00:00:02.340> old<00:00:02.490> 12-volt<00:00:03.060> cordless

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
if you have an old 12-volt cordless

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.499 
if you have an old 12-volt cordless
drill<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:04.140> battery<00:00:04.470> packs<00:00:04.740> are<00:00:04.950> done

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:05.509 
drill and the battery packs are done

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.030 
drill and the battery packs are done
quite<00:00:06.509> often<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.930> case<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.529> battery<00:00:07.830> packs

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
quite often the case the battery packs

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.970 
quite often the case the battery packs
are<00:00:08.309> almost<00:00:08.550> as<00:00:08.700> much<00:00:08.820> as<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.030> whole<00:00:09.240> new<00:00:09.389> drill

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
are almost as much as a whole new drill

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.379 
are almost as much as a whole new drill
well<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.099> like<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.580> old<00:00:11.730> drill<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.179> didn't

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
well I like this old drill and I didn't

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.160 
well I like this old drill and I didn't
want<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.599> get<00:00:12.690> rid<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.870> it

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
want to get rid of it

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.680 
want to get rid of it
do<00:00:13.380> all<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:13.650> typically<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> good<00:00:14.429> name<00:00:14.660> so<00:00:15.660> I

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
do all it's typically a good name so I

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.620 
do all it's typically a good name so I
decided<00:00:16.049> I'd<00:00:16.289> modify<00:00:16.680> buying<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.010> little<00:00:17.130> bit

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
decided I'd modify buying a little bit

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.050 
decided I'd modify buying a little bit
what<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.660> did<00:00:18.869> was<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.260> took<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.500> battery<00:00:19.830> pack

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
what I did was I took the battery pack

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.019 
what I did was I took the battery pack
and<00:00:21.230> opened<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.320> up<00:00:22.410> took<00:00:23.400> out<00:00:23.550> most<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
and opened it up took out most of the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.120 
and opened it up took out most of the
batteries<00:00:25.189> ran<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.250> long<00:00:26.460> cord<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:26.939> there<00:00:28.130> put

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
batteries ran a long cord in there put

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.650 
batteries ran a long cord in there put
alligator<00:00:29.519> clips<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> end<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.330> now<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.539> can

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
alligator clips on the end so now we can

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.290 
alligator clips on the end so now we can
clip<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.050> 12<00:00:31.349> volts<00:00:31.940> now<00:00:32.940> you're<00:00:33.149> kind

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
clip it on to 12 volts now you're kind

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.190 
clip it on to 12 volts now you're kind
of<00:00:33.360> wondering<00:00:33.480> what's<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.809> point<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
of wondering what's the point of that

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.770 
of wondering what's the point of that
well<00:00:34.980> there's<00:00:35.610> some<00:00:35.760> advantages<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.360> my<00:00:36.570> case

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
well there's some advantages in my case

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.569 
well there's some advantages in my case
oftentimes<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.739> drill<00:00:37.950> sits<00:00:38.219> for<00:00:38.399> quite<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
oftentimes the drill sits for quite a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.100 
oftentimes the drill sits for quite a
while

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
while

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.690 
while
months<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.260> between<00:00:40.350> use<00:00:40.770> batteries<00:00:41.520> go<00:00:41.670> dead

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
months in between use batteries go dead

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.850 
months in between use batteries go dead
when<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> go<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> use<00:00:42.989> if<00:00:43.200> they're<00:00:43.320> dead<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.829> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
when I go to use if they're dead so I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.170 
when I go to use if they're dead so I
have<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.160> charge<00:00:44.370> them<00:00:44.550> up<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.000> course

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
have to charge them up and of course

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.330 
have to charge them up and of course
sitting<00:00:45.899> dead<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.379> definitely<00:00:46.860> bad<00:00:47.039> for

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
sitting dead is definitely bad for

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
sitting dead is definitely bad for
batteries<00:00:47.730> they'll<00:00:48.239> shorten<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> life<00:00:48.899> quite

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
batteries they'll shorten the life quite

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.470 
batteries they'll shorten the life quite
a<00:00:49.170> bit<00:00:49.640> charging<00:00:50.640> them<00:00:50.730> up<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> time<00:00:51.270> yeah

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
a bit charging them up all the time yeah

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.270 
a bit charging them up all the time yeah
that's<00:00:51.750> great<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.140> think<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.070> I

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that's great if I think of it and I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.450 
that's great if I think of it and I
don't<00:00:53.809> so<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.110> my<00:00:55.230> case<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.949> lot<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> work

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
don't so in my case I do a lot of work

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.790 
don't so in my case I do a lot of work
around<00:00:56.969> automotive<00:00:57.750> or<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.469> see<00:00:58.649> where

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
around automotive or you see where

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.490 
around automotive or you see where
there's<00:00:58.949> 12-volt<00:00:59.340> batteries<00:00:59.640> available<00:01:00.500> so

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
there's 12-volt batteries available so

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.420 
there's 12-volt batteries available so
of<00:01:01.590> course<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.250> some

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
of course you have to have some

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.490 
of course you have to have some
knowledge<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.940> soldering<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.600> correct

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
knowledge with soldering and correct

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500 
knowledge with soldering and correct
polarity<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.640> usually<00:01:05.939> these<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.119> marked

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
polarity but usually these are marked

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.020 
polarity but usually these are marked
it's<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:06.990> hard<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.290> figure<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.680> inside<00:01:08.070> I

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.499 

opened<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.180> drill<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> little<00:01:13.470> hole

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
opened it up drill the little hole

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.510 
opened it up drill the little hole
knotted<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> wire<00:01:15.810> inside<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.560> don't<00:01:16.979> jerk

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
knotted the wire inside so don't jerk

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.330 
knotted the wire inside so don't jerk
out<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.850> break<00:01:18.030> off<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> connections<00:01:22.340> so

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
out and break off on the connections so

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.080 
out and break off on the connections so
now<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.729> plug<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:26.070> hook<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
now just plug it in and hook it up to a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.800 
now just plug it in and hook it up to a
battery<00:01:27.299> which<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> get<00:01:29.750> here's<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
battery which I have to get here's a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.149 
battery which I have to get here's a
lawnmower<00:01:31.049> battery<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.860> sitting<00:01:32.130> around

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
lawnmower battery I have sitting around

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.010 
lawnmower battery I have sitting around
I'm<00:01:32.939> sure<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.180> could<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.420> found<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.720> dirtier

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
I'm sure I could have found a dirtier

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.630 
I'm sure I could have found a dirtier
one<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.439> looked<00:01:36.200> black<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.380> negative<00:01:37.520> red<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
one if I looked black to negative red to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.969 
one if I looked black to negative red to
positive<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:39.180> course<00:01:39.920> recalling<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
positive of course recalling the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.230 
positive of course recalling the
polarity<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.729> works<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.149> it

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
polarity and it works just like it

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.359 
polarity and it works just like it
always<00:01:45.479> good

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
always good

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.999 
always good
the<00:01:47.369> nice<00:01:47.520> thing<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.649> the<00:01:49.649> battery

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the nice thing of this is the battery

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
the nice thing of this is the battery
will<00:01:50.130> last<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.430> lot<00:01:50.549> longer<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:51.450> you're<00:01:51.689> working

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
will last a lot longer if you're working

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.170 
will last a lot longer if you're working
around<00:01:52.140> automotive<00:01:52.799> or<00:01:52.920> whatever<00:01:53.159> it'll<00:01:54.060> go<00:01:54.149> a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
around automotive or whatever it'll go a
