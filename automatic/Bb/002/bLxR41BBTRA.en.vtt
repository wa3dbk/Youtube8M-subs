around here
you<00:00:30.179> know<00:00:31.009> there's<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> nice<00:00:32.219> balance<00:00:33.739> those

most people do not grip room here

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.910 
most people do not grip room here

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
because it's kind of far away from the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.520 
because it's kind of far away from the
gun<00:00:38.070> itself<00:00:38.750> but<00:00:39.750> lots<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.079> people<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.440> to

gun itself but lots of people like to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.529 
gun itself but lots of people like to
keep<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.800> either<00:00:41.070> close<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:42.030> or<00:00:42.890> right<00:00:43.890> here

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
keep it either close here or right here

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.639 
keep it either close here or right here
now<00:00:45.539> what<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.840> does<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.230> gives<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.469> nice

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
now what this does it gives you nice

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.900 
now what this does it gives you nice
grooves<00:00:47.719> ambidextrous<00:00:48.719> crews<00:00:49.820> allowing<00:00:50.820> you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
grooves ambidextrous crews allowing you

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.529

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
to get grip the gun a lot easier now

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.840 
to get grip the gun a lot easier now
what<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.809> means<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:56.250> don't<00:00:56.370> really<00:00:56.610> need

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
what this means you don't really need

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.029 
what this means you don't really need
the<00:00:57.510> vertical<00:00:57.870> foregrip<00:00:58.199> no<00:00:58.440> some<00:00:58.710> people<00:00:58.920> can

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the vertical foregrip no some people can

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.430 
the vertical foregrip no some people can
use<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.609> don't<00:01:00.090> use<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.260> you're

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
use it and don't use this and you're

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.470 
use it and don't use this and you're
gonna<00:01:01.530> think<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.859> overkill<00:01:02.239> but<00:01:03.239> when<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> get

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
gonna think it's overkill but when I get

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.789 
gonna think it's overkill but when I get
my<00:01:03.660> magazine<00:01:04.110> I'll<00:01:04.199> show<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.470> what<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> mean

my magazine I'll show you what I mean

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.520 
my magazine I'll show you what I mean
what<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.070> does<00:01:05.869> let's<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> bottom<00:01:07.380> of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
what it does let's get to the bottom of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.260 
what it does let's get to the bottom of
the<00:01:07.619> gun<00:01:08.000> as<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.180> could<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.710> it<00:01:10.710> adds<00:01:11.010> about

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
the gun as you could see it adds about

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.760 
the gun as you could see it adds about
almost<00:01:12.270> an<00:01:12.390> inch<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:13.200> mag<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:13.560> so

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
almost an inch of your mag well so

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.109 
almost an inch of your mag well so
reloading<00:01:15.290> it's<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.380> whole<00:01:16.560> lot<00:01:16.799> easier<00:01:20.119> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
reloading it's a whole lot easier this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.260 
reloading it's a whole lot easier this
curved<00:01:21.479> part<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.200> mag<00:01:22.350> will<00:01:22.530> grip<00:01:23.270> allows

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
curved part of the mag will grip allows

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.880 
curved part of the mag will grip allows
you<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.979> make<00:01:26.159> reloading<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.320> whole<00:01:28.320> lot<00:01:28.530> easier

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
you to make reloading a whole lot easier

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.340 
you to make reloading a whole lot easier
and<00:01:29.400> more<00:01:29.460> accurate<00:01:32.450> let's<00:01:33.450> do<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> couple<00:01:34.079> more

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and more accurate let's do a couple more

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:46.440 
and more accurate let's do a couple more
reloads<00:01:35.420> see

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:59.929 

couple<00:01:47.450> card<00:01:47.659> reloads

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.630 

so<00:02:00.939> overall<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.710> little<00:02:03.100> piece<00:02:03.220> makes

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
so overall this little piece makes

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.870 
so overall this little piece makes
reloading<00:02:04.150> definitely<00:02:04.570> easier<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.880> it

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
reloading definitely easier and it

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.010 
reloading definitely easier and it
definitely<00:02:07.060> takes<00:02:07.299> off<00:02:07.600> some<00:02:07.810> way<00:02:07.900> because

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
definitely takes off some way because

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.449 
definitely takes off some way because
Nigel<00:02:08.380> now<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:08.739> don't<00:02:08.979> have<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.220> use<00:02:09.429> a

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
Nigel now you don't have to use a

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.800 
Nigel now you don't have to use a
vertical<00:02:09.729> foregrip<00:02:10.209> now<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.420> got<00:02:10.569> this<00:02:10.660> nice

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
vertical foregrip now you got this nice

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.890 
vertical foregrip now you got this nice
grip<00:02:11.190> right<00:02:12.190> here<00:02:12.510> allowing<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.660> make<00:02:13.810> the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
grip right here allowing it to make the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.150 
grip right here allowing it to make the
got<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.050> little<00:02:14.319> bit<00:02:14.410> smaller<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:14.860> not<00:02:15.010> good

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
got a little bit smaller so not good

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.250 
got a little bit smaller so not good
gold<00:02:16.030> out<00:02:16.180> here<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.540> use<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.840> vertical
