him moments after he won his second
straight<00:03:08.410> PGA<00:03:08.830> Championship<00:03:09.520> we<00:03:10.030> asked<00:03:10.480> him

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
straight PGA Championship we asked him

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.080 
straight PGA Championship we asked him
if<00:03:10.780> this<00:03:11.140> duel<00:03:11.770> with<00:03:12.100> Bob<00:03:12.340> May<00:03:12.580> was<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:12.910> most

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
if this duel with Bob May was the most

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.970 
if this duel with Bob May was the most
intense<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.660> his<00:03:13.780> professional<00:03:14.380> career<00:03:14.530> I

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
intense of his professional career I

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.070 
intense of his professional career I
think<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.850> was<00:03:16.060> just<00:03:16.630> from<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.810> standpoint

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
think it was just from the standpoint

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.040 
think it was just from the standpoint
that<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:18.160> know<00:03:18.640> Bob<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.120> we<00:03:19.690> never<00:03:19.780> made<00:03:20.019> a

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
that you know Bob and I we never made a

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.080 
that you know Bob and I we never made a
bogey<00:03:20.290> coming<00:03:20.800> out<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:21.010> stretch<00:03:21.220> every

bogey coming out of stretch every

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.050 
bogey coming out of stretch every
championship<00:03:22.660> is<00:03:22.780> special<00:03:23.430> not<00:03:24.430> necessarily
