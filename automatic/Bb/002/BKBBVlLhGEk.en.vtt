this<00:02:00.400> very<00:02:01.400> slow<00:02:01.730> so<00:02:02.510> as<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:02.930> just<00:02:03.200> get<00:02:03.410> ready

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
this very slow so as I just get ready

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.750 
this very slow so as I just get ready
here<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:03.950> just<00:02:03.980> created<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.550> nice<00:02:04.700> little

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
here I just created a nice little

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.980 
here I just created a nice little
incision<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:07.000> when<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.090> take<00:02:08.480> it<00:02:08.600> off<00:02:08.660> just

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
incision and when you take it off just

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.080 
incision and when you take it off just
make<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.440> holes<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:10.040> little<00:02:10.430> bit<00:02:10.550> more<00:02:10.700> visible

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
make the holes a little bit more visible

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.940 
make the holes a little bit more visible
just<00:02:11.420> so<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:11.660> can<00:02:11.930> know<00:02:11.990> where<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.680> place

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
just so you can know where to place

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.730 
just so you can know where to place
