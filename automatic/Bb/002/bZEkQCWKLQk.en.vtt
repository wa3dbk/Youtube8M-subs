00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.340 
something like fruit or live food or all
the<00:00:36.489> foods<00:00:36.760> that<00:00:36.970> existed<00:00:37.600> before<00:00:37.750> we<00:00:37.989> started

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
the foods that existed before we started

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.900 
the foods that existed before we started
playing<00:00:38.590> with<00:00:38.770> foods<00:00:39.040> and<00:00:39.610> they<00:00:39.699> all<00:00:39.760> had

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
playing with foods and they all had

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.520 
playing with foods and they all had
water<00:00:40.090> in<00:00:40.150> them<00:00:40.239> everything<00:00:40.960> had<00:00:41.050> water<00:00:41.260> in<00:00:41.320> it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
water in them everything had water in it

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.280 
water in them everything had water in it
now<00:00:42.280> we're<00:00:42.940> eating<00:00:43.020> peanut<00:00:44.020> butter<00:00:44.140> and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
now we're eating peanut butter and

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.240 
now we're eating peanut butter and
crackers<00:00:44.380> and<00:00:45.040> fish<00:00:45.730> and<00:00:45.880> chips<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:47.250> fried

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
crackers and fish and chips and fried

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.400 
crackers and fish and chips and fried
chicken<00:00:48.280> there's<00:00:49.030> no<00:00:49.120> water<00:00:49.329> okay<00:00:50.290> we

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
chicken there's no water okay we

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.620 
chicken there's no water okay we
basically<00:00:51.190> processed<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.970> water<00:00:52.149> out<00:00:52.420> of<00:00:52.450> our

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
basically processed the water out of our

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.450 
basically processed the water out of our
food<00:00:52.899> and<00:00:53.380> so<00:00:53.410> we're<00:00:53.649> chronically<00:00:54.040> starving

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
food and so we're chronically starving

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.010 
food and so we're chronically starving
for<00:00:54.610> water<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:57.280> need<00:00:57.460> water<00:00:57.820> to<00:00:58.630> eliminate

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
for water and we need water to eliminate

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.740 
for water and we need water to eliminate
toxins<00:00:59.500> we've<00:00:59.980> talked<00:01:00.219> about<00:01:00.340> toxins<00:01:00.880> we<00:01:01.540> also

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
toxins we've talked about toxins we also

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.469 
toxins we've talked about toxins we also
need<00:01:02.110> water<00:01:02.380> to<00:01:02.530> burn<00:01:02.680> fat<00:01:03.119> because<00:01:04.119> when<00:01:04.360> you

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
need water to burn fat because when you

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.810 
need water to burn fat because when you
burn<00:01:04.629> fat<00:01:04.930> you're<00:01:05.590> you're<00:01:05.979> putting<00:01:06.250> toxins

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
burn fat you're you're putting toxins

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.150 
burn fat you're you're putting toxins
into<00:01:06.970> your<00:01:07.119> system<00:01:07.649> you<00:01:08.649> need<00:01:08.800> to<00:01:08.860> be<00:01:08.979> able<00:01:09.040> to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
into your system you need to be able to

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.040 
into your system you need to be able to
flush<00:01:09.369> those<00:01:09.550> toxins<00:01:09.610> out<00:01:10.180> if<00:01:10.660> you're<00:01:10.840> not

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
flush those toxins out if you're not

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.580 
flush those toxins out if you're not
getting<00:01:11.320> enough<00:01:11.500> water<00:01:12.300> then<00:01:13.350> your<00:01:14.350> body's

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
getting enough water then your body's

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.440 
getting enough water then your body's
gonna<00:01:14.680> shut<00:01:14.950> down<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.310> fat<00:01:15.460> burning<00:01:15.670> process

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.020 

so<00:01:19.450> I<00:01:19.540> recommend<00:01:19.810> drinking<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.610> glass<00:01:21.610> of<00:01:21.850> water

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
so I recommend drinking a glass of water

so I recommend drinking a glass of water
before<00:01:22.659> each<00:01:22.690> meal<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:23.549> recommend<00:01:24.549> drinking

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
before each meal I recommend drinking

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.109 
before each meal I recommend drinking
two<00:01:25.450> glasses<00:01:25.479> of<00:01:25.930> water<00:01:26.049> when<00:01:26.260> you<00:01:26.350> wake<00:01:26.500> up<00:01:26.710> I

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
also recommend drinking a glass of water

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
sleep there was a study at the

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.450 
sleep there was a study at the
University<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:38.290> Wisconsin<00:01:39.630> where<00:01:40.630> they<00:01:41.460> found

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
University of Wisconsin where they found

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.770 
University of Wisconsin where they found
that<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.060> hundred<00:01:43.180> percent<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.689> the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
that in a hundred percent of the

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.550 
that in a hundred percent of the
subjects<00:01:44.200> studied<00:01:46.229> drinking<00:01:47.229> water<00:01:47.409> at<00:01:47.530> night

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
subjects studied drinking water at night

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.300 
subjects studied drinking water at night
killed<00:01:47.950> nighttime<00:01:48.640> cravings

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
killed nighttime cravings

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.160 
killed nighttime cravings
yeah<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> great<00:01:51.570> way<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:51.750> kill<00:01:51.930> junk

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
yeah so it's a great way to kill junk

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.680 
yeah so it's a great way to kill junk
food<00:01:52.979> craters<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.729> lot<00:01:54.150> of<00:01:54.240> experts<00:01:54.540> talk

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
food craters to a lot of experts talk

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:55.820 
food craters to a lot of experts talk
about<00:01:54.930> water<00:01:55.080> but<00:01:55.260> I<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.470> want<00:01:55.650> to<00:01:55.740> emphasize

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
about water but I just want to emphasize

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.260 
about water but I just want to emphasize
that<00:01:56.190> if<00:01:56.490> you're<00:01:56.580> not<00:01:56.760> drinking<00:01:56.940> enough<00:01:57.240> water

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that if you're not drinking enough water

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.060 
that if you're not drinking enough water
you're<00:01:57.600> not<00:01:57.630> eliminating<00:01:58.229> toxins<00:01:58.409> your

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
you're not eliminating toxins your

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.680 
you're not eliminating toxins your
body's<00:01:59.340> not<00:01:59.430> going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> burn<00:01:59.790> for<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.030> so

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
body's not going to burn for that so

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.300 
body's not going to burn for that so
that's<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.900> really<00:02:01.049> important<00:02:01.409> point<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:02.190> need

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
that's a really important point you need

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:13.710 
that's a really important point you need
to<00:02:02.430> understand

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.780 

you
