 learn how to make homemade brandy complex 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:19.230
 we will need dried debarks 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:25.130
 from one mandarin, all things do not throw in 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:38.070
 one capacity 1 bay leaf 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:44.460
 Here is a teaspoon of sugar 1 teaspoon 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:52.520
 a spoonful of good leaf tea can be 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.520
 assembly even the same horse to cinnamon 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:18.400
 five peas black pepper 2 bud 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:24.780
 cloves and on the tip of a vanilla spoon 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:32.100
 sugar and all these ingredients we pour 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.100
 half a liter 55 degree year itself 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.320
 ingredients all must be observed if 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.350
 you do let's say there per liter of moonshine 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.750
 it means you have to double this whole thing by 2 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:53.229
 if 2 liters three and so on and on 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:59.050
 further the whole thing we interfere to the full 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:04.299
 dissolving sugar and so we leave 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:08.679
 approximately for 5-7 days we interfere not only 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:12.670
 once here at the beginning of five to ten minutes 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:16.989
 it is possible to prevent ki then this whole 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.830
 mass, we are not closing learn there and you can 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.430
 cover our container but not hermetically 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.090

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.260
 and set for 5-7 days in the dark cool 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:33.030
 place and we don't touch it 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.190
 we then no longer need a node 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.030
 interfere nothing to do this we do for 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.989
 so that all these essential oils 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:48.370
 precipitated and after seven 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:53.410
 days I neatly merge it with this 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.160
 sediment and clean up through the planets or through 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.120
