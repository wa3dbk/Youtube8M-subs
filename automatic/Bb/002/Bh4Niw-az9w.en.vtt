knows we'll find it played by ear just
when<00:03:36.330> your<00:03:36.480> moment<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.840> looking<00:03:37.140> pretty<00:03:37.350> green

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
when your moment is looking pretty green

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.110 
when your moment is looking pretty green
aren't<00:03:38.040> there<00:03:38.250> other<00:03:38.400> these<00:03:38.670> fluorescent

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
aren't there other these fluorescent

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.910 
aren't there other these fluorescent
lights<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:40.709> fact<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.040> it's<00:03:41.220> all<00:03:41.490> brand<00:03:42.150> new

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
lights the fact that it's all brand new

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.080 
lights the fact that it's all brand new
once<00:03:43.920> we<00:03:44.070> hit<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.190> bags<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.730> then<00:03:44.820> I<00:03:44.850> think

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
once we hit the bags and then I think

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.760 
once we hit the bags and then I think
it's<00:03:45.209> going<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.450> start<00:03:46.020> setting<00:03:46.260> off<00:03:46.440> we<00:03:46.560> still

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
it's going to start setting off we still

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.670 
it's going to start setting off we still
got<00:03:46.890> more<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.100> go<00:03:47.280> on<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:48.110> so<00:03:49.110> it's<00:03:49.290> looking<00:03:49.470> a

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
got more to go on it so it's looking a

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
got more to go on it so it's looking a
bit<00:03:49.709> too<00:03:50.400> much<00:03:50.640> grain<00:03:50.970> at<00:03:51.090> this<00:03:51.270> stage<00:03:52.700> should

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
bit too much grain at this stage should

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.890 
bit too much grain at this stage should
be<00:03:53.760> alright<00:03:53.940> alright<00:03:54.330> guys<00:03:54.560> keep<00:03:55.560> on<00:03:55.680> riding
