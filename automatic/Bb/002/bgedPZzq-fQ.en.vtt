00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.230
 now that such good guys all 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.240
 we will teach how to configure the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.430
 environment variables in what is the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.080
 operating system windows 17 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.330
 really used continuation of 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.950
 windows what is it used to configure a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.749
 barrier around the time of environments 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.279
 serves to create or modify that our 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.529
 team can read any kind of 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.329
 command any type of package in 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.359
 this case what we wanted to do is that 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.970
 there is any java command that 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.609
 java package is many times then 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.390
 we have to allocate the route 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:38.550
 of the java package and this is a bit 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.320
 because more laborious masked we have 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.289
 with these we can give our files 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.030
 to our classes on any route of 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.809
 our computer already service put in 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.670
 all some folder on the desk 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.859
 which we facilitate everything like 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.370
 we created this just let's go and 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.370
 Really 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.920
 the console 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.309
 r 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.799
 we have it right that's the first step 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.640
 because later on as I know from the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.780
 consultation of the neighbors at the beginning 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.909
 team 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.909
 right click system properties 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.340
 well here we have for example the 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.310
 properties of windows 7 the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.549
 advanced system configuration 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.040
 ok let's go to the tabs of 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.320
 Advanced options in environment variables 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.840
 we click on what we have 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.960
 assigned variables at the same time we 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.240
 let's create a new t2 a new 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.429
 variable we write a name so 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.369
 dispar was going to write the route of the 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:04.600
 variable although as you will remember in class 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:08.110
 we set a start disk equipment 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.580
 local be program files 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.340
 we finish the jd cat that we appreciated 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.410
 you have ok let's go to the capital 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.920
 I came here are all the commands 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:25.680
 that we used while alex cares that 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.680
 up so that the route we see the route 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.880
 let's accept again 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.490
 and we have the variable configured 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:52.409
 we first created a program 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.050
 which is a program the java class for 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:03:04.220
 try out 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:06.230
 here world to try 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.470
 if you want to try it on what 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.890
 They believe in the desktop folder this 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.740
 small program 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.240
 that do not create we wait and you know that 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.990
 address it as a hit 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:25.710
 hello world is already going but we have here 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.600
 to the console of 2 we are going to direct ourselves 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.220
 I do not have on the desk here you have to 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.220
 put the route that you have chosen 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.930
 so that it's based on a language that does not 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.930
 be English is in Spanish 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.440
 ok on the desk that I'm going to do here 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.310
 I'm going to complicate my program to see if 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.310
 works correctly 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:59.370
 the command to trust java 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:02.420
 hello world point we already let in 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.420
 it is even recognized 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.060
 let's do this let's leave the 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.450
 console 2 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.900
 let's look again 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.909
 to see if the changes were saved 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.530
 let's do it again with 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:19.790
 security 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.519
 and that 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.620
 it is not 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.260
 I know how to form chau 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.160
 hello world 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.160
 name 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.230
 very well now yes all but I do not send 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.280
 no error is reconciling normal no 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.180
 any 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:44.960
 with some problem let's go 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:52.430
 write your latest music 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:54.199
 favorite artists just follow the same 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.180
 likes a hollywood star 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:05:03.289
 follow the social one that never like the world 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.470
 2 s 21 state the program worked 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.470
 correctly 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:13.260
 but no problem with this we have already 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:18.230
 configured around our 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.230
 programs your classes the computer 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.020
 and that's all a boy and girl 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.529
 their subjects and my channel tigers in the 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.479
 tutorials 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:31.969
 in your exhibition a lot my name is there 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.779
 someone on my twitter any doubt or 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:37.839
