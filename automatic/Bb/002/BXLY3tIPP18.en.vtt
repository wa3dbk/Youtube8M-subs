00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.220
 thank you very much for your attention 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.519
 today we are going back to 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.950
 how to play there guitar to fishing 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.349
 it's a question that comes up often 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.710
 and so I decided to dwell on a 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.789
 little bit about this issue and so the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.400
 basic principle of Belgian art because 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.320
 what are these two holidays like? 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.320
 of the toy select the organs good 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.320
 day 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.770
 a judge all the problems of a messi 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.890
 do it to him 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.040
 I choose the roosters 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.600
 I want to play it and dance art 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.579
 Belgian 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:50.809
 the principle of the taste of peace the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.920
 system therefore assigned the notes 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.839
 fundamental the mass notes to 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:03.850
 possible and so we have the thumb 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:06.460
 the major index the ring that they are 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.560
 four fingers playing the intervening 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.740
 most often for example in 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.479
 the agreement of 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.970
 the water door the hunchback is going to play there 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.790
 all in 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:26.460
 and then the three roof notes the 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:29.140
 three bodies of 2-3 the three strings 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.720
 the first the second and the third 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:37.530
 will be played respectively by 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.530
 the ring finger a major and the election 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:51.770
 major and ex that's what I chose 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.799
 a few strings a play not all 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:01.039
 body to the the system is not it 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:05.060
 labège and in her breasts in the intake 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.569
 for example soil but that's it 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.569
 lesson 

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:15.190
 the three fingers then remained at the same 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.190
 at the same place of interest 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.410
 1 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.910
 or 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.790
 m 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.900
 that's pretty much the principle of 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.260
 the arpeggio so the fact how 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.090
 select the spas the precise notes 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.360
 that you want 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.270
 so it's very simple and three fingers 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:16.090
 that his index the major 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:20.190
 the sea ​​is always fixed but the air 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.810
 in a way the kimouche finger that 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.150
 move to seek our fundamental 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.430
 this protocol 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.689
 anything that can move soil and more 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.689
 when we go once bones 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.190
 I hope it was pretty serene and 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.950
 chic to guide in learning to 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.590
 Belgian art at its own pace each 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.360
 his way so thank you for your attention
