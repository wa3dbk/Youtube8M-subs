00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.630 

so<00:00:24.650> how<00:00:25.040> does<00:00:25.100> vintage<00:00:25.730> begin

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
so how does vintage begin

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.760 
so how does vintage begin
well<00:00:28.640> we<00:00:28.790> sit<00:00:29.060> down<00:00:29.270> as<00:00:29.720> a<00:00:29.779> brewing<00:00:30.200> team<00:00:30.470> and

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
well we sit down as a brewing team and

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.890 
well we sit down as a brewing team and
we<00:00:31.520> think<00:00:31.790> about<00:00:32.029> what<00:00:32.300> we<00:00:32.450> want<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:32.780> do

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
we think about what we want to do

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.130 
we think about what we want to do
different<00:00:33.470> this<00:00:33.830> year<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.430> last<00:00:35.140> vintages

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
different this year to last vintages

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.540 
different this year to last vintages
waves<00:00:36.559> at<00:00:36.770> seven-and-a-half<00:00:37.220> percent

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
waves at seven-and-a-half percent

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.850 
waves at seven-and-a-half percent
alcohol<00:00:37.970> so<00:00:38.510> that's<00:00:39.110> an<00:00:39.290> important<00:00:39.739> feature

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
alcohol so that's an important feature

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.670 
alcohol so that's an important feature
every<00:00:40.730> vintage<00:00:40.879> obviously<00:00:41.570> has<00:00:41.750> pale<00:00:42.410> malt

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
every vintage obviously has pale malt

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.799 
every vintage obviously has pale malt
which<00:00:42.949> is<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:43.340> base<00:00:43.489> of<00:00:43.520> every<00:00:43.879> beer<00:00:44.090> and

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
which is the base of every beer and

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.270 
which is the base of every beer and
generally<00:00:45.230> all<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.379> vintages<00:00:45.890> have<00:00:46.040> a<00:00:46.100> lot<00:00:46.250> of

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
generally all the vintages have a lot of

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.140 
generally all the vintages have a lot of
Kristallnacht

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
Kristallnacht

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.119 
Kristallnacht
but<00:00:47.540> the<00:00:47.720> main<00:00:47.930> element<00:00:47.960> that<00:00:48.650> we<00:00:48.800> change

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
but the main element that we change

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.630 
but the main element that we change
these<00:00:49.340> year<00:00:49.670> are<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:50.449> hops<00:00:50.739> so<00:00:51.739> this<00:00:52.220> is<00:00:52.400> where

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
these year are the hops so this is where

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.400 
these year are the hops so this is where
we<00:00:52.820> have<00:00:53.059> a<00:00:53.090> bit<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.330> fun<00:00:53.629> as<00:00:53.809> a<00:00:53.840> brewing<00:00:54.140> team

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
we have a bit of fun as a brewing team

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.200 
we have a bit of fun as a brewing team
and<00:00:55.040> then<00:00:55.130> we<00:00:55.219> do<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.370> little<00:00:55.610> thing<00:00:55.700> called<00:00:55.850> hot

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
and then we do a little thing called hot

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.479 
and then we do a little thing called hot
idol<00:00:56.600> where<00:00:57.170> we<00:00:57.290> taste<00:00:57.530> all<00:00:57.739> these<00:00:57.890> beers<00:00:58.219> will

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
idol where we taste all these beers will

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.040 
idol where we taste all these beers will
the<00:00:58.579> very<00:00:58.760> tops<00:00:59.000> and<00:00:59.270> then<00:00:59.570> we<00:00:59.660> give<00:00:59.809> them<00:00:59.930> a

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
the very tops and then we give them a

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.410 
the very tops and then we give them a
score<00:01:00.260> yes<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.100> that's<00:01:01.340> what<00:01:01.879> they<00:01:02.030> refer<00:01:02.390> to

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
score yes so that's what they refer to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.200 
score yes so that's what they refer to
in<00:01:02.750> terms<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.200> hop<00:01:03.410> height<00:01:03.710> oh<00:01:03.739> yes<00:01:07.180> did<00:01:08.180> you

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
in terms the hop height oh yes did you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.260 
in terms the hop height oh yes did you
notice<00:01:08.660> that<00:01:08.810> we<00:01:09.289> wanted<00:01:09.649> more<00:01:09.920> business<00:01:10.369> but

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
notice that we wanted more business but

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.249 
notice that we wanted more business but
