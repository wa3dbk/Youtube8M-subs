inside we have of course I know what's
inside<00:00:16.680> because<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.070> bought<00:00:17.279> them<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:17.850> have

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
inside because I bought them but we have

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.050 
inside because I bought them but we have

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
a golden shrimp and their silver matilda

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.339 
a golden shrimp and their silver matilda
already<00:00:27.810> still<00:00:28.080> boxed<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.990> yes<00:00:30.990> these<00:00:31.289> are

already still boxed and yes these are
the<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:32.550> believe<00:00:33.360> Golden<00:00:33.870> Wonder<00:00:35.030> special

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
the I believe Golden Wonder special

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.549 
the I believe Golden Wonder special
edition<00:00:36.360> ones<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.750> had<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.050> send<00:00:37.230> off<00:00:37.410> for

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
edition ones you had to send off for

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.040 
edition ones you had to send off for
these<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.120> from<00:00:39.120> my<00:00:39.239> understanding<00:00:39.450> they<00:00:39.960> are

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
these and from my understanding they are

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.080 
these and from my understanding they are
relatively<00:00:40.710> limited<00:00:41.059> I'm<00:00:45.379> going<00:00:46.379> trumped

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
relatively limited I'm going trumped

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.240 
relatively limited I'm going trumped
with<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.770> recipe<00:00:49.770> apparently<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
with the recipe apparently it's a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.580 
with the recipe apparently it's a
flywheel<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:51.149> definitely<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.140> flywheel

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
flywheel it's definitely not a flywheel

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.340 
flywheel it's definitely not a flywheel
like<00:00:53.489> some<00:00:53.699> sorts<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.030> bludgeoning<00:00:54.840> device<00:00:55.140> on

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
like some sorts of bludgeoning device on

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.900 
like some sorts of bludgeoning device on
the<00:00:55.440> end<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> axe<00:00:56.750> Robot<00:00:57.750> Wars<00:00:57.780> logo<00:00:58.140> there

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
the end of the axe Robot Wars logo there

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.869 
the end of the axe Robot Wars logo there
and<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.980> stats<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.399> I'm<00:01:02.640> led<00:01:02.850> to

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
and you get the stats and I'm led to

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.579 
and you get the stats and I'm led to
believe<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.300> Matilda<00:01:03.600> status<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.260> actually

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
believe the Matilda status is actually

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.760 
believe the Matilda status is actually
for<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> wrong<00:01:05.400> type<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.760> Matilda<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.619> can

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
for the wrong type of Matilda as you can

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.770 
for the wrong type of Matilda as you can
see<00:01:08.010> when<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> show<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> Matilda<00:01:09.659> one

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
see when I show you the Matilda one

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.890 
see when I show you the Matilda one
actually<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.409> fact<00:01:11.360> you've<00:01:12.360> got<00:01:12.600> all<00:01:12.720> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
actually in fact you've got all that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.960 
actually in fact you've got all that
down

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
down

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.630 
down
Matilda<00:01:14.970> there<00:01:15.470> actually<00:01:16.470> has<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> flywheel

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
Matilda there actually has a flywheel

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.039 
Matilda there actually has a flywheel
instead<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.020> chainsaw<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.990> if<00:01:21.990> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
instead of the chainsaw and if I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.539 
instead of the chainsaw and if I
remember<00:01:22.320> eyelid<00:01:22.650> that's<00:01:22.799> actually

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
remember eyelid that's actually

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.929 
remember eyelid that's actually
increased<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> weight<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.509> Matilda<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:26.250> this

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
increased the weight of Matilda so this

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.450 
increased the weight of Matilda so this
is<00:01:27.360> strictly<00:01:28.049> speaking<00:01:28.229> wrong<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.220> don't<00:01:29.280> know

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
is strictly speaking wrong I don't know

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.600 
is strictly speaking wrong I don't know
if<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.210> was<00:01:30.420> series<00:01:30.840> for<00:01:31.350> ear<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:32.130> series

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
if this was series for ear or series

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.200 
if this was series for ear or series
five<00:01:33.079> or<00:01:34.079> even<00:01:34.290> extreme<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.009> should<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:36.090> I

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
five or even extreme it should if I

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.370 
five or even extreme it should if I
remember<00:01:36.479> rightly<00:01:36.689> they<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.159> series<00:01:38.159> four

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
remember rightly they are series four

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.260 
remember rightly they are series four
they<00:01:40.380> were<00:01:40.500> released<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.369> run-up<00:01:42.150> to

been<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.849> 12<00:02:09.390> years<00:02:10.050> ago<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.319> think<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.709> will

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
been what 12 years ago I think it will

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.780 
been what 12 years ago I think it will
be<00:02:11.009> now<00:02:11.250> twelve

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
be now twelve

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.720 
be now twelve
yeah<00:02:12.090> sort<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.840> some

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
yeah sort of some

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.790 
yeah sort of some
so<00:02:15.180> yeah<00:02:15.300> these<00:02:15.450> were<00:02:15.720> ramp<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.290> Christmas

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
so yeah these were ramp to the Christmas

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.150 
so yeah these were ramp to the Christmas
period<00:02:17.209> mm<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.780> would<00:02:19.260> make<00:02:19.440> them<00:02:19.680> series

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
period mm so that would make them series

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.140 
period mm so that would make them series
four<00:02:20.840> extreme<00:02:21.840> now<00:02:22.800> then<00:02:22.980> let's<00:02:23.190> let's<00:02:23.790> unbox

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
four extreme now then let's let's unbox

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.720 
four extreme now then let's let's unbox
these<00:02:24.390> for<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.780> very<00:02:25.080> first<00:02:25.470> time<00:02:25.860> still<00:02:26.459> if

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
these for the very first time still if

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.390 
these for the very first time still if
you<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.480> see<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.840> there<00:02:28.020> it's<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.040> still<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
you can see that there it's a still the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.830 
you can see that there it's a still the
original<00:02:29.459> solitaire<00:02:30.150> these<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:30.480> never<00:02:30.690> been

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
original solitaire these have never been

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.680 
original solitaire these have never been
unboxed<00:02:31.470> apart<00:02:31.950> from<00:02:32.239> rolling<00:02:33.239> shrimps<00:02:33.569> of

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
unboxed apart from rolling shrimps of

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.630 
unboxed apart from rolling shrimps of
course<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.050> try<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.590> slightly<00:02:35.040> unboxed

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
course we try it slightly unboxed

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.140 
course we try it slightly unboxed
earlier<00:02:36.080> now<00:02:37.080> let's<00:02:37.709> see<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.220> see<00:02:38.880> what<00:02:39.030> would

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
earlier now let's see I see what would

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.100 
earlier now let's see I see what would
make<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:44.180> I've<00:02:45.180> been<00:02:45.300> very<00:02:45.480> careful<00:02:45.930> here

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
make of that I've been very careful here

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.970 
make of that I've been very careful here
not<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.319> damage<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.739> box<00:02:48.350> because<00:02:49.350> as<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.620> bit

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
not to damage the box because as a bit

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.460 
not to damage the box because as a bit
of<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.160> collector<00:02:50.340> I'd<00:02:50.880> rather<00:02:51.269> keep<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.260> all

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
of a collector I'd rather keep it all

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.479 
of a collector I'd rather keep it all
pristine<00:02:53.450> or<00:02:54.450> as<00:02:54.600> much<00:02:54.780> as<00:02:54.900> possible<00:02:55.260> anyway

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
pristine or as much as possible anyway

yeah brand-new golden shun there we go I
don't<00:03:21.329> know<00:03:21.390> wandering<00:03:21.840> over<00:03:21.930> here

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
don't know wandering over here

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.810 
don't know wandering over here
golden<00:03:23.850> shunts<00:03:25.040> with<00:03:26.040> what<00:03:26.280> appears<00:03:26.609> to<00:03:26.670> be

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
golden shunts with what appears to be

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.009 
golden shunts with what appears to be
actually<00:03:27.299> a<00:03:27.329> slightly<00:03:27.780> damaged<00:03:28.230> X<00:03:29.660> hmm

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.509 

see<00:03:34.019> it's<00:03:34.260> slightly<00:03:34.410> damaged<00:03:34.980> there<00:03:35.190> don't

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
see it's slightly damaged there don't

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.199 
see it's slightly damaged there don't
know<00:03:35.609> why<00:03:36.260> probably<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.350> age<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:38.280> age<00:03:39.060> of

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
know why probably the age of the age of

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.960 
know why probably the age of the age of
the<00:03:39.390> thing<00:03:39.600> in<00:03:40.230> fact<00:03:40.530> truth<00:03:41.459> be<00:03:41.579> told

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
the thing in fact truth be told

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.670 
the thing in fact truth be told
looks<00:03:42.150> like<00:03:42.359> it's<00:03:42.569> slightly<00:03:42.870> split<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
looks like it's slightly split in the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.729 
looks like it's slightly split in the
middle<00:03:43.920> don't<00:03:44.670> know<00:03:44.790> if<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:44.910> can<00:03:45.030> see<00:03:45.329> that

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
middle don't know if you can see that

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.940 
middle don't know if you can see that
just<00:03:46.739> yeah<00:03:48.019> I'll<00:03:49.019> probably<00:03:49.230> do<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.530> bit<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.769> work

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
just yeah I'll probably do a bit of work

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:57.229 
just yeah I'll probably do a bit of work
on<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:54.109> and<00:03:55.109> there<00:03:55.560> we<00:03:55.650> have<00:03:55.799> it<00:03:56.239> golden

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
on that and there we have it golden

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.479 
on that and there we have it golden
shunt<00:03:58.730> with<00:03:59.750> the<00:04:00.750> actual<00:04:01.170> acts<00:04:01.350> I'm<00:04:02.280> not

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
shunt with the actual acts I'm not

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.180 
shunt with the actual acts I'm not
entirely<00:04:02.760> sure<00:04:02.910> why<00:04:03.870> it's<00:04:04.109> like<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.290> it's<00:04:04.799> as

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
entirely sure why it's like that it's as

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.759 
entirely sure why it's like that it's as
you<00:04:05.459> can<00:04:05.549> see<00:04:05.670> it's<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.819> very<00:04:08.870> it's<00:04:09.870> not<00:04:09.959> set<00:04:10.590> him

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
you can see it's a very it's not set him

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.229 
you can see it's a very it's not set him
very<00:04:11.010> well<00:04:11.069> but<00:04:11.400> he<00:04:11.489> does<00:04:11.670> look<00:04:11.819> like<00:04:11.850> he<00:04:12.209> has

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
very well but he does look like he has

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.039 
very well but he does look like he has
cracked<00:04:12.780> side<00:04:13.109> that<00:04:13.709> might<00:04:13.920> be<00:04:14.040> with<00:04:14.190> age<00:04:15.049> in

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
cracked side that might be with age in

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.909 
cracked side that might be with age in
fact<00:04:16.350> I'm<00:04:16.829> certain<00:04:17.370> that's<00:04:17.669> with<00:04:17.910> age<00:04:18.919> so

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
fact I'm certain that's with age so

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.159 
fact I'm certain that's with age so
let's<00:04:20.430> get<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:20.760> silver<00:04:21.419> Matilda

if<00:04:27.169> we<00:04:27.349> can<00:04:27.500> actually<00:04:27.620> get<00:04:27.949> in<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.310> thing<00:04:28.520> that

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
if we can actually get in the thing that

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:41.339 
if we can actually get in the thing that
is<00:04:31.810> yep<00:04:33.639> and<00:04:34.810> there<00:04:35.810> is<00:04:36.069> the<00:04:37.069> solver<00:04:37.669> Matilda

very nice quality on this this is the

Matilda as well I have earned a golden
shrimp<00:04:48.710> before<00:04:49.069> this<00:04:50.030> is<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.270> very<00:04:50.479> first

time I've ever in fact seen a silver
Matilda

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
Matilda

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.610 
Matilda
well<00:04:55.639> apart<00:04:55.849> from<00:04:55.909> on<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.210> eBay<00:04:56.479> page<00:04:56.810> when<00:04:57.590> I

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
well apart from on the eBay page when I

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.950 
well apart from on the eBay page when I
was<00:04:57.800> looking<00:04:57.979> at<00:04:58.220> it<00:04:58.430> in<00:04:59.330> here<00:04:59.659> as<00:04:59.750> well<00:04:59.930> you

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
was looking at it in here as well you

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.610 
was looking at it in here as well you
can<00:05:00.229> see<00:05:00.440> you<00:05:00.650> get<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:01.150> chain<00:05:02.150> saw<00:05:02.289> silver<00:05:03.289> of

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
can see you get the chain saw silver of

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.520 
can see you get the chain saw silver of
course<00:05:03.889> but<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:05.479> standard<00:05:05.840> long<00:05:05.960> silver<00:05:06.409> as

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
course but the standard long silver as

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.559 
course but the standard long silver as
well<00:05:06.710> so<00:05:07.039> I'm<00:05:07.430> assuming<00:05:07.699> it's<00:05:08.000> a<00:05:08.150> slightly

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
well so I'm assuming it's a slightly

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.390 
well so I'm assuming it's a slightly
different<00:05:08.659> color<00:05:09.020> to<00:05:09.259> match<00:05:09.470> it<00:05:10.039> doesn't<00:05:10.220> even

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
different color to match it doesn't even

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.860 
different color to match it doesn't even
look<00:05:10.550> like<00:05:10.610> a<00:05:10.759> much<00:05:11.000> different<00:05:11.419> cause<00:05:11.569> to<00:05:11.780> be

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
look like a much different cause to be

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.659 
look like a much different cause to be
honest<00:05:12.080> with<00:05:12.229> you<00:05:12.319> but<00:05:12.470> Sir<00:05:12.830> hey<00:05:13.729> huh<00:05:14.500> let's

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
honest with you but Sir hey huh let's

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.950 
honest with you but Sir hey huh let's
get<00:05:16.669> round<00:05:17.030> to<00:05:17.150> doing<00:05:17.270> that<00:05:19.690> same<00:05:20.690> could<00:05:20.930> be

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
get round to doing that same could be

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.260 
get round to doing that same could be
said<00:05:21.050> for<00:05:21.199> the<00:05:21.530> disc<00:05:22.460> with<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.699> back<00:05:22.879> as<00:05:23.090> well

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
said for the disc with the back as well
