I think that no team was getting to the
format<00:05:55.190> was<00:05:55.630> loading<00:05:56.630> as<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:57.290> chance<00:05:57.530> to<00:05:57.800> come

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
format was loading as the chance to come

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.190 
format was loading as the chance to come
