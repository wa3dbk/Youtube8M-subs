you're<00:01:42.110> supposed<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.710> slow<00:01:42.950> down<00:01:43.190> so<00:01:43.640> it's<00:01:43.820> not

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
you're supposed to slow down so it's not

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.180 
you're supposed to slow down so it's not
to<00:01:44.210> melt<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.540> plastic<00:01:44.680> but<00:01:45.680> I<00:01:45.710> found<00:01:46.070> the

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
to melt the plastic but I found the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.610 
to melt the plastic but I found the
plastic<00:01:46.400> melted<00:01:47.090> anyway<00:01:47.540> so<00:01:47.990> might<00:01:48.350> as<00:01:48.470> well

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
plastic melted anyway so might as well

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.490 
plastic melted anyway so might as well
just<00:01:49.010> power<00:01:49.310> right<00:01:49.760> through

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.030 

and<00:01:55.040> sure<00:01:55.520> enough<00:01:55.550> it<00:01:56.180> cuts<00:01:56.480> word<00:01:56.780> or<00:01:57.470> actually

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
and sure enough it cuts word or actually

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.520 
and sure enough it cuts word or actually
if<00:01:58.130> more<00:01:58.340> burns<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.210> cuts<00:01:59.240> but<00:02:00.080> that<00:02:00.320> has

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
if more burns and cuts but that has

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.010 
if more burns and cuts but that has
nothing<00:02:00.800> to<00:02:01.040> do<00:02:01.310> with<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.670> tool<00:02:01.880> this<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
nothing to do with the tool this is the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.500 
nothing to do with the tool this is the
same<00:02:03.350> number<00:02:03.800> four<00:02:04.010> to<00:02:04.310> zero<00:02:04.340> cutoff<00:02:05.210> wheel

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
same number four to zero cutoff wheel

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.350 
same number four to zero cutoff wheel
which<00:02:06.290> is<00:02:06.470> obviously<00:02:07.010> not<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.430> best<00:02:07.700> choice

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
which is obviously not the best choice

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.410 
which is obviously not the best choice
for<00:02:08.390> wood<00:02:11.920> now<00:02:12.920> taking<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.460> closer<00:02:13.670> look<00:02:14.030> at<00:02:14.300> the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
for wood now taking a closer look at the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.080 
for wood now taking a closer look at the
tool<00:02:14.630> itself<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.890> power<00:02:16.100> cord<00:02:16.520> caught<00:02:16.850> my<00:02:17.060> eye

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
tool itself the power cord caught my eye

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.670 
tool itself the power cord caught my eye
right<00:02:17.300> away<00:02:17.990> that<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.920> good<00:02:19.460> power<00:02:19.880> cord<00:02:20.330> you

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
right away that is a good power cord you

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.290 
right away that is a good power cord you
already<00:02:21.680> know<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.400> power<00:02:22.610> switch<00:02:23.030> is

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
already know that the power switch is

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.510 
already know that the power switch is
separate<00:02:23.750> from<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.140> speed<00:02:24.410> control<00:02:24.920> which<00:02:25.340> is

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
separate from the speed control which is

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.030 
separate from the speed control which is
good<00:02:25.730> there's<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.540> steel<00:02:26.870> hanger<00:02:27.350> loop<00:02:27.590> which

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
good there's a steel hanger loop which

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.970 
good there's a steel hanger loop which
is<00:02:28.220> good<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:29.360> tool<00:02:29.570> has<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.930> uniform<00:02:30.590> round

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
is good and the tool has a uniform round

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.100 
is good and the tool has a uniform round
shape<00:02:31.280> which<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.300> think<00:02:32.600> is<00:02:32.750> better<00:02:32.959> than

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
shape which I think is better than

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.740 
shape which I think is better than
having<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.709> weird<00:02:33.980> shape<00:02:34.370> with<00:02:34.730> protrusions<00:02:35.480> a

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
still one thing nagged at me after the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.009 
still one thing nagged at me after the
fact<00:02:57.560> talking<00:02:58.459> about<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.000> shaft<00:02:59.269> lock<00:02:59.630> button

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
fact talking about the shaft lock button

some<00:03:00.709> amazon<00:03:01.220> reviewers<00:03:01.820> had<00:03:02.090> said<00:03:02.330> things

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
some amazon reviewers had said things

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.810 
some amazon reviewers had said things
like<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.560> button<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.100> holds<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.640> shaft

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
like the button that holds the shaft

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.780 
like the button that holds the shaft
broke<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.900> shaft<00:03:06.170> stopper<00:03:06.739> broke<00:03:07.070> after<00:03:07.580> some

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
broke the shaft stopper broke after some

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.150 
broke the shaft stopper broke after some
light<00:03:08.000> use<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.989> locking<00:03:09.410> pin<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.860> change

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160

tools<00:03:10.519> broke<00:03:11.030> with<00:03:11.420> less<00:03:11.690> than<00:03:11.959> 20<00:03:12.290> minutes

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
tools broke with less than 20 minutes

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.790 
tools broke with less than 20 minutes
use<00:03:12.890> obviously<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:14.450> bought<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.930> tool<00:03:15.140> anyway

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
use obviously I bought the tool anyway

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.280 
use obviously I bought the tool anyway
but<00:03:16.550> now<00:03:16.580> these<00:03:16.970> comments<00:03:17.480> started<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.080> bother

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
but now these comments started to bother

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.820 
but now these comments started to bother
me<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.400> decided<00:03:20.269> warranty<00:03:21.080> what<00:03:21.380> warranty

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
me so I decided warranty what warranty

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.730 
me so I decided warranty what warranty
and<00:03:22.190> took<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.060> look<00:03:23.299> inside

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.220 

as<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.610> turns<00:03:27.850> out<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.450> maybe<00:03:28.720> there's<00:03:29.020> not

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
as it turns out and maybe there's not

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.650 
as it turns out and maybe there's not
much<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.770> worry<00:03:29.980> about<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:31.090> shaft<00:03:31.360> lock

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
much to worry about the shaft lock

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.460 
much to worry about the shaft lock
mechanism<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.650> steel<00:03:33.130> pin<00:03:33.660> held<00:03:34.660> by<00:03:34.990> a<00:03:35.020> steel

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
mechanism is a steel pin held by a steel

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.880 
mechanism is a steel pin held by a steel
spring<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.390> then<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.630> pin<00:03:37.870> engages<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.590> notch

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
spring and then the pin engages a notch

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.330 
spring and then the pin engages a notch
in<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.460> steel<00:03:39.730> shaft<00:03:40.500> maybe<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.740> nose<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:42.220> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
in a steel shaft maybe the nose of the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.120 
in a steel shaft maybe the nose of the
pin<00:03:42.580> could<00:03:42.850> be<00:03:43.060> larger<00:03:43.540> but<00:03:44.170> then<00:03:44.470> this<00:03:44.710> is<00:03:44.890> not

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
pin could be larger but then this is not

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.520 
pin could be larger but then this is not
a<00:03:45.190> diesel<00:03:45.490> engine<00:03:46.090> so<00:03:46.240> I<00:03:46.600> think<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:47.140> might<00:03:47.350> hold

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
a diesel engine so I think it might hold

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.000 
a diesel engine so I think it might hold
up<00:03:47.830> pretty<00:03:48.070> well<00:03:48.220> as<00:03:48.610> is<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:50.410> housing<00:03:50.860> is

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
up pretty well as is and the housing is

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.230 
up pretty well as is and the housing is
open<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:51.910> might<00:03:52.120> as<00:03:52.240> well<00:03:52.390> take<00:03:52.630> a<00:03:52.690> look<00:03:52.930> around

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
open so might as well take a look around

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.130 
open so might as well take a look around
