00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.299
 how much raised morale fell 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.160
 goats fighters and 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:13.330
 do you coordinate with 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.550
 other volunteer battalions 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:21.859
 if disagreement is there any battalion 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.900
 with which we have some wonderful 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.210
 great if it's a battalion with 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.519
 which we simply have no relationship with 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.140
 some kind of battalion innate relationship 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:35.870
 we have no communication ski in terms of moral 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.559
 spirit well i find it so nice to think 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.350
 that in any case I did not see 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.109
 that someone's spirit is morally higher than ours 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.370
 this also applies to volunteer 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:53.180
 battalions it concerns 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.399
 we guard better and better day you 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.719
 know the conclusion 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.719
 they are mostly people who 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.760
 either by chance whether you wanted them at all 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.059
 would avoid 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.680
 although there are you and so rock bands 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.280
 some people have something like one said 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.950
 our Georgian comrades his legitimate that 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.320
 it all depends on the commander from the hall to do 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.740
 exactly two times more to do commander 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.140
 the commander is drinking a dog and weâ€™ll find it twice 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.040
 asked to create a coward two times more 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.540
 if the commander is normally a soldier depends 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.840
 exclusively to manners here are some 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.840
 parts high 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.560
 with commanders and soldiers really 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.410
 say hello 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.000
 nice to wonderful people with them 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:44.380
 wonderful attitude have any 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.380
 parts of the question 5 parts some 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.410
 moral freaks and has no 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.460
 rights to call him a yenn functionary 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.890
 who dealt exclusively with those 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.440
 to give this unfortunate army 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.700
 built themselves cottages 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.110
 but they now want to stay posts 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.310
 for them a place in this army is not him 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:14.180
 just cog their presence and their 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.010
 much they spell it normal 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.870
 health core in the army which 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.450
 the soldiers are just like plastic 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.450
 such you eat 6 you will not make that
