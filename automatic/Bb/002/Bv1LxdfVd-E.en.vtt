for<00:00:46.200> now<00:00:46.350> I'm<00:00:46.559> using<00:00:46.739> face<00:00:47.039> paint<00:00:47.309> because

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
for now I'm using face paint because

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.639 
for now I'm using face paint because
even<00:00:48.329> though<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.570> doesn't<00:00:48.840> dry<00:00:48.989> permanently

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
even though it doesn't dry permanently

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.310 
even though it doesn't dry permanently
it<00:00:49.920> works<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.550> I'm<00:00:51.059> not<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> remove<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it works and I'm not going to remove the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.520 
it works and I'm not going to remove the
lid<00:00:52.550> anyways<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.449> fine<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.199> not<00:00:55.379> going

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
lid anyways so it's fine it's not going

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.099 
lid anyways so it's fine it's not going
to<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.649> exposed<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.219> water<00:00:56.399> inside<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.360> then

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
to be exposed to water inside and then

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.740 
to be exposed to water inside and then
I'm<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> use<00:00:59.340> q-tips<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.270> apply<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
I'm going to use q-tips to apply the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.189 
I'm going to use q-tips to apply the
paint<00:01:01.109> inside<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.920> jar<00:01:02.160> instead<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.420> pink

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
paint inside the jar instead of pink

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.039 
paint inside the jar instead of pink
brushes<00:01:04.739> why<00:01:05.519> because<00:01:05.970> q-tips<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.720> round

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
brushes why because q-tips are round

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.500 
brushes why because q-tips are round
tipped<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> lot<00:01:08.130> easier<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.820> apply

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
tipped and it's a lot easier to apply

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.100 
tipped and it's a lot easier to apply
the<00:01:09.659> paint<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:11.010> round<00:01:11.430> tip<00:01:11.610> brush<00:01:12.600> instead

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the paint with a round tip brush instead

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.550 
the paint with a round tip brush instead
a<00:01:13.439> round<00:01:13.979> tip<00:01:14.250> applicator<00:01:14.430> instead<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.840> flat

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
a round tip applicator instead of a flat

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.140 
a round tip applicator instead of a flat
tip<00:01:16.920> brush<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.700> any<00:01:18.360> round<00:01:18.689> tip<00:01:18.930> brush<00:01:19.229> or

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
tip brush so any round tip brush or

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.640 
tip brush so any round tip brush or
q-tip<00:01:21.150> works<00:01:21.450> fine

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
q-tip works fine

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.010 
q-tip works fine
so<00:01:24.070> I'm<00:01:24.160> just<00:01:24.370> going<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.670> squeeze<00:01:25.150> out<00:01:25.420> some<00:01:25.450> of

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
after airs absorb the light so once you

are done with the entire jar painted on

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.420 
are done with the entire jar painted on
the<00:02:31.600> inside<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.500> should<00:02:32.680> look<00:02:32.860> something<00:02:33.190> like

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
the inside it should look something like

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.290 
the inside it should look something like
this

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
this

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.160 
this
and<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:36.130> throw<00:02:36.459> my<00:02:37.180> cotton<00:02:37.570> bud<00:02:37.780> at<00:02:38.050> the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
and I just throw my cotton bud at the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.800 
and I just throw my cotton bud at the
bottom<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.920> just<00:02:39.310> give<00:02:39.970> some<00:02:40.270> sort<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.630> a

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
bottom to just give some sort of a

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
bottom to just give some sort of a
whirlwind<00:02:41.770> effect<00:02:42.340> like<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.530> universe<00:02:44.530> black

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
whirlwind effect like a universe black

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.910 
whirlwind effect like a universe black
hole<00:02:45.100> kind<00:02:45.459> of<00:02:45.610> effect<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.630> yeah<00:02:46.870> mom<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.770> next

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
hole kind of effect so yeah mom the next

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.190 
hole kind of effect so yeah mom the next
step<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.850> leave<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.360> paint<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.690> dry<00:02:49.959> it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
step is to leave the paint to dry it

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.290 
step is to leave the paint to dry it
won't<00:02:50.410> dry<00:02:50.620> permanently<00:02:51.280> so<00:02:51.580> remember<00:02:52.090> that

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
won't dry permanently so remember that

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.630 
won't dry permanently so remember that
this<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.600> not<00:02:52.630> waterproof<00:02:53.440> paint<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:53.950> as<00:02:54.459> you

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
this is not waterproof paint and as you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.090 
this is not waterproof paint and as you
get<00:02:54.820> glow-in-the-dark<00:02:55.630> acrylic<00:02:56.260> paint<00:02:56.500> when

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
get glow-in-the-dark acrylic paint when

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.170 
get glow-in-the-dark acrylic paint when
I<00:02:57.489> like<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.800> hasten<00:02:59.800> up<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.280> process<00:03:00.700> by

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
I like to hasten up the process by

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.110 
I like to hasten up the process by
putting<00:03:01.840> this<00:03:02.170> directly<00:03:02.709> at<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.280> light<00:03:03.610> bulb<00:03:03.910> to

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
putting this directly at a light bulb to

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.110 
putting this directly at a light bulb to
absorb<00:03:04.450> as<00:03:04.570> much<00:03:04.810> light<00:03:04.870> as<00:03:05.230> possible<00:03:05.260> and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
absorb as much light as possible and

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.400 
absorb as much light as possible and
then<00:03:07.120> I'm<00:03:07.330> going<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.630> show<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:07.870> how<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.380> looks

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
then I'm going to show you how it looks

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.670 
then I'm going to show you how it looks
like<00:03:08.709> when<00:03:09.640> my<00:03:09.820> lights<00:03:10.000> are<00:03:10.180> off

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
like when my lights are off

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.850 
like when my lights are off
so<00:03:12.189> this<00:03:12.819> is<00:03:12.970> my<00:03:13.150> jar<00:03:13.480> I'm<00:03:13.750> just<00:03:14.140> putting<00:03:14.590> this

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
so this is my jar I'm just putting this

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.880 
so this is my jar I'm just putting this
to<00:03:15.640> my<00:03:15.939> light<00:03:16.269> bulb<00:03:16.659> and<00:03:16.959> I'm<00:03:17.439> letting<00:03:17.739> this

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
to my light bulb and I'm letting this

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.210 
to my light bulb and I'm letting this
absorb<00:03:18.489> as<00:03:18.730> much<00:03:19.060> light<00:03:19.120> as<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.290> possibly<00:03:20.590> can

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
absorb as much light as it possibly can

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.309 
absorb as much light as it possibly can
as<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:22.150> can<00:03:22.299> see<00:03:22.569> here<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:24.329> this<00:03:25.329> really<00:03:25.810> helps

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
as you can see here so this really helps

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.240 
as you can see here so this really helps
to<00:03:26.379> hasten<00:03:26.920> up<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.189> process<00:03:27.670> of<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:29.250> absorbing

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
to hasten up the process of it absorbing

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.869 
to hasten up the process of it absorbing
all<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.519> light<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.689> that<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:31.959> can<00:03:32.349> show<00:03:32.590> you

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
all the light so that I can show you

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.640 
all the light so that I can show you
faster<00:03:33.879> how<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.329> looks<00:03:34.569> like<00:03:34.840> in<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.439> night

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
faster how it looks like in the night

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:46.559 
faster how it looks like in the night
time<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:38.220> I'm<00:03:39.220> just<00:03:39.250> going<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.909> seal<00:03:40.209> this<00:03:40.510> up

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.340 

and<00:03:46.959> I'm<00:03:47.409> going<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.680> turn<00:03:47.860> off<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.129> lights
