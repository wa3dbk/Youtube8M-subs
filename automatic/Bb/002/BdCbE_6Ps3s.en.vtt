00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
when you've done that on top I'm

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.319 
when you've done that on top I'm
actually<00:00:59.469> good<00:00:59.739> to<00:00:59.859> go<00:00:59.979> over<00:01:00.070> this<00:01:00.159> trick<00:01:00.430> okay

actually good to go over this trick okay
so<00:01:01.390> let's<00:01:01.600> just<00:01:01.750> pretend<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.079> suspect<00:01:02.409> area

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
so let's just pretend the suspect area

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:03.869 
so let's just pretend the suspect area
in<00:01:02.649> front<00:01:02.710> of<00:01:02.859> me<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.309> first<00:01:03.339> thing<00:01:03.579> you<00:01:03.729> say

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
in front of me the first thing you say

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.469 
in front of me the first thing you say
is<00:01:04.920> take<00:01:05.920> off<00:01:06.070> third<00:01:06.340> of<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.549> deck<00:01:06.729> so<00:01:07.330> let's

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
is take off third of the deck so let's

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.630 
is take off third of the deck so let's
just<00:01:07.630> say<00:01:07.720> they<00:01:07.869> take<00:01:08.080> off<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.320> third<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
just say they take off the third and

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.340 
just say they take off the third and
then<00:01:09.700> we<00:01:09.820> put<00:01:09.970> that<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.180> one<00:01:10.299> side<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:11.170> then

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
then we put that to one side and then

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.440 
then we put that to one side and then
you<00:01:11.920> just<00:01:12.340> leave<00:01:12.520> them<00:01:12.700> alone<00:01:12.940> for<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.149> second

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
you just leave them alone for a second

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.570 
you just leave them alone for a second
and<00:01:13.750> then<00:01:13.810> you<00:01:13.990> offer<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.350> spectator<00:01:14.770> card<00:01:15.130> of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
and then you offer the spectator card of

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.270 
and then you offer the spectator card of
these<00:01:16.319> so<00:01:17.319> it<00:01:17.440> could<00:01:17.500> be<00:01:17.560> any<00:01:17.710> card<00:01:17.950> there's<00:01:18.159> no

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
these so it could be any card there's no

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.620 
these so it could be any card there's no
force<00:01:18.549> involved<00:01:19.030> so<00:01:19.119> let's<00:01:19.270> just<00:01:19.390> say<00:01:19.479> they

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
force involved so let's just say they

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.340 
force involved so let's just say they
pick<00:01:19.810> that<00:01:19.990> one<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:21.159> four<00:01:21.490> clubs<00:01:21.869> okay<00:01:22.869> and<00:01:23.229> as

and you ask them to deal them into a
pale<00:02:05.869> face<00:02:06.140> down<00:02:06.650> okay<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.729> now<00:02:07.909> there's<00:02:08.149> a

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
pale face down okay and now there's a

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.389 
pale face down okay and now there's a
little<00:02:08.390> trick<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.810> this<00:02:08.899> fit<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.200> eye<00:02:09.399> you

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
little trick to this fit the eye you

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.340 
little trick to this fit the eye you
have<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.819> you<00:02:11.480> have<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.660> remember<00:02:11.900> which<00:02:12.170> is

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
have to you have to remember which is

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.480 
have to you have to remember which is
one<00:02:12.530> which<00:02:12.709> ones<00:02:12.920> are<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.100> eight<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.400> which

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
one which ones are the eight and which

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.670 
one which ones are the eight and which
ones<00:02:13.700> are<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:13.910> nines<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:15.200> know<00:02:15.380> that<00:02:15.560> the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
ones are the nines and you know that the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.410 
ones are the nines and you know that the
answer<00:02:15.950> on<00:02:16.069> top<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.760> know<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.030> first<00:02:17.180> one

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
answer on top so you know the first one

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.970 
answer on top so you know the first one
down<00:02:17.569> is<00:02:17.780> an<00:02:17.870> eight<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.530> this<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.709> where<00:02:18.950> I

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
down is an eight and this is where I

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.809 
down is an eight and this is where I
remember<00:02:19.340> this<00:02:19.430> okay<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:22.430> ACE<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.580> then

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
remember this okay so the ACE and then

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.780 
remember this okay so the ACE and then
Ali<00:02:23.000> yours<00:02:23.360> ok<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:24.110> in<00:02:24.739> your<00:02:24.980> head<00:02:25.190> as<00:02:25.430> they're
