what<00:00:51.230> makes<00:00:51.410> it<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.800> mainly<00:00:52.550> controlled<00:00:52.940> and

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
what makes it the mainly controlled and

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.060 
what makes it the mainly controlled and
maneuverable<00:00:53.629> is<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.079> combination<00:00:54.800> of<00:00:54.829> a

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
maneuverable is the combination of a

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.979 
maneuverable is the combination of a
soft<00:00:55.340> inner<00:00:55.489> boot<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:55.940> molded<00:00:56.750> hard

shell<00:00:57.230> on<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.410> outside<00:00:57.469> this<00:00:58.340> keeps<00:00:58.579> your

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
shell on the outside this keeps your

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.729 
shell on the outside this keeps your
foot<00:00:59.120> from<00:00:59.449> shifting<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:00.260> stretching<00:01:00.649> the

foot from shifting and stretching the

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.799 
foot from shifting and stretching the
material<00:01:01.160> enables<00:01:01.760> you<00:01:02.000> to<00:01:02.059> keep<00:01:02.239> good<00:01:02.510> feel

and<00:01:03.050> response<00:01:03.410> from<00:01:03.559> your<00:01:03.679> skate<00:01:03.949> it<00:01:04.820> also<00:01:04.940> has

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
and response from your skate it also has

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.120 
and response from your skate it also has
a<00:01:05.210> buckle<00:01:05.480> up<00:01:05.660> on<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.870> cuff<00:01:06.050> area<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.530> instead

the<00:01:26.300> liner<00:01:26.510> the<00:01:26.780> liner<00:01:27.410> is<00:01:27.680> actually<00:01:28.070> also

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
the liner the liner is actually also

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.480 
the liner the liner is actually also
form-fitting<00:01:29.660> and<00:01:29.720> has<00:01:29.870> memory<00:01:30.230> foam<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:31.340> this

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
form-fitting and has memory foam so this

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.490 
form-fitting and has memory foam so this
enables<00:01:32.150> that<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.570> remember<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.050> foot<00:01:33.230> shape

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
enables that to remember the foot shape

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.050 
enables that to remember the foot shape
and<00:01:33.740> eliminate<00:01:34.370> all<00:01:34.490> those<00:01:34.640> pressure<00:01:34.910> points

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
and eliminate all those pressure points

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.120 
and eliminate all those pressure points
that<00:01:35.360> may<00:01:35.600> occur<00:01:36.520> underneath<00:01:37.520> we<00:01:38.180> have<00:01:38.480> the

that may occur underneath we have the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.190 
that may occur underneath we have the

and<00:01:49.670> maneuverability<00:01:50.540> they<00:01:51.380> also<00:01:51.530> started

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
and maneuverability they also started

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.530 
and maneuverability they also started
using<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.310> low<00:01:52.550> balance<00:01:52.760> frame<00:01:53.120> which<00:01:53.270> keeps
