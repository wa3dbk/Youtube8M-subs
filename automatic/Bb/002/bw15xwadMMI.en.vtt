00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.550
 beauty and power of the bmw s1000rr are 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.949
 undisputed 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.720
 but what is most surprising is the ease 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.900
 to drive in low and medium 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.810
 rotations without gagging or talking 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.119
 common in all- sport models 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.969
 technological apparatus allows the extraction or 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.610
 maximum performance with safety 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.739
 in a few seconds but also run in 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.590
 low speeds when operating 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.399
 smooth straight even in marches 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.010
 high 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.469
 this makes it easy to drive 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.140
 super sports in urban traffic and 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.899
 allows you to accept s 1000 rr for 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.129
 different types of flooring and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.840
 skills of every pilot of 2012 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.390
 model gained new torque curve 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.520
 making the delivery of power more linear 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.780
 and harmonious since the low and medium 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.240
 rotations 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.450
 besides the new mapping of the motor that the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.100
 The most responsive accelerator response is 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.560
 equipped with four-cylinder engine 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.530
 in line of 999 destined to s 1000 rr 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.670
 reaches 193 horsepower 13 thousand 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.250
 revolutions per minute and the maximum torque of 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.869
 11.42 schedule force per meter and already 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.970
 nine thousand 750 manager turns 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.150
 makes all the communication between the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.610
 control power traction and the br 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.340
 the emotion and leads when starting in river 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.479
 hot go 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.479
 diego tardelli 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.240
 the module in the power delivery 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.030
 limited in only 163 horses 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.490
 the abs of the three becomes more sensitive to 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.200
 drive and traction control between 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.530
 in action with lower angle of inclination 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.080
 the bike is ideal for getting to know 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.950
 Pilot bike features 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.040
 beginners rain and slippery and even 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.920
 on winding road rides a 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.739
 point above the bike enters the sport mode 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.680
 with the delivery of all the power of the 193 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.010
 horses but with enough interference 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.400
 of abs and traction control called king 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.069
 becomes a sporty trip where the ps 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.720
 has a delayed drive and allows 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:42.600
 large slopes to the slopes yet 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.510
 there is wisnik where you can 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.870
 competition and virtually shut down all 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.170
 electronic device on the road bmw 1000 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.109
 sr is a safe death who loves long 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.820
 but is also very competent and 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.880
 Guilty passages 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.730
 the answers are quick to the commands of the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.630
 steering damper throttle has 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.459
 ten levels that pass safety 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.680
 the six-speed gearbox has the 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.079
 gear shift that allows the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.070
 reduction without the need to 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.019
 clutch 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.390
 this reflects in curve outputs with the 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:23.069
 greater engine spin and an impressive 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.829
 delivery makes it weighing 202 pounds with 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.720
 Full tank oil at 1000 rr has one 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.880
 cycling set closing the package 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.130
 giving balance needed 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.590
 the pilot's position is good and has room 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.049
 sufficient to settle and drive in 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.480
 more aggressive positions with the ad 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.970
 in the tank or relaxed with the legs 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.139
 members and the well-defined traits 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.269
 positioned 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.390
 thanks to the other then it does not get so 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.910
 low 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.770
 To the engine, it warms the legs more. 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.450
 it is also demanding too much when 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:03.120
 the bike completely out of its habitat 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:07.830
 natural is firm but not comfortable 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.630
 moreover it is valid to regulate 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.010
 front suspension at the direction of the 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:17.970
 own bmw you use find box 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.430
 the higher the number 56 the suspension will go 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.790
 getting the softer front but flÃ¡via 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.950
 rue in the city so much smaller 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.990
 the numbering is a stiffer front for 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.720
 you get stronger in the corners 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.390
 the front has a stroke of 120 millimeters 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.930
 and 130 at the rear using the 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.340
 single engine and cement 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.830
 the panel has a plethora of 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.660
 information between them an important 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.720
 indicator and can be 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.720
 programmed in the streets and when it is 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.940
 because the modes of driving have the 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.450
 Henri is for silva so you can 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:04.200
 pass a part for a sporty touch 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:10.620
 which is for the city usually track 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:14.360
 hurley se and snipe at your own risk 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.360
 We are going in race mode. 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:26.340
 believe because the abs and the control of 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.340
 infractions are activated marker gave wrong 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:35.650
 he was available in the colors 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.800
 red and black with price suggested by 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.680
 manufacturer of 72 thousand three hundred and 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.850
 tricolor blue and red for being 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.850
 made gangs
