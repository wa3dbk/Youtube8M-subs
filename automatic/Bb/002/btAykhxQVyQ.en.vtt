I'm<00:00:15.870> basically<00:00:16.260> just<00:00:16.380> going<00:00:16.860> to<00:00:17.010> build<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
I'm basically just going to build the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.330 
I'm basically just going to build the
machine<00:00:17.939> so<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:19.110> is<00:00:19.140> post<00:00:19.619> commentary<00:00:20.160> that

machine so this is post commentary that

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.940 
machine so this is post commentary that
I'm<00:00:20.460> doing<00:00:20.730> now<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.210> I've<00:00:21.810> just<00:00:21.840> basically<00:00:22.740> go

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
I'm doing now and I've just basically go

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.350 
I'm doing now and I've just basically go
through<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.220> steps<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.670> done<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.029> build

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
through the steps that I done to build

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.810 
through the steps that I done to build
this<00:00:24.510> machine<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:25.470> haven't<00:00:26.100> included<00:00:26.369> things

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
this machine I haven't included things

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.760 
this machine I haven't included things
like<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.300> Wi-Fi<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.900> stuff<00:00:28.080> because<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.380> don't

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
like the Wi-Fi and stuff because I don't

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.410 
like the Wi-Fi and stuff because I don't
actually<00:00:29.160> need<00:00:29.400> them<00:00:29.610> right<00:00:29.670> now<00:00:30.029> just

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
actually need them right now just

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.540 
actually need them right now just
because<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.529> my<00:00:31.650> audio<00:00:31.980> workstation<00:00:32.460> to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
because this is my audio workstation to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.770 
because this is my audio workstation to
want<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.790> distracted<00:00:33.000> by<00:00:33.210> internet<00:00:33.660> if

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
want to be distracted by internet if

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.900 
want to be distracted by internet if
possible<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.770> i'll<00:00:35.190> add<00:00:35.370> stuff<00:00:35.699> like<00:00:35.879> that

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
possible but i'll add stuff like that

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.640 
possible but i'll add stuff like that
mean<00:00:36.180> later<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:36.900> not<00:00:37.110> really<00:00:37.290> important

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
mean later it's not really important

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.180 
mean later it's not really important
this<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> core<00:00:38.340> components<00:00:43.190> so

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
this is just the core components so

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.830 
this is just the core components so
first<00:00:44.550> off<00:00:44.730> you'll<00:00:44.940> see<00:00:45.090> me<00:00:45.210> installed<00:00:45.630> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
first off you'll see me installed the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.900 
first off you'll see me installed the
power<00:00:46.110> supply<00:00:46.290> unit<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.770> apologize<00:00:47.340> flee<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
power supply unit I apologize flee the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.600 
power supply unit I apologize flee the
net<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.420> naf<00:00:48.630> camera<00:00:49.110> angle<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.489> was

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
net the naf camera angle because it was

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.100 
net the naf camera angle because it was
actually<00:00:50.850> balancing<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:51.570> chair<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.870> it

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
actually balancing on my chair and it

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.600 
actually balancing on my chair and it
just<00:00:52.290> kind<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.530> lost<00:00:52.710> its<00:00:52.920> balance<00:00:53.040> tilted

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
just kind of lost its balance tilted

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.130 
just kind of lost its balance tilted
upwards<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.120> couldn't<00:00:54.450> actually<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.780> me

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
upwards so you couldn't actually see me

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.430 
upwards so you couldn't actually see me
install<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:55.950> power<00:00:56.250> supply<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.960> fairly

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
install the power supply but it's fairly

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.529 
install the power supply but it's fairly
easy<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.860> install<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.430> place<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.270> on

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539

power<00:01:05.520> supply<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.060> modular<00:01:06.630> which<00:01:06.840> makes<00:01:07.080> it

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
power supply is modular which makes it

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.440 
power supply is modular which makes it
so<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.190> much<00:01:08.340> easier<00:01:08.550> to<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.030> tidy<00:01:09.240> up

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
so so so much easier to just tidy up

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.480 
so so so much easier to just tidy up
you'll<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.350> me<00:01:10.440> just<00:01:10.619> pull<00:01:10.979> all<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.160> cables

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you'll see me just pull all the cables

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.100 
you'll see me just pull all the cables
through<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.759> back<00:01:11.940> as<00:01:12.119> well<00:01:12.149> and<00:01:12.660> just<00:01:12.899> make

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110

I<00:01:47.849> didn't<00:01:48.060> actually<00:01:48.149> need<00:01:48.539> it<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.110> like

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
I didn't actually need it but just like

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.710 
I didn't actually need it but just like
what<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.590> earth<00:01:49.709> is<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:51.090> yeah<00:01:51.360> that's<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
what on earth is this so yeah that's the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.160 
what on earth is this so yeah that's the
unboxing<00:01:52.319> of<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> motherboard<00:01:53.929> so<00:01:54.929> I<00:01:54.959> just

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
unboxing of the motherboard so I just

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.479 
unboxing of the motherboard so I just
move<00:01:55.289> it<00:01:55.380> over<00:01:55.440> take<00:01:55.709> a<00:01:55.770> look<00:01:55.860> take<00:01:56.160> out<00:01:56.369> of

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:56.489 
move it over take a look take out of

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:00.610 
move it over take a look take out of
this<00:01:56.580> packaging

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.270 

got<00:02:01.620> my<00:02:01.740> trusty<00:02:02.040> knife<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.580> me<00:02:03.980> you<00:02:04.980> always

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
got my trusty knife with me you always

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.470 
got my trusty knife with me you always
want<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:05.580> careful<00:02:05.760> when<00:02:06.030> taking<00:02:06.150> it<00:02:06.360> out<00:02:06.450> of

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
want to be careful when taking it out of

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.210 
want to be careful when taking it out of
the<00:02:06.630> Patrick<00:02:06.780> packaging<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.590> always<00:02:07.830> hold<00:02:08.039> it

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the Patrick packaging I always hold it

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.340 
the Patrick packaging I always hold it
by<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.369> either<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.869> remember<00:02:10.020> but<00:02:10.170> they're

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
by the either I can remember but they're

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.570 
by the either I can remember but they're
cool<00:02:10.530> they're<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.830> heat<00:02:11.039> sinks<00:02:11.310> or<00:02:11.400> chip

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
cool they're like heat sinks or chip

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.870 
cool they're like heat sinks or chip
sets<00:02:11.790> or<00:02:11.940> something<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.990> above<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.380> CPU<00:02:14.130> so

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
sets or something just above the CPU so

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.340 
sets or something just above the CPU so
I<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.330> always<00:02:15.540> hold<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.930> by<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.170> because

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
I just always hold it by that because

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.840 
I just always hold it by that because
it's<00:02:16.620> one<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.860> most<00:02:16.950> secure<00:02:17.250> places<00:02:17.550> and

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
it's one of the most secure places and

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.550 
it's one of the most secure places and
it's<00:02:17.970> not<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.420> know<00:02:18.450> covetable<00:02:18.870> silicon<00:02:19.320> so

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
it's not you know covetable silicon so

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.320 
it's not you know covetable silicon so
just<00:02:19.830> be<00:02:19.950> very<00:02:19.980> very<00:02:20.220> very<00:02:20.610> careful<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
just be very very very careful and

it'll<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:29.220> could<00:02:29.490> damage<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.970> because<00:02:30.240> you'll

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
it'll it could damage it because you'll

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.150 
it'll it could damage it because you'll

you<00:02:38.280> don't<00:02:38.430> want<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.610> put<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.940> wrong

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
you don't want to put it in the wrong

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.520 
you don't want to put it in the wrong
way<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.480> won't<00:02:39.600> let<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.989> put<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.410> wrong

way it won't let you put it in the wrong
way<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.070> wanted<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.280> guide<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.120> in

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
way but I just wanted to guide it in

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.910 
way but I just wanted to guide it in
make<00:02:42.360> sure<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.660> all<00:02:42.720> fits<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:43.110> there<00:02:43.290> just<00:02:43.650> fine

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
make sure it all fits in there just fine

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.310 
make sure it all fits in there just fine
and<00:02:44.220> don't<00:02:44.820> be<00:02:44.970> gentle<00:02:45.209> with<00:02:45.480> them<00:02:45.690> put<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.260> the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
and don't be gentle with them put in the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.660 
and don't be gentle with them put in the
clamp<00:02:46.560> down<00:02:46.680> because<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.190> quite<00:02:47.400> stiff

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
clamp down because it is quite stiff

clamp down because it is quite stiff
thing<00:02:47.880> it's<00:02:48.030> got<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.209> hold<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.420> in<00:02:48.540> place<00:02:48.570> so

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
thing it's got to hold it in place so

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.870 
thing it's got to hold it in place so
just<00:02:49.260> really<00:02:49.800> push<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.250> down<00:02:50.370> there<00:02:50.610> make<00:02:50.850> sure

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
just really push it down there make sure

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.830 
just really push it down there make sure
you<00:02:51.060> can<00:02:51.209> get<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.480> wedged<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:53.390> moving<00:02:54.390> on<00:02:54.630> to

you can get it wedged in moving on to

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
comes with it's really good it's exactly

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.130 
comes with it's really good it's exactly
the<00:02:59.370> same<00:02:59.580> or<00:02:59.880> very<00:02:59.910> very<00:03:00.480> similar<00:03:00.750> at<00:03:00.959> least

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
to the last generation well they done it

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.750

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
so you don't need to do anything with

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.590 
so you don't need to do anything with
that<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:07.950> just<00:03:08.160> put<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.760> on<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.090> then<00:03:09.150> you're

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
that you just put it on and then you're

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.800 
that you just put it on and then you're
set<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.840> go<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:12.090> here<00:03:12.239> I<00:03:12.269> am<00:03:12.360> putting<00:03:12.630> the

set to go so here I am putting the
backplate<00:03:13.260> on<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.799> fiddling<00:03:14.220> around<00:03:14.310> with

fiddling about sorry with the fan and at
that<00:03:20.100> point<00:03:20.340> as<00:03:20.549> well<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:21.180> couldn't<00:03:21.810> really

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
that point as well I couldn't really

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.740 
that point as well I couldn't really
screw<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.730> risers<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.209> your

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
screw in the the risers so your

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.199 
screw in the the risers so your
motherboard<00:03:25.200> or<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.950> case<00:03:26.190> sorry<00:03:26.640> comes<00:03:27.000> with

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
motherboard or the case sorry comes with

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.090 
motherboard or the case sorry comes with
Rises<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.870> separate<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.320> motherboard<00:03:28.739> from

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
Rises that separate the motherboard from

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.640 
Rises that separate the motherboard from
the<00:03:29.160> case<00:03:29.790> itself<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:30.570> metal<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.080> not<00:03:31.260> touching

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
the case itself so metal is not touching

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.890 
the case itself so metal is not touching
like<00:03:31.830> metal<00:03:32.280> directly<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.180> stuff<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:33.870> just

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
like metal directly and stuff so just

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.660 
like metal directly and stuff so just
make<00:03:34.290> sure<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.500> put<00:03:34.680> them<00:03:34.799> on<00:03:34.830> correctly<00:03:35.459> in

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
make sure you put them on correctly in

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.940 
make sure you put them on correctly in
this<00:03:35.880> case<00:03:36.140> it's<00:03:37.140> got<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.500> nice<00:03:37.650> little

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
this case it's got the nice little

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.110 
this case it's got the nice little
guides<00:03:38.160> where<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.430> put<00:03:38.610> them<00:03:38.760> but<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.000> took

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
guides where you put them but I took

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.420 
guides where you put them but I took
kind<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.170> I've<00:03:40.530> done<00:03:40.680> this<00:03:40.799> off-camera<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.370> I

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
kind of I've done this off-camera and I

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.479 
kind of I've done this off-camera and I
just<00:03:41.670> screwed<00:03:41.850> them<00:03:42.030> all<00:03:42.150> in<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:43.410> down<00:03:43.680> and

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
just screwed them all in that down and

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.710 
just screwed them all in that down and
then<00:03:44.670> attach<00:03:44.910> my<00:03:45.060> motherboard<00:03:45.480> it's<00:03:45.600> not

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
then attach my motherboard it's not

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.240 
then attach my motherboard it's not
really<00:03:45.930> hard<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.170> do<00:03:46.320> just<00:03:46.590> make<00:03:46.709> sure<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:47.010> fits

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
really hard to do just make sure it fits

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.280 
really hard to do just make sure it fits
in<00:03:47.579> nice<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:47.790> snuggly<00:03:48.360> at<00:03:48.780> this<00:03:48.959> point<00:03:49.140> as

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
in nice and snuggly at this point as

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.890 
in nice and snuggly at this point as
well<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.470> didn't<00:03:49.860> need<00:03:49.980> this<00:03:50.190> extra<00:03:50.519> Bay<00:03:50.790> in<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
well I didn't need this extra Bay in the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.420 
well I didn't need this extra Bay in the
middle<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.230> my<00:03:52.410> case<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:52.799> I<00:03:52.829> decided<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.280> take

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
middle of my case so I decided to take

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.460 
middle of my case so I decided to take
out<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:54.000> can<00:03:54.239> always<00:03:54.420> put<00:03:54.570> it<00:03:54.600> back<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:54.989> if<00:03:55.230> I

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
out I can always put it back in if I

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.440 
out I can always put it back in if I
ever<00:03:55.890> expanding<00:03:56.310> eat<00:03:56.610> more<00:03:56.790> hard<00:03:57.000> drives<00:03:57.090> or

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
ever expanding eat more hard drives or

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.819 
ever expanding eat more hard drives or
anything<00:03:57.810> off<00:03:57.900> anything<00:03:58.200> like<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.470> but<00:03:58.739> at

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
anything off anything like that but at

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.830 
anything off anything like that but at
the<00:03:58.920> moment<00:03:59.040> it's<00:03:59.310> just<00:03:59.549> it's<00:04:00.209> space<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.810> I

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
the moment it's just it's space and I

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.170 
the moment it's just it's space and I
don't<00:04:01.110> really<00:04:01.320> want<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.769> be<00:04:02.100> used<00:04:02.489> up<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:02.760> I

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
don't really want it to be used up so I

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.000 
don't really want it to be used up so I
took<00:04:03.420> it<00:04:03.660> out<00:04:03.750> now<00:04:04.200> there's<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.500> nice<00:04:04.680> kind<00:04:04.890> of

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
took it out now there's a nice kind of

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.350 
took it out now there's a nice kind of
clean<00:04:05.280> window<00:04:05.670> straight<00:04:06.000> through<00:04:06.239> the

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
clean window straight through the

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.319 
clean window straight through the
computer<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:07.280> now<00:04:08.280> we're<00:04:08.400> about<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.760> install

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
computer and now we're about to install

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.900 
computer and now we're about to install
the<00:04:09.660> SSD<00:04:10.290> Drive<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:10.799> take<00:04:11.130> out<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.489> bay

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
the SSD Drive so take out the bay

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.490 
the SSD Drive so take out the bay
and<00:04:12.510> of<00:04:13.290> course<00:04:13.320> unpack<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.010> SSD<00:04:18.500> it's

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
and of course unpack the SSD it's

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.900 
and of course unpack the SSD it's
remarkably<00:04:20.010> simple<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.489> install<00:04:20.580> you<00:04:20.880> just

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
remarkably simple to install you just

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.150 
remarkably simple to install you just
screw<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.420> in<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.780> then<00:04:22.049> plop<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.650> in<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.070> then

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
screw it in and then plop it in and then

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.130 
screw it in and then plop it in and then
for<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.790> rest<00:04:24.000> of<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.330> video<00:04:24.660> it's<00:04:24.840> mostly

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
for the rest of the video it's mostly

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.570 
for the rest of the video it's mostly
just<00:04:25.350> dealing<00:04:25.650> with<00:04:25.680> cables<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.310> have<00:04:26.490> to

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
just dealing with cables so you have to

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.070 
just dealing with cables so you have to
be<00:04:26.640> very<00:04:26.670> very<00:04:26.940> careful<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.570> putting<00:04:27.780> the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
be very very careful and putting the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.470 
be very very careful and putting the
computer<00:04:28.670> computer<00:04:29.670> together<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:30.240> I'm<00:04:30.330> going

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
computer computer together so I'm going

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.820 
computer computer together so I'm going
to<00:04:30.510> fast-forward<00:04:30.810> through<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.260> lot<00:04:31.530> of<00:04:31.650> this

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
to fast-forward through a lot of this

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.440 
to fast-forward through a lot of this
it's<00:04:32.370> gonna<00:04:32.520> be<00:04:32.670> this<00:04:32.880> is<00:04:33.000> going<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.180> be<00:04:33.270> quite

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
it's gonna be this is going to be quite

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.450 
it's gonna be this is going to be quite
a<00:04:33.480> quick<00:04:33.720> video<00:04:33.900> because<00:04:34.380> you<00:04:35.340> know

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
a quick video because you know

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.860 
a quick video because you know
installing<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:36.030> big<00:04:36.180> parts<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.540> doesn't<00:04:36.750> take

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
installing the big parts it doesn't take

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.200 
installing the big parts it doesn't take
a<00:04:36.900> lot<00:04:37.230> of<00:04:37.290> time<00:04:37.410> of<00:04:38.160> course<00:04:38.430> if<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.700> have<00:04:38.940> a

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
a lot of time of course if you have a

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.970 
a lot of time of course if you have a
graphics<00:04:39.690> card<00:04:39.780> you'll<00:04:40.170> see<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.410> orange<00:04:40.680> slot

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
graphics card you'll see the orange slot

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.830 
graphics card you'll see the orange slot
say<00:04:41.190> you<00:04:41.250> just<00:04:41.670> put<00:04:42.150> them<00:04:42.270> in<00:04:42.390> there<00:04:42.570> of<00:04:42.690> course

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
say you just put them in there of course

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.810 
say you just put them in there of course
take<00:04:43.050> out<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.950> protective<00:04:44.340> covering<00:04:44.670> for

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
take out the the protective covering for

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.390 
take out the the protective covering for
the<00:04:44.880> back<00:04:45.060> just<00:04:46.050> basically<00:04:46.920> put<00:04:47.220> whatever

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
the back just basically put whatever

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.190 
the back just basically put whatever
slots<00:04:47.790> you've<00:04:47.940> got<00:04:48.210> in<00:04:48.390> there<00:04:48.660> it's<00:04:48.870> really

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
slots you've got in there it's really

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.530 
slots you've got in there it's really
really<00:04:49.500> easy<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.820> can<00:04:50.850> see<00:04:51.060> already<00:04:51.240> is

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
really easy and you can see already is

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.720 
really easy and you can see already is
it's<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.960> lot<00:04:52.110> tidier<00:04:52.350> than<00:04:52.590> what<00:04:52.860> my<00:04:53.010> actual

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
it's a lot tidier than what my actual

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.550 
it's a lot tidier than what my actual
gaming<00:04:54.030> PC<00:04:54.360> was<00:04:54.570> I<00:04:54.810> don't<00:04:55.200> know<00:04:55.320> if<00:04:55.410> have<00:04:55.530> a

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
gaming PC was I don't know if have a
