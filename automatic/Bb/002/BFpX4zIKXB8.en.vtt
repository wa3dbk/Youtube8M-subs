00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.420 

okay<00:03:30.540> very<00:03:30.780> good<00:03:30.900> now<00:03:31.590> once<00:03:31.830> you've<00:03:32.010> done<00:03:32.040> the

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
okay very good now once you've done the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.250 
okay very good now once you've done the
her<00:03:32.550> I<00:03:32.700> want<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.120> go<00:03:33.240> back<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.810> second

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
her I want you to go back to the second

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.430 
her I want you to go back to the second
string<00:03:34.560> with<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.920> middle<00:03:35.220> finger<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.450> then

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
string with the middle finger and then

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.699 
string with the middle finger and then
the<00:03:37.590> third<00:03:37.830> string<00:03:38.220> with<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.760> first<00:03:38.790> finger

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
the third string with the first finger

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.470 
the third string with the first finger
so<00:03:40.709> if<00:03:40.980> we<00:03:41.130> join<00:03:41.340> those<00:03:41.520> notes<00:03:41.819> on<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.150> end<00:03:42.300> it

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
so if we join those notes on the end it

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.380 
so if we join those notes on the end it
should<00:03:42.660> sound<00:03:42.870> like<00:03:43.050> this

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.210 

okay<00:03:48.390> now<00:03:48.810> what<00:03:48.990> happens<00:03:49.380> is<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.709> can<00:03:49.740> repeat

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
okay now what happens is you can repeat

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.100 
okay now what happens is you can repeat
that<00:03:50.250> over<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:51.000> over<00:03:51.120> again<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.870> joins

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
that over and over again and it joins

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.480 
that over and over again and it joins
together<00:03:52.410> perfectly<00:03:53.130> like<00:03:53.370> this

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.730 

you

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.890 

okay<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:03.850> you<00:04:03.910> can<00:04:04.030> see<00:04:04.270> that<00:04:04.450> that<00:04:04.540> sounds

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
okay and you can see that that sounds

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.650 
okay and you can see that that sounds
really<00:04:05.290> nice<00:04:05.440> now<00:04:06.070> I<00:04:06.100> suggest<00:04:06.520> you<00:04:06.940> can<00:04:07.150> change

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
really nice now I suggest you can change

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.080 
really nice now I suggest you can change
their<00:04:07.930> different<00:04:08.260> cords<00:04:08.620> for<00:04:09.520> example<00:04:09.910> if<00:04:10.000> we

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
their different cords for example if we

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.760 
their different cords for example if we
went<00:04:10.270> to<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.510> G<00:04:10.690> chord<00:04:10.960> and<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.440> course<00:04:11.620> you

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
went to the G chord and of course you

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.260 
went to the G chord and of course you
already<00:04:11.860> know<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.340> G<00:04:12.490> chord<00:04:12.730> because<00:04:12.970> we

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
already know the G chord because we

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.520 
already know the G chord because we
learned<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:13.630> in<00:04:13.810> one<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.110> previous

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
learned that in one of the previous

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.820 
learned that in one of the previous
segments<00:04:15.040> but<00:04:15.790> just<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.180> refresh<00:04:16.510> your<00:04:16.750> memory

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
segments but just to refresh your memory

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.990 
segments but just to refresh your memory
middle<00:04:17.830> finger<00:04:18.130> on<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.280> sixth<00:04:18.730> string<00:04:18.880> at

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
on the second string at fret three

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.390 
on the second string at fret three
little<00:04:26.140> finger<00:04:26.530> on<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.680> first<00:04:26.980> string<00:04:27.070> of

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
little finger on the first string of

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.430 
little finger on the first string of
fret<00:04:27.610> three<00:04:27.910> okay<00:04:28.450> you<00:04:28.810> can<00:04:28.990> pause<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.320> video

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
fret three okay you can pause the video

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.320 
fret three okay you can pause the video
if<00:04:29.650> you<00:04:29.800> just<00:04:30.010> need<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.340> check<00:04:30.550> that<00:04:30.790> now

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
if you just need to check that now

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.540 
if you just need to check that now
what's<00:04:31.630> going<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:31.870> happen<00:04:32.290> is<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.950> thumb<00:04:33.310> is

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
what's going to happen is the thumb is

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.860 
what's going to happen is the thumb is
now<00:04:33.700> going<00:04:33.880> to<00:04:33.940> put<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.270> sixth<00:04:34.600> string

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
now going to put the sixth string

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.080 
now going to put the sixth string
because<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.920> sum<00:04:36.160> always<00:04:36.460> plucks<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:36.910> root

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
because the sum always plucks the root

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.030 
because the sum always plucks the root
no<00:04:37.270> of<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.600> chord<00:04:37.840> when<00:04:38.260> we<00:04:38.440> were<00:04:38.530> on<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.860> D

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
no of the chord when we were on the D

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.100 
no of the chord when we were on the D
the<00:04:39.310> root<00:04:39.490> no<00:04:39.700> was<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.330> fourth<00:04:40.570> string<00:04:40.870> but

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
the root no was the fourth string but

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.230 
the root no was the fourth string but
now<00:04:41.260> we're<00:04:41.440> on<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.650> G<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.490> root<00:04:42.700> note<00:04:42.910> is<00:04:43.090> the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
now we're on the G the root note is the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.910 
now we're on the G the root note is the
sixth<00:04:43.540> string<00:04:43.780> okay<00:04:44.260> I<00:04:44.290> hope<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.710> makes

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
sixth string okay I hope that makes

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.220 
sixth string okay I hope that makes
sense<00:04:45.220> but<00:04:45.880> these<00:04:46.060> three<00:04:46.360> fingers<00:04:46.600> are<00:04:46.960> still

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
sense but these three fingers are still

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.630 
sense but these three fingers are still
going<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.560> be<00:04:47.680> on<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.890> same<00:04:48.100> strings<00:04:48.460> as

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
going to be on the same strings as

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.640 
going to be on the same strings as
before<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.240> third<00:04:49.450> string<00:04:49.810> second<00:04:50.620> string

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
before the third string second string

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.250 
before the third string second string
and<00:04:51.040> first<00:04:51.370> string<00:04:51.700> so<00:04:52.270> when<00:04:52.510> we<00:04:52.660> apply<00:04:52.780> this

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
and first string so when we apply this

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:01.390 
and first string so when we apply this
picking<00:04:53.650> pattern<00:04:54.010> it'll<00:04:54.310> sound<00:04:54.460> like<00:04:54.580> this

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.600 

right<00:05:02.150> so<00:05:02.780> what<00:05:02.930> I<00:05:02.960> suggest<00:05:03.320> you<00:05:03.380> do<00:05:03.650> is<00:05:03.889> to<00:05:04.160> do

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
right so what I suggest you do is to do

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.700 
right so what I suggest you do is to do
that<00:05:04.760> picking<00:05:05.210> pattern<00:05:05.570> twice<00:05:05.810> on<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.199> D<00:05:06.380> and

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
that picking pattern twice on the D and

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.920 
that picking pattern twice on the D and
then<00:05:07.280> twice<00:05:07.550> on<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:07.850> G<00:05:08.030> so<00:05:08.479> it<00:05:08.570> should<00:05:08.720> sound

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
then twice on the G so it should sound

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:18.170 
then twice on the G so it should sound
like<00:05:09.020> this

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:31.340 

and<00:05:19.180> then<00:05:19.330> you<00:05:19.450> can<00:05:19.630> do<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:19.900> again

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.920 

okay<00:05:32.220> I<00:05:32.250> think<00:05:32.700> you<00:05:32.760> get<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:33.000> idea<00:05:33.120> now<00:05:33.900> I

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
okay I think you get the idea now I

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.320 
okay I think you get the idea now I
suggest<00:05:34.350> you<00:05:34.710> practice<00:05:35.520> that<00:05:35.910> with<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.210> other

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
suggest you practice that with the other

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.030 
suggest you practice that with the other
cords<00:05:36.660> you<00:05:36.720> know<00:05:36.840> as<00:05:36.990> well<00:05:37.140> like<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:37.440> E<00:05:37.650> and

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
cords you know as well like the E and

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.460 
cords you know as well like the E and
the<00:05:38.490> a<00:05:38.670> and<00:05:39.240> if<00:05:39.570> you<00:05:39.600> go<00:05:39.780> on<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.020> archive

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
the a and if you go on the archive

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.170 
the a and if you go on the archive
there's<00:05:40.800> a<00:05:40.860> full<00:05:41.130> length<00:05:41.370> video<00:05:41.550> guitar
