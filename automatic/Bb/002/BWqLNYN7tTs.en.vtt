00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
know when the next episode will be out I

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.670 
know when the next episode will be out I
ended<00:06:29.270> up<00:06:29.330> going<00:06:29.540> with<00:06:29.600> 21-percent<00:06:30.410> attack

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
ended up going with 21-percent attack

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.220 
ended up going with 21-percent attack
just<00:06:30.890> because<00:06:31.250> I<00:06:31.280> can<00:06:31.640> get<00:06:31.850> boss<00:06:32.630> nebu<00:06:33.050> lights

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.230 
just because I can get boss nebu lights

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.659 
just because I can get boss nebu lights
and<00:06:33.470> then<00:06:33.590> there's<00:06:33.770> also<00:06:33.919> a<00:06:34.040> new<00:06:34.190> class<00:06:34.430> coming

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
and then there's also a new class coming

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.840 
and then there's also a new class coming
out<00:06:34.850> that<00:06:35.030> gives<00:06:35.240> us<00:06:35.390> %<00:06:35.780> boss<00:06:36.160> so<00:06:37.160> I<00:06:37.190> figured<00:06:37.250> %

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:37.850 
out that gives us % boss so I figured %

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.790 
out that gives us % boss so I figured %
attack<00:06:38.090> would<00:06:38.240> be<00:06:38.330> better<00:06:38.510> and<00:06:38.840> hopefully<00:06:39.530> it

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
attack would be better and hopefully it

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.350 
attack would be better and hopefully it
is<00:06:39.919> even<00:06:40.190> if<00:06:40.310> it's<00:06:40.460> not<00:06:40.640> I<00:06:40.669> can<00:06:40.940> always<00:06:41.060> just

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
is even if it's not I can always just

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.900 
is even if it's not I can always just
use<00:06:41.540> another<00:06:41.840> black<00:06:42.110> cube<00:06:42.410> and<00:06:42.620> I<00:06:43.580> can<00:06:43.730> save

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
use another black cube and I can save

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.460 
use another black cube and I can save
the<00:06:44.060> potential<00:06:44.540> and<00:06:44.660> hopefully<00:06:45.020> maybe<00:06:45.230> get

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
the potential and hopefully maybe get

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.780 
the potential and hopefully maybe get
something<00:06:45.680> better<00:06:45.890> so<00:06:46.190> who<00:06:46.310> knows<00:06:46.430> what<00:06:46.610> will

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
something better so who knows what will

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.950 
something better so who knows what will
happen<00:06:46.820> but<00:06:47.270> for<00:06:47.480> now<00:06:47.540> I'm<00:06:47.630> going<00:06:47.660> to<00:06:47.810> keep

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
happen but for now I'm going to keep

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.080 
happen but for now I'm going to keep
that<00:06:48.140> and<00:06:48.380> we're<00:06:49.160> so<00:06:49.310> much<00:06:49.490> closer<00:06:49.700> to<00:06:49.850> plan

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
that and we're so much closer to plan

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.760 
that and we're so much closer to plan
phantom<00:06:50.450> again<00:06:50.630> I<00:06:50.660> can't<00:06:50.990> wait<00:06:51.169> I<00:06:51.350> just<00:06:51.560> need<00:06:51.680> a
