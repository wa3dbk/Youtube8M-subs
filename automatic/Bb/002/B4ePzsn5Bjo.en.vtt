00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
so here's what it looks like it might

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.770 
so here's what it looks like it might
notice<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.310> reflection<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
notice the reflection there is a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.149 
notice the reflection there is a
reflection<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> glass<00:01:16.530> which<00:01:16.950> some

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
reflection in the glass which some

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.490 
reflection in the glass which some
people<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.490> find<00:01:17.790> annoying<00:01:18.170> but<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.320> only

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
people do find annoying but it's only

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.520 
people do find annoying but it's only
really<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.189> big<00:01:21.060> deal<00:01:21.299> when<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.960> really<00:01:22.320> dark

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
really a big deal when it is really dark

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.230 
really a big deal when it is really dark
outside<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.520> walk<00:01:23.700> straight<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
outside and you walk straight up to the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.460 
outside and you walk straight up to the
glass<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.810> might<00:01:24.960> see<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> reflection

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
glass then you might see a reflection

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.170 
glass then you might see a reflection
but<00:01:25.770> other<00:01:25.950> than<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.670> looks<00:01:26.700> really

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
but other than that it looks really

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.330 
but other than that it looks really
beautiful<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> second<00:01:28.829> windowpane

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
beautiful as for the second windowpane

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.429 
beautiful as for the second windowpane
which<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.880> left<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.479> you

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
which is to the left of that you

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.929 
which is to the left of that you
basically<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> little<00:01:32.549> bit<00:01:32.640> more<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.880> can

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
basically get a little bit more you can

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.550 
basically get a little bit more you can
see<00:01:33.030> Griffith<00:01:33.420> Observatory<00:01:33.479> can't<00:01:34.380> really

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
see Griffith Observatory can't really

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.840 
see Griffith Observatory can't really
see<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> violent<00:01:35.040> sign<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.460> then<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.610> still

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
see the violent sign but then you still

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.580 
see the violent sign but then you still
see<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.180> same<00:01:36.360> houses<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.930> same<00:01:37.110> things<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
see the same houses and same things to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.410 
see the same houses and same things to
the<00:01:37.680> left<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.729> course<00:01:38.790> we're

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the left of that and of course we're

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.880 
the left of that and of course we're
gonna<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> nighttime<00:01:39.900> shot<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.530> again

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
gonna do a nighttime shot of this again

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.830 
gonna do a nighttime shot of this again
so<00:01:41.100> there<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.369> guys<00:01:41.490> go<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.570> said<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
so there you guys go like I said the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.539 
so there you guys go like I said the
reflection<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.470> kind<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.979> obvious<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.460> guys

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
reflection is kind of obvious you guys

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.670 
reflection is kind of obvious you guys
can<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.479> wish<00:01:45.780> Rockstar<00:01:46.229> was<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
can see it I do wish Rockstar was to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.830 
can see it I do wish Rockstar was to
maybe<00:01:47.100> turn<00:01:47.430> off<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.820> reflection<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
maybe turn off this reflection in the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.350 
maybe turn off this reflection in the
glass<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.619> does<00:01:49.799> make<00:01:49.979> sense<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.210> were

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
glass but it does make sense if you were

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.639 
glass but it does make sense if you were
to<00:01:51.479> live<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.750> real<00:01:51.899> life<00:01:52.110> apartment<00:01:52.500> with

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
to live in a real life apartment with

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.130 
to live in a real life apartment with
high<00:01:52.979> glossy<00:01:53.250> windows<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.659> would<00:01:54.810> see<00:01:55.020> that

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
high glossy windows you would see that

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.139 
high glossy windows you would see that
kind<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.409> reflection<00:01:55.740> at<00:01:55.979> night<00:01:56.219> lastly<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
kind of reflection at night lastly the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.270 
kind of reflection at night lastly the
last<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.840> last<00:01:57.869> changes<00:01:58.439> up<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> odd<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.159> this

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
last the last changes up the odd to this

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.859 
last the last changes up the odd to this
apartment<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> bedroom<00:02:00.540> windows
