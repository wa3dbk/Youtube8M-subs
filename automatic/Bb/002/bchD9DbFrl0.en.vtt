physics really just a chance to figure
out<00:00:35.250> how<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.489> think<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.660> our<00:00:36.690> potential

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
out how we think and what our potential

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.530 
out how we think and what our potential
is<00:00:37.380> as<00:00:37.530> scientists<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.129> mathematicians

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
is as scientists and mathematicians

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.600 
is as scientists and mathematicians
what's<00:00:39.540> your<00:00:39.690> project<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.290> did<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.460> my

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
what's your project that you did so my

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.220 
what's your project that you did so my
project<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.090> about<00:00:42.149> colon<00:00:42.780> cancer

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
project is about colon cancer

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.410 
project is about colon cancer
specifically<00:00:43.800> early-stage<00:00:44.309> colon<00:00:44.910> cancer

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
specifically early-stage colon cancer

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.510 
specifically early-stage colon cancer
right<00:00:46.050> now<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> clinic<00:00:46.890> even<00:00:47.190> after<00:00:47.399> we

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
right now in the clinic even after we

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
right now in the clinic even after we
treat<00:00:47.820> patients<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.480> very<00:00:48.690> high<00:00:48.899> percentage<00:00:49.140> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
treat patients a very high percentage of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.680 
treat patients a very high percentage of
them<00:00:49.800> developed<00:00:50.070> cancer<00:00:50.489> again<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.570> we

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
them developed cancer again but we

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.150 
them developed cancer again but we
really<00:00:51.930> don't<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> way<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> tell<00:00:52.800> who's

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
really don't have a way to tell who's

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.400 
really don't have a way to tell who's
most<00:00:53.460> likely<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:54.090> develop<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.660> cancer<00:00:55.199> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
most likely to develop that cancer a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.950 
most likely to develop that cancer a
second<00:00:56.100> time<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> tried<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> go<00:00:57.420> straight<00:00:57.449> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
second time so I tried to go straight to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.900 
second time so I tried to go straight to
the<00:00:57.989> genetics<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.489> could<00:00:59.550> develop

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the genetics and see if I could develop

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.459 
the genetics and see if I could develop
a<00:01:00.149> predictor<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.809> would<00:01:00.930> tell<00:01:01.140> me<00:01:01.260> who's

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
a predictor that would tell me who's

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.860 
a predictor that would tell me who's
most<00:01:01.739> likely<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.190> relapse<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.969> even<00:01:03.600> further

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
most likely to relapse and even further

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.600 
most likely to relapse and even further
how<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.559> treat<00:01:04.769> them<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.460> very

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
how we can treat them so it's very

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.000 
how we can treat them so it's very
individualized<00:01:06.510> therapy<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:07.740> you're

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
individualized therapy because you're

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.740 
individualized therapy because you're
looking<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.400> one<00:01:08.610> individual<00:01:09.210> patient<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
looking at one individual patient and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.179 
looking at one individual patient and
which<00:01:09.900> treatment<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.409> best<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.799> them<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
which treatment is best for them and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.429 
which treatment is best for them and
because<00:01:11.760> we're<00:01:11.909> being<00:01:12.090> proactive<00:01:12.450> we're

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
because we're being proactive we're

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.840 
because we're being proactive we're
shifting<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.860> conversation<00:01:14.520> from

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
shifting the conversation from

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.850 
shifting the conversation from
chemotherapy<00:01:15.270> which<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.960> after<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> fact<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
chemotherapy which is after the fact to

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.060 
chemotherapy which is after the fact to
before<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> fact<00:01:17.850> chemoprevention<00:01:19.070> you're

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
how old Shivani I'm 17 okay you're 17

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.530 
how old Shivani I'm 17 okay you're 17
and<00:01:23.430> we're<00:01:23.670> hearing<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.000> talk<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.210> all

in this field for years how did you get

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.840 
in this field for years how did you get
so<00:01:28.229> much<00:01:28.350> background<00:01:28.619> here<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.369> had<00:01:29.520> what

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
so much background here and had what

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.640 
so much background here and had what
sort<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.450> what<00:01:30.689> made<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.200> involved<00:01:31.409> in

that's<00:01:40.680> what<00:01:40.890> kind<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.159> triggered<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.610> spark<00:01:41.939> in

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
that's what kind of triggered a spark in

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.789

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
me and I know that the doctors helped to

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.830 
me and I know that the doctors helped to
save<00:01:43.950> my<00:01:44.189> family<00:01:44.579> member<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.420> really<00:01:45.720> want

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
save my family member and I really want

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.050 
save my family member and I really want
a<00:01:45.960> chance<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.320> return<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.829> favor<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.700> someone

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
a chance to return that favor to someone

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.520 
a chance to return that favor to someone
else<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.479> they<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.930> pursue<00:01:49.290> their

you<00:02:08.069> will<00:02:08.220> get<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.459> know<00:02:08.550> some<00:02:08.789> some<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.509> think

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
you will get you know some some I think

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.150 
you will get you know some some I think
it's<00:02:09.780> five<00:02:09.929> thousand<00:02:10.319> dollars<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.739> D<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
it's five thousand dollars is D is the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.640 
it's five thousand dollars is D is the
lowest<00:02:11.700> amount<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.300> all

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
lowest amount that so all

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.690 
lowest amount that so all
you<00:02:12.680> come<00:02:12.829> away<00:02:12.950> with<00:02:13.040> some<00:02:13.189> scholarship

as yet I still have two schools to hear
back<00:02:20.540> from<00:02:20.569> so<00:02:21.079> I<00:02:21.110> guess<00:02:21.319> I'll<00:02:21.470> lay<00:02:21.500> out<00:02:21.739> all<00:02:21.769> my

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
back from so I guess I'll lay out all my

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.830 
back from so I guess I'll lay out all my
options<00:02:22.189> and<00:02:22.640> then<00:02:22.790> I'll<00:02:22.879> go<00:02:23.030> from<00:02:23.239> there<00:02:23.450> can

working on so there are a lot of

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.399 
working on so there are a lot of
projects<00:02:35.359> that<00:02:35.420> deal<00:02:35.629> with<00:02:35.780> computer<00:02:36.200> science

there's some other projects that look at
cancer<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:39.079> they're<00:02:39.200> looking<00:02:39.530> at<00:02:39.590> breast

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
cancer and they're looking at breast

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.460 
cancer and they're looking at breast
cancer<00:02:40.150> maybe<00:02:41.150> which<00:02:41.420> chemicals<00:02:42.019> that<00:02:42.319> we

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
cancer maybe which chemicals that we

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.199 
cancer maybe which chemicals that we
actually<00:02:42.680> eat<00:02:43.099> have<00:02:43.430> an<00:02:43.549> impact<00:02:43.879> on<00:02:44.030> those

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
actually eat have an impact on those

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.940 
actually eat have an impact on those
cancers<00:02:44.780> there<00:02:45.470> have<00:02:45.560> been<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.709> lot<00:02:45.799> of

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
cancers there have been a lot of

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.470 
cancers there have been a lot of
computer<00:02:46.400> science<00:02:46.700> problems<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.239> lot<00:02:47.269> of

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
computer science problems a lot of

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.349 
computer science problems a lot of
theoretical<00:02:47.780> math<00:02:48.739> problems<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:49.549> just<00:02:49.909> a<00:02:50.060> wide

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
theoretical math problems so just a wide

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.330 
theoretical math problems so just a wide
variety<00:02:50.629> of<00:02:50.989> science<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.739> so<00:02:51.920> many<00:02:52.129> talented

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
variety of science and so many talented

the same major all they're competing for

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.929 
the same major all they're competing for
the<00:02:57.650> same<00:02:57.799> prize<00:02:58.069> but<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.340> would<00:02:58.459> imagine<00:02:58.549> that

the same prize but I would imagine that

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.069 
the same prize but I would imagine that
it's<00:02:59.209> kind<00:02:59.420> of<00:02:59.450> nice<00:02:59.569> and<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.810> get<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.959> little
