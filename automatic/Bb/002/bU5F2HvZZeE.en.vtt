00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.250
 30th saturday 12 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.120
 olympic stadium of berlin 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.710

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.750

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.090
 the last three games of the two has 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.630
 each hertha with 2 0 for themselves 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.890
 decided 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.219
 in between there was a 0 0 and a 1 0 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.219
 victory of bochum performance technically 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:33.949
 harder currently 71 percent last that 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.579
 draw against the Munich lions 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:40.610
 in front of a 4 2 over duisburg one 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.460
 surprising 1 0 defeat against 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.520
 dresden a 1 0 victory over the louder 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.320
 and 1 0 against ahlen 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.720
 at bochum looks like 29 percent 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.330
 last , last minute the last 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.200
 minute defeat against Brunswick with 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.720

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.489
 that second defeat against 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:09.390
 ingolstadt 1 0 0 against lautern 1 2 0 im 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.990
 dfb pokal lent against Stuttgart 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.440
 respectively 2 0 lost and 2 2 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.520
 against reviernachbarn duisburg the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.190
 direct comparison 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.410
 eleven victories for the ten hertha 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.979
 a draw and six for the bochum 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:30.060
 in tabular form the tenth 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:34.510
 the capital 56 points against number 15 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.500
 the bochum revierklub with 26 points 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:43.360
 Shaping table is harder on the third 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.320
 platz and bochum only 16 days too 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.910
 the scorer i mean what is it about 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.100
 Tor will probably be here 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:55.170
 know who hertha is, of course 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.060
 Ronny 13 goals at eight assists 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.820
 otherwise second frame from nine goals 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.790
 and five more scorers 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:08.410
 allegory no longer so the 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.990
 Zoff with Luca has five goals and 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.920
 left with 4 and sandro wagner as well 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.730
 with four goals 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.070
 when booking best scorer or best 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.280
 both scored the talent leon 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:27.250
 goretzka with 4 david with 433 and 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.750
 Radkovsky believes in the seasonal 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.800
 Pauli changes when I'm at it 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.290
 also very wrong with three goals 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.820
 take a quick look if it is synonymous 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.950
 correct was the change to the first fc 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.160
 st pauli 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.470
 Otherwise, what else to say 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.320
 half of the games of the hertha whopping 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.610
 300 pieces end with more than two and a half 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:57.670
 years at bochum are but then 15 yes 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.500
 and how the tips look like this alone 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.720
 because of the performance and the general 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.300
 trend of the two I'll touch here 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.050
 a 3 0 victory the main of 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.050
 capital clubs
