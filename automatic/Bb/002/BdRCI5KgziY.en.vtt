00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 and the politician does not have to be always 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.600
 Charming here is Putin's speech store 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.580
 the buna of the Valdai club was called tough 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.590
 In general, if you analyze the performance 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.230
 Putin on serious international topics 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.210
 then he has always been a correction for and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.859
 declared the desire to resolve issues 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.510
 by negotiation based on 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.270
 international and arrangements and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.769
 international laws and on friday Putin 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.980
 really stated 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.449
 talk from this position today already 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.119
 almost pointless everything changed 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:37.170
 and outside of Russia and internal too 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:39.329
 changes analysts believe that 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.520
 confrontation between the western coalition 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.280
 Russia led to an increase in Russian 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.690
 hardliners 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.219
 the liberals faded into the background she 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.890
 first representatives came out so 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.120
 called siloviki and honestly it 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.620
 objective process 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.260
 liberals especially included in 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 the government had strong positions as 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.430
 negotiators with major westerners 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.620
 Companies they supported European 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.809
 and American investment in Russia 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.610
 economy and while it worked them 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.760
 political positions were really 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.200
 serious however in conditions when due 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.960
 Western sanctions this investment 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.000
 proved to be covered by political weight 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.890
 liberals began to decline rapidly here 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840
 really pressing questions now 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.270
 Russian security not only 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.979
 economic but also military brought to 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.420
 first positions are those who are 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.180
 directly involved 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.070
 Putin's speech in Sochi at the meeting 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.439
 Valdai club showed Russia 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.860
 we have to mobilize our potential 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.170
 in new conditions threatening us and Putin 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.420
 Signaled west resources for such 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.159
 Russia’s mobilization is and it is firm 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.890
 intend to stick to their sovereign 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.020
 positions although traditionally leaving 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.649
 open their doors to all processes 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.530
 normalization of relations but not for 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.850
 account of our country and sochi transfers Victor 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.560
 bruise it was the toughest critic of us 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.610
 over the past few years, states 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.100
 invade sovereign states 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.810
 states finance extremist regimes 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.790
 and terrorists support color 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.439
 coup and worldwide listeners 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.239
 Putin's foreign experts are noticeable 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.129
 worried overseas media already on 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.290
 the next day they started talking about the possible 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.610
 the beginning of the third world war she certainly 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.530
 may be cold or 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.540
 economic but especially for those who 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.670
 may forgot Vladimir Putin reminds 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.379
 we will protect our interests 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.989
 as recently joined territories 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.270
 there is certainly a speech about the Crimea which 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.400
 the president will skew remember this 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.250
 wonderful phrase what's allowed 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.420
 jupiter is not allowed to bull nd we cannot 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.090
 agree with such with 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.550
 wording means maybe baku and 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.240
 not allowed but i want to tell you that 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.270
 no one has a bear 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:48.980
 he won't ask permission at all 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:52.190
 we are considered the master of taiga and he is not 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.690
 going and I know it for sure somewhere 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.420
 move to other climatic zones 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.400
 he is uncomfortable there but he is his taiga anyone 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.800
 will not give up I think it should be 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.270
 understandable now in essence is also global 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.160
 the problem is that in the forty-fifth year 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.960
 of the last century but then on Yalta 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.820
 winning country conferences 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.980
 gathered agreed on the rules 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.020
 world politics hour instead of the system 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.300
 checks and balances are only 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.980
 views and interests of the united states 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.650
 the Russian president sees this 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.440
 the threat of stability around the world let's 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.970
 let us ask how much we all 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.570
 comfortably safe pleasant to live in such 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.080
 the world 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.610
 how fair and rational 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.750
 maybe we have no valid reason 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.360
 worry argue ask uncomfortable 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.420
 questions may be exclusivity 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.100
 the united states how they implement 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.590
 your leadership is really good 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:51.580
 for all and their ubiquitous intervention 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.260
 in all things in the world brings peace 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.020
 prosperity progress prosperity 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.490
 democracy just needs everyone like ours 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.150
 burns relax and get 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.880
 pleasure let me say that 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.010
 it is not so why for its essence 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.750
 the keynote speech the president chose 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.970
 this event Valdai club exists 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.530
 many years but such a resonance for the first time 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.330
 Analysts believe that it is a matter of 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.280
 patriotic bias of the event 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.410
 which power most recently 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.080
 claimed at the very place of performance 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.600
 President Sochi Red Glade, too 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.490
 plays a big role in sochi for vladimir 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.080
 Putin's special place here he holds 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.970
 important state meetings here 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.530
 there was an olympiad here even mountains 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.060
 help can be therefore speech on 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.980
 Valdai club was so 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.990
 bright that and now put on a par with 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.640
 other famous performances 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.470
 the Russian president he is not yet 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.050
 finished talking about many already won 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.250
 Putin’s Munich speech in notebooks 2 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.110
 really similar 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.620
 Russian president once again suggested 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.930
 usa get rid of there 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.729
 superpowers for the benefit of the world 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.449
 only this time it turned out much 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.000
 tougher 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.570
 then in 2007 the words of Vladimir Putin all 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.490
 surprised 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.919
 they were remembered but principled here 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.300
 moment of russia and usa rivals in 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.600
 geopolitics but not enemies 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.880
 I did not say that the United States represent for 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.470
 we are a threat 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.650
 here is president obama as you said 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:14.100
 I think Russia is a threat I don’t think that 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:18.680
 usa is a threat to us i think 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:23.389
 what is the policy of the ruling circles like 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:26.000
 I'm sorry I will use such a stamp 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:32.600
 government policy of the ruling circles 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.139
 she is mistaken sure she 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.130
 contrary to 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:41.510
 and our interests are undermined by trust 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.199
 emergency states and in that sense 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.229
 applied to the united states 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:48.479
 certain damage 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:51.120
 undermines confidence in them as one of 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.370
 global leaders both in economics and in 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.110
 Politics Ukrainian crisis that we 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.090
 Vladimir Putin has paid much less 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.800
 attention than the audience expected it 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.840
 one example of the mistakes of the ruling 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.490
 american elite what will it be country 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.320
 further incomprehensible Russia which 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.000
 the creation of political and political in Ukraine 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.289
 economic chaos is not to blame 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.210
 imposed sanctions 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.070
 now they are bad for all parties 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.690
 conflict from this position vladimir 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.650
 Putin agreed almost all 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:18.449
 foreign expert i think sanctions 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.310
 always negatively affect because 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.410
 all parties need trade relations 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.270
 we want Russia to integrate 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.430
 the world economy as much as possible 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.720
 this has been the goal of the west since 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.060
 the Soviet regime collapsed 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.229
 the current situation has alienated us but i 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.210
 I hope that the conflict in Ukraine 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.820
 will be resolved as soon as possible 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.530
 the sanction will be canceled and it seems with a set 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.599
 problems are defined and all believe that 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.970
 order and clear to all rule in the world 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.949
 should be but those leaving the forum 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.960
 participants are more concerned than 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:47.490
 optimism we talked to many of 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.380
 them when they are still cold 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.330
 President and understood with Putin yes 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.240
 many experts questions agree but 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.849
 that confidence 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.530
 This Sasha will hear him at all 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:59.410
 here is the big problem of our world order 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.910
 crumbling it is created very impromptu 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.949
 nobody controls them 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.069
 tournament order is a huge problem 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:08.349
 she is very explosive in that sense i 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.970
 glad that Putin sees it in this 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:12.340
 situations are very difficult to bend your line 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.020
 while maintaining stern calm on 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.300
 Russia has no other choice 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.130
 live under sanctions insisting upon 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.050
 this sovereign right to pursue 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.449
 their national interests and wait 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.729
 understanding of this position from our western 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:25.990
 no one really wants partners 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:28.419
 to end it 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:31.680
 in a bad way Viktor snow Ignat tugaev 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:31.680
 very frontline
