we'd like to show you one of the most
common<00:00:58.829> patterns<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> mink<00:01:00.000> makes<00:01:00.539> when

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
common patterns that the mink makes when

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.599 
common patterns that the mink makes when
it's<00:01:01.109> moving<00:01:01.320> around<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> landscape<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it's moving around the landscape the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.299 
it's moving around the landscape the
mink<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.660> other<00:01:03.840> weasels<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.920> move<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
mink like other weasels can move in a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
mink like other weasels can move in a
variety<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.820> ways<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.840> walk<00:01:07.080> around<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
variety of ways and it can walk around a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.570 
variety of ways and it can walk around a
landscape<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.310> could<00:01:08.939> bounce<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:10.200> fours<00:01:10.590> but

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
landscape it could bounce and fours but

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.000 
landscape it could bounce and fours but
most<00:01:11.790> commonly<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.510> mink<00:01:12.810> likes<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.770> travel

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
most commonly the mink likes to travel

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.600 
most commonly the mink likes to travel
in<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.640> call<00:01:14.850> 22<00:01:15.420> bounds<00:01:16.110> we're<00:01:16.530> all<00:01:16.920> four

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
in what we call 22 bounds we're all four

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.120 
in what we call 22 bounds we're all four
of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> feet<00:01:18.060> actually<00:01:18.689> land<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.530> almost

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
of the feet actually land in almost

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.210 
of the feet actually land in almost
exact<00:01:20.850> same<00:01:21.479> spot<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:21.990> two<00:01:22.500> feet<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.009> you'll

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
exact same spot as two feet so you'll

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.539 
exact same spot as two feet so you'll
have<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.430> front<00:01:23.880> front<00:01:25.280> hitting<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> ground

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
have a front front hitting the ground

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.719 
have a front front hitting the ground
and<00:01:27.000> then<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.780> hind<00:01:28.020> hind<00:01:28.439> hitting<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> exact

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
and then the hind hind hitting the exact

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.870 
and then the hind hind hitting the exact
same<00:01:30.030> place<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.860> mink<00:01:32.070> when<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.430> traveling

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
same place the mink when it's traveling

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.420 
same place the mink when it's traveling
these<00:01:33.060> tutus<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.720> very<00:01:34.110> very<00:01:34.380> consistent<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
these tutus is very very consistent and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.069 
these tutus is very very consistent and
that's<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> features<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.570> look<00:01:36.810> for

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that's one of the features you look for

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.140 
that's one of the features you look for
to<00:01:37.290> identify<00:01:37.860> mink<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.400> opposed<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.939> some

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
to identify mink as opposed to some

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.480 
to identify mink as opposed to some
other<00:01:39.180> weasel<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.140> smaller<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> large<00:01:41.100> or

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
other weasel a smaller or a large or

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.020 
other weasel a smaller or a large or
weasel<00:01:42.530> when<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.680> gets<00:01:43.860> into<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.189> tube<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.790> bound

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
weasel when it gets into a tube to bound

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.160 
weasel when it gets into a tube to bound
it<00:01:45.689> will<00:01:46.020> travel<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.579> stride<00:01:48.360> anywhere<00:01:48.930> from

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
it will travel a stride anywhere from

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.740 
it will travel a stride anywhere from
about<00:01:49.380> 11<00:01:49.890> inches<00:01:50.009> up<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.579> 38<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.390> once<00:01:51.600> it

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
about 11 inches up to 38 but once it

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.060 
about 11 inches up to 38 but once it
gets<00:01:51.899> into<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.140> bound<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.649> will<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.860> very

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
gets into that bound it will be very

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.920 
gets into that bound it will be very
consistent<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.060> what<00:01:54.479> we've<00:01:54.630> tried

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
consistent and that's what we've tried

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.880 
consistent and that's what we've tried
to<00:01:55.110> show<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.509> it's<00:01:57.509> about<00:01:57.840> 20<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.500> 21

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
to show you here is it's about 20 to 21

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.609 
to show you here is it's about 20 to 21
inches<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.670> between<00:02:00.360> each<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:01.110> these<00:02:01.259> groups

inches in between each of these groups

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.179 
inches in between each of these groups
and<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.729> was<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.090> mink<00:02:03.719> moving<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.619> tutu<00:02:04.829> it

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
and if it was a mink moving in a tutu it

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.520 
and if it was a mink moving in a tutu it
would<00:02:05.340> continue<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.210> pattern<00:02:06.530> very

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
would continue in that pattern very

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.240 
would continue in that pattern very
consistent<00:02:08.429> even<00:02:09.000> bounds<00:02:09.720> for<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.289> long<00:02:10.709> long

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
