00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 good morning everyone today for now and 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.190
 welcome to be information from 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.990
 pokémon mysterious world good guys 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.880
 I just came out with a trailer 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.800
 pretty cool honestly on the channel 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.509
 of pokemon in japan I will only put it 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.610
 around here in the background and so they do not see me 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.839
 my boss all clear that yes and the truth is 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.660
 that is pretty cool and there are things 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.070
 new and things that come back after 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.320
 many years like for example the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.140
 initial questionnaire there are two novelties 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.750
 let's say in this trailer other than 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.609
 that the trailer will leave it so that under 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.679
 whether someone is Japanese I'll leave 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.120
 down here because there is someone in the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.940
 trailer that tells you exactly the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.320
 trailer news of the things that 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.730
 there are new in this little mega seen world 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.469
 that the only bad thing is that as I do not know 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.260
 Japanese I do not know exactly what he says 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.450
 but I do know things like that the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.770
 initial questionnaire outside that if that 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.300
 the initial question as it is something very 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.920
 simple very simple and cool one 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.210
 outrageous and it 's something I was wearing 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.160
 asking people back from makes 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.260
 enough time and that is that at the beginning of 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.940
 the mysterious world pokémon games 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.649
 let's say some Pokémon games of 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.000
 Ask a few questions and it will depend 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.010
 how to answer the questions you 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.480
 assign a pokémon then in this game in 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.939
 this little in a mysterious mega world 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.570
 returns this initial questionnaire in 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.370
 place 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.200
 to see how little they give me sincerely 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.210
 I think they will assign me to pikachu 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.520
 to place me when canelo forgiveness river in 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.229
 this case or some still of fire type 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.300
 I do not know maybe not maybe a little 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.360
 my kind of water a bulb south guy rita 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.590
 night with ítalo for I do not know I do not know but the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.390
 theme is that it's cool for me to make you a 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.910
 initial questionnaire to know what is 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.950
 the pokemon that officially assigns you 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.259
 the pokémon company because there are lots of 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.990
 things from web pages that assign you 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.700
 a pokémon but it's never better than you 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.080
 officially assigned as in this game 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.700
 what will this pokemon world do 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.399
 mega mystery sebas all the initials 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.220
 more pikachu more river which does it still 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.899
 wider the range of possibilities 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.490
 of the initials that you can get in 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.100
 this one in this game is cool 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.420
 and I hope you do it right this is 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.070
 questions this initial questionnaire 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.479
 It will not be anything spectacular either 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.250
 what to say but fuck the truth that cool 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.899
 it's a detail that is pretty good in 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.490
 end things already from the game itself 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.200
 within the game is the new region 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.940
 region obviously the hours it goes 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.039
 quite the map honestly I'm cool is 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.140
 too big, it's pretty big 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.759
 many mountains a lot green much water 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.130
 also which is very cool and we 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.760
 we will be able to teleport not for a 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.069
 Pokemon 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.030
 but for a water type pokémon with a 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.129
 the praza a person can 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.049
 teleport I do not know if so 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.150
 automatic is to say as the flight by 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.959
 example that in the pokemon bicks 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.450
 let's say he makes the flight and 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.280
 teleport tdt teleport and already 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.140
 is in this case I think I do not think that 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.000
 we will be able to handle the paras and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.290
 I do not know what I have no idea 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.019
 the best thing is it was in a teleport and 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.900
 ball point but that is minimally 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.209
 normal transport by water we will see 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.040
 see the transport that there is per flight 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.359
 I do not know if there are flights that I do not have 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.040
 idea but for now the only thing that 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.230
 know it's going to be for water point 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.849
 ball you know absolutely nothing else 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.870
 as for the story we do not know what 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.129
 which is the only thing we use is the subject of 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.299
 those of which there are lots of legendary 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.790
 and everything revolves around the legendary 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.010
 which is cool, but a little bit more 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.250
 the region is cool there I like the region 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.780
 is well designed is quite broad or 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.579
 that seems very very big there is no 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.109
 cities obviously because obviously 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.060
 that 's a pokemon world game 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.560
 mysterious there will be no cities inside 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.720
 of that there is no no there are no people 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.609
 humans within this world but yes that 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.260
 surely there are mini villages in the 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.819
 which live the pokemon I do not know how many 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.470
 there will be at the best there is a nexus and it is already 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.639
 maybe there's more than one city inside 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.360
 of the region itself now is that that 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.030
 colaría 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.860
 that there would be forgiveness in more than 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.810
 a city but well I still repeat not 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.220
 you know absolutely nothing so 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.470
 let me have to comment on everything 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.120
 you want new or not information of this 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.740
 little a mysterious world that is giving 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.330
 many high brushstrokes that none 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.620
 treating them badly to the truth that the judge 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.030
 It looks good and I really want 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.610
 that they come out again on the 17th 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.020

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.760
 year in the us in america and leaves in europe 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.100
 in early 2010 and ladies that goes out 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.080
 very late in dome in 2010 and it comes out very 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.880
 late in europe but surely I'm going 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.500
 to catch with enough enough desire 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.850
