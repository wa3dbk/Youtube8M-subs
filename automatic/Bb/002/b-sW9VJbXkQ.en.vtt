00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.889
 there is a new video you can already see it 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.009
 I'm in the FBI building 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.660

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.220

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.869
 liked it very much 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.850
 so i decided to make multiple videos 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.400
 to record here you see me 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.130
 I broke into the FBI building 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.420
 a collapse of the gta missions it 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.920
 is of course special that I am on here 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.269
 gta online 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.329
 after a glitch I got mine 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.920
 given youtube channel and me 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.600
 think well I am going to try and me 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.160

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.590

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.610
 I just got one here too 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.690
 just a little wrong in pursuit 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.550
 is this just a bit too round 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.340
 walking around 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.660
 how it all is because yes i am 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.160
 of course not every day in this building 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.320
 and of course you are in the missions themselves 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.610
 also not the walk around and I am 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.149
 curious and I want this one 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.840
 delivery also go in multiple clots 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.239
 that you probably haven't 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.100

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.420

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.530
 probably they never have now 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.210
 I just wanted to say very often 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.590
 probably hey 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.740
 you have never seen them 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.820

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.310

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.880
 jumping that's pretty dry though 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.759
