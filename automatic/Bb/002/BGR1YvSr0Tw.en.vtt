I<00:00:07.740> like<00:00:07.890> your<00:00:08.160> wacky<00:00:08.429> stuff<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.090> figured<00:00:09.690> I'd

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
I like your wacky stuff I figured I'd

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.240 
I like your wacky stuff I figured I'd
also<00:00:09.990> show<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.349> how<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.590> make<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> million

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
also show you how to make a million

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.950 
also show you how to make a million
points<00:00:11.400> before<00:00:11.849> around<00:00:12.059> 20<00:00:12.450> which<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.719> probably

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
points before around 20 which I probably

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.189 
points before around 20 which I probably
could<00:00:13.230> have<00:00:13.259> done<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.559> lot<00:00:13.769> quicker<00:00:13.820> but<00:00:15.199> you

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
could have done a lot quicker but you

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.840 
could have done a lot quicker but you
know<00:00:16.379> what<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.650> figured<00:00:17.220> I'd<00:00:17.310> make<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.640> video

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
know what I figured I'd make this video

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.689 
know what I figured I'd make this video
you<00:00:18.810> know<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.230> was<00:00:19.890> already<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.279> few<00:00:20.580> rounds

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
you know I was already a few rounds

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.230 
you know I was already a few rounds
intro<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.660> anyways<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.590> right<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:23.070> is

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
intro but anyways I this right here is

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.200 
intro but anyways I this right here is
unburied<00:00:24.240> how<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> max<00:00:25.260> ammo<00:00:26.210> whenever

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
unburied how you get a max ammo whenever

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
unburied how you get a max ammo whenever
you<00:00:27.449> want<00:00:27.750> to

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
you want to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.620 
you want to
you<00:00:28.830> basically<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.279> punch<00:00:29.699> by<00:00:30.000> thousand

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
you basically just punch by thousand

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.600 
you basically just punch by thousand
points<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.170> air<00:00:31.349> there<00:00:31.679> feel<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.309> abroad

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
points in the air there feel it abroad

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.450 
points in the air there feel it abroad
candy<00:00:33.180> he'll<00:00:33.780> make<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.440> random<00:00:34.710> perk<00:00:35.219> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
candy he'll make it a random perk it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.080 
candy he'll make it a random perk it
might<00:00:35.640> take<00:00:35.940> two<00:00:36.559> six<00:00:37.559> eight<00:00:37.890> times<00:00:38.340> but

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
might take two six eight times but

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.700 
might take two six eight times but
eventually<00:00:39.300> you're<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> max<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
eventually you're going to get a max and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.490 
eventually you're going to get a max and
up<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.280> now<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> max<00:00:42.690> ammo<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.350> all

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
up so now we have a max ammo it's all

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500 
up so now we have a max ammo it's all
about<00:00:43.680> time<00:00:43.980> bombs<00:00:44.309> I've<00:00:44.670> already<00:00:45.030> been<00:00:45.210> doing

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
about time bombs I've already been doing

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.360 
about time bombs I've already been doing
this<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> couple<00:00:46.110> times<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.829> filled<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:47.219> my

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
this a couple times and filled up my

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.479 
this a couple times and filled up my
bank<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.969> whatnot<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.379> decided<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> take

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
bank and whatnot and I decided to take

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.500 
bank and whatnot and I decided to take
it<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> next<00:00:51.030> level

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
it to the next level

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.040 
it to the next level
so<00:00:51.989> now<00:00:52.680> you've<00:00:53.010> done<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.660> know<00:00:54.690> I

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
so now you've done all this you know I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.200 
so now you've done all this you know I
find<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> easiest<00:00:56.129> way<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.340> do<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.059> go

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
find the easiest way to do it is to go

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.410 
find the easiest way to do it is to go
ahead<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.870> make<00:00:58.350> crawler<00:00:58.800> give<00:00:59.789> Leroy<00:01:00.180> some

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
ahead and make crawler give Leroy some

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.959 
ahead and make crawler give Leroy some
candy<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.530> let<00:01:01.859> him<00:01:01.949> hold<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.340> crawler<00:01:02.579> while

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
candy but let him hold the crawler while

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:03.830 
candy but let him hold the crawler while
you're<00:01:03.149> doing<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.449> because<00:01:03.510> you're<00:01:03.690> gonna

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
you're doing it because you're gonna

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.289 
you're doing it because you're gonna
have<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.170> sit<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.000> hit<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> bank

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
have to sit there and hit the bank

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.010 
have to sit there and hit the bank
button<00:01:06.689> more<00:01:07.260> than<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.740> few<00:01:08.040> times<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> it's

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
button more than a few times so it's

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.410 
button more than a few times so it's
definitely<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.470> great<00:01:10.979> way<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.189> diary<00:01:11.670> strands

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
definitely a great way for diary strands

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.600 
definitely a great way for diary strands

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
you know I went over and I hit the box

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.500 
you know I went over and I hit the box
and<00:05:40.100> I<00:05:40.190> got<00:05:40.370> my<00:05:40.550> monkeys<00:05:41.000> and<00:05:41.330> whatnot<00:05:41.690> and

and I got my monkeys and whatnot and

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.670 
and I got my monkeys and whatnot and
actually<00:05:44.510> I<00:05:44.540> went<00:05:44.690> and<00:05:44.840> put<00:05:45.020> my<00:05:45.169> goal<00:05:45.380> doubles

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.020 
actually I went and put my goal doubles
down<00:05:45.860> cuz<00:05:46.160> I'm<00:05:46.280> actually<00:05:46.430> gonna<00:05:46.640> play<00:05:46.790> this

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
down cuz I'm actually gonna play this

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:54.670 
down cuz I'm actually gonna play this
game<00:05:47.120> out<00:05:47.300> and<00:05:49.540> see<00:05:50.540> if<00:05:50.660> I<00:05:50.810> can<00:05:51.020> beat<00:05:51.260> my<00:05:51.580> 153<00:05:53.680> so

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
game out and see if I can beat my 153 so

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.760 
game out and see if I can beat my 153 so
hopefully<00:05:55.070> that'll<00:05:55.310> be<00:05:55.430> the<00:05:55.550> next<00:05:55.820> video<00:05:56.090> but

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.560 
here we are with that round 20 you know
real<00:06:00.510> simple<00:06:01.410> I<00:06:01.440> haven't<00:06:02.220> even<00:06:02.310> saw<00:06:02.580> could<00:06:03.450> be

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
real simple I haven't even saw could be

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.720

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
worried about it I'm pretty sure I'd be

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.960
