 talk about a culture list a list of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.809
 blocked contacts so that if a 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.480
 person who is on that list calls me 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.130
 phone will never mention and the other 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.650
 person will immediately enter into use 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.630

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.640
 to a contact activist person 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.070

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.649
 be here by phone enter here 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.460
 by records and they searched suddenly in 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.710
 my records 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.390
 this person who uncomfortably 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.039
 is calling several times 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.010
 let's say it's going to be my samsung galaxy 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.020
 s3 mini of jamundÃ­ or here the button and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.079
 here I get the option below to add to 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.210
 the rejects list click here 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.679
 we go way since to that person neither to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.980
 the rejection list the second option 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.530
 by entering here by contacts 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.850
 we seek contact with a person who 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.630
 we do not want to talk anymore with that 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.909
 person and who is calling looks for the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.530
 contact we give you click here in this 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.619
 case that garment is already blocked 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.720
 it seems here a symbol of blocking in 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.030
 case that is not blocked so what 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.680
 we avoid here to setup in this 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.800
 case I get it is to remove it from the list of 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.050
 right there, remove it and if I want it 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.910
 link again I give it back 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.369
 configuration and add to the list of 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.340
 rejected the remove to make the test 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.580
 that now all this works as it goes 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.340
 to call using my samsung galaxy s3 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.980

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.420
 the chante between my contacts I call it 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.420
 and hopefully they tend 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.230
 you can see that that phone called this 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:04.070
 and this one only he is finished is rejected 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:07.250

 to call him back having been 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.010
