00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.210
 when teams players like to think a 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.380
 the match with the knight, many begin 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.380
 tremble knees 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.969
 in the composition of the knight much more 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.450
 tough guys than any other royal cubes 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.120
 in this off-season combat 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.210
 Moscow Region team updated immediately 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 four newcomers from canada 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.579
 tarnaski 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.429
 the main thing here is Michael I found 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.249
 physical counter 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:27.869
 America in any league is much more 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.710
 rudeness but we were paid money 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.879
 so we come here to play and we will 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.710
 to represent our team as much as possible 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.800
 it is better 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.480
 Jeremy Apple 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.530
 competently defended as for us does not have 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.520
 values ​​who are on the ice against whom are you 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.220
 play hope guys will fight 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.490
 for the prize cup and the pushes will go into 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.760
 hits then we will see who put in 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.870
 the end of the duel 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.110
 8 more 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.750
 kip brennan 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.839
 final claim amount to check 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.930
 but despite being stubborn on the back 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.940
 I just lie down and we tried to put 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.360
 the blow is so strong that as far as 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.200
 can 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.580
 I try to cripple 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.040
 maybe it's a few stars and desires 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.940
 especially rival knight is 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.150
 fear john is not growing 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.920
 all his career he spent in the lower 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.820
 North American leagues and four times 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.680
 scored more than three hundred free throws 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.719
 minutes per season 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.090
 debut match of the knight was for 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.200
 John is not too successful his team 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.330
 lost to salavat yulaeva 4 11 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.380
 seemingly devastating john not upset 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.049
 tom he managed to check on 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.329
 player strength salavat alexander 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.240
 retreat fight ended for 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.149
 a Russian broken tooth and hand injury then 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.909
 there is a video with the first full-time creepy 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.210
 liked someone there complained after a number 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.490
 our style but we have such a job 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.759
 and we are obliged to benefit 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.390
 his team in any way already as 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.630
 we know how the owners of the site John was engaged 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.329
 boxing more than ten years 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.099
 now after the knight's workout 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:56.139
 he has a lineup of players 

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:58.060
 near Moscow team who want 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.060
 learn from Canadian fighting experience 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.300
 site owners 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.410
 last season knight set 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.630
 several fighting records at once 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.150
 queens so January match against Omsk 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.490
 avant-garde was not carried out and one 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.010
 period of pure time 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.950
 but protest staged a mass 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.580
 fight fight intermittently 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.450
 lasted a record one and a half 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.639
 o'clock 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.039
 and another match against the same avant-garde in 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:29.319
 December last year because of the carnage 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.599
 arranged by the players of the knight was interrupted 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.329
 already at the sixth second hardly anyone will be able to 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.029
 start a fight faster 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.149
 accordingly, I am happy to be here 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:40.329
 be part of a knight I watched this 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.329
 team a few years passed a little 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.800
 days i'm just happy to play here 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.339
 so nobody knows 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:48.240
 coaching this Moscow region his 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.209
 Andrei Nazarov in the squad 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.109
 Andrei first Russian there Gaeva Michael 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.059
 he just remembers past people 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.479
 times are not the most pleasant 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.299
 Klavtsova G. n Kornilov 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.779
 in fact, everything is serious 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.959
 more important is serious work at the very 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.119
 the job is to 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:10.699
 as much as possible right that bright 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.129
 opponent players 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.429
 so do not rule out that we lost 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.679
 Canadian Vityaz fans immediately fell in love 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.809
 their Russian coach they are affectionately 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.399
 call it the main ideas 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.089
 but this time he cries he knows English 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:26.219
 helps us to understand what is common 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.109
 gas we do someone lucky with the coach 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.189
 so the question is when 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.959
 but most trainers do not understand 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:32.329
 addition g 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.289
 the poet was a bathroom himself 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:36.439
 he doesn't ask us why we did so 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.479
 so and so then he knows why we are with him 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:41.689
 it is nice to work 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.779
 signing contracts with new and 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:45.869
 new tough guys nazarov explain 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:47.639
 just need to win 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.469
 really like the expression work 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:50.420
 may be 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.649
 what if 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:53.729
 our colleagues matter we them 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:54.609
 let's beat 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.329
 Knight Club with one of the smallest 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.699
 budgets like royal however near Moscow 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.709
 the team often earn points for 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.029
 an account of the fact that it is simply intimidating 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:05.159
 then standing opponent stars 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.019
 after all, and for this they dislike but 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.299
 interest in games to harel club noticeable 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.260
 stirs adds pepper 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.319
 found the hockey league
