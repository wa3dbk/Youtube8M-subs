00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.570
 hello hunters welcome to the channel 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:19.279
 barbie since we are in monster hunter 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.670
 4g in the range arm analysis 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:27.320
 game is the turn of the chaos maga the 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:32.180
 the cao series for swordsman and good 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:35.150
 because this armor is weird 9 has 10 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.470
 grooves and a basic defense per piece 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:42.909
 of 106 what would a total of 530 and 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:48.500
 can reach a maximum per piece of 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:50.629
 148 which would make a total of 740 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.570
 Well, we are here giving you this 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.659
 outside glance from top to bottom of 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.299
 down up the sides doing the 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.339
 zoom watching it carefully because the 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:05.630
 truth is that this is impressive 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:08.600
 armor esthetically it is precious good 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.200
 let's move on to elemental resistances 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.490
 this armor has minus 25 at fire 20 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.899
 water minus 15 to 110 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:23.530
 ice and -20 to dragon seen this let's see 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.479
 active skills the first one is 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.549
 Awakening releases the properties 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.610
 latent elementals in weapons that 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:34.990
 they lack elements the second is 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.439
 attack plus one affects the attack the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.600
 third is the destroyer increases your 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.939
 ability to go body parts of the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.770
 monsters and the fourth is the negative 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.270
 luck -1 that affects the rewards 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.100
 of mission except in exceptional cases 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.740
 seen this let's see the table with 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.460
 all skill points the 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:05.490
 first is to wake up 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:10.380
 the second one here is attack plus one 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:14.710
 the third is the destroyer 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.020
 and the fourth is the negative luck 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.690
 then we have two skills here with 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.250
 the little dots the first with 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.370
 seven points 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.120
 it's about fencing prevents your 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.670
 attacks are rejected and the second with 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.510
 Six dots is new from the monster 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.570
 hunter 4g ultimate is the critic of 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.580
 attributes increases the damage of the 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.390
 attributes when you make a critical hit 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.640
 that is to say water fire dragon ice and 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.170
 good thunder let's see from piece to 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.370
 piece 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.270
 we started by the helmet has a slot 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.250
 at the bottom of the screen 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.220
 we put the resistances translated 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.830
 elementals of each piece and the points 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.090
 of the abilities that each of 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.370
 they 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.440
 well we went to the second piece that is 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.030
 the chest in this case gives us two slots 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.570
 and you know what we are interested in is the 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.150
 first window and this last one where 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.340
 they tell us the points they give us in each 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.380
 one of the skills that we also 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.960
 Give each of the pieces 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.850
 we went to the third one that are the gloves 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:30.880
 the gloves give us three slots and nothing 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.680
 We pass pantallita until we reach this 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.790
 from here 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:40.629
 let's go for the fourth piece that is the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:45.040
 belt gives us a slot and there we have 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:47.769
 the elemental resistances and we passed 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.030
 up the skills and points that 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.790
 they give us in each of them 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.930
 and finally we go for the pants 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.819
 you record calves as I preferred to call it 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:03.060
 here they give us three slots 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.859
 and with this last step of windows I 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.079
 I'm saying goodbye before reaching the 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:13.200
 final glimpse of the armor as 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:16.979
 always hunters I hope that I have 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.229
 liked as long as you have very 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.479
 good houses and you know we will go 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.370
 pulling armor as we go 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.710
 getting all the necessary pieces 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.710
