 a better minecraft a minecraft 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.400
 with the best you describe yourself 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.619
 can imagine 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.949
 welcome to a minecraft with the 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.900
 shader watch yes and therefore also cordial 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.430
 Welcome to a tutorial for the 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.379
 shader minecraft version 1.4 point 2 was 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.179
 this wonderful motto is needed 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.829
 I think I can hardly say that anymore 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:40.989
 one on this camera ride with cameras 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.260
 studio really impressive 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.639
 So look, there are wonderful ones 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.210
 shadow effects lovely from day to night 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:49.089
 to change 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.769
 what he changes and the trees 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.859
 All in all, they are very moving 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.179
 welcome and very nice modification 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.219
 and that's why we might look 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.079
 even how to install all but 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.809
 pretty much not as complicated as it is 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.979
 at first sight seems 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.860
 and there we are already at the 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:10.360
 installation of the shader model for the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.670
 mine denomination 1 points 4.20 pm the 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.230
 installation of this motto can be found in 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.630
 download the video description 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.460
 should not be a problem 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.570
 yes and now the files are the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.000
 you need that and we need it 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.840
 start right now 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.910
 By the way, installation instructions are 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.680
 also in the video description to find 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.180
 if you are not in the video right now 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.130
 with kommseite just look 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.770
 in the video description 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.420
 First we have to opti the final motto 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.340
 install that is very important 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.230
 You really do that first, too 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.210
 press windows button once and r 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.880
 To be too long in execution and give there 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.340
 percent off as data percent go down 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.260
 minecraft and in our bin folder in 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.710
 our folder we have ours 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.020
 minecraft points as they would 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.880
 the right screen here and straight 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.770
 then we'll open our eleven 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.010
 on 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.040
 here 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.260
 and the minecraft and pull now are 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.810
 the files of opti fine so on 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.510
 the point over there and then leave 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.970
 Go on and we have the opti 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.230
 fine gold installed that went great 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.730
 I've already done that 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.040
 therefore I will not let go of the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.940
 train and then just click ok 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.140
 when these copies replace education comes 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.680
 we would be already at the second 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.700
 Step by step , we now find in 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.530
 this file shaping 1.6 will go in again 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.980
 chains folder and then there is one 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.390
 nst So installer estate we hold 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.140
 once out and then you just click 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.720
 on install mods we will wait shortly 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.060
 they have unpacked and again 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.040
 packed and then you are waiting now 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.570
 not yet out after installation 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.600
 computer stands then you have that 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.920
 successfully installed if that has to be done 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.930
 you have to take care of that before too 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.450
 really your minecraft score the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.970
 file at the here really works 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.620
 is linked and so you have to do that 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.050
 Everyone will think about it 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.720
 I would not be afraid at the moment 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.330
 that here then your name stands in it 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.220
 so, so we have already 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.440
 the next step we completed 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.910
 are soon at the third step of the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:25.400
 installation, and we are opening now 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.989
 swayze around ca c2 and c3 point a and theirs 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.750
 we have a few things the readme 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.890
 you do not need to pay attention to the file 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.860
 now we have a pretty long one 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:38.340
 path follow against bavaria 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:43.750
 then we go shortly in Motzing 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.300
 shaders and then into the content in files 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.860
 and at the end still a shaders and then 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.080
 finally made it so I have to 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.610
 Admit a very very long file van 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.680
 the vaart is also in the 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.750
 Installation instructions in the video 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.340
 describes linked if you by the way 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.830
 does not come along just presses to pause 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.420
 loved this break function 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.580
 Now we need those again 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.040
 minecraft point 12 time once 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.500
 We must now have closed 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.020
 the minecraft next to it again 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.520
 winrar a development program and 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.280
 should be here a bidder in advantage 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.270
 What is forgotten to say 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.350
 please resist in any case 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:22.180
 the installation of opti fine so now 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.500
 here should be a folder shaders 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.090
 have formed and through the 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.340
 installation we with these nice ones 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.570
 have made installers in which go 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.510
 Let's go in and see them 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.790
 files here and here are relatively similar 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.830
 from the that is related the 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.510
 the same ones are just another 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.460
 that they just have another content 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.700
 So here's going from left to right in 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.960
 the file purely clicks on ok and now 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:50.980
 became, so to speak, her this rc2 and rc3 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.830
 is compatible rc5 made quite 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.130
 complicated for explaining but it is now 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.010
 times 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.260
 we close the minecraft point again 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.770
 yes and now you are one now 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.670
 file and something version 10 rc 5 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.310
 Points 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.500
 you can open that again and 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.150
 now it's minecraft time again 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.490
 year to open 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.960
 with winrar as I said here should no 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.920
 attributed to tenant in folder in cage 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.480
 be more 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:21.010
 and then we pull this file in here 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.050
 the minecraft 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.090
 that is related to you then 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.750
 this shader also with another day 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.370
 Perfect 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.780

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.350
 already done i need that now 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.270
 not anymore 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.460
 and then we have the courage already 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.050
 successfully installed i hope so 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.140
 could help you there are of course 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.030
 so many good shader tutorials i would 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.770
 me a like rio behind this one
