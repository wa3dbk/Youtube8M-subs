you

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.869 

hi<00:00:05.290> and<00:00:05.529> welcome<00:00:05.709> to<00:00:05.890> another<00:00:06.220> photo<00:00:06.609> blazer

00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:06.879 
hi and welcome to another photo blazer

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.390 
hi and welcome to another photo blazer
tutorial<00:00:07.540> today<00:00:08.230> we're<00:00:08.530> going<00:00:08.680> to<00:00:08.740> cover<00:00:08.980> the

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
tutorial today we're going to cover the

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.490 
tutorial today we're going to cover the
common<00:00:09.760> metering<00:00:10.240> modes<00:00:10.450> on<00:00:10.660> SLR<00:00:11.020> cameras

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500 
common metering modes on SLR cameras

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.100 
common metering modes on SLR cameras
that<00:00:11.950> is<00:00:12.130> matrix<00:00:12.910> metering<00:00:13.060> spot<00:00:13.690> metering

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
that is matrix metering spot metering

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.320 
that is matrix metering spot metering
and<00:00:14.260> center-weighted<00:00:14.860> metering<00:00:14.950> modes

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
and center-weighted metering modes

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.769 
and center-weighted metering modes
so<00:00:18.199> every<00:00:18.650> modern<00:00:19.189> DSLR<00:00:19.939> has<00:00:20.269> an<00:00:20.390> automatic

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
so every modern DSLR has an automatic

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.429 
so every modern DSLR has an automatic
exposure<00:00:21.380> mode<00:00:21.740> and<00:00:22.419> this<00:00:23.419> uses<00:00:23.840> three<00:00:24.140> types

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
exposure mode and this uses three types

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.550 
exposure mode and this uses three types
of<00:00:24.619> metering<00:00:24.949> usually<00:00:25.520> first

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
of metering usually first

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.670 
of metering usually first
center-weighted<00:00:27.560> metering<00:00:27.849> this<00:00:28.849> is<00:00:29.029> when<00:00:29.239> a

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
center-weighted metering this is when a

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.950 
center-weighted metering this is when a
circular<00:00:30.680> area<00:00:31.070> of<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:31.309> scene<00:00:31.579> is<00:00:31.820> used<00:00:32.300> to

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
circular area of the scene is used to

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.410 
circular area of the scene is used to
correctly<00:00:33.470> expose<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:34.309> photograph<00:00:34.850> by<00:00:35.360> the

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
correctly expose the photograph by the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.700 
correctly expose the photograph by the
DSLR<00:00:36.050> system<00:00:37.570> second<00:00:38.570> spot<00:00:38.930> metering<00:00:39.320> this<00:00:39.559> is

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
DSLR system second spot metering this is

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.160 
DSLR system second spot metering this is
when<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:39.980> circular<00:00:40.460> area<00:00:40.489> is<00:00:41.059> a<00:00:41.120> really<00:00:41.750> small

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
when the circular area is a really small

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.240 
when the circular area is a really small
spot<00:00:42.940> this<00:00:43.940> gives<00:00:44.210> you<00:00:44.329> more<00:00:44.480> control<00:00:44.659> over

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
spot this gives you more control over

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.729 
spot this gives you more control over
what<00:00:46.250> you<00:00:46.399> want<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:46.729> expose<00:00:47.030> for<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.739> finally

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
what you want to expose for and finally

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.970 
what you want to expose for and finally
matrix<00:00:49.430> metering<00:00:49.640> this<00:00:50.449> use<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:51.379> uses<00:00:51.800> an

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
matrix metering this use this uses an

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.069 
matrix metering this use this uses an
average<00:00:52.370> calculation<00:00:52.670> of<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.329> whole<00:00:53.600> scene

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
average calculation of the whole scene

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.380 
average calculation of the whole scene
and<00:00:54.859> all<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.190> light<00:00:55.370> in<00:00:55.579> that<00:00:55.609> scene<00:00:56.030> to

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
and all the light in that scene to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.750 
and all the light in that scene to
calculate<00:00:56.899> what<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.410> exposure<00:00:57.859> should<00:00:58.129> be<00:00:58.309> to

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
calculate what the exposure should be to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.250 
calculate what the exposure should be to
produce<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.269> good<00:00:59.449> photograph<00:01:02.109> so<00:01:03.109> I'll

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
produce a good photograph so I'll

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.919 
produce a good photograph so I'll
demonstrate<00:01:03.469> these<00:01:04.309> three<00:01:04.699> modes<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:05.360> this

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:05.929 
demonstrate these three modes in this

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.859 
demonstrate these three modes in this
difficult<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:07.009> shoot<00:01:07.190> scene<00:01:07.580> you<00:01:08.390> have<00:01:08.509> lights

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
difficult to shoot scene you have lights

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.080 
difficult to shoot scene you have lights
you<00:01:09.410> have<00:01:09.470> an<00:01:09.649> open<00:01:09.979> window<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:10.550> you<00:01:10.970> have<00:01:11.060> a

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
you have an open window and you have a

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.840 
you have an open window and you have a
dark<00:01:11.420> Christmas<00:01:11.990> tree<00:01:12.229> let's<00:01:13.130> see<00:01:13.340> all<00:01:13.550> three

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
dark Christmas tree let's see all three

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.480 
dark Christmas tree let's see all three
modes<00:01:14.320> taking<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.380> same<00:01:15.590> photograph<00:01:16.190> in<00:01:16.399> the

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
modes taking the same photograph in the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.669 
modes taking the same photograph in the
scene<00:01:16.789> so<00:01:17.720> this<00:01:17.929> is<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:18.110> view<00:01:18.409> through<00:01:18.619> the

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
scene so this is a view through the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.100 
scene so this is a view through the
viewfinder<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.429> camera<00:01:19.550> in<00:01:20.179> matrix

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
viewfinder of the camera in matrix

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.229 
viewfinder of the camera in matrix
metering<00:01:21.319> mode<00:01:21.709> we're<00:01:22.310> taking<00:01:22.640> an<00:01:22.759> average<00:01:22.880> of

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:23.239 
metering mode we're taking an average of

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:25.389 
metering mode we're taking an average of
the<00:01:23.360> whole<00:01:23.630> scene<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.500> includes<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.220> light

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
the whole scene this includes the light

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.580 
the whole scene this includes the light
coming<00:01:25.670> through<00:01:25.789> the<00:01:26.060> window<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.630> from<00:01:27.470> the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
coming through the window and from the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.639 
coming through the window and from the
fluorescent<00:01:28.069> light<00:01:28.250> bulbs<00:01:28.610> above<00:01:29.060> us<00:01:29.649> this

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
fluorescent light bulbs above us this

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.889 
fluorescent light bulbs above us this
results<00:01:31.160> in<00:01:31.250> a<00:01:31.310> much<00:01:31.520> faster<00:01:31.550> shutter<00:01:32.149> speed<00:01:32.509> 1

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
results in a much faster shutter speed 1

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.660 
results in a much faster shutter speed 1
mm<00:01:33.649> of<00:01:33.739> a<00:01:33.830> second<00:01:35.560> so<00:01:36.560> in<00:01:36.679> this<00:01:36.860> result<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.520> can

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
mm of a second so in this result you can

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.729 
mm of a second so in this result you can
see<00:01:37.910> that<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.270> matrix<00:01:38.450> metering<00:01:39.080> mode<00:01:39.530> has

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:39.739 
see that the matrix metering mode has

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:41.949 
see that the matrix metering mode has
done<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.369> pretty<00:01:40.580> good<00:01:40.700> job<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:41.239> averaging<00:01:41.840> out

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
done a pretty good job of averaging out

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.139 
done a pretty good job of averaging out
all<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.349> light<00:01:42.560> but<00:01:43.250> because<00:01:43.550> of<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.789> window

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
all the light but because of the window

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.630 
all the light but because of the window
light<00:01:44.330> that<00:01:44.539> comes<00:01:44.840> in<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.860> final<00:01:46.250> exposure

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
light that comes in the final exposure

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.490 
light that comes in the final exposure
is<00:01:46.879> darker<00:01:47.390> than<00:01:47.420> we<00:01:47.660> might<00:01:47.810> expect

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
is darker than we might expect

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.440 
is darker than we might expect
so<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:48.979> Christmas<00:01:49.399> tree<00:01:49.610> is<00:01:49.789> still<00:01:50.090> quite

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
so the Christmas tree is still quite

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.979 
so the Christmas tree is still quite
dark<00:01:50.869> in<00:01:51.879> spot<00:01:52.879> metering<00:01:53.300> mode<00:01:53.509> we're<00:01:53.780> using

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
dark in spot metering mode we're using

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:55.949 
dark in spot metering mode we're using
the<00:01:54.289> middle<00:01:54.619> of<00:01:54.739> the<00:01:54.830> Christmas<00:01:55.369> tree<00:01:55.670> as<00:01:55.879> the

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
the middle of the Christmas tree as the

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.050 
the middle of the Christmas tree as the
center<00:01:56.959> of<00:01:56.989> our<00:01:57.200> exposure<00:01:57.800> this<00:01:58.550> is<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.789> very

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
center of our exposure this is a very

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.570 
center of our exposure this is a very
dark<00:01:59.390> area<00:01:59.629> so<00:02:00.560> we're<00:02:01.069> getting<00:02:01.190> a<00:02:01.369> slow

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
dark area so we're getting a slow

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.119 
dark area so we're getting a slow
shutter<00:02:02.030> speed<00:02:02.450> of<00:02:02.629> about<00:02:02.929> 1/4<00:02:03.649> hundredths<00:02:04.039> of

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:04.129 
shutter speed of about 1/4 hundredths of

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:10.630 
shutter speed of about 1/4 hundredths of
a<00:02:04.250> second<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:09.200> can<00:02:09.379> see<00:02:09.619> because<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.099> spot

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
a second you can see because the spot

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.820 
a second you can see because the spot
meter<00:02:10.910> focused<00:02:11.480> in<00:02:11.660> right<00:02:12.020> into<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.470> tree

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
meter focused in right into that tree

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.979 
meter focused in right into that tree
the<00:02:13.580> tree<00:02:13.849> and<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.090> ornaments<00:02:14.540> are<00:02:14.629> really

that's<00:02:18.830> only<00:02:19.099> because<00:02:19.340> we<00:02:19.849> focused<00:02:20.300> in<00:02:20.510> on<00:02:20.660> the
