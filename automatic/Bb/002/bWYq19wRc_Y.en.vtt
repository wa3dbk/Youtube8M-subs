00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
arm and that gives it quite a different

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.270 
arm and that gives it quite a different
type<00:03:51.430> of<00:03:51.459> flexibility<00:03:52.450> than<00:03:53.110> you<00:03:53.290> see<00:03:53.530> on<00:03:53.560> most

overall<00:04:07.989> this<00:04:08.829> is<00:04:08.890> just<00:04:09.160> one<00:04:09.730> intense<00:04:10.180> figure

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
overall this is just one intense figure

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
to find though I'm not entirely sure why

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.110 
to find though I'm not entirely sure why
but<00:04:22.180> it<00:04:22.330> is<00:04:22.510> this<00:04:23.380> is<00:04:23.590> probably<00:04:24.039> the<00:04:24.400> second

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
but it is this is probably the second
