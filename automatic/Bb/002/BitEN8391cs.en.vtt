00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
that I don't use very often and that's

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.380 
that I don't use very often and that's
called<00:02:33.260> tight<00:02:33.650> lining<00:02:33.980> which<00:02:34.490> is<00:02:34.670> basically

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
called tight lining which is basically

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
is a very uncomfortable process so it's

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.130 
is a very uncomfortable process so it's
something<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.360> you'll<00:02:44.480> have<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.840> get<00:02:44.960> used
