00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello, today I want to show you 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.740
 homemade simplest design 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.740
 the speaker itself is the speaker here 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.350
 here we see on the wooden tabletop on 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.170
 double-sided tape reel copper 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.330
 thin wire wound on top 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.410
 on double-sided tape magnet 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:30.779
 neodymium hanging magnet neodinovy 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:35.190
 pulled out of the drive platoon soldered 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:39.480
 posting and now show how good he is 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.489
 sounds in my sound quality 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.730
 playback device for 3 player 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.629
 will be used but an amplifier for 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.110
 fighting dynamics 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.789
 homemade amplifier on chip 30 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.289
 419 you must have him video review him 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.059
 have seen 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.649
 if they saw that there he was on a big 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:05.570
 breadboard and now I sawed it off 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:10.340
 it turned out quite small here 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:14.360
 the little scarf is already connecting the wires 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.360
 up to 10th coil speaker impedance 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.030
 the minimum is permissible for an amplifier 8th all 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.840
 Normally you can connect to power 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.990
 Today I will be from two lithium cans 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.119
 if you have seen tips on using 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.740
 lithium batteries then these jars you 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.619
 jars 18 650 of 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:43.770
 notebook batteries 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:46.350
 so turn on by the way all the batteries 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.350
 I reinforce each other on the neodymium 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.229
 magnets why this is where we are because 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.280
 first you can not understand understand them 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.899
 can not be here and at the same time not very 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.899
 securely fastened 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:12.119
 here we hold them here passed to them 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.119
 only great magnet 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:42.060
 so now connected to the crocodile yet 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.060
 the speaker itself 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.170
 so everything seems to be right well Th 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.820
 Now I run all my player 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.840
 configured let's say the maximum 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.870
 volume so that the sound was at its maximum 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.390
 loud without distortion and in general 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.390
 right now what volume will it be and 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:19.090
 will be the maximum volume for this 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.090
 amplifier and for this speaker 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:36.340
 here is a quiet sound you hear 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.890
 probably this is the limit for this 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.980
 dynamics if it is exclusively 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.600
 factory speaker 8 smart you will 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.110
 the sound is much louder right by a lot 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.510
 despite the low sensitivity 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.209
 given dynamics it sounds good in 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.209
 Well, listen to this 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.210
 also the sound is excellent is heard on the other 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.210
 side table top 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:25.330
 Well, at the same time you will see that under the tabletop 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:28.090
 no speaker anywhere i have hidden here 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.500
 here here is the speaker 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.130
 just on the other side of the wood 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.130
 listen to the sound 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.710
 Well, in principle, I think it is clear and the volume 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:57.440
 quality well and honesty nowhere 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:05:04.669
 dynamics behind is not hidden like this 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:08.380
 everything looks on my desk 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.380
 other compositions will serve on it 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:46.569
 Well, I think everything is clear. All right, thanks. 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:47.469
 I hope you enjoyed watching yes 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.930
 few more words 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:52.719
 such a speaker in principle to make as 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.310
 you understood it is easy to literally need copper 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:57.789
 the wire is thin and 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.139
 and a neodymium magnet or in principle 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:03.460
 ferrite magnet will do 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:07.620
 but with a neodymium magnet better 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:12.909
 use it he is both small and powerful 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:14.560
 That means in terms of sound quality of course 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.389
 and in terms of sound volume it is inferior 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.680
 the factory even the cheapest 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:21.129
 Chinese consumer goods 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.259
 but nevertheless , if there is no dynamic fool 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:26.229
 or if you just want to experiment 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:29.529
 do it yourself 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:33.479
 option for experiments and homemade 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:33.479
 Thank you all for your attention
