the flipper is down
I<00:02:54.170> believe<00:02:54.739> that's<00:02:54.980> normal<00:02:55.670> for<00:02:55.700> the

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
I believe that's normal for the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.490 
I believe that's normal for the
Mosasaurus<00:02:56.600> there<00:02:56.870> because<00:02:57.019> this<00:02:57.140> would<00:02:57.350> be

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
Mosasaurus there because this would be

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.100 
Mosasaurus there because this would be
more<00:02:57.680> like<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.890> shark<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.700> then<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.720> would<00:02:59.870> be

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
more like a shark and then that would be

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.870 
more like a shark and then that would be
down<00:03:00.739> for<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.220> Mosasaurus

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
down for the Mosasaurus

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.690 
down for the Mosasaurus
