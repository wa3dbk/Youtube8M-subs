hey guys points here on the public test

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.500 
hey guys points here on the public test
realm<00:00:02.040> and<00:00:02.340> this<00:00:02.639> time<00:00:02.820> I'm<00:00:03.030> here<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.240> talk<00:00:03.360> to

realm and this time I'm here to talk to
you<00:00:03.600> guys<00:00:03.629> about<00:00:03.899> some<00:00:04.200> potential<00:00:04.589> changes<00:00:05.279> in

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
you guys about some potential changes in

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.639 
you guys about some potential changes in
terms<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.390> our<00:00:06.509> stat<00:00:06.810> growth<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.529> know

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
terms of our stat growth and you know

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.290 
terms of our stat growth and you know
your<00:00:07.980> per<00:00:08.130> level<00:00:08.340> stats<00:00:08.700> stuff<00:00:08.940> works<00:00:09.179> for

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
your per level stats stuff works for

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.330 
your per level stats stuff works for
season<00:00:09.660> 5<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.590> all<00:00:10.740> tentative<00:00:11.040> so<00:00:11.250> who

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
season 5 so this is all tentative so who

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.339 
season 5 so this is all tentative so who
knows<00:00:11.460> how<00:00:11.610> this'll<00:00:11.820> end<00:00:11.940> up<00:00:12.090> working<00:00:12.210> out<00:00:12.450> but

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
knows how this'll end up working out but

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.990 
knows how this'll end up working out but
basically<00:00:13.620> what's<00:00:14.160> happening<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.820> gain<00:00:14.969> a

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
basically what's happening is you gain a

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.330 
basically what's happening is you gain a
lot<00:00:15.330> more<00:00:15.570> stats<00:00:15.960> like<00:00:16.230> your<00:00:16.470> absolute<00:00:16.949> base

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
lot more stats like your absolute base

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.910 
lot more stats like your absolute base
base<00:00:17.640> stats<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.600> have<00:00:18.779> more<00:00:19.080> right<00:00:19.470> at<00:00:19.650> level

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
base stats you have more right at level

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.250 
base stats you have more right at level
1<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.430> then<00:00:21.000> per<00:00:21.270> level<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.750> start<00:00:22.020> gaining

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
1 and then per level you start gaining

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.200 
1 and then per level you start gaining
less<00:00:22.769> for<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.130> while<00:00:23.310> until<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.939> hit<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.150> certain

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
less for a while until you hit a certain

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.269 
less for a while until you hit a certain
point<00:00:24.630> somewhere<00:00:24.990> about<00:00:25.199> mid<00:00:25.410> game<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.890> then

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
point somewhere about mid game and then

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.189 
point somewhere about mid game and then
you<00:00:26.369> start<00:00:26.640> gaining<00:00:26.849> more<00:00:27.180> again<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.660> ultimate

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
you start gaining more again so ultimate

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.109 
you start gaining more again so ultimate
level<00:00:28.410> 18<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> ideas<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> exact

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
level 18 the ideas you have the exact

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.460 
level 18 the ideas you have the exact
same<00:00:30.330> base<00:00:30.570> stats<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> more<00:00:31.140> or<00:00:31.260> less<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
same base stats and more or less the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.740 
same base stats and more or less the
same<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:33.110> early<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.880> you<00:00:35.880> start<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.510> more

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
same and early on you start with more

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.780 
same and early on you start with more
but<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.559> die<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:37.920> something<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.579> fall

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
but if you die or something and fall

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.729 
but if you die or something and fall
behind<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.390> terms<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.719> exp<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.320> levels<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
behind in terms of exp and levels and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.709 
behind in terms of exp and levels and
stuff<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.579> snowball<00:00:42.149> isn't<00:00:42.480> quite

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
stuff like that the snowball isn't quite

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.229 
stuff like that the snowball isn't quite
as<00:00:42.899> big<00:00:43.200> now<00:00:43.469> there's<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.340> some<00:00:44.730> companion

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
as big now there's some some companion

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.600 
as big now there's some some companion
changes<00:00:45.539> going<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.110> terms<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.440> how

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
changes going with that in terms of how

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.010 
changes going with that in terms of how
first<00:00:47.610> blood<00:00:47.910> goal<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.270> introduced<00:00:48.629> anymore

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
first blood goal is introduced anymore

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.810 
first blood goal is introduced anymore
so<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.350> you're<00:00:49.920> not<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:50.219> punished<00:00:50.640> for

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
so you you're not really punished for

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.760 
so you you're not really punished for
getting<00:00:50.879> first<00:00:51.180> blood<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> penalty<00:00:52.739> is

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
getting first blood but the penalty is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.439 
getting first blood but the penalty is
less<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.610> fall<00:00:53.910> behind<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
less so you know if you fall behind a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.270 
less so you know if you fall behind a
couple<00:00:54.570> levels<00:00:54.930> I'm<00:00:55.289> you're<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
couple levels I'm you're not going to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.740 
couple levels I'm you're not going to
get<00:00:56.370> completely<00:00:56.699> destroyed<00:00:57.270> because<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
get completely destroyed because you

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.959 
get completely destroyed because you
have<00:00:58.050> lower<00:00:58.289> base<00:00:58.649> stats<00:00:58.949> kind<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.370> thing<00:00:59.489> so

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
have lower base stats kind of thing so

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.150 
have lower base stats kind of thing so
um<00:01:00.239> i<00:01:00.480> Mun<00:01:00.780> Jarvan<00:01:01.140> right<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.739> i'm<00:01:02.100> just

with<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.080> exact<00:01:07.350> same<00:01:07.560> points<00:01:07.950> we're<00:01:08.040> going

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
with the exact same points we're going

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.920 
with the exact same points we're going
to<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.340> over<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.420> save<00:01:09.689> an<00:01:09.810> old

to go over here as you can save an old

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.020 
to go over here as you can save an old
Ted<00:01:10.110> between<00:01:10.380> these<00:01:10.530> two<00:01:10.650> things<00:01:10.830> I've<00:01:11.610> exact

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
Ted between these two things I've exact

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.640 
Ted between these two things I've exact
same<00:01:12.210> ruins<00:01:12.510> exact<00:01:12.810> same<00:01:12.990> masteries<00:01:13.500> but

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
same ruins exact same masteries but

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.590 
same ruins exact same masteries but
you'll<00:01:13.740> notice<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:14.790> level<00:01:15.090> one<00:01:15.210> right<00:01:15.420> now<00:01:15.570> I

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you'll notice at level one right now I

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.660 
you'll notice at level one right now I
have<00:01:15.869> higher<00:01:16.110> attack<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.920> not<00:01:17.100> by<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> lot<00:01:17.640> but

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
have higher attack it's not by a lot but

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.810 
have higher attack it's not by a lot but
it<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.420> exists<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.159> have<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> same<00:01:20.520> or

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
it you know it exists I have the same or

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.090 
it you know it exists I have the same or
higher<00:01:21.150> armor<00:01:21.720> magic<00:01:22.439> as<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.710> can't<00:01:22.920> see

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
higher armor magic as you can't see

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.230 
higher armor magic as you can't see
because<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.400> bar<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> way<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.119> I

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
because this bar is in the way but I

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.880 
because this bar is in the way but I
have<00:01:24.360> slightly<00:01:24.659> higher<00:01:24.930> magic<00:01:25.380> resist<00:01:25.680> most

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
have slightly higher magic resist most

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.310 
have slightly higher magic resist most
likely<00:01:26.509> HP<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.630> probably<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.140> notice

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
likely HP is probably going to notice

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.109 
likely HP is probably going to notice
that<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> most<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:29.070> not<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> massive<00:01:29.640> amount

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
that the most it's not a massive amount

but I have about 40 more HP so you know

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.760 
but I have about 40 more HP so you know
it's<00:01:33.420> not<00:01:33.509> terrible<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.049> about<00:01:34.200> an<00:01:34.320> extra

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
it's not terrible it's about an extra

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.749 
it's not terrible it's about an extra
auto-attack<00:01:35.250> worth<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.640> HP<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.549> yeah

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
auto-attack worth of HP you have so yeah

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
auto-attack worth of HP you have so yeah
you're<00:01:39.299> working<00:01:39.450> off<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.810> more<00:01:40.200> stats<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
you're working off of more stats and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.039 
you're working off of more stats and
then<00:01:40.979> per<00:01:41.189> level<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.549> gain<00:01:41.759> less<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.630> let's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
then per level you gain less so let's

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.200 
then per level you gain less so let's
say<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.460> into<00:01:44.579> lane<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.030> died<00:01:45.180> for

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
say you know I go into lane and died for

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.910 
say you know I go into lane and died for
some<00:01:45.540> reason<00:01:45.780> immediately<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.829> know

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
some reason immediately because you know

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.030 
some reason immediately because you know
I'm<00:01:47.040> being<00:01:47.250> an<00:01:47.369> idiot<00:01:47.430> or<00:01:47.700> something<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:49.799> I

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
I'm being an idiot or something and I

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.160 
I'm being an idiot or something and I
come<00:01:50.310> back<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.670> I'm<00:01:50.729> two<00:01:50.939> levels<00:01:51.270> behind<00:01:51.420> I'm

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
come back and I'm two levels behind I'm

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.840 
come back and I'm two levels behind I'm
not<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.860> get<00:01:52.979> utterly<00:01:53.310> destroyed

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
not going to get utterly destroyed

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.520 
not going to get utterly destroyed
because<00:01:54.090> again<00:01:54.420> i'm<00:01:54.659> working<00:01:54.990> with<00:01:55.200> higher

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
because again i'm working with higher

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.499 
because again i'm working with higher
base<00:01:55.829> stats<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.340> he's<00:01:56.490> gaining<00:01:56.729> less<00:01:57.119> per

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
base stats and he's gaining less per

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.959 
base stats and he's gaining less per
level<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:59.250> an<00:01:59.369> interesting<00:01:59.490> sort<00:01:59.880> of

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
level so it's an interesting sort of

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.359 
level so it's an interesting sort of
change<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.680> um<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:02.240> don't<00:02:03.240> know<00:02:04.070> well<00:02:05.070> here's<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369

personally enjoyed the snowball thing
kind<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.879> because<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> way<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.150> play<00:02:12.450> but<00:02:12.930> you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
kind of because the way I play but you

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.000 
kind of because the way I play but you
know<00:02:13.140> right<00:02:13.290> has<00:02:13.440> already<00:02:13.530> said<00:02:13.770> there

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
know right has already said there

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.350 
know right has already said there
they're<00:02:14.159> kind<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.610> trying<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.000> where<00:02:15.269> they've

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
they're kind of trying to where they've

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.449 
they're kind of trying to where they've
been<00:02:15.390> moving<00:02:15.599> away<00:02:15.870> from<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.590> since<00:02:17.069> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
been moving away from that since the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.350 
been moving away from that since the
beginning<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.879> season<00:02:18.120> 3<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:20.060> think<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.269> is

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
beginning of season 3 so I think this is

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.789 
beginning of season 3 so I think this is
a<00:02:21.390> better<00:02:21.569> way<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.840> doing<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.409> because<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.739> was

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
a better way of doing it because it was

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.039 
a better way of doing it because it was
really<00:02:23.310> annoying<00:02:23.519> how<00:02:23.819> they<00:02:23.970> nerfed<00:02:24.269> first

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
really annoying how they nerfed first

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.569 
really annoying how they nerfed first
blood<00:02:25.319> gold<00:02:25.560> who<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:25.829> that<00:02:25.950> just<00:02:26.159> felt<00:02:26.430> like<00:02:26.519> I

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.369

i made this video actually right now is

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.949 
i made this video actually right now is
because<00:03:04.829> i'm<00:03:05.010> going<00:03:05.159> to<00:03:05.220> go<00:03:05.400> through<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.480> most

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
because i'm going to go through and most

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.809 
because i'm going to go through and most
likely<00:03:07.079> do<00:03:07.379> like<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:07.859> did<00:03:07.920> with<00:03:08.129> season<00:03:08.459> three<00:03:08.489> a

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
likely do like I did with season three a

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.899 
likely do like I did with season three a
whole<00:03:09.090> bunch<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.359> junglers<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:11.220> since<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
whole bunch of junglers and since the

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.539 
whole bunch of junglers and since the
season<00:03:12.120> or<00:03:12.810> basically<00:03:13.709> level<00:03:13.980> one<00:03:14.129> jungle

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
season or basically level one jungle

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.009 
season or basically level one jungle
clear<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:14.879> initial<00:03:15.269> jungle<00:03:15.629> clear<00:03:15.810> on<00:03:15.930> whole

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
clear so initial jungle clear on whole

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.520 
clear so initial jungle clear on whole
bunch<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.260> champions<00:03:17.599> now<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.660> season<00:03:19.199> for

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
bunch of champions now the season for

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.619 
bunch of champions now the season for
jungle<00:03:19.859> is<00:03:19.919> a<00:03:20.010> lot<00:03:20.280> harder<00:03:20.639> like<00:03:21.030> mobs<00:03:21.299> hit<00:03:21.569> a

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
jungle is a lot harder like mobs hit a

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.050 
jungle is a lot harder like mobs hit a
lot<00:03:21.810> harder<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.260> stuff<00:03:22.790> or<00:03:23.790> maybe<00:03:23.910> they<00:03:24.030> just

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
lot harder and stuff or maybe they just

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.240 
lot harder and stuff or maybe they just
have<00:03:24.239> more<00:03:24.419> whatever<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.079> is<00:03:25.139> it<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.560> mobs<00:03:26.069> are

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
have more whatever it is it the mobs are

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.390 
have more whatever it is it the mobs are
harder<00:03:26.690> so<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:27.989> change<00:03:28.440> might<00:03:28.829> help<00:03:29.190> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
harder so this change might help the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.099 
harder so this change might help the
junglers<00:03:29.879> a<00:03:29.910> bit<00:03:30.389> just<00:03:30.629> because<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:31.019> know

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
junglers a bit just because you know

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.259 
junglers a bit just because you know
level<00:03:31.440> one<00:03:31.620> you're<00:03:31.829> not<00:03:31.949> going<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.310> get<00:03:32.430> the

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
level one you're not going to get the

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.539 
level one you're not going to get the
crap<00:03:33.540> kicked<00:03:33.569> out<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.169> as<00:03:34.440> hard<00:03:35.069> but<00:03:35.400> you
