00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.770 
and designing sweet from AMD a lot of
developers<00:01:05.909> will<00:01:06.119> use<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.689> future

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
developers will use this in the future

but currently it remains to be seen if

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.320 
but currently it remains to be seen if
it's<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> good<00:01:09.540> option<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:10.020> lock<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.850> DX

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it's a good option on lock now it is DX

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.010 
it's a good option on lock now it is DX
11.2<00:01:13.010> compatible<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.840> give

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
proof is in the puddin so let's get this

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:50.210 
proof is in the puddin so let's get this
open<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.280> we've<00:01:41.430> got<00:01:41.460> inside

pin<00:02:25.750> adapter<00:02:26.260> which<00:02:27.070> obviously<00:02:27.490> if<00:02:27.730> you

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
pin adapter which obviously if you

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.250 
pin adapter which obviously if you
haven't<00:02:28.060> gotten<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.360> adapters<00:02:29.050> on<00:02:29.140> your

haven't gotten the adapters on your
graphics<00:02:29.560> card<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:31.450> would<00:02:31.600> be<00:02:31.720> quite

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
graphics card and it would be quite

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.740 
graphics card and it would be quite
useful<00:02:32.340> but<00:02:33.340> obviously<00:02:33.430> if<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.330> are<00:02:34.480> going<00:02:34.660> to

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
useful but obviously if you are going to

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.170 
useful but obviously if you are going to
use<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.350> minimum<00:02:35.850> minimum<00:02:36.850> power

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
use this the minimum minimum power
