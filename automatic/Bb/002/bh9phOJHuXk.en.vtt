00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.969 

that's<00:01:17.340> about<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.670> for<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
that's about it for that

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:28.210

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
they're the same size is the one from

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.429 
they're the same size is the one from
the<00:01:32.159> other<00:01:32.520> set<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.210> sling<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:35.960> see<00:01:36.960> Santa's

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the other set this sling and see Santa's

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.899 
the other set this sling and see Santa's
mouth<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:38.610> more

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
mouth with this one it's like more

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:50.230 
mouth with this one it's like more
detailed<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:41.490> one's<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:47.000> they're

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.120 

essentially<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.689> think<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.439> fuzzy<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:52.890> is

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
essentially I think the fuzzy one is

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.690 
essentially I think the fuzzy one is
actually<00:01:53.369> bigger

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:07.510 

it<00:01:58.700> is<00:02:00.640> look<00:02:01.640> it's<00:02:01.820> bigger<00:02:03.429> hold<00:02:04.429> on<00:02:05.920> see<00:02:06.920> so

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
it is look it's bigger hold on see so

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.550 
it is look it's bigger hold on see so
there<00:02:09.069> it's<00:02:10.069> like<00:02:10.190> bigger<00:02:10.550> than<00:02:10.879> him<00:02:11.560> don't

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
there it's like bigger than him don't

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.509 
there it's like bigger than him don't
know<00:02:12.620> why<00:02:12.739> they<00:02:12.890> made<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.069> went<00:02:13.280> slightly

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
know why they made that went slightly

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.809 
know why they made that went slightly
bigger<00:02:13.940> but<00:02:14.629> they<00:02:14.750> did<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.430> means<00:02:16.670> I

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
bigger but they did so that means I

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.000 
bigger but they did so that means I
would<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:17.510> one<00:02:17.750> be<00:02:17.780> more<00:02:18.140> up<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.560> be<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:18.890> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
would this one be more up to be in the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.130 
would this one be more up to be in the
cypher<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.519> them<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.849> guess<00:02:22.840> really<00:02:23.840> fuzzy

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
cypher to them I guess really fuzzy

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.509 
cypher to them I guess really fuzzy
though<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:29.079> little<00:02:30.079> pads<00:02:30.380> on<00:02:30.590> his<00:02:30.709> paws<00:02:30.980> on

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:09.840 
this one but they both have that hole on
the<00:03:00.739> bottom<00:03:01.030> here's<00:03:02.200> another<00:03:03.200> one<00:03:04.810> she's

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.520 

smaller<00:03:10.850> than<00:03:11.120> him<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.810> think<00:03:12.019> it's<00:03:12.139> because<00:03:12.410> of

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
smaller than him I think it's because of

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.350 
smaller than him I think it's because of
the<00:03:12.620> way<00:03:12.739> she's<00:03:13.010> standing

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.330 

yeah<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.260> believe<00:03:20.740> it's<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:21.010> way<00:03:21.100> she's

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
yeah I believe it's the way she's

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.530 
yeah I believe it's the way she's
standing<00:03:26.100> as<00:03:27.100> you<00:03:27.220> can<00:03:27.370> see<00:03:27.610> she's<00:03:27.910> really

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
standing as you can see she's really

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.920 
standing as you can see she's really
tiny<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:32.050> only<00:03:32.320> reason<00:03:32.680> I<00:03:32.770> got<00:03:33.100> this<00:03:33.430> one<00:03:33.930> is

tiny the only reason I got this one is

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.290 
tiny the only reason I got this one is
so<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:35.440> there<00:03:35.920> would<00:03:36.160> be<00:03:36.190> an<00:03:36.610> Allah<00:03:36.880> with<00:03:37.270> a

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300
