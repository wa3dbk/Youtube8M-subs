 Hello everyone from maurizio of moto.it 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.230
 welcome your review of what we talk about 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.780
 today a perfect fabric jacket 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.660
 for those who have a sports bike or a naked 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.680
 but even a touring is called net e 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.050
 votes 170 and is produced by spiri as 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.140
 you can see this is a jacket that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.449
 to expand in perforated network but that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.519
 also presents portions of fabric in the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.070
 points to possible contact with the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.840
 land is what we would call the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.600
 perfect jacket for the summer period 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.340
 when you don't have to risk going 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.440
 around without protections because of 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.480
 hot but you can just opt ​​for one 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.489
 jacket like this or light from 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.309
 wear like weight but also like 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.460
 sensations of heat but with protections 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.309
 then there 's security thanks to two 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.920
 optional that are also indicated on the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.980
 identification tag from the net evo 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.859
 can lengthen its field of action up to 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.680
 at autumn or even in spring i 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.750
 optional are termon liner and range 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.810
 respectively a padding 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.880
 thermal is an anti rain but what are they 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.570
 the salient features of this 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.490
 polyester outer jacket 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.890
 high tenacity water repellent or 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.320
 resists abrasions very well 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.369
 think of a fabric like this 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.640
 withstands 450 rubbing cycles with 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.070
 a 180 grit paper when the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.850
 normal cotton withstands a maximum of 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.900
 45 cycles then we have two narrowings 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.899

 waterproof bodice or windbreak 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.200
 indispensable for example if you decide 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.540
 and in the summer to take a mountain pass 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.969

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.850
 then we have an inside pocket and clip 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.340
 stop for attaching the trousers that 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.130

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.160

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.160
 keep in place all protectors then 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.020
 the protectors could not be missing 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.600

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.000
