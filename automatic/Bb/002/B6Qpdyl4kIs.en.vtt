00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
to bring in great quarterbacks and I

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.460 
to bring in great quarterbacks and I
think<00:01:41.729> now<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.390> exception<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.869> course<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.229> Tim

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
think now the exception of course of Tim

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.260 
think now the exception of course of Tim
and<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:44.490> they're<00:01:44.790> gonna<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:45.060> able<00:01:45.149> to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
and now I think they're gonna be able to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.210 
and now I think they're gonna be able to
go<00:01:45.509> out<00:01:45.659> there<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:45.960> bring<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.439> guys<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.979> run

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
that style of offense I think the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.539 
that style of offense I think the
biggest<00:01:48.990> fire<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.439> who<00:01:49.770> does<00:01:49.890> he<00:01:49.979> bring<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.340> as

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
biggest fire is who does he bring in as

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.670 
biggest fire is who does he bring in as
his<00:01:50.850> defensive<00:01:51.329> coordinator<00:01:51.720> he's<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.649> of

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.300 
these head coaches that's gonna spend
all<00:01:54.450> his<00:01:54.570> time<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.990> offense<00:01:55.380> he's<00:01:55.829> gonna<00:01:55.950> hand

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
