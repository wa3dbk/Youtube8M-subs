00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello very good here fires with the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:11.330
 second chapter of the series with more than 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.330
 line in this case let's see 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.230
 christ as pretty classic pretty 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.160
 simple 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.160
 to execute 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.750
 for those who do not know 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.070
 book I'm going to explain now really 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.750
 yes 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.390
 kristen has 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.840
 of first skill crystal solution 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.239
 a new expression of ice 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.420
 guaranteed enemies and for years 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.970
 and also guarantees its attack price 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:01.070
 thing that we have to take into account to 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.070
 the rating time is missing 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.810
 the second measure of crystal maiden 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.030
 we have freezing that freezes one 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.830
 unit and leaves it still in immobilized 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.540
 for a time 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.370
 causing damage per second and cause 70 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:23.299
 of damage per second 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:26.299
 lasting 1.52 2.53 of level 4 to do 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.299
 280 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.380
 the third skill of kirchner maiden 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.270
 it's an aura passively 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.440
 what affects all the departures units 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.760
 in the map 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.000
 as the most winner would be one of your 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.000
 porsche 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:54.100
 They have more impact on the game 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:58.679
 that is generating finally has a 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:02.390
 last one is a freezing field you have to 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:05.450
 ice exposures begin to fall 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.780
 and ice contents of the sky in a 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.260
 area that occupies practically everything to everything 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.480
 the width of the line 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.180
 this is a skill made in the link 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.599
 some time also guarantee 30% 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.599
 every exclusion 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.280
 the amount of damage from the center 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.430
 we go to giorno 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.280
 his first skill is his leaf fury 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.790
 face mill with the sword 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.540
 and years ago the seeds are close to 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.690
 80 to 100 120 and 140 damages as we have 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.680
 tested we climbed out of the ground a circle with 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.650
 the average amount that we have in mind 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.870
 the second skill is a guardian 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.220
 hitler senator who will heal us 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.660
 and the units that are around the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.610
 guardian 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.610
 in this guardian is controllable 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.160
 or heal the realities according to their 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.950
 demarcation 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.040
 we can see a speed of 300 and there 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.690
 is controllable and this means that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.810
 it is controllable but we can move 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.000
 grams and we can also give you orders 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.620
 as you follow a unit postpone it 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.620
 keep on doing 20 songs 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.790
 the third link skill the 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.610
 critical of killing the leaf and 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.380
 possibility of directing double the damage 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.380
 with 15 between 25 and 35 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.420
 stability is going to be that we do not 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.610
 let's understand 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.620
 and finally we have the combinative 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.550
 when he throws himself on a reality 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.460
 it starts to bounce 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.819
 the units with the sword have seen 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.319
 jump from unit to something else 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.470
 with the sword doing a series of 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:06.990
 hits 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.920
 and he's doing 335 and 250 damage per 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.100
 every why 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.650
 when less obviously more than less 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.650
 70 years older 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:27.230
 until 3 6 and 9 jumps ago and has 400 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.240
 consists of consolation we like like 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.990
 you have seen combined with the fury of 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.210
 the turn sheet 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.290
 while the freeze immobilizes him and 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.390
 then doing it with second 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.810
 we take advantage with bernal to be able 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.530
 make me julia the way 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.630
 optimal without it being believed enemy to be 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.280
 move since it says the problem when 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.889
 we use stability is that without fear 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.500
 is moving the results in this 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.289
 complicated can make the 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.430
 success 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:07.750
 taking advantage of maximum stability 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.750
 as you see another 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:17.760
 another possibility that we have to do 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.760
 how is christ regenerating 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:25.199
 because there is very little life 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.480
 but no 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:39.210
 with double wait 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.210
 will hook good 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.480
 effective carmen 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.720
 and the good thing about this color is that 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.190
 they are like 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.520
 is that right now we are only 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.720
 contraband we are not using 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.860
 openly what can be used 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.430
 from the forest 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.630
 for example 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.630
 and more 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.280
 in rows first at levels a little bit 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.280
 international 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.280
 ah 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.890
 in this case I also of the body 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.890
 trust less 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:52.759
 so what I wanted to tell 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:55.569
 he composes this patient classes now 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:57.499
 from many places the simile of freezing 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:01.590
 use covered of the fish market and in addition 

00:06:57.499 --> 00:07:05.340
 I'm leaving in a week 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:08.330
 we can make me not always have 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:11.330
 because it's not always very fair from a 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
 generation 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:19.880
 we use the products 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.580
 how 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:36.040
 we all have little left 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:38.120
 for saying in this video I hope that you 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.240
 I liked it 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.560
 it's very classic but we have to 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.480
 to have 

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.100
 explaining 

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:51.780
 you can use it every time 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:53.960
 influences them later 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:57.050
 instead of worse 

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.409
 and it 's amazing does not serve to fail 

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.929
 an initial simple 

00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:04.469
 and with which he says goodbye we are up to 

00:08:01.929 --> 00:08:04.469
 next video
