and an analog oscillator detune the two
multi<00:00:53.969> oscillators<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.809> thicken<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.199> up

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
multi oscillators a bit to thicken it up

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.340

and<00:00:55.760> send<00:00:56.760> them<00:00:56.879> through<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.510> numbers<00:00:57.840> 2<00:00:58.109> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and send them through with numbers 2 and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.900 
and send them through with numbers 2 and
3<00:00:58.620> here<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.129> we've<00:00:59.460> got<00:00:59.579> all<00:00:59.730> three

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
3 here so we've got all three

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.209 
3 here so we've got all three
oscillators<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.719> into<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> filter<00:01:01.350> now

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
oscillators going into the filter now

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.770

the<00:01:02.520> two<00:01:02.670> multi<00:01:02.969> oscillators<00:01:03.449> will<00:01:03.570> provide

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the two multi oscillators will provide

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.200 
the two multi oscillators will provide
the<00:01:03.960> kind<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.229> thick<00:01:04.500> tone<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.640> reef<00:01:05.909> space

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the kind of thick tone of the reef space

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.539 
the kind of thick tone of the reef space
and<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.260> analog<00:01:07.619> oscillator<00:01:07.799> will<00:01:08.310> provide

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and the analog oscillator will provide

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.609 
and the analog oscillator will provide
the<00:01:08.700> punchy<00:01:09.090> forefront<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> synth<00:01:10.350> sound

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the punchy forefront to the synth sound

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.710 
the punchy forefront to the synth sound
I'll<00:01:11.310> put<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.729> some<00:01:11.880> notes<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.570> hear

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
I'll put in some notes so we can hear

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.359 
I'll put in some notes so we can hear
the<00:01:12.840> synth<00:01:13.049> now<00:01:13.260> there<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.159> I've<00:01:14.250> just

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the synth now there we go I've just

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.310 
the synth now there we go I've just
added<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.939> riff<00:01:15.119> here<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.780> sequencer

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
added in a riff here in the sequencer

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.140 
added in a riff here in the sequencer
window<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.130> listen<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.430> that

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
that we can work with so Silla the town

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.890 
that we can work with so Silla the town
and<00:01:31.700> we'll<00:01:31.940> get<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.150> work<00:01:32.240> making<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:32.690> even

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
and we'll get to work making this even

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.670 
and we'll get to work making this even
cooler

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
cooler

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.860 
cooler
now<00:01:34.660> hit<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.690> portamento<00:01:36.260> on<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:37.600> maybe<00:01:38.600> turn

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
now hit the portamento on and maybe turn

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.570 
now hit the portamento on and maybe turn
down<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.110> little<00:01:39.290> bit<00:01:39.500> this<00:01:39.680> just<00:01:39.890> makes<00:01:40.070> notes

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
down a little bit this just makes notes

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.120 
down a little bit this just makes notes
slide<00:01:40.910> between<00:01:41.180> each<00:01:41.510> other<00:01:41.860> turn<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.010> amp

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
slide between each other turn the amp

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.120 
slide between each other turn the amp
fellow<00:01:43.430> amp<00:01:43.670> envelope<00:01:44.060> up<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.990> full<00:01:45.800> the

fellow amp envelope up to full the
sustain<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:46.760> decay<00:01:47.060> so<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:48.440> doesn't

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
sustain and decay so that it doesn't

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.950 
sustain and decay so that it doesn't
lose<00:01:48.950> any<00:01:49.220> volume<00:01:49.580> over<00:01:49.790> time<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.690> then

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
lose any volume over time and then

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.590 
lose any volume over time and then
that's<00:01:51.080> hit<00:01:51.380> at<00:01:51.620> a<00:01:51.710> consistent<00:01:52.040> level<00:01:52.600> now

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
that's hit at a consistent level now

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.090 
that's hit at a consistent level now
this<00:01:53.630> is<00:01:53.780> pretty<00:01:54.050> cool<00:01:54.320> but<00:01:54.650> to<00:01:54.770> make<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.010> even

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
this is pretty cool but to make it even

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.010 
this is pretty cool but to make it even
more<00:01:55.220> interesting<00:01:55.580> I'm<00:01:56.240> going<00:01:56.300> to<00:01:56.570> modulate<00:01:56.960> a

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
more interesting I'm going to modulate a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.290 
more interesting I'm going to modulate a
notch<00:01:57.380> filter<00:01:57.830> over<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.130> synth<00:01:58.400> with<00:01:58.670> an<00:01:58.790> LFO

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
notch filter over the synth with an LFO

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.270 
notch filter over the synth with an LFO
not<00:02:00.020> as<00:02:00.170> hard<00:02:00.350> as<00:02:00.410> it<00:02:00.470> sounds<00:02:00.800> at<00:02:00.890> all

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
not as hard as it sounds at all

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.880 
not as hard as it sounds at all
just<00:02:01.910> turn<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.720> low-pass<00:02:03.200> filter<00:02:03.560> into<00:02:03.770> a

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
just turn the low-pass filter into a

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.290 
just turn the low-pass filter into a
state<00:02:04.190> variable<00:02:04.430> filter<00:02:05.440> like<00:02:06.440> notch<00:02:09.220> and

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
state variable filter like notch and

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.550 
state variable filter like notch and
take<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.390> frequency<00:02:11.630> down<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.230> hundred

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
take the frequency down to a hundred

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.000 
take the frequency down to a hundred
mils<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:14.450> just<00:02:14.690> cuts<00:02:14.959> frequencies<00:02:15.590> around

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
mils this just cuts frequencies around

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.220 
mils this just cuts frequencies around
the<00:02:16.100> selected<00:02:16.459> frequency<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:17.660> by<00:02:17.840> moving<00:02:18.050> this

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
the selected frequency so by moving this

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.500 
the selected frequency so by moving this
frequency<00:02:18.620> point<00:02:18.920> around<00:02:19.280> it'll<00:02:20.240> give<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.480> a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
frequency point around it'll give you a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.880 
frequency point around it'll give you a
sweet<00:02:20.750> sweeping<00:02:21.650> effect<00:02:21.910> okay<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:24.110> turn<00:02:24.740> the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
sweet sweeping effect okay so turn the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.660 
sweet sweeping effect okay so turn the
LFO<00:02:25.280> tempo<00:02:25.700> sync<00:02:26.000> on<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.890> change<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.100> rate<00:02:28.310> to

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
LFO tempo sync on and change the rate to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.900 
LFO tempo sync on and change the rate to
two<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.150> one<00:02:32.260> then<00:02:33.260> in<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:34.160> modulation<00:02:34.519> bus

so<00:02:53.870> let's<00:02:54.050> add<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.260> scream<00:02:54.709> for<00:02:54.950> distortion

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
so let's add a scream for distortion

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.920 
so let's add a scream for distortion
unit<00:02:55.690> right<00:02:56.690> click<00:02:56.930> create

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
unit right click create

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.099 
unit right click create
scream<00:02:59.170> for<00:02:59.409> distortion<00:03:00.659> yeah

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
scream for distortion yeah

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.440 
scream for distortion yeah
as<00:03:02.859> always<00:03:03.159> with<00:03:03.430> this<00:03:03.609> it's<00:03:04.120> pretty<00:03:04.390> much

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
as always with this it's pretty much

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.059 
as always with this it's pretty much
your<00:03:04.569> playground<00:03:05.319> so<00:03:05.590> tried<00:03:05.859> different

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
your playground so tried different

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.679 
your playground so tried different
settings<00:03:06.609> to<00:03:06.760> get<00:03:06.879> them<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.180> new<00:03:07.359> wanting

but<00:03:08.109> I'll<00:03:08.349> be<00:03:08.469> using<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:09.129> tube<00:03:09.849> distortion

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
but I'll be using the tube distortion

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.990 
but I'll be using the tube distortion

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
about half damage control and the bias

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.890 
about half damage control and the bias
I'm<00:03:16.359> going<00:03:16.569> to<00:03:16.719> have<00:03:17.250> ha<00:03:18.269> or<00:03:19.269> rather<00:03:19.569> the

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
move on to the sub base okay now for the

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.330 
move on to the sub base okay now for the
sub<00:05:07.720> base<00:05:07.870> this<00:05:08.199> is<00:05:08.319> actually<00:05:08.650> ridiculously

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
sub base this is actually ridiculously

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.339 
sub base this is actually ridiculously
easy<00:05:09.460> synth<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.150> make<00:05:10.360> but<00:05:10.840> I<00:05:10.870> usually<00:05:11.199> add<00:05:11.319> a

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
easy synth to make but I usually add a

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:12.659 
easy synth to make but I usually add a
few<00:05:11.590> extra<00:05:11.710> things<00:05:11.949> to<00:05:12.250> make<00:05:12.400> it<00:05:12.490> a<00:05:12.520> bit<00:05:12.639> more

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
few extra things to make it a bit more

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.520 
few extra things to make it a bit more
powerful<00:05:13.060> so<00:05:13.780> right<00:05:13.960> click<00:05:14.169> and<00:05:14.319> create<00:05:14.380> a

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
powerful so right click and create a

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.150 
powerful so right click and create a
Combinator

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
Combinator

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.680

and<00:05:15.340> then<00:05:15.610> it's<00:05:15.759> sub<00:05:15.970> base<00:05:18.150> add<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.360> Thor

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
and then it's sub base add a Thor

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.640 
and then it's sub base add a Thor
instance<00:05:21.630> doesn't<00:05:22.630> have<00:05:22.810> to<00:05:22.900> be<00:05:23.020> full<00:05:23.199> but<00:05:23.560> I

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
instance doesn't have to be full but I

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.420 
instance doesn't have to be full but I
just<00:05:23.800> like<00:05:23.949> Thor

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
just like Thor

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.360 
just like Thor

patch<00:05:28.410> open<00:05:29.410> it<00:05:29.500> up<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:30.479> select<00:05:31.479> the<00:05:31.780> sine

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
patch open it up and select the sine

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
wave here in the analog oscillator

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.159 
wave here in the analog oscillator
that's<00:05:36.099> the<00:05:36.280> default<00:05:36.460> now<00:05:37.449> if<00:05:37.690> you<00:05:37.810> open<00:05:38.080> up

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
that's the default now if you open up

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.439 
that's the default now if you open up
here<00:05:38.440> and<00:05:38.680> I'll<00:05:39.009> just<00:05:39.190> drag<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:39.610> notes<00:05:40.210> across

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
here and I'll just drag the notes across

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:41.839 
here and I'll just drag the notes across
so<00:05:40.660> we<00:05:40.750> can<00:05:40.900> have<00:05:41.080> something<00:05:41.289> to<00:05:41.470> listen<00:05:41.650> to

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
so we can have something to listen to

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:43.620 
so we can have something to listen to
not<00:05:42.849> sure<00:05:43.000> you'll<00:05:43.090> be<00:05:43.180> able<00:05:43.240> to<00:05:43.389> hear<00:05:43.570> it

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
not sure you'll be able to hear it

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.200 
not sure you'll be able to hear it
because<00:05:43.750> it'll<00:05:43.960> be<00:05:44.020> quite<00:05:44.259> low<00:05:45.190> if<00:05:45.880> it<00:05:46.090> is<00:05:46.180> a

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
because it'll be quite low if it is a

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.740 
because it'll be quite low if it is a
sub<00:05:46.570> bass<00:05:47.520> but<00:05:48.520> yeah<00:05:48.699> that<00:05:48.940> you<00:05:49.240> could<00:05:49.479> just

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
sub bass but yeah that you could just

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.290 
sub bass but yeah that you could just
leave<00:05:49.870> this<00:05:50.169> the<00:05:50.620> sub<00:05:51.460> bass<00:05:51.669> here<00:05:51.880> because

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
leave this the sub bass here because

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.540 
leave this the sub bass here because
that<00:05:52.599> is<00:05:52.810> already<00:05:52.990> a<00:05:53.380> powerful<00:05:53.889> enough<00:05:54.280> sub

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
that is already a powerful enough sub

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.189 
that is already a powerful enough sub
bass<00:05:54.729> because<00:05:55.030> a<00:05:55.060> sine<00:05:55.360> wave<00:05:55.389> is<00:05:55.750> very<00:05:55.990> good

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
bass because a sine wave is very good

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.499 
bass because a sine wave is very good
for<00:05:56.349> this<00:05:56.500> sort<00:05:56.949> of<00:05:57.009> thing<00:05:57.220> but<00:05:57.940> I<00:05:58.180> like<00:05:58.330> to

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
for this sort of thing but I like to

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.580 
for this sort of thing but I like to
have<00:05:58.690> three<00:05:59.320> different<00:05:59.500> sine<00:05:59.949> waves

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.590 

like<00:06:04.590> this<00:06:05.040> and<00:06:05.130> an<00:06:05.400> octave<00:06:05.790> spread<00:06:06.180> a<00:06:06.360> three

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
like this and an octave spread a three

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:14.150 
like this and an octave spread a three
octave<00:06:06.720> spread<00:06:12.140> let<00:06:13.140> me<00:06:13.200> take<00:06:13.440> one<00:06:13.470> down<00:06:13.980> an

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
octave spread let me take one down an

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.280 
octave spread let me take one down an
octave<00:06:14.280> so<00:06:15.240> you<00:06:15.330> got<00:06:15.450> the<00:06:15.570> base<00:06:15.750> here<00:06:16.020> one<00:06:16.200> in

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
octave so you got the base here one in

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.930 
octave so you got the base here one in
the<00:06:16.380> higher<00:06:16.590> one<00:06:16.770> and<00:06:17.340> then<00:06:17.490> make<00:06:17.670> sure<00:06:17.700> that

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
the higher one and then make sure that

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.690 
the higher one and then make sure that
the<00:06:18.230> the<00:06:19.230> higher<00:06:19.470> one<00:06:19.710> isn't<00:06:20.010> as<00:06:20.130> loud<00:06:20.370> as<00:06:20.580> the

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
the the higher one isn't as loud as the

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.730 
the the higher one isn't as loud as the
others<00:06:20.970> and<00:06:21.180> the<00:06:21.600> vaisya<00:06:22.020> one<00:06:22.230> is<00:06:22.380> the<00:06:22.530> most

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
others and the vaisya one is the most

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.040 
others and the vaisya one is the most
prominent<00:06:23.220> or<00:06:23.730> rather<00:06:24.000> the<00:06:24.240> loudest<00:06:24.630> volume

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
prominent or rather the loudest volume

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.250 
prominent or rather the loudest volume
so<00:06:25.800> it's<00:06:25.980> not<00:06:26.510> taken<00:06:27.510> over<00:06:27.750> by<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:27.930> higher

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
so it's not taken over by the higher

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.280 
so it's not taken over by the higher
more<00:06:28.710> prominent<00:06:29.130> sounds<00:06:29.630> okay<00:06:30.630> cut

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
more prominent sounds okay cut

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.310 
more prominent sounds okay cut

crank that sub bass and blow some
speakers<00:06:47.100> now<00:06:47.340> let's<00:06:47.520> have<00:06:47.670> a<00:06:47.730> listen<00:06:47.970> to<00:06:48.210> that
