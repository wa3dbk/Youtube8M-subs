 Biologist Naganuma Satoshi 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.970
 With a biologist 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:18.550

 Nsu 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.310
 It was such a no 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.200
 Dreams talk of the discovery of extraterrestrial life 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.580

 Ryo Naganuma 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:38.100
 Meyama at the age of four to the mystery of life 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:44.210
 Aiming for an astronaut seeking the answer to the universe 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.210
 That that Soichi Noguchi was contested Hilo seat to pull the trailing edge 6 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:53.130
 The line is him 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:58.580
 Currently teaching bio-oceanography as an associate professor at Hiroshima University 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.580
 It has attracted the attention is called in such a nickname 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.670
 Go again 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:12.040
 In fact, Naganuma is flying around the world for most of the research in a year 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.750
 The scolding of frigid who said that the South Pole North Pole 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.350
 Burning you out, such as the desert 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.640
 Follow 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.640
 Rally 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.640
 He is the last in such a remote place 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.280
 Microorganism 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.830
 Some microorganisms that can not be 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.830
 There are many things with unknown power 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.150
 I am studying the various possibilities of mysterious microorganisms 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.580
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.580
 Biologist Takumi Takeshiro 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:06.960
 It is said that no near future 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.960
 Oil is 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.200
 I will 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.200
 Is the glans 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.590
 I will never lose 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:26.450
 Is that kind of thing, say that seat well 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:29.060
 In fact, other than it but something dead we do not have fossil fuel organisms will be a sermon to decompose 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.930
 Micro organisms are making to 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.150
 It's why there are so kind of microorganisms I'm a component of petroleum 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.720
 It has never disappears because you can secure In addition to new 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.030
 a 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.600
 hey is it a living thing 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:48.069
 It is a creature called aurantio chutrium but 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:53.950
 Yes the length is right 1/100 building or something like that 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:03:00.220
 It's very small, but you can store the same kind of oil component in its cells . 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:03.460
 Well, if you collect this, you can treat it like oil, right? 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.610
 US piano Middle East brain tore this really 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.010
 Things taken in Okinawa, Japan a 4 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.780
 I want to open now 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.250
 I put away the world's leading 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:20.180
 I'm a Japan only to find this in Japan but says many also on whether that child Tsukuba 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.180
 The one from which the university teacher was found is the best at the moment 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.850
 The point is how much I can take or which is also more and more rapidly be cultured with a huge sense 500 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.320
 In a 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:37.760
 And this is my leftover food 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:39.569
 Or you can eat such stuff and turn it into an oil component 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:46.829
 pane 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:53.659
 Wow it This Bookshelf year each ship is in at all so that it can be used in energy N energy 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.659
 It is already how much Japan's country will pay if we exist 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:04.450
 I want to open my 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:08.910
 Here, we introduce the microorganisms that biologist Naganuma may have great potential in the future 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.910
 At first it is good to catch flow 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.700
 It Dongfeng 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.700
 Frank with the name of a mouth named Luka inhabiting the sea 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:24.240
 This micro-organism of up to about 1 mm is another name 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.240
 About space 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:33.069
 Large quantities does it have occurred 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.069
 Light the night sea fantastically 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:49.289
 It would be good if the substance that is the source of this glowing component could be injected into the human body 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:49.289
 If you are affected by cancer cutting board react and come from light 1 side 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.840
 The experiment with mice is progressing and the day when it will be put to practical use is near 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:02.580
 Microorganisms that may be useful for space travel 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.830
 It Dongfeng 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:13.300
 Length that inhabits rivers such as the rhinoceros beetle 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.300
 About 0.1 mm of microorganisms 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:19.929
 It is amazing that you can see its movement eyes 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.920
 It was found that a woman 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.920
 The Sachiko of you 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.720
 This shrinking movement is 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.280
 Prompt twice 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:38.000
 You can go 900 b a second 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.000
 Be quickened 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.820
 If Ikere winning practical application of this movement 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:50.389
 Space Badesu 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.389
 Developed space elevator that can be reached in 2 hours 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.700
 rar 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:11.260
 I'm not going to do it-I've done the creatures 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:14.950
 It is a real small issue this place profit by another great fast take 900 people that small body 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:18.810
 You may be able to carry something heavy loose in space 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:24.240
 So you can think about the application of data Nankai on that house 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:27.510
 Teacher is more Tteyuu Toka place to become the best care now do not you become the correct answer of the Antarctic 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.230
 There is a lot of thick ice but 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:38.830
 Below that is the meaning of liquid water 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:44.460
 Reach the bottom of the cat would be the fine by 55 million yen Toka more long ice 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:50.400
 I guess I dug a hole and it's not 4,000 yen but it's also ice 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:51.409
 Te one year ago that contains the voice that Eboshi that is the body of Fuji scale was reached dug in Bunsen net 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.480
 1 year 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:57.710
 Over 20 years of trouble over the years 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.680
 dj hi is it? 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.740
 In addition, it is yeah just to make it completely penetrate in the next in professional summer 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.360
 There is this 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:14.050
 Line 5 million yen or more with the other machining When used in a through Once conductors 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:19.390
 There seems to be a lot of oxygen in the lake that was isolated , so let's just say animals if there is oxygen 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:22.540
 The guitar tab I have evolved something better 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:26.930
 I want to look at possibly the bottom of dinosaurs 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:30.620
 I think that it should be seen other than the living thing gold microbe 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:34.780
 Hey do you think Yukio Toka and each has Tsu YukiYuki man of mother 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:39.139
 I think I have that 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:44.670
 According to the philosopher Yukio exists 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:48.210
 Maybe that 's a different kind of humanity in our point 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:53.870
 It is thought that it would be extinct 30,000 years ago if now 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:57.160
 I feel like it's a Neanderthal offspring yes 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:08:00.930
 I want to hear a lot of stories though 

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.930
 It's a erotic dream , it really hurts
