00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.769
 know that Valeria who never 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:15.030
 gave his mug this stick 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.390
 nevertheless he gave the doctor to whom the team 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.770
 USSR national team 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.810
 Balakovsky this stick Valeria 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.330
 Kharlamov stored not in the hockey museum 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.910
 fame and in the painting workshop 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.160
 car we actually don't stick 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.470
 total derek in the center of exposure in 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.390
 workshop T-shirt autographed by one of 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:40.140
 most beloved Petersburg hockey players 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:42.780
 goalie maxim falcon and it's from just 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.120
 of course the falcon found its place on 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.430
 the back of the head always a falcon must necessarily 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.719
 be sure to coat of arms of St. Petersburg 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.309
 always something from peter should display 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.570
 despite where max was not playing in 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.050
 which team must have something 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.090
 St. Petersburg must be present 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.550
 his first helmet artem steps then the artist 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.589
 by airbrushing once wrote it for 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.420
 Falcon Maxim for goalkeepers 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.700
 and this piece of equipment is also a way 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.970
 express yourself therefore every character 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.170
 has a very personal meaning falcons on the helmet 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.570
 x goalkeeper ska 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.119
 also appeared not just when u 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.770
 I was born the first scene was two 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.930
 when 2 was three 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.210
 in general, well, it depends directly on 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.310
 replenishment in the family of my falcons Sokal 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.810
 from the helmet of which I played 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.990
 last season there 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.439
 besides Peter also made a fragment 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.909
 iron man well, so little by 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.049
 laughed at himself say then because 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.740
 that was not 40 years old and 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:48.119
 but that injury to him something else played well 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.679
 here it is with irony approached 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.009
 painting the helmet and cars is different 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:59.439
 little base color needs to be prevented at first 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:03.159
 tried the convenience palette do not stick 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:05.470
 stencil then we will have delphi snow when 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.920
 airbrush and stencil artist 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.410
 causes 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.929
 the outlines of the base objects and then already 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.040
 brush out or small parts 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.230
 when the brush is already working 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.090
 fragment some kind of jewelry 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.610
 work must be because the helmet 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.569
 should look good and close 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.760
 and shooting from afar the image should 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.260
 even however detailed it is 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.989
 must be read even from afar 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.470
 it is clear that they are simply drawn there 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.470
 some kind of hodgepodge 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.310
 paint helmets on some teams 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.829
 only goalkeepers are entitled to damage first 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.140
 not even a helmet but a Canadian mask 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.120
 goalie jack and jill 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.310
 the scars on it he drew himself 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.019
 each after another hit the puck 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.549
 in face 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.049
 called one famous goalkeeper wanted 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:58.329
 draw drawing fantasy style 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.209
 nude beauties on dragon style 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.150
 Borisov Ledger so I managed it 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.560
 dissuade that this is not really serious 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.030
 theme for painting the helmet and we are there 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:13.290
 depicted the coat of arms of Russia need to stick on 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.290
 we will be St. Isaac's Cathedral 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.130
 artyom in constant creative search here 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.230
 this experimental helmet is finished 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.450
 armor - piercing material line-x except 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.790
 every goalkeeperâ€™s favorite characters have 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.570
 and taboo topics are all hockey people 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.540
 superstitious and goalkeepers are no exception they 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.320
 don't like to portray no numbers 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.190
 besides my number and even me somehow 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.100
 remember 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:52.069
 I always sign my work and 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.709
 I put the year I was even small 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.230
 scandal when I put the year I had to 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:01.520
 remake paint over because the goalkeeper 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.350
 said no since since arthur steps 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.480
 you once wrote your first member orders 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.790
 proceeds to him an endless stream 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.880
 goalkeepers from Russian teams call and 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.250
 even from nhl among customers for example 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.260
 varlam seed 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.049
 call yourself with a nose said that there 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.310
 should have been depicted since he 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.630
 played washington capitals 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:26.260
 there was an image of the capitol with one 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.090
 hand on the other hand 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:34.930
 Yaroslavl view of Yaroslavl on chin 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:38.150

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.660
