 well how about friends this time 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.460
 will show how to root your device without 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.050
 need for pc without the need for 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.680
 decompose your device at the moment 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.869
 to use it at the time of surrounding it without 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.300
 risk of it being shone a way 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.940
 very easy and very simple this time 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.860
 I will use it with the device that 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.239
 is the yiyi x lite a model of 680 what 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.830
 first thing we're going to do is download 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.320
 the files that will leave you the 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.170
 description of the video and what is the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.390
 superuser and in the root once 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.600
 downloaded, it will show you that I do not 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.900
 I'm root so you can see that you do not 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.089
 I'm lying and I'm going to upload this 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.440
 application that is called wifi that is 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:03.600
 recovery that needs to be root user 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.830
 as you see here it tells me that I need to be or 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.840
 will rudy not let me open it 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.060
 well then the first thing we're going to 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.990
 to do is go to our administrator 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.710
 files locate the root and the 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.900
 superuser located 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.350
 let's locate the user first 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.600
 we are going to install it 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.610
 we are not going to open it, we are going to 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.100
 give the ready 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.140
 and then let's go to our 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.760
 file that is the root 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.760
 the same thing we will install 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.259
 Once installed, we will open it 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.750
 once we have opened it as they can 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.920
 see here appears here for that model of the 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:57.100
 device and we're going to give you in this 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.650
 small green box that is to surround it a 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.670
 Once we gave them the wait for the 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.670
 device is removed 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.879
 This pop -up window appears we will 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.760
 we're going to give in the little square on the side 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.620
 straight 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.640
 once we live our device 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.390
 is going to restart nothing happens is normal 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.620
 to restart is ours is a process 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.620
 very easy is very simple 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.920
 once I restart the phone we will 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.590
 application drawer we go to the 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.659
 superuser application will seem 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.799
 that the expression binaries are 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.129
 be updated 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:10.350
 we give in continue and a 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:13.380
 legend we are going to give you in normal 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.380
 once it appears that they are installing 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.240
 to appear another emerging memory and 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.240
 let's give it in the right option 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.819
 and here's why going through emerging 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.980
 where it says that another one has been detected 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.959
 superuser application aside from the 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.030
 of superuser that this is the 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.859
 Chinese application we will give to 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.859
 accept to remove that application 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:53.170
 and ready here it appears in the window and 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:56.800
 it appears that we are super users 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.780
 and I will show you how we already have 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.520
 we have root access with the same 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.260
 application that has been shown to be 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.660
 wifi recovery as you can see me here 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.900
 he is asking for superuser's permission 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.450
 we will give allow and simply 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.570
 will open us the application is useful in 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.200
 surgery we are super users and that would be 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:23.680
 everything and comment in like subscribe if 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.600
 fear they liked hand up and 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.930
 soon I will be uploading more videos 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.340
 of applications that need user 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.360
 root 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.360
 its greatest benefit
