00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.990

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.609
 Booklets are 7 o'clock in the morning if they leave 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.980
 our favorites as it is appreciated 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.860
 very much I say it at this time 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.900
 appreciates very much but attentive to the 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.410
 next news what I finish seeing 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.900
 it's really impressive what he has 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.210
 made a fan is worthy of praise and 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.949
 has done the resident and hbo2 in hd 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.630
 thanks to a fan who has grown tired of 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.179
 wait for camps with will react and 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.800
 take out the remake and he has done it himself 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.780
 not used the unreal graphic engine 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.100
 engine 3 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.850
 the result is simply 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.350
 spectacular little can I say because 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.920
 the video you have in the source 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.960
 description and watching him the lad stefan 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.180
 has thus created two versions of 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.040
 resident two one with the typical camera 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.880
 of the saga and another in which he has improved 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.090
 the rough original control in this 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:02.440
 president and hbo2 the truth is that 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.970
 well this fan that opens does not 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.969
 his first steps in man to the entity 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.090
 in three it has been pretty enough 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:13.899
 well to say it 's spectacular 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.119
 one pass and see if capcom then 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.210
 encouraged this kid to hire 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.549
 order to be in official mastering 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.689
 or to say it in some way and attentive 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.549
 because it was the second link in the 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.319
 description you will have a video where 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.939
 details everything that the 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:31.119
 final fantasy collector's edition 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.250

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.649
 a case with the copy of the game 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.179
 logically in a steel box 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:44.200
 donated with impressive illustrations 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:47.110

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.880

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.189

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.280
