00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
passenger side to be identical then

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.090 
passenger side to be identical then
what's<00:00:18.960> nice<00:00:19.140> about<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> bolts

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
what's nice about this is that the bolts

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.890 
what's nice about this is that the bolts
are<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.279> there<00:00:20.520> relatively<00:00:21.270> easy<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.689> clean

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
are in there relatively easy to clean

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.570 
are in there relatively easy to clean
out<00:00:22.080> on<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.680> other<00:00:22.800> side<00:00:23.070> though<00:00:23.279> if<00:00:23.430> there's

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
out on the other side though if there's

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.340 
out on the other side though if there's
not<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> tie-down<00:00:24.150> bracket<00:00:24.210> take<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.990> few

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
not a tie-down bracket take a few

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.810 
not a tie-down bracket take a few
moments<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.949> clean<00:00:26.220> up<00:00:26.340> those<00:00:26.460> threads<00:00:26.699> over

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
moments to clean up those threads over

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.070 
moments to clean up those threads over
there<00:00:27.060> we'll<00:00:27.300> work<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.570> next

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
there we'll work on that next

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.480 
there we'll work on that next
all<00:00:28.500> right<00:00:28.619> we're<00:00:28.769> good<00:00:28.890> spread<00:00:29.099> ease<00:00:29.279> down

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
all right we're good spread ease down

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.919 
all right we're good spread ease down
even<00:00:29.910> though<00:00:30.000> if<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.359> got<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> bolts<00:00:30.810> out

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
even though if we just got the bolts out

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.780 
even though if we just got the bolts out
of<00:00:30.990> them<00:00:31.199> make<00:00:31.980> sure<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.219> get<00:00:32.309> all<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> dust

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
of them make sure we get all the dust

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.850 
of them make sure we get all the dust
and<00:00:33.000> an<00:00:33.570> extra<00:00:33.870> grime<00:00:34.110> when<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.380> came<00:00:34.559> out<00:00:34.710> with

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
and an extra grime when I came out with

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.560 
and an extra grime when I came out with
it<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.370> let's<00:00:36.120> go<00:00:36.180> ahead<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.420> throw<00:00:36.480> two

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
it and just let's go ahead and throw two

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.860 
it and just let's go ahead and throw two
bolts<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.410> make<00:00:37.590> sure<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.920> works<00:00:38.870> all

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
bolts in just to make sure it works all

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.330 
bolts in just to make sure it works all
right<00:00:40.020> now<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.800> other<00:00:40.829> side<00:00:41.219> that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
right now this is the other side that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.560 
right now this is the other side that
doesn't<00:00:41.520> have<00:00:41.760> anything<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.180> there<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.360> it's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
doesn't have anything in there so it's

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.090 
doesn't have anything in there so it's
going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> take<00:00:42.840> some<00:00:43.050> work<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.829> we're<00:00:44.010> going

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
going to take some work so we're going

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.270 
going to take some work so we're going
to<00:00:44.160> do<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.399> spray<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.640> down<00:00:45.890> when<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.100> that

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
to do is spray it down when you do that

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.470 
to do is spray it down when you do that
then<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.730> go<00:00:47.820> ahead<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.059> start<00:00:48.210> running

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
then we can go ahead and start running

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.470 
then we can go ahead and start running
our<00:00:48.600> bolt<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.670> you're<00:00:50.670> gonna<00:00:50.789> be<00:00:50.879> very<00:00:51.059> careful

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
our bolt in you're gonna be very careful

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.819 
our bolt in you're gonna be very careful
about<00:00:51.539> doing<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.230> don't<00:00:52.350> cross<00:00:52.590> any

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
about doing this so you don't cross any

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.700 
about doing this so you don't cross any
threads<00:00:53.190> starting<00:00:53.550> off<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.530> could

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
threads starting off so this could

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.200 
threads starting off so this could
appear<00:00:55.980> like<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.489> threads<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:56.879> too<00:00:57.000> big

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
appear like it's the threads are too big

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.849 
appear like it's the threads are too big
with<00:00:57.360> actually<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.809> much<00:00:57.930> dirt<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.410> grime<00:00:58.620> in

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
with actually so much dirt and grime in

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.970 
with actually so much dirt and grime in
there<00:00:59.719> once<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.989> started<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
there once you get it started then you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.670 
there once you get it started then you
want<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.219> back<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.430> off<00:01:03.320> do<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.439> two<00:01:04.559> or<00:01:04.619> three

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
want to back it off do that two or three

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.140 
want to back it off do that two or three
times<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.489> some<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> junks

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
times you can see some of the junks

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.050 
times you can see some of the junks
already<00:01:06.420> coming<00:01:06.570> out<00:01:07.610> this<00:01:08.610> point<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.030> go

at this point we're bolts snugged down
