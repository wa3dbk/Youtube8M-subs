 his boat that is a touring boat

 specific boat for the shell it is 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.689
 better not have a layout have an arrangement 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.340
 best for practicing this sport 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.720
 now a motorboat was the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.719
 priority is st 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.690
 many banks will approach you if

 move with a lot of people in comfort 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.969
 if you do not have so much space to circulate 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.000
 inside the boat if there are not too many 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.980
 places to store fishing tackle 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.770
 which are often numerous you do not 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.239
 It has so much place to store fish. 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.280
 but how do you do with a speed boat? 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.280
 ride if you can improvise door several 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.219
 export meat chance is very easy already 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.550
 are sold on the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.559
 stores is just buy and install 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.380
 to take the fish you can buy a 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.619
 Thermal box is very easy to carry ice 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.750
 put fish in there to carry the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.000
 fishing tackle in the various panels of the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.880
 boat can condition a box of 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.250
 stripes for example so you have space 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.380
 the main its most difficult would be to 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.110
 getting a good right 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.049
 but all chips and you have the same 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.079
 front space in the race and another behind 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.820
 Then you can concentrate, you can stay 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.200
 during fisheries 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.960
 then you can use a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.869
 a stroll that can get in the way a bit 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.780
 in the fishing would then be a motorboat 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.670
 is usually 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.290
 centered on the control and the 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.880
 also enter then you can move 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.020
 around the command a boat of 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.399
 tour 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.500
 You have to choose or call you. 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.480
 stand still to fish 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.610
 so maybe this is the 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.320
 the greatest difficulty, but of course it can 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.630
 be used on your tour boat 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.640
 to fish mainly with the boat 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.640
 anchored with the boat stopped
