00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.730
 eight here in the other good video on video 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.070
 We are here for our third 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.200
 our third episode of our headquarters 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.519
 how to play doctor and good video people 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.560
 will talk a little more about how 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.750
 works the structure of a deck as it is 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.689
 that creatures behave as you do 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.390
 balances between earthly creatures are 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.400
 their sources of mana and other magic 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.400
 I hope you like it 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.260
 well come on then I shared that the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.360
 our three-part range right between 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.579
 the forests that are our sources of 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.280
 mana needed to conjure up our 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.620
 creatures and our magic in general 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.170
 this deck is a beque only green 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.489
 they can come here and it was there that I 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.230
 I created it now, it's not a beque 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.879
 competition to win tournaments in the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.440
 desktop version to show you 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.000
 how the team behaves during the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.550
 game and how do we balance 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.920
 between earthly and magical creatures and 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.730
 had to get it out of here 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.949
 good that here a whole deck and green 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.600
 I am using 24 fonts from an area 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.360
 Green are the demands sources 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.860
 necessary to conjure up our magic 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.340
 You can see here in the fashion course. 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.780
 when the camera wants to put the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.979
 camera and this I'm playing with 24 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.049
 forests 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.210
 sincerely if i were to take tectron 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.939
 tournament would not play with so many forests 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.560
 so because they were from here relatively 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.470
 light can you see we have 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.770
 enough creatures with only one human 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.049
 cost and then it could be 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.070
 easily played with 20 forest without 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.570
 no problem 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.369
 But how are you starting now? 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.650
 I advise you with more ground for you 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.770
 avoid means that this chaos in 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.869
 land or land - then 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 in this case here I think you have better 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.950
 more land which is less certain but 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.659
 finally this goes player per player 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.070
 good we have here our sources demand 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.409
 that it is necessary to conjure up 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.079
 our us the rest of our fan 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.820
 we have various creatures here I 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.219
 I try to balance between 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.780
 several courses of mana for example 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.509
 in the first round you will only have 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.220
 source of mana and is necessary to 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.190
 freeze for example the experiment a 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.819
 to run for example the mythical 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.560
 elf doctor 2 you 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.329
 you will probably already have two sources 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.129
 demand that is needed to cast 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.280
 for example our blush trailer that the 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.870
 our beast here in conjur there is also the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.680
 necroscopic report that a letter well 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.620
 cool 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.329
 already in turn 3 you will already have three 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.409
 weeks and maybe I will not have any more 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.599
 Assume you the time you are 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.389
 playing with plenty of ground 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.609
 You will then have to cast the 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.139
 Our site is well- sweated it costs two sleeves 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.030
 obligatorily see above any 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:43.010
 color in this case will be see why 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.749
 we only have one of the times you will have 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.370
 including some heavier brands 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:49.010
 such as our lupi the heart of 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.010
 silver and it costs 5 human but it is a letter 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.060
 well cool and good you can not 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.709
 simply in full of creatures 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.389
 because you are not going to have a 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.730
 start the game you will start playing 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.680
 there for the 5th shift and until then your already 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.239
 will have developed his entire table and 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.680
 You're going to have a big problem. 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.510
 can not simply make a 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.730
 deck only of creatures so but had not 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.060
 County there are strategies only use 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.159
 creatures but we'll show you a little 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.230
 of every thing besides fractures you go 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.299
 have more campaigns spells artifacts 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.159
 spells in this case that we only 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.379
 has magisterium and spells 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.430
 but you may be putting 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.680
 enchantments and artifacts also for 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.959
 leave the city ​​better 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.449
 the green is I already said in the previous video 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.430
 We have five colors, each one of them has 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:33.530
 I think its positive and negative points 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.569
 its advantages and disadvantages one 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.930
 green creatures have great creatures 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.939
 big as this and a 4/4 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.220
 advantage of green ne 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:44.959
 I think the same disadvantage is that the 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.540
 Kiss does not have many emotions for example 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.000
 if your opponent's power creature 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.709
 Okay, it 's just with the green mana. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.500
 It's hard for you to get her out of there. 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.120
 kill a green human creature exist 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.310
 few brands that do this 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.620
 the green a border is a color that 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.849
 quite knowledgeable creatures but not 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.889
 is very good for removal 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.409
 in this case here we have a removal 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:09.799
 I see it's the tone noise you're going to pay 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.599
 a mana in colorful human green for 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.739
 to destroy target creature with flying 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.539
 you see that the times emotions in several is 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.570
 several however sure have your creature 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:24.320
 destroys but it has to have powder or else 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.180
 I think you can understand it 's good, we 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.620
 here we have some magic like 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.520
 for example haze too 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.320
 and we have the vocation wild and some 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.460
 other things you can put on the 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.100
 its right as for example the 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.020
 rampant growth you pay 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.340
 a mother of the soccer program plus three more 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.340
 three until the end of the shift so if I 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.240
 had this creature at stake is a 4/4 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.260
 I used the exuberant growth in her 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.600
 unfortunately the Brazilians with the 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.620
 rampant growth in her she would 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:57.830
 a 7/7 a very nice letter 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.960
 Good, I'll advise you, okay. 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.900
 not a rule but I advise that 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.750
 you do dextotal - now in the beginning 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.419
 You have already learned to play and you have 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.090
 whole domain with several lands and I 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.520
 I would advise 2424 a good number despite the 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.510
 gay number but it's a good number of sneakers 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.520
 the dec 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.080
 You have to put more creatures. 7 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.180
 who play a lot by controlling the game of 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.919
 your opponent just because it can 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.229
 It sounds pretty cool, but it 's a bit more 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.000
 difficult to play with creatures then 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.270
 You'll really understand how 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.010
 does the damage to battle with such low 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.289
 and with some magic for you to go 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.810
 training you to use it without an answer 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.760
 something and you leave your credits 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.470
 such as our lupine 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.750
 with our getglue here that I had 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.680
 shown that the professional has taken over here 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:48.349
 It's fine here and I think that's what 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.120
