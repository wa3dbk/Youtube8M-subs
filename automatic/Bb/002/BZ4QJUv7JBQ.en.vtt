he<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.280> likes<00:00:44.520> carthage<00:00:45.120> MO<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:45.570> he<00:00:45.660> quickly

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
he just likes carthage MO but he quickly

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.150 
he just likes carthage MO but he quickly
picked<00:00:46.230> Carthage<00:00:46.649> when<00:00:46.800> he<00:00:46.860> entered<00:00:47.039> the

picked Carthage when he entered the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.270 
picked Carthage when he entered the
battle<00:00:47.309> before<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.760> could<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:49.140> sik<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:50.039> guess

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
battle before I could and I sik I guess

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.920 
battle before I could and I sik I guess
if<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.520> want<00:00:50.700> Carthage<00:00:51.090> let's<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:51.809> you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
if you want Carthage let's see if you

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.010 
if you want Carthage let's see if you
use<00:00:52.170> Carthage<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> picked<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
use Carthage like I do so I picked a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.119 
use Carthage like I do so I picked a
Roman<00:00:55.260> army<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.710> need<00:00:55.860> would<00:00:55.949> play

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
Roman army that I need would play

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.459 
Roman army that I need would play
against<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> could<00:00:57.780> play<00:00:57.870> against<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
against that I could play against the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.310 
against that I could play against the
weaknesses<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.129> Carthaginians<00:00:59.760> the

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
weaknesses of the Carthaginians the

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.910 
weaknesses of the Carthaginians the
Carthaginians<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> strength<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
Carthaginians have a strength and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.399 
Carthaginians have a strength and
cavalry<00:01:02.340> more<00:01:03.329> accurate<00:01:03.780> would<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.290> me<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
cavalry more accurate would be for me to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.230 
cavalry more accurate would be for me to
bring<00:01:04.739> Roman<00:01:05.250> cavalry<00:01:05.510> however<00:01:06.510> being<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
bring Roman cavalry however being I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.130 
bring Roman cavalry however being I
guess<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.360> should<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.600> brought<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:09.990> some

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
guess I should have brought like some

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.810 
guess I should have brought like some
auxiliary<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.740> some<00:01:10.979> Roman<00:01:11.280> cavalry<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
auxiliary and some Roman cavalry to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.280 
auxiliary and some Roman cavalry to
fight<00:01:12.000> his<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.960> would've<00:01:13.110> been<00:01:13.170> more

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
fight his that would've been more

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
fight his that would've been more
accurate<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.860> was<00:01:14.010> lazy<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.610> i<00:01:14.670> brought

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
accurate but I was lazy so i brought

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.490 
accurate but I was lazy so i brought
legionary<00:01:15.299> cavalry<00:01:15.750> which<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.080> face<00:01:16.259> off

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
legionary cavalry which can face off

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.490 
legionary cavalry which can face off
with<00:01:16.680> Sacred<00:01:17.040> Band<00:01:17.070> cavalry<00:01:18.020> I<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.380> it's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
with Sacred Band cavalry I think it's

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.660 
with Sacred Band cavalry I think it's
actually<00:01:19.799> probably<00:01:19.920> bit<00:01:20.189> better<00:01:20.400> which<00:01:20.640> is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
actually probably bit better which is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.420 
actually probably bit better which is
wholly<00:01:21.540> unrealistic<00:01:22.409> but<00:01:22.920> we're<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.310> going

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
wholly unrealistic but we're just going

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.100 
wholly unrealistic but we're just going
to<00:01:23.460> imagine<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> Romans<00:01:24.330> hired<00:01:24.570> some<00:01:24.930> nice

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
to imagine the Romans hired some nice

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.840 
to imagine the Romans hired some nice
logs<00:01:25.409> Ilya<00:01:25.710> cavalry<00:01:26.280> that's<00:01:26.520> what<00:01:26.700> we'll<00:01:26.790> call

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
logs Ilya cavalry that's what we'll call

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
logs Ilya cavalry that's what we'll call
this<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.320> front<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.680> my

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
this and then up front we have my

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.050 
this and then up front we have my
Praetorian<00:01:29.490> cohorts<00:01:30.350> sometimes<00:01:32.060> Praetorian

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
Praetorian cohorts sometimes Praetorian

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.460 
Praetorian cohorts sometimes Praetorian
cohorts<00:01:33.479> would<00:01:33.630> go<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> battle<00:01:34.079> with<00:01:34.229> your

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
cohorts would go to battle with your

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.710 
cohorts would go to battle with your
general<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.909> guess<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.240> also<00:01:36.390> feasible

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
general so I guess it's also feasible

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.469 
general so I guess it's also feasible
however<00:01:37.320> unlikely<00:01:37.970> once<00:01:38.970> again<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.360> was

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
however unlikely once again if I was

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.120 
however unlikely once again if I was
more<00:01:39.600> talented<00:01:39.990> i<00:01:40.079> would<00:01:40.200> use<00:01:40.380> da<00:01:40.500> legion<00:01:40.860> rico

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
more talented i would use da legion rico

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.859 
more talented i would use da legion rico
hordes<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.579> probably<00:01:41.850> could<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.000> won<00:01:42.090> now

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.720 
outflank them so i'm using my Rome and
maneuverability<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:56.980> quickly<00:02:57.340> move<00:02:57.489> around

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730

the flanks so these men here are going

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.720 
the flanks so these men here are going
to<00:03:02.049> take<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.260> beating<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.799> they're<00:03:03.400> about<00:03:03.549> to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
to take a beating that they're about to

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.270 
to take a beating that they're about to
be<00:03:03.849> assisted<00:03:04.330> from<00:03:04.540> behind<00:03:04.780> all<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.980> all<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
be assisted from behind all that all the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.039 
be assisted from behind all that all the
while<00:03:06.430> my<00:03:06.609> Roman<00:03:06.910> archers<00:03:07.180> are<00:03:07.329> just<00:03:07.480> firing<00:03:07.690> I

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
while my Roman archers are just firing I

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.900 
while my Roman archers are just firing I
guess<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.500> will<00:03:08.680> I<00:03:08.950> didn't<00:03:09.400> really<00:03:09.489> direct

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
guess that will I didn't really direct

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.259 
guess that will I didn't really direct
them<00:03:10.120> too<00:03:10.510> much<00:03:10.690> during<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.079> battle<00:03:11.820> so<00:03:12.820> any

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
them too much during this battle so any

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.479 
them too much during this battle so any
case<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.570> can<00:03:13.690> see<00:03:13.720> his<00:03:13.900> cavalry<00:03:14.200> rounded<00:03:14.650> my

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
case you can see his cavalry rounded my

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.250 
case you can see his cavalry rounded my
cavalry<00:03:15.850> is<00:03:15.970> pretty<00:03:16.150> beat<00:03:16.329> up<00:03:16.359> that<00:03:16.930> was<00:03:17.049> them

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
cavalry is pretty beat up that was them

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.900 
cavalry is pretty beat up that was them
that<00:03:17.769> was<00:03:17.859> a<00:03:17.890> pretty<00:03:18.010> close<00:03:18.220> fight<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.730> had

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
that was a pretty close fight and had

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.280 
that was a pretty close fight and had
his<00:03:19.090> other<00:03:19.269> units<00:03:19.630> made<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.109> fight

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.199 
his other units made it to the fight
quicker<00:03:20.560> um<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.489> may<00:03:21.640> have<00:03:21.760> turned<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.120> other

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
quicker um it may have turned the other

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.430 
quicker um it may have turned the other
way<00:03:23.819> so<00:03:24.819> he<00:03:25.239> needed<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.540> get<00:03:25.630> his<00:03:25.690> cavalry<00:03:26.109> into

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
way so he needed to get his cavalry into

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.229 
way so he needed to get his cavalry into
the<00:03:26.530> fight<00:03:26.709> faster<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.459> now<00:03:27.640> I've<00:03:27.819> got<00:03:28.030> these

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
the fight faster and now I've got these

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.960 
the fight faster and now I've got these
units<00:03:28.959> of<00:03:29.079> sacred<00:03:29.380> man<00:03:29.970> hopelessly

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
units of sacred man hopelessly

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.379 
units of sacred man hopelessly
surrounded<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.739> Ben<00:03:33.670> admits<00:03:34.150> defeat<00:03:36.389> so

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
surrounded and so Ben admits defeat so

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.080 
surrounded and so Ben admits defeat so
um<00:03:38.010> what<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.040> what<00:03:39.430> could<00:03:39.519> my<00:03:39.639> opponent<00:03:40.000> have

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
um what I what could my opponent have

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.360 
um what I what could my opponent have
done<00:03:40.239> better<00:03:40.420> in<00:03:40.600> this<00:03:40.690> video<00:03:41.069> he<00:03:42.069> should<00:03:42.280> have

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
done better in this video he should have

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.129 
done better in this video he should have
kept<00:03:42.579> his<00:03:42.700> failing<00:03:43.060> client<00:03:43.359> contiguous<00:03:43.900> and

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
kept his failing client contiguous and

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.559 
kept his failing client contiguous and
march<00:03:44.319> forward<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:44.920> fixed<00:03:45.700> nearly<00:03:46.060> all<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.239> my

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
march forward and fixed nearly all of my

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.930 
march forward and fixed nearly all of my
infantry<00:03:46.989> into<00:03:47.200> place<00:03:47.410> he<00:03:48.130> then<00:03:48.400> could<00:03:48.760> have

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
infantry into place he then could have

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.569 
infantry into place he then could have
either<00:03:49.660> busy<00:03:50.049> my<00:03:50.290> cavalry<00:03:50.709> or<00:03:51.010> defeated<00:03:51.459> my

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
either busy my cavalry or defeated my

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.180 
either busy my cavalry or defeated my
cavalry<00:03:51.970> with<00:03:52.209> better<00:03:52.389> maneuvering<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.200> that

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
cavalry with better maneuvering and that

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.710 
cavalry with better maneuvering and that
would<00:03:54.310> have<00:03:54.400> given<00:03:54.459> his<00:03:54.700> failings<00:03:55.090> line<00:03:55.299> time

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
would have given his failings line time

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.259 
would have given his failings line time
to<00:03:55.900> inflict<00:03:56.230> major<00:03:56.440> damage<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:57.430> my<00:03:57.819> infantry

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
to inflict major damage to my infantry

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.319 
to inflict major damage to my infantry
forces<00:03:59.250> and<00:04:00.250> even<00:04:00.819> though<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:00.940> would<00:04:01.120> have<00:04:01.209> had

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
forces and even though I would have had

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.479 
forces and even though I would have had
a<00:04:01.359> unit<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.810> out<00:04:01.900> flank<00:04:02.139> him<00:04:02.319> on<00:04:02.440> either<00:04:02.590> end<00:04:02.859> it

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
a unit to out flank him on either end it

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.590 
a unit to out flank him on either end it
would<00:04:03.609> have<00:04:03.700> just<00:04:03.730> been<00:04:03.850> one<00:04:04.150> unit<00:04:04.420> rather

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
would have just been one unit rather

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.390 
would have just been one unit rather
than<00:04:04.840> me<00:04:05.019> being<00:04:05.200> able<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.560> out<00:04:05.620> flank<00:04:05.859> him<00:04:06.069> with

than me being able to out flank him with

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.059
