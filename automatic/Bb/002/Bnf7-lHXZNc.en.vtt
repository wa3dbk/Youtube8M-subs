00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.880 

okay<00:00:19.090> so<00:00:19.150> we<00:00:19.480> have<00:00:19.660> here<00:00:20.110> a<00:00:21.000> dell<00:00:22.470> power<00:00:23.470> supply

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
okay so we have here a dell power supply

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.760 
okay so we have here a dell power supply
from<00:00:24.040> the<00:00:24.130> server<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.869> model<00:00:26.110> is<00:00:26.230> at<00:00:26.470> nine

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
from the server the model is at nine

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.890 
from the server the model is at nine
thirty<00:00:27.010> P<00:00:27.369> -<00:00:28.150> 2<00:00:28.330> 0<00:00:28.480> 0<00:00:30.180> and<00:00:31.180> here<00:00:31.480> is<00:00:31.510> what<00:00:31.720> needs

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
thirty P - 2 0 0 and here is what needs

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.590 
thirty P - 2 0 0 and here is what needs
to<00:00:31.990> be<00:00:32.140> done<00:00:32.290> to<00:00:33.120> power<00:00:34.120> up<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.600> system

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
to be done to power up the system

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.660 
to be done to power up the system
basically<00:00:39.150> jumper<00:00:40.150> needs<00:00:40.360> to<00:00:40.480> be<00:00:40.600> installed

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
basically jumper needs to be installed

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:51.299 
basically jumper needs to be installed
between<00:00:45.150> D<00:00:46.150> to<00:00:46.449> 10<00:00:47.080> and<00:00:48.780> minus<00:00:49.780> 12<00:00:50.280> which<00:00:51.280> is

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
between D to 10 and minus 12 which is

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.190 
between D to 10 and minus 12 which is
one<00:00:51.550> of<00:00:51.579> the<00:00:51.790> three<00:00:53.610> bars<00:00:54.610> on<00:00:55.270> the<00:00:55.809> left<00:00:55.840> side

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
one of the three bars on the left side

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.040 
one of the three bars on the left side
and<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:58.480> board<00:00:58.750> didn't<00:00:59.320> have<00:01:00.600> our<00:01:01.600> test

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
and this board didn't have our test

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.460 
and this board didn't have our test
switch<00:01:02.410> installed<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.420> what<00:01:04.809> I've<00:01:04.960> what<00:01:05.440> I

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
switch installed so what I've what I

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.230 
switch installed so what I've what I
have<00:01:05.680> done<00:01:05.860> is<00:01:06.100> installed<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.910> regular

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
have done is installed the regular

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.690 
have done is installed the regular
on/off<00:01:07.600> switch<00:01:07.869> right<00:01:08.220> there<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.369> the<00:01:09.399> board

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
on/off switch right there to the board

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.980 
on/off switch right there to the board
and<00:01:09.940> I'm<00:01:10.780> going<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:11.020> be<00:01:11.140> using<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:13.000> power

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
and I'm going to be using this to power

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.999 
and I'm going to be using this to power
the<00:01:14.940> system<00:01:15.940> up<00:01:16.300> as<00:01:17.289> you<00:01:17.649> see<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:19.000> green<00:01:19.240> light

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the system up as you see the green light

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.090 
the system up as you see the green light
indicating<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:23.020> voltage<00:01:23.410> connected<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:23.979> the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
indicating the voltage connected to the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.090 
indicating the voltage connected to the
power<00:01:24.280> supply<00:01:24.399> is<00:01:24.910> on<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.470> all<00:01:26.470> I'm<00:01:26.679> gonna<00:01:26.860> do

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
power supply is on and all I'm gonna do

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.320 
power supply is on and all I'm gonna do
right<00:01:27.250> now<00:01:27.310> is<00:01:27.490> switch<00:01:28.000> this<00:01:29.580> fan<00:01:30.580> kicks<00:01:30.850> in

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.640 

hope<00:01:34.330> we<00:01:34.599> go

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
hope we go

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.270 
hope we go
a<00:01:35.970> little<00:01:36.970> bit<00:01:37.060> noisy<00:01:37.480> but<00:01:37.660> that's<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:39.130> is

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
a little bit noisy but that's that is

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.969 
a little bit noisy but that's that is
something<00:01:39.640> that<00:01:39.700> I'm<00:01:39.880> gonna<00:01:40.030> work

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
something that I'm gonna work

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.890 
something that I'm gonna work
all<00:01:41.979> right

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.440 

the<00:01:44.990> voltage<00:01:45.380> from<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.620> moment

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
the voltage from the moment

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.950 
the voltage from the moment
voltmeter<00:01:47.079> which<00:01:47.619> is<00:01:47.649> Oh

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.210 

all<00:01:51.960> right<00:01:52.730> and<00:01:53.730> there's<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:54.300> voltage

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:08.730 

so

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.740 

perfect
