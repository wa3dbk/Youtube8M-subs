00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
and put it back through the loop like

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.310 
and put it back through the loop like
that<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.660> pull<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.200> then<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.309> get<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> nice

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320

now<00:01:59.950> yeah<00:02:00.460> it's<00:02:00.580> a<00:02:00.610> little<00:02:00.670> too<00:02:00.940> dark<00:02:01.090> but<00:02:01.720> here

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
now yeah it's a little too dark but here

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.420 
now yeah it's a little too dark but here
is<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.560> knife

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
is a knife

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.940 
is a knife
I<00:02:03.480> just<00:02:04.480> basically<00:02:04.840> keep<00:02:05.110> this<00:02:05.410> in<00:02:05.650> my<00:02:05.740> pocket

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
I just basically keep this in my pocket

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.530 
I just basically keep this in my pocket
I<00:02:06.280> don't<00:02:06.460> really<00:02:06.610> need<00:02:06.790> it<00:02:06.850> right<00:02:07.210> now

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
I don't really need it right now

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:14.670 
I don't really need it right now
and<00:02:08.380> then<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:12.510> think<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.750> way<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:13.990> throw<00:02:14.440> a

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
and then I think the way to throw a

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.460 
and then I think the way to throw a
kunai<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.640> think<00:02:16.090> their<00:02:16.210> code<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:16.750> kind<00:02:17.380> of

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
kunai I think their code is kind of

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.440 
kunai I think their code is kind of
placing<00:02:17.980> your<00:02:18.070> hand<00:02:18.460> like<00:02:18.700> this<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.210> then

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
placing your hand like this and then

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.630 
placing your hand like this and then
flick<00:02:20.140> your<00:02:20.260> wrist<00:02:20.470> forward<00:02:20.830> you're<00:02:21.310> going

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
flick your wrist forward you're going

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.830 
flick your wrist forward you're going
forward<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:23.910> try<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:24.940> I've<00:02:25.330> never<00:02:25.510> done<00:02:25.720> this

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
forward I try that I've never done this

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.010 
forward I try that I've never done this
before<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.460> don't<00:02:27.460> laugh<00:02:27.700> if<00:02:28.270> I<00:02:28.390> suck<00:02:28.720> at<00:02:28.870> it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
before so don't laugh if I suck at it

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.580 
before so don't laugh if I suck at it
but<00:02:29.290> whatever<00:02:31.020> alright<00:02:33.990> alright<00:02:34.990> so<00:02:35.410> at<00:02:35.530> least

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
but whatever alright alright so at least

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.790 
but whatever alright alright so at least
I<00:02:35.740> hit<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.570> this<00:02:37.570> thing<00:02:37.870> still<00:02:38.230> doll<00:02:38.530> like

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
I hit it this thing still doll like

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.720 
I hit it this thing still doll like
factory<00:02:39.420> just<00:02:40.420> came<00:02:40.630> out<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.520> space<00:02:42.520> go

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730
