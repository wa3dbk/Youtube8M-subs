00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
this stuff it doesn't work anymore you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.110

this<00:01:47.390> also<00:01:47.570> explains<00:01:48.080> like<00:01:48.260> why<00:01:48.410> Windows

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
this also explains like why Windows

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.000 
this also explains like why Windows
Vista<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.340> slow<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:49.910> anyways<00:01:50.720> take<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:51.590> this

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
Vista so slow so anyways take this this

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.010 
Vista so slow so anyways take this this
whole<00:01:52.250> computer<00:01:53.030> thing<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:53.960> whole

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
whole computer thing this whole

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.380 
whole computer thing this whole
motherboard<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:55.610> just<00:01:55.760> pull<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.120> out<00:01:56.240> of

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
motherboard and you just pull it out of

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.570 
motherboard and you just pull it out of
here<00:01:56.570> like<00:01:56.750> this<00:01:56.960> okay<00:01:57.440> just<00:01:58.040> set<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.550> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.790 
blueberry like a verizon wine in this in
this<00:02:07.610> case<00:02:07.910> in<00:02:08.119> this<00:02:08.270> machine<00:02:08.510> and<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.619> can

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
this case in this machine and you can

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.440 
this case in this machine and you can
take<00:02:09.979> that<00:02:10.010> and<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.429> can<00:02:10.610> use<00:02:10.790> it<00:02:10.820> if<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.180> want

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
take that and you can use it if you want

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.020 
take that and you can use it if you want
ok<00:02:12.290> so<00:02:12.380> just<00:02:12.620> set<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:12.860> over<00:02:13.010> here<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.670> that's

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
ok so just set that over here and that's

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.330 
ok so just set that over here and that's
usually<00:02:14.300> used<00:02:14.660> for<00:02:14.870> your<00:02:15.200> modem<00:02:15.980> in<00:02:16.160> the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
usually used for your modem in the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.420 
usually used for your modem in the
computer<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.910> then<00:02:17.480> under<00:02:17.900> here<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:19.280> will

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
computer and then under here you will

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.600 
computer and then under here you will
see<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.970> gameboy<00:02:20.930> color<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.500> we<00:02:22.250> never<00:02:22.370> know

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
see a gameboy color and we never know

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.030 
see a gameboy color and we never know
what<00:02:22.820> game<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.270> going<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.420> be<00:02:23.510> in<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.780> but<00:02:24.320> in

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
what game is going to be in it but in

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.520 
what game is going to be in it but in
this<00:02:25.190> case<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.760> looks<00:02:25.880> like<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.300> got<00:02:26.540> Galaga

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
this case it looks like it's got Galaga

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.210 
this case it looks like it's got Galaga
and<00:02:27.739> then<00:02:29.050> there's<00:02:30.050> also<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.350> battery<00:02:30.830> hack<00:02:31.010> you

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
and then there's also a battery hack you

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.220 
and then there's also a battery hack you
can<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.459> find<00:02:31.790> some<00:02:31.970> batteries<00:02:32.390> in<00:02:33.170> your

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
can you find some batteries in your

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.260 
can you find some batteries in your
Gameboy<00:02:33.800> because<00:02:34.430> there<00:02:34.610> has<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:35.000> be<00:02:35.030> that's

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
Gameboy because there has to be that's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.590 
Gameboy because there has to be that's
what<00:02:35.420> keeps<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.860> bios<00:02:36.860> clock<00:02:37.250> going<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:37.850> the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
what keeps the bios clock going is the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.510 
what keeps the bios clock going is the
battery<00:02:38.989> power<00:02:39.170> from<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.709> from<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.280> Game<00:02:40.489> Boy

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
battery power from the from the Game Boy

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.470 
battery power from the from the Game Boy
so<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.180> just<00:02:41.330> set<00:02:41.450> this<00:02:41.570> aside<00:02:41.750> two<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:43.480> we'll

so I just set this aside two and we'll

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.900 
so I just set this aside two and we'll
set<00:02:44.630> this<00:02:44.780> aside<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:46.070> next<00:02:46.250> thing<00:02:46.489> you're

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910

set this aside and the next thing you're
going<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.120> find<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.690> Nintendo<00:02:48.260> zapper

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150
