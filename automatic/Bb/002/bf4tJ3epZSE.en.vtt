chain so let's get started what you'll

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.250 
chain so let's get started what you'll
need<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.369> project<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:30.269> chain<00:00:30.810> from<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
need for this project is chain from the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.160 
need for this project is chain from the
hardware<00:00:31.619> store<00:00:31.910> this<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> metal<00:00:33.540> chain<00:00:33.780> and
