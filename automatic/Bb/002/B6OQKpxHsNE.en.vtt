there is a volcano in Seattle some

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:21.920 
there is a volcano in Seattle some
reason<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.590> always<00:04:15.260> maybe<00:04:16.260> it's<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:16.620> cuz<00:04:20.930> when

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
reason I always maybe it's just cuz when

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.320 
reason I always maybe it's just cuz when
I<00:04:21.959> see<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.860> pictures<00:04:23.010> of<00:04:23.220> Matt<00:04:23.400> one<00:04:23.550> years<00:04:23.760> how
