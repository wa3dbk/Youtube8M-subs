00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
moisture and I I love this I used to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.710 
moisture and I I love this I used to
have<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:04.830> part<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.430> my<00:01:05.519> leg<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.420> would

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
have this one part on my leg that would

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.660 
have this one part on my leg that would
keep<00:01:06.930> rashing<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> think<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.310> because

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
keep rashing up and I think it's because

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.969 
keep rashing up and I think it's because
maybe<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.270> dryness<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:10.320> would<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.619> keep<00:01:10.740> like

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
maybe of dryness it would just keep like

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.830 
maybe of dryness it would just keep like
getting<00:01:11.400> itchy<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.790> rash<00:01:11.909> either<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:12.600> that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
getting itchy and rash either but that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.800 
getting itchy and rash either but that
rarely<00:01:13.200> ever<00:01:13.560> happens<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.330> could<00:01:15.630> be

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
rarely ever happens now and it could be

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.200 
rarely ever happens now and it could be
because<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.799> lotion<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.820> recently
