00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
thousand but it took me a long time

200<00:02:15.810> hits<00:02:16.340> still<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.730> only<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:18.120> 3<00:02:18.390> hearts

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
200 hits still you only have 3 hearts

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.600 
200 hits still you only have 3 hearts
and<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.590> little<00:02:19.800> bit<00:02:19.920> tricky<00:02:20.280> out<00:02:20.370> where

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
and it's a little bit tricky out where

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.150 
and it's a little bit tricky out where
you<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:21.000> start<00:02:21.030> using<00:02:21.420> your<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:22.620> special

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
you have to start using your a special

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.620 
you have to start using your a special
sack<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:24.530> more<00:02:25.530> be<00:02:25.770> attacks<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.540> do

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
sack and more be attacks and you can do

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.480 
sack and more be attacks and you can do
loads<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.990> backflips<00:02:28.440> as<00:02:28.709> well<00:02:28.890> by<00:02:29.040> holding

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
loads of backflips as well by holding

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.490 
loads of backflips as well by holding
down<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:30.330> control<00:02:30.660> stick<00:02:30.870> backwards<00:02:31.320> and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
down the control stick backwards and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.380 
down the control stick backwards and
pressing<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.820> can<00:02:32.970> get<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.209> away

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
pressing a and that can get you away

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.570 
pressing a and that can get you away
from<00:02:33.420> him<00:02:33.750> faster<00:02:34.320> if<00:02:34.530> you're<00:02:34.830> afraid<00:02:35.190> of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
from him faster if you're afraid of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.210 
from him faster if you're afraid of
getting<00:02:36.150> hit<00:02:36.330> without<00:02:36.930> blocking<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:38.190> can

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
getting hit without blocking you can

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.920 
getting hit without blocking you can
just<00:02:38.520> quickly<00:02:38.670> backflip<00:02:39.239> away<00:02:39.450> from<00:02:39.630> him<00:02:39.780> and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
just quickly backflip away from him and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.290 
just quickly backflip away from him and
that'll<00:02:40.800> help<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.580> survive<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:42.150> just

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
that'll help you survive and then just

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.120 
that'll help you survive and then just
quickly<00:02:42.540> run<00:02:42.690> up<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.080> them<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.260> start<00:02:43.410> hacking

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
quickly run up to them and start hacking

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.380 
quickly run up to them and start hacking
them<00:02:44.340> away<00:02:44.550> with<00:02:44.700> be<00:02:44.910> again<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:47.090> couldn't<00:02:48.090> do<00:02:48.360> a

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
them away with be again I couldn't do a

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.229 
them away with be again I couldn't do a
video<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.140> because<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:50.340> don't<00:02:51.150> have

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
video of this because I don't have

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.180 
video of this because I don't have
anything<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.900> record<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.380> with<00:02:52.530> which<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.160> a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
anything to record it with which is a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.949 
anything to record it with which is a
real<00:02:53.400> shame<00:02:53.430> because<00:02:54.000> then<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.720> would<00:02:54.870> have

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
real shame because then I would have

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.530 
real shame because then I would have
been<00:02:55.050> noted<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.440> tutorial<00:02:55.820> but<00:02:56.820> seeing<00:02:57.420> as<00:02:57.480> I

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
been noted to a tutorial but seeing as I

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.390 
been noted to a tutorial but seeing as I
can't<00:02:57.780> do<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.050> I've<00:02:58.290> decided<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.860> just<00:02:59.190> do

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
can't do that I've decided to just do

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.440 
can't do that I've decided to just do
pictures<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.390> what<00:03:00.750> I've<00:03:01.530> done<00:03:01.880> yesterday<00:03:02.880> and

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
pictures of what I've done yesterday and

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.770 
pictures of what I've done yesterday and
so<00:03:06.450> all<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:07.050> really<00:03:07.110> need<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.620> do<00:03:07.800> is<00:03:08.040> use<00:03:08.340> be<00:03:08.780> /

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
so all you really need to do is use be /

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.610 
so all you really need to do is use be /
attacks<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:11.000> jumper<00:03:12.000> tax<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:13.019> special

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
attacks a jumper tax and a special

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.940 
attacks a jumper tax and a special
attacks<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:15.060> also<00:03:15.180> need<00:03:15.450> are<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:16.260> defend

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
attacks and you also need are to defend

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.680 
attacks and you also need are to defend
you<00:03:17.100> with<00:03:17.220> your<00:03:17.400> shield<00:03:17.610> that's<00:03:18.209> all<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.510> need

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
you with your shield that's all you need

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.350 
you with your shield that's all you need
and<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.709> have<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:19.980> use<00:03:20.010> them<00:03:20.370> in<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.700> right

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
and you have to use them in the right

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.770 
and you have to use them in the right
timing<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:22.010> also<00:03:23.010> came<00:03:23.340> up<00:03:23.519> with<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.790> combo<00:03:24.420> move

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
timing I also came up with a combo move

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.710 
timing I also came up with a combo move
which<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.769> hit<00:03:26.010> him<00:03:26.100> four<00:03:26.400> times<00:03:26.430> with<00:03:26.790> B<00:03:27.030> then

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
which you hit him four times with B then

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.170 
which you hit him four times with B then
using<00:03:28.049> a<00:03:28.140> jump<00:03:28.440> attack<00:03:28.530> him<00:03:29.400> four<00:03:29.670> times<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:30.060> B

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
using a jump attack him four times of B

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.210 
using a jump attack him four times of B
again<00:03:30.269> then<00:03:30.720> using<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:31.110> special<00:03:31.530> attack<00:03:31.769> four

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
again then using a special attack four

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.060 
again then using a special attack four
times<00:03:32.430> would<00:03:32.610> be<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:33.110> attack<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.410> jump<00:03:34.980> attack

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
times would be a attack a jump attack

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.009 
times would be a attack a jump attack
then<00:03:35.579> four<00:03:35.880> times<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.150> day<00:03:36.180> again<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.720> special

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
then four times a day again a special

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.440 
then four times a day again a special
packing<00:03:37.500> because<00:03:38.040> usually<00:03:38.820> when<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.299> do<00:03:39.420> a

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
packing because usually when you do a

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.100 
packing because usually when you do a
jump<00:03:39.750> attack<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.380> stops<00:03:40.769> him<00:03:41.010> attacking<00:03:41.310> you

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
jump attack it stops him attacking you

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.660 
jump attack it stops him attacking you
but<00:03:43.110> you<00:03:43.260> can<00:03:43.440> still<00:03:43.650> get<00:03:43.769> some<00:03:43.950> hits<00:03:44.100> in<00:03:44.310> but

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
but you can still get some hits in but

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.960 
but you can still get some hits in but
if<00:03:44.790> we<00:03:44.910> if<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.630> hit<00:03:45.900> him<00:03:46.049> but<00:03:47.010> he<00:03:47.190> blocks<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.760> I

if we if you hit him but he blocks it I

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.780 
if we if you hit him but he blocks it I
suggest<00:03:48.840> holding<00:03:49.079> down<00:03:49.380> our<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:50.070> defend<00:03:50.640> with

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
suggest holding down our to defend with

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.370 
suggest holding down our to defend with
your<00:03:50.940> shield<00:03:51.120> because<00:03:51.420> otherwise<00:03:51.989> you're

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
your shield because otherwise you're

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.819 
your shield because otherwise you're
likely<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.799> get<00:03:53.040> hit<00:03:54.110> unless<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.350> can<00:03:55.620> back

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
likely to get hit unless you can back

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.590 
likely to get hit unless you can back
without<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.370> way<00:03:56.489> before<00:03:56.850> he<00:03:56.910> manages<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.360> hit

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
without the way before he manages to hit

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.650 
without the way before he manages to hit
you<00:03:57.780> then<00:03:58.610> that'd<00:03:59.610> be<00:03:59.640> okay<00:04:00.030> or<00:04:00.299> if<00:04:00.510> you

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
you then that'd be okay or if you

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.009 
you then that'd be okay or if you
quickly<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.500> know<00:04:01.620> sidestep<00:04:02.720> but<00:04:03.720> that's<00:04:03.870> a

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
quickly you know sidestep but that's a

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.420 
quickly you know sidestep but that's a
bit<00:04:04.170> more<00:04:04.290> tricky<00:04:04.500> because<00:04:04.769> sometimes<00:04:05.280> he

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
bit more tricky because sometimes he

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.979 
bit more tricky because sometimes he
slides<00:04:05.700> along<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.150> floor<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.570> you<00:04:06.690> can<00:04:06.840> get

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
slides along the floor and you can get

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.479 
slides along the floor and you can get
hit<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:09.750> only<00:04:10.049> other<00:04:10.200> way<00:04:10.709> which<00:04:11.160> is<00:04:11.190> a

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
hit and the only other way which is a

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.930 
hit and the only other way which is a
really<00:04:11.880> slow<00:04:12.390> way<00:04:12.660> but<00:04:13.140> it's<00:04:13.519> very<00:04:14.519> high

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
really slow way but it's very high

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.180 
really slow way but it's very high
protection<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.440> you're<00:04:16.560> not<00:04:16.709> likely<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:17.010> get

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
protection and you're not likely to get

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.539 
protection and you're not likely to get
hurt<00:04:17.340> at<00:04:17.489> all<00:04:17.640> is<00:04:17.880> by<00:04:18.479> keep<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:19.190> if<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.400> keep

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
hurt at all is by keep and if you keep

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.700 
hurt at all is by keep and if you keep
backing<00:04:20.880> away<00:04:21.090> from<00:04:21.239> him<00:04:21.599> and<00:04:21.780> using<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.320> jumper

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
backing away from him and using a jumper

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.960 
backing away from him and using a jumper
thax<00:04:22.979> and<00:04:23.340> every<00:04:23.970> so<00:04:24.120> often<00:04:24.300> doing<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.690> special

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
thax and every so often doing a special

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.270 
thax and every so often doing a special
back<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.390> maybe<00:04:25.510> a<00:04:25.630> few<00:04:25.660> be<00:04:25.990> attacks<00:04:26.290> it<00:04:26.860> keeps

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
back and maybe a few be attacks it keeps

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.090 
back and maybe a few be attacks it keeps
you<00:04:27.400> safe<00:04:27.700> but<00:04:28.000> it's<00:04:28.780> a<00:04:29.050> very<00:04:29.080> very<00:04:29.530> slow

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
you safe but it's a very very slow

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.670 
you safe but it's a very very slow
method<00:04:31.410> so<00:04:32.410> I<00:04:32.680> wouldn't<00:04:33.100> suggest<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:35.320> if

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
method so I wouldn't suggest it so if

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.550 
method so I wouldn't suggest it so if
you're<00:04:35.950> really<00:04:36.520> really<00:04:37.000> into<00:04:37.480> getting<00:04:37.750> 1,000

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
you're really really into getting 1,000

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.520 
you're really really into getting 1,000
hits<00:04:38.710> then<00:04:39.610> make<00:04:40.360> sure<00:04:40.390> you<00:04:40.810> hit<00:04:40.990> him<00:04:41.140> enough

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
hits then make sure you hit him enough

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.060 
hits then make sure you hit him enough
times<00:04:41.830> but<00:04:42.250> not<00:04:42.370> too<00:04:42.550> much<00:04:42.580> and<00:04:43.260> block<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.920> keep

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
times but not too much and block to keep

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.640 
times but not too much and block to keep
you<00:04:45.160> safe<00:04:45.400> and<00:04:45.810> often<00:04:46.810> but<00:04:47.050> not<00:04:47.170> too<00:04:47.320> often

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
you safe and often but not too often

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
you safe and often but not too often
because<00:04:47.770> otherwise<00:04:48.100> you<00:04:48.310> won't<00:04:48.430> get<00:04:48.610> very

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
because otherwise you won't get very

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.610 
because otherwise you won't get very
nice<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.420> will<00:04:49.600> take<00:04:49.720> you<00:04:49.810> ages<00:04:50.050> to<00:04:50.470> get<00:04:50.560> a

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
nice and it will take you ages to get a

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.290 
nice and it will take you ages to get a
thousand<00:04:51.100> but<00:04:51.730> as<00:04:51.820> long<00:04:51.970> as<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.150> keep

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
thousand but as long as you keep

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.510 
thousand but as long as you keep
yourself<00:04:52.420> safe<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.470> on<00:04:53.620> target<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:54.280> get<00:04:54.370> in<00:04:54.460> a

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
yourself safe and on target to get in a

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.220 
yourself safe and on target to get in a
thousand<00:04:54.970> then<00:04:55.090> you<00:04:55.180> will<00:04:55.360> get<00:04:55.570> a<00:04:55.630> thousand<00:04:56.080> I

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
thousand then you will get a thousand I

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.830 
thousand then you will get a thousand I
promise<00:04:56.680> I<00:04:56.940> mean<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.030> first<00:04:58.180> time<00:04:58.330> I<00:04:58.450> tried<00:04:58.810> it

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
promise I mean the first time I tried it

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.570 
promise I mean the first time I tried it
I<00:04:58.960> got<00:04:59.260> less<00:04:59.440> than<00:04:59.470> 500<00:04:59.890> then<00:05:00.850> I<00:05:01.000> got<00:05:01.440> around

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
I got less than 500 then I got around

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.990 
I got less than 500 then I got around
707<00:05:03.600> then<00:05:04.710> on<00:05:05.710> my<00:05:06.070> last<00:05:06.250> picture<00:05:06.670> I<00:05:06.730> got<00:05:06.990> 998

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
707 then on my last picture I got 998

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.550 
707 then on my last picture I got 998
which<00:05:10.000> was<00:05:10.270> really<00:05:10.570> annoying<00:05:10.750> because<00:05:11.350> that's

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
which was really annoying because that's

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.670 
which was really annoying because that's
two<00:05:11.710> away<00:05:12.090> so<00:05:13.090> I<00:05:13.120> tried<00:05:13.450> again<00:05:13.660> got<00:05:14.170> a<00:05:14.200> thousand

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
two away so I tried again got a thousand

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.370 
two away so I tried again got a thousand
and<00:05:14.800> you<00:05:14.970> get<00:05:15.970> the<00:05:16.300> title<00:05:16.600> of<00:05:16.840> master

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
and you get the title of master

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.620 
and you get the title of master
swordsman<00:05:17.860> and<00:05:18.300> 200<00:05:19.300> rupees<00:05:21.090> it's<00:05:22.090> best<00:05:22.330> if

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
swordsman and 200 rupees it's best if

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.420 
swordsman and 200 rupees it's best if
you<00:05:22.900> have<00:05:23.050> an<00:05:23.200> empty<00:05:23.530> wallet<00:05:23.740> before<00:05:24.040> you<00:05:24.310> do

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
you have an empty wallet before you do

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.900 
you have an empty wallet before you do
this<00:05:24.610> otherwise<00:05:25.090> you're<00:05:25.450> likely<00:05:25.660> to<00:05:26.640> not<00:05:27.640> get

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
this otherwise you're likely to not get

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.130 
this otherwise you're likely to not get
any<00:05:28.060> rupees<00:05:28.419> at<00:05:28.540> all<00:05:28.690> and<00:05:28.840> it's<00:05:28.960> pretty

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
any rupees at all and it's pretty

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.400 
any rupees at all and it's pretty
pointless<00:05:29.410> and<00:05:30.600> also<00:05:31.600> while<00:05:31.900> you're<00:05:31.930> in<00:05:32.200> there

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
pointless and also while you're in there

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.550 
pointless and also while you're in there
if<00:05:32.680> you<00:05:33.010> have<00:05:33.220> ten<00:05:33.820> night<00:05:34.150> crests<00:05:34.750> you<00:05:35.290> can

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
if you have ten night crests you can

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.700 
if you have ten night crests you can
trade<00:05:36.190> them<00:05:36.370> with<00:05:36.430> them<00:05:36.760> to<00:05:36.970> get<00:05:37.120> a<00:05:37.330> be<00:05:37.990> special

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
trade them with them to get a be special

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.219 
trade them with them to get a be special
attack<00:05:39.040> where<00:05:40.030> you<00:05:40.240> if<00:05:40.479> you<00:05:40.600> hold<00:05:40.810> down<00:05:40.900> be

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
attack where you if you hold down be

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.710 
attack where you if you hold down be
linked<00:05:41.710> will<00:05:42.160> hold<00:05:42.490> us<00:05:42.640> all<00:05:42.850> behind<00:05:43.000> him<00:05:43.240> it

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
linked will hold us all behind him it

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.830 
linked will hold us all behind him it
will<00:05:43.840> charge<00:05:44.050> up<00:05:44.350> with<00:05:44.620> a<00:05:44.650> yellow<00:05:45.070> light<00:05:45.400> and

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
will charge up with a yellow light and

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.800 
will charge up with a yellow light and
it's<00:05:46.840> a<00:05:47.050> massive<00:05:47.470> spin<00:05:47.710> attack<00:05:48.120> it's<00:05:49.120> pretty

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
it's a massive spin attack it's pretty

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.320 
it's a massive spin attack it's pretty
good<00:05:49.900> for<00:05:50.110> swarmed<00:05:50.680> enemies<00:05:51.100> because<00:05:51.820> it<00:05:52.120> can

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
good for swarmed enemies because it can

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.390 
good for swarmed enemies because it can
get<00:05:52.479> them<00:05:52.600> you<00:05:53.140> know<00:05:53.260> hit<00:05:53.440> them<00:05:53.590> all<00:05:53.650> away<00:05:53.800> blow

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
get them you know hit them all away blow

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.870 
get them you know hit them all away blow
them<00:05:54.550> up<00:05:54.750> but<00:05:55.750> it<00:05:56.229> does<00:05:56.830> make<00:05:57.100> you<00:05:57.160> dizzy<00:05:57.550> after

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
them up but it does make you dizzy after

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.350 
them up but it does make you dizzy after
so<00:05:58.600> you<00:05:59.200> spin<00:05:59.590> around<00:05:59.620> about<00:06:00.070> 10<00:06:00.580> times<00:06:00.850> you

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
so you spin around about 10 times you

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.190 
so you spin around about 10 times you
know<00:06:01.450> ah<00:06:01.750> but<00:06:02.710> then<00:06:02.880> you<00:06:03.880> stand<00:06:04.270> there<00:06:04.510> dizzy

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
know ah but then you stand there dizzy

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.200 
know ah but then you stand there dizzy
so<00:06:05.650> you<00:06:05.950> can't<00:06:06.160> actually<00:06:06.280> do<00:06:06.640> anything<00:06:06.669> for<00:06:07.180> a

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
so you can't actually do anything for a

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.180 
so you can't actually do anything for a
little<00:06:07.330> bit<00:06:07.479> so<00:06:07.690> it's<00:06:07.810> best<00:06:08.020> to<00:06:08.200> use<00:06:08.229> on<00:06:08.590> week

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
little bit so it's best to use on week

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.409 
little bit so it's best to use on week
at<00:06:09.370> enemies<00:06:09.610> where<00:06:09.910> you<00:06:09.970> don't<00:06:10.030> have<00:06:10.150> to<00:06:10.330> hit

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
at enemies where you don't have to hit

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.200
