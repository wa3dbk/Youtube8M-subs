00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.400
 again and again I get the request 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.440
 analogously that if everything is so today 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.210
 interesting is to return with 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.340
 the wolves to germany the from 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.110
 alone, yes, spread it out and it 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.680
 will be exciting think I watch 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.680
 how many new messages about puppies 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.050
 we have births this year or where 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.760
 wolves arrive or show where they are 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.519
 have not been spotted before 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.989
 However, the question is why do you have them 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.879
 because then only in the middle ages 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.420
 eradicated because that's all today 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.220
 great is why they have been eradicated 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.710
 the reason is that in the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.809
 Middle ages and that is a development 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.400
 the over decades and sometimes yes 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.350
 even less so centuries ago 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.210
 has happened completely different 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.260
 boundary conditions here in Germany 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.570
 prevailed 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.580
 behind me is such a wilderness-like 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.239
 landscape grown here with us in the 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.610
 At that time in the moment where the 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.650
 man from the hunter and collector in the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.920
 sedentary, therefore, the normalized 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.740
 he gave up life changed he caught 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.660
 on forests to clear soil 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.820
 Of course, that was the small develop 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.680
 But with the increase of the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.780
 Human population in the area 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.880
 with the increase in forest clearing 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.660
 or the changes in the 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.640
 agriculture or in the countryside has 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.100
 one also just noticed at the time 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.080
 with research like that today prove that 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.030
 the wild animal population at that time in the 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.180
 were not that high in the middle ages 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.680
 like today in our times 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.530
 in addition, that was also the time where 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.380
 more and more farm animals in the form of sheep 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.210
 goats may be the horses of the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.409
 Many were kept by the farmers 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.140
 Of course, their own survival 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.909
 secured also compulsory contributions were too 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.070
 contribute to the high nobility 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.610
 By the way, it was the high nobility alone 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.120
 who was allowed to hunt and gradually 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.650
 as mentioned above over decades 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.560
 this boundary conditions increased 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.540
 more and more in a competitive situation 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.840
 between the farmers and the wolves 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.120
 into it because wolves are wolfing more and more 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.090
 were forced by the wild animals 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.769
 distance and also quite 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.220
 in the larger frame to the farm animals too 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.140
 orient that if that really is 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.209
 important basis of life for the farmers 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.580
 so they were torn by the wolves 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.290
 have caused massive damage that 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.769
 That's not exactly the joy of the farmers 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.420
 of course it came over today 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.230
 100 years where the wolves are back 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.150
 spread 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.610
 we find in our agriculture 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.549
 completely different frame conditions again us 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.680
 have big fattening farms where pigs and 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.629
 chickens are fattened so we can feed them 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.650
 always as humans can consume too 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.750
 in the field of dairy farming 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.670
 seems to be a lot to this day 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.040
 the stables are getting bigger and bigger 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.560
 more and more cows that are there too 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.090
 less to see the daylight 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.430
 that is, the grazing becomes 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.560
 probably in the next few years 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.290
 few decades probably too 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.150
 change so that this 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.140
 boundary conditions also for wolves 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.319
 change significantly 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.860
 which does not mean that wölfl 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.870
 in some cases, certainly 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.569
 in the area of ​​the house uses animals 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.569
 to look around, especially in sheep 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.250
 dear viewers, if you also ask 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.080
 have been around the topic of wolves in 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.230
 germany, we are glad if you us 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.360
 this under info at wolfcenter de 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.010
 put this in one 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.310
 answer next video for you 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.310
 can
