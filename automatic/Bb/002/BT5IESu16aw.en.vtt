a<00:00:19.150> little<00:00:19.480> bit<00:00:19.600> easier<00:00:20.110> finally<00:00:20.920> when<00:00:21.070> we

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.190 
a little bit easier finally when we

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.040 
a little bit easier finally when we
finish<00:00:21.520> this<00:00:21.670> off<00:00:21.910> we'll<00:00:22.270> go<00:00:22.300> ahead<00:00:22.510> and<00:00:22.930> look

finish this off we'll go ahead and look
at<00:00:23.140> some<00:00:23.290> considerations<00:00:24.040> when<00:00:24.190> we<00:00:24.310> get<00:00:24.460> into

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
at some considerations when we get into

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.580 
at some considerations when we get into
the<00:00:24.760> rendering<00:00:25.240> of<00:00:25.360> it<00:00:25.480> just<00:00:26.110> so<00:00:26.230> you<00:00:26.290> can<00:00:26.440> be

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
the rendering of it just so you can be

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.230 
the rendering of it just so you can be
prepared<00:00:26.770> to<00:00:27.130> deal<00:00:27.580> with<00:00:27.760> some<00:00:27.880> of<00:00:28.000> the<00:00:28.060> things

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
prepared to deal with some of the things

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.960 
prepared to deal with some of the things
that<00:00:28.360> happen<00:00:28.810> with<00:00:28.990> anime<00:00:29.440> studio<00:00:29.740> pro<00:00:30.220> 5<00:00:30.550> all

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
that happen with anime studio pro 5 all

that happen with anime studio pro 5 all
right<00:00:31.210> let's<00:00:31.540> take<00:00:31.720> a<00:00:31.780> look<00:00:32.020> at<00:00:32.140> the<00:00:32.259> scene<00:00:32.500> and

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
right let's take a look at the scene and

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.340 
right let's take a look at the scene and
so<00:00:32.800> we've<00:00:33.010> got<00:00:33.219> here<00:00:33.489> obviously<00:00:34.059> we've<00:00:34.929> got<00:00:35.199> an

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
so we've got here obviously we've got an

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.169 
so we've got here obviously we've got an
imported<00:00:35.829> frog<00:00:36.070> you<00:00:36.249> can<00:00:36.399> barely<00:00:36.640> tell<00:00:36.760> right

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:37.179 
imported frog you can barely tell right

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:39.299 
imported frog you can barely tell right
there<00:00:37.210> and<00:00:37.510> let<00:00:37.629> me<00:00:37.749> zoom<00:00:37.960> in<00:00:38.199> on<00:00:38.379> the

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
there and let me zoom in on the

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.160 
there and let me zoom in on the
workspace<00:00:39.820> just<00:00:40.059> a<00:00:40.179> little<00:00:40.390> bit<00:00:40.510> we're<00:00:41.140> a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
workspace just a little bit we're a

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.829 
workspace just a little bit we're a
timeline<00:00:42.039> 0<00:00:42.609> so<00:00:43.179> there<00:00:43.390> has<00:00:43.539> been<00:00:43.719> no

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
timeline 0 so there has been no

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:45.569 
timeline 0 so there has been no
animation<00:00:44.199> applied<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.800> Frog<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:45.309> in

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
fact there's no animation applied to

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.130 
fact there's no animation applied to
this<00:00:47.620> scene<00:00:47.949> yet<00:00:48.159> other<00:00:48.760> than<00:00:48.999> having<00:00:49.929> the

across but maybe didn't notice or
realize<00:01:01.749> the<00:01:01.989> importance<00:01:02.379> of<00:01:02.499> it<00:01:02.649> when<00:01:02.920> you

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
realize the importance of it when you

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.850 
realize the importance of it when you
saw<00:01:03.699> them<00:01:03.909> in<00:01:04.120> the<00:01:04.300> preferences<00:01:05.050> and<00:01:05.199> presets

when you go look at the working files
there<00:05:43.360> will<00:05:43.450> be<00:05:43.510> two<00:05:43.870> frog<00:05:44.440> master<00:05:45.210> actions

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
there will be two frog master actions

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.810 
there will be two frog master actions
one<00:05:47.050> says<00:05:47.320> group<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:47.860> one<00:05:47.979> just<00:05:48.190> says<00:05:48.310> actions

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
one says group and one just says actions

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.659 
one says group and one just says actions
one<00:05:49.090> we<00:05:49.450> built<00:05:49.780> all<00:05:50.110> the<00:05:50.710> actions<00:05:51.100> on<00:05:51.250> action

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
one we built all the actions on action

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.610 
one we built all the actions on action
one<00:05:51.910> and<00:05:52.150> I'm<00:05:52.570> going<00:05:52.780> to<00:05:52.870> keep<00:05:53.050> that<00:05:53.260> because

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
one and I'm going to keep that because

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.310 
one and I'm going to keep that because
when<00:05:53.800> we<00:05:53.919> import<00:05:54.460> we<00:05:54.610> can<00:05:54.790> do<00:05:54.970> that<00:05:55.180> by<00:05:55.450> eyes<00:05:55.720> by

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
when we import we can do that by eyes by

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.460 
when we import we can do that by eyes by
itself<00:05:56.680> mouth<00:05:57.250> by<00:05:57.580> head<00:05:57.880> however<00:05:58.720> I<00:05:58.810> also<00:05:58.990> want

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
itself mouth by head however I also want

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.710 
itself mouth by head however I also want
the<00:05:59.590> option<00:05:59.740> to<00:05:59.919> bring<00:06:00.370> and<00:06:00.580> the<00:06:00.850> frog<00:06:01.090> in<00:06:01.300> its

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
the option to bring and the frog in its

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.480 
the option to bring and the frog in its
entirety<00:06:02.229> and<00:06:02.470> not<00:06:02.590> have<00:06:02.740> to<00:06:02.860> keep<00:06:03.040> importing

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
entirety and not have to keep importing

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.270 
entirety and not have to keep importing
each<00:06:03.790> layer<00:06:04.120> so<00:06:04.840> with<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.050> frog<00:06:05.380> group<00:06:05.740> I<00:06:05.890> can<00:06:06.130> do

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
each layer so with a frog group I can do

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.310 
each layer so with a frog group I can do
that<00:06:06.400> all<00:06:06.640> in<00:06:06.970> one<00:06:07.060> click<00:06:08.220> we've<00:06:09.220> got<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:09.550> road

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
that all in one click we've got the road

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.200 
that all in one click we've got the road
0.3<00:06:11.320> and<00:06:11.440> then<00:06:11.890> we<00:06:12.010> have<00:06:12.160> the<00:06:12.310> blades<00:06:12.610> of<00:06:12.850> grass

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
0.3 and then we have the blades of grass

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.890 
0.3 and then we have the blades of grass
at<00:06:14.550> 0.16<00:06:15.550> and<00:06:15.850> I<00:06:15.880> actually<00:06:16.090> should<00:06:16.390> probably

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
at 0.16 and I actually should probably

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.409 
at 0.16 and I actually should probably
bring<00:06:17.140> that<00:06:17.320> behind<00:06:17.500> the<00:06:18.010> road<00:06:18.850> just<00:06:19.150> so<00:06:19.270> i<00:06:19.300> can

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
bring that behind the road just so i can

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.620 
bring that behind the road just so i can
keep<00:06:20.050> the<00:06:20.110> orders<00:06:20.620> straight<00:06:21.040> in<00:06:21.280> my<00:06:21.310> mind<00:06:21.630> so

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
keep the orders straight in my mind so

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.690 
keep the orders straight in my mind so
that's<00:06:22.840> how<00:06:23.020> this<00:06:23.200> is<00:06:23.380> set<00:06:23.560> up<00:06:23.620> initially<00:06:24.430> in

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
that's how this is set up initially in

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.030 
that's how this is set up initially in
our<00:06:25.479> next<00:06:25.720> movie<00:06:26.080> when<00:06:26.229> we<00:06:26.260> start<00:06:26.710> we'll<00:06:26.950> go

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
our next movie when we start we'll go

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.830 
our next movie when we start we'll go
ahead<00:06:27.160> and<00:06:27.280> animate<00:06:27.729> the<00:06:27.880> Frog<00:06:28.150> will<00:06:28.540> use<00:06:28.690> our

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
ahead and animate the Frog will use our

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.140 
ahead and animate the Frog will use our
actions<00:06:29.350> palette<00:06:29.800> to<00:06:30.070> easily<00:06:30.850> and<00:06:30.970> quickly

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
actions palette to easily and quickly

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.969 
actions palette to easily and quickly
create<00:06:31.660> some<00:06:31.810> expressions<00:06:32.229> for<00:06:32.350> our<00:06:32.470> frog<00:06:32.710> and

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
create some expressions for our frog and

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:34.409 
create some expressions for our frog and
then<00:06:33.400> we'll<00:06:33.520> begin<00:06:33.729> importing<00:06:34.180> those

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
then we'll begin importing those

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.340 
then we'll begin importing those
automobiles<00:06:34.870> with<00:06:35.380> cycling<00:06:35.979> motion
