now<00:00:00.240> it's<00:00:00.989> interesting<00:00:01.079> that<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:01.949> art<00:00:02.490> and

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
now it's interesting that the art and

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.820 
now it's interesting that the art and
atheists<00:00:03.240> Richard<00:00:03.629> Dawkins<00:00:03.870> says<00:00:04.500> that<00:00:04.710> the

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
atheists Richard Dawkins says that the

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.280 
atheists Richard Dawkins says that the
point<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.190> evolution<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:06.299> produce<00:00:06.480> objects

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
point of evolution is to produce objects

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.720 
point of evolution is to produce objects
which<00:00:07.379> have<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.830> appearance<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.519> being

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
which have the appearance of being

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.200 
which have the appearance of being
designed<00:00:10.190> he's<00:00:11.190> an<00:00:11.340> atheist<00:00:11.490> he<00:00:12.030> doesn't

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
designed he's an atheist he doesn't

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.549 
designed he's an atheist he doesn't
believe<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.450> blur<00:00:12.630> design<00:00:12.990> but<00:00:13.200> he<00:00:13.259> said<00:00:13.440> they

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
believe a blur design but he said they

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.140 
believe a blur design but he said they
had<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.799> appearance<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.370> being<00:00:14.549> designed<00:00:14.880> but

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
had the appearance of being designed but

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.700 
had the appearance of being designed but
I'd<00:00:15.210> say<00:00:15.509> they<00:00:16.020> look<00:00:16.230> like<00:00:16.379> they're<00:00:16.560> being

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
I'd say they look like they're being

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.439 
I'd say they look like they're being
designed<00:00:17.039> because<00:00:17.250> they<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.880> been<00:00:18.119> designed

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
designed because they have been designed

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.609 
designed because they have been designed
that's<00:00:19.380> pretty<00:00:19.529> logical<00:00:21.199> now<00:00:22.199> what<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.439> said

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
that's pretty logical now what I said

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.650 
that's pretty logical now what I said
about<00:00:22.710> metabolism<00:00:23.340> one<00:00:23.850> thing<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.119> need<00:00:24.269> for

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
going about 10,000 moves minute though

going about 10,000 moves minute though
and<00:02:01.520> here's<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.579> top<00:02:02.790> view<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:06.770> every

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
and here's a top view of it and every

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.509 
and here's a top view of it and every
rotation<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.789> produces<00:02:09.360> three<00:02:09.690> ATP<00:02:10.470> molecules

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
rotation it produces three ATP molecules

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.699 
rotation it produces three ATP molecules
but<00:02:13.519> this<00:02:13.640> molecule<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.629> vital<00:02:15.140> for<00:02:15.170> life<00:02:15.319> and

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
but this molecule is vital for life and

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.429 
but this molecule is vital for life and
yet<00:02:15.769> it's<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.579> incredibly<00:02:17.540> complicated<00:02:17.930> motor

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
yet it's a incredibly complicated motor

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.739 
yet it's a incredibly complicated motor
you<00:02:19.099> couldn't<00:02:19.400> have<00:02:19.549> life<00:02:19.849> and<00:02:20.090> lets<00:02:20.389> you<00:02:20.510> head

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:20.749 
you couldn't have life and lets you head

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.449 
you couldn't have life and lets you head
this<00:02:21.170> motor<00:02:21.499> to<00:02:21.799> produce<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.340> energy

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
this motor to produce the energy

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.369 
this motor to produce the energy
currency<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.269> looks<00:02:26.450> like<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:26.780> life<00:02:27.019> this

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
currency so it looks like this life this

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.020 
currency so it looks like this life this
motor<00:02:27.680> must<00:02:28.040> have<00:02:28.159> been<00:02:28.310> there<00:02:28.549> right<00:02:28.849> from

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
motor must have been there right from

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.509 
motor must have been there right from
the<00:02:29.150> beginning<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.889> I'd<00:02:30.889> say<00:02:31.129> that<00:02:31.370> because

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
the beginning and I'd say that because

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.140 
the beginning and I'd say that because
this<00:02:32.450> motor<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:33.109> difficult<00:02:33.819> i<00:02:34.819> nee<00:02:34.879> are

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
this motor is so difficult i nee are

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.699 
this motor is so difficult i nee are
more<00:02:35.299> efficient<00:02:35.780> than<00:02:35.810> any<00:02:36.079> motor<00:02:36.319> we<00:02:36.560> can

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
more efficient than any motor we can

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.530 
more efficient than any motor we can
design<00:02:36.859> I<00:02:37.189> say<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.459> design<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.819> us<00:02:38.060> motor<00:02:38.299> is

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
design I say the design of us motor is

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.599 
design I say the design of us motor is
far<00:02:38.780> more<00:02:38.959> intelligent<00:02:39.260> than<00:02:39.650> any<00:02:39.859> motor

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
far more intelligent than any motor

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.689 
far more intelligent than any motor
designer<00:02:40.969> we<00:02:41.150> have<00:02:41.329> today<00:02:41.510> too
