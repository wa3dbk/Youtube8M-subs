00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
make the oil that we produce thicker so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.650 
make the oil that we produce thicker so
that's<00:01:00.930> something<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.500> want<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.829> avoid

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
also drink plenty of water now that is

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.719 
also drink plenty of water now that is
so<00:01:06.479> important<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.320> usually<00:01:07.830> say<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.520> don't

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
so important I usually say if you don't

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.760 
so important I usually say if you don't
do<00:01:08.850> anything<00:01:09.060> else<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.479> your<00:01:09.630> skin<00:01:09.900> drink

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
do anything else for your skin drink

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.700 
do anything else for your skin drink
more<00:01:10.979> water<00:01:11.270> because<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.810> actually<00:01:13.439> helps

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
more water because that actually helps

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.399 
more water because that actually helps
to<00:01:13.890> eliminate<00:01:14.220> toxins<00:01:15.000> from<00:01:15.570> our<00:01:15.869> body<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
to eliminate toxins from our body and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.950 
to eliminate toxins from our body and
therefore<00:01:16.770> from<00:01:17.100> our<00:01:17.310> skin<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.790> also<00:01:18.600> helps

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
therefore from our skin and also helps

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.010 
therefore from our skin and also helps
to<00:01:19.049> purify<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.740> oil<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.610> produce<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:21.330> our

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to purify the oil that we produce if our

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.190 
to purify the oil that we produce if our
oil<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.530> cleaner<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.270> less<00:01:24.479> likely<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
oil is cleaner then it's less likely to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.990 
oil is cleaner then it's less likely to
clog<00:01:25.650> our<00:01:25.950> pores<00:01:26.720> also<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.960> plenty<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.439> sleep

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
clog our pores also get plenty of sleep

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.490 
clog our pores also get plenty of sleep
uninterruptedly<00:01:30.000> now<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> reason<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.470> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
uninterruptedly now the reason for that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
uninterruptedly now the reason for that
is<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:32.460> our<00:01:32.610> sleep<00:01:32.880> pattern<00:01:33.329> is

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
is because when our sleep pattern is

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.620 
is because when our sleep pattern is
interrupted<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> surge<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.369> hormones<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
interrupted we get a surge in hormones a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.800 
interrupted we get a surge in hormones a
surge<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.650> androgen<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.670> even<00:01:39.030> testosterone

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
surge in androgen or even testosterone

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.109 
surge in androgen or even testosterone
when<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.619> happens<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.549> therefore<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
when that happens we therefore get a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.630 
when that happens we therefore get a
surge<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.509> oil<00:01:43.079> production<00:01:43.430> which<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.610> course

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
surge in oil production which of course

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.420 
surge in oil production which of course
can<00:01:45.240> contribute<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.869> acne<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.070> those<00:01:47.250> three

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
can contribute to acne so those three

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.350 
can contribute to acne so those three
things<00:01:47.670> are<00:01:47.909> vital<00:01:48.799> very<00:01:49.799> very<00:01:50.040> important<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
things are vital very very important to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.980 
things are vital very very important to
our<00:01:51.390> skins<00:01:52.079> health<00:01:52.439> now<00:01:53.280> beyond<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:54.000> you

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.570 
about oily skin or acne but really when
you<00:02:06.210> keep<00:02:06.390> your<00:02:06.600> skin<00:02:06.869> hydrated<00:02:07.580> you're

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
you keep your skin hydrated you're

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.800 
you keep your skin hydrated you're
sending<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.060> signal<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.479> your<00:02:09.660> oil<00:02:09.869> glands<00:02:10.200> that

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
sending a signal to your oil glands that

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.979 
sending a signal to your oil glands that
they<00:02:11.020> don't<00:02:11.709> need<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:12.130> produce<00:02:12.480> more<00:02:13.480> oil<00:02:13.540> than

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
they don't need to produce more oil than

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.410 
they don't need to produce more oil than
is<00:02:14.140> necessary<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:15.010> also<00:02:15.880> when<00:02:16.000> we<00:02:16.090> keep<00:02:16.270> our

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
is necessary and also when we keep our

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.809 
is necessary and also when we keep our
skin<00:02:16.690> hydrated<00:02:17.349> it's<00:02:17.560> keeping<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.130> sealed<00:02:18.459> and

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
skin hydrated it's keeping it sealed and

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.240 
skin hydrated it's keeping it sealed and
therefore<00:02:19.239> protecting<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:19.989> from<00:02:20.250> bacteria

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
therefore protecting it from bacteria

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.790 
therefore protecting it from bacteria
now<00:02:22.209> as<00:02:22.360> far<00:02:22.510> as<00:02:22.569> attacking<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.290> source<00:02:23.590> of

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
now as far as attacking the source of

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.960 
now as far as attacking the source of
the<00:02:23.950> problem<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.400> might<00:02:24.550> need<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.760> do<00:02:24.940> some

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
the problem you might need to do some

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.270 
the problem you might need to do some
research<00:02:25.180> on<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.170> do<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.680> process<00:02:27.160> of

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
research on that and do a process of

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.430 
research on that and do a process of
elimination<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:28.060> see<00:02:28.300> what<00:02:28.780> your<00:02:28.930> problem

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
elimination to see what your problem
