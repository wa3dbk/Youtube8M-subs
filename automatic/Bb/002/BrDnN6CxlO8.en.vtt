building some support for the guys in my

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.360 
building some support for the guys in my
team<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.640> if<00:02:29.850> they<00:02:30.000> are<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> area<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.930> the

team so if they are in the area of the
the<00:02:32.370> jammer<00:02:32.640> they<00:02:33.210> will<00:02:33.360> not<00:02:33.540> be<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:33.780> showed<00:02:34.080> up

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
the jammer they will not be in showed up

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.980 
the jammer they will not be in showed up
on<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.610> on<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.670> radar<00:02:36.150> when<00:02:36.450> they<00:02:36.570> are<00:02:36.690> firing

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
on the on the radar when they are firing

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.840 
on the on the radar when they are firing
their<00:02:37.320> gun<00:02:37.530> if<00:02:38.010> they<00:02:38.250> are<00:02:38.280> not<00:02:38.430> using<00:02:38.640> a

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
their gun if they are not using a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.040 
their gun if they are not using a
suppressor<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.420> course<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:41.060> then<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.330> picked

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
suppressor of course and then I picked

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.830 
suppressor of course and then I picked
the<00:02:43.290> tackle<00:02:43.800> mask<00:02:44.070> pro<00:02:44.580> I'm<00:02:44.910> also<00:02:45.090> almost

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
the tackle mask pro I'm also almost

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.510 
the tackle mask pro I'm also almost
every<00:02:46.230> time<00:02:46.440> using<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.950> pair<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.310> just

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
every time using that pair of just

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.180 
every time using that pair of just
because<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.300> pro<00:02:48.510> benefits<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.260> reduces

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
because the pro benefits and reduces

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.160 
because the pro benefits and reduces
this<00:02:50.400> effect<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.150> stun<00:02:51.450> grenades<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:51.959> flash

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
this effect of stun grenades and flash

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.470 
this effect of stun grenades and flash
grenades<00:02:52.560> by<00:02:52.739> ninety<00:02:53.070> percent<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:54.060> figured

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
grenades by ninety percent so figured

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.710 
grenades by ninety percent so figured
that<00:02:54.660> if<00:02:54.810> I'm<00:02:55.320> going<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.830> be<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.720> support

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
that if I'm going to be this support

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.800 
that if I'm going to be this support
kind<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:58.080> player<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:59.459> won't<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.239> ending<00:03:00.660> up

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
kind of player and I won't be ending up

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.070 
kind of player and I won't be ending up
I<00:03:01.140> am<00:03:01.700> well<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.880> wouldn't<00:03:03.390> be<00:03:03.510> an<00:03:03.570> annoying<00:03:03.840> if

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
I am well it wouldn't be an annoying if

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.770 
I am well it wouldn't be an annoying if
I<00:03:04.200> died<00:03:04.440> by<00:03:04.790> getting<00:03:05.790> stunned<00:03:06.090> or<00:03:06.239> flash<00:03:06.540> and

then finished off so I slap that on and

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.570 
then finished off so I slap that on and
combined<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.570> with<00:03:09.630> hardline<00:03:10.200> pro<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.770> you

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
combined it with hardline pro and you

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.330 
combined it with hardline pro and you
will<00:03:11.670> see<00:03:11.850> I'm<00:03:11.970> trying<00:03:12.930> all<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.739> time<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.190> gain
