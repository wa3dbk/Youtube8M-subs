00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
kind of difficult if you let your if

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.870 
kind of difficult if you let your if
you're<00:02:47.870> got<00:02:48.740> it<00:02:48.830> on<00:02:48.920> your<00:02:49.040> back<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.459> it's<00:02:49.700> kind

but<00:02:52.810> that's<00:02:53.810> just<00:02:54.290> if<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:55.400> could<00:02:55.580> be<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.760> problem

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
but that's just if it could be a problem

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.750 
but that's just if it could be a problem
for<00:02:56.209> some<00:02:56.390> people<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:57.260> might<00:02:57.440> not<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:58.459> it's

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
now on top it's got these loops now I

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.590 
now on top it's got these loops now I
didn't<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:12.769> didn't<00:03:13.010> come<00:03:13.130> with<00:03:13.160> these<00:03:16.600> iPad

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
and if you run it around the frame like

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.400 
and if you run it around the frame like
this<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:20.150> cinch<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.570> down<00:03:20.630> they're<00:03:20.930> good<00:03:21.200> it

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
this and cinch it down they're good it

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.300 
this and cinch it down they're good it
won't<00:03:21.620> go<00:03:21.769> anywhere<00:03:23.080> it's<00:03:24.080> also<00:03:24.230> got<00:03:24.560> the

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
won't go anywhere it's also got the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.840 
won't go anywhere it's also got the
loops<00:03:25.850> on<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.180> front<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:27.950> can<00:03:28.370> attach

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
loops on the front and you can attach

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.670 
loops on the front and you can attach
stuff<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:29.420> bottom<00:03:29.840> of<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.110> just<00:03:30.320> strap<00:03:30.650> it

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
stuff to the bottom of it just strap it

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.770 
stuff to the bottom of it just strap it
on<00:03:30.920> right<00:03:31.100> here<00:03:31.130> so<00:03:31.940> you've<00:03:32.060> got<00:03:32.239> multiple

on right here so you've got multiple

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.680 
on right here so you've got multiple
options<00:03:33.260> for<00:03:33.350> carrying<00:03:33.910> lots<00:03:34.910> of<00:03:35.060> heavy<00:03:35.299> gear

other department so this separator we
have<00:04:26.310> bars<00:04:27.310> right<00:04:27.610> here<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:29.580> holds<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.670> open

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
have bars right here that holds it open

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.720 
have bars right here that holds it open
so<00:04:31.300> it's<00:04:31.690> not<00:04:31.900> gonna<00:04:32.050> shut<00:04:32.320> on<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:32.680> and<00:04:32.860> these

are hooked in over here with that true
hooks<00:04:40.000> into<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.510> so<00:04:41.440> this<00:04:41.710> this<00:04:42.010> ain't<00:04:42.310> going

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
hooks into that so this this ain't going

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.540 
hooks into that so this this ain't going
anywhere<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:44.590> that's<00:04:44.680> one<00:04:45.040> things<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.520> I

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
don't feel the frame at all so that's

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.650 
don't feel the frame at all so that's
that<00:06:39.200> on<00:06:39.440> it<00:06:39.590> and<00:06:39.740> the<00:06:40.280> frame<00:06:40.580> it's<00:06:41.480> a

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
that on it and the frame it's a

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.050 
that on it and the frame it's a
lightweight<00:06:41.900> aluminum<00:06:42.580> really<00:06:43.580> really

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
lightweight aluminum really really

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.440 
lightweight aluminum really really
durable<00:06:44.300> I<00:06:44.950> mean<00:06:45.950> it<00:06:46.100> could<00:06:46.250> be<00:06:46.280> and<00:06:46.700> like<00:06:47.270> if

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
durable I mean it could be and like if

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.740 
durable I mean it could be and like if
you<00:06:47.570> dropped<00:06:48.110> it<00:06:48.260> on<00:06:48.380> a<00:06:48.410> rock<00:06:48.710> but<00:06:49.370> it's<00:06:50.000> very

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
you dropped it on a rock but it's very

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.380 
you dropped it on a rock but it's very
unlikely<00:06:51.500> that<00:06:51.710> it's<00:06:52.010> gonna<00:06:52.160> break<00:06:52.490> just

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
unlikely that it's gonna break just

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.770 
unlikely that it's gonna break just
because

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
because

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.610 
because
