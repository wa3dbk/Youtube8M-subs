00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 this game is to involve this game is evo 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.089
 The old man can not explain what 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.740
 doing with both hands can not 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:15.660
 to coordinate both hands I have a serious 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:19.470
 My brain is connected and then people 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.199
 all right is the next you're there must 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.689
 orphaned the flap band the game that was taken 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.460
 epd tour was taken from google play 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.980
 you can not play down here 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.000
 down low down no more 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.070
 that happens 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.350
 do not fear because the developer of 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.280
 flipboard made several other games to 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.590
 you can play 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.870
 in fact he made two and we're going to give 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.629
 a look that today in the other games that 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.450
 are the inheritance of the flipboard made by 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.030
 Vietnamese game developer 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.329
 let's take a look at the guys come 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.860
 first game is called super bowl game is 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.010
 The next I'll let you know if 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.100
 You were angry with the non-flipboard. 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.320
 play this business, it's sic a game to 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.030
 to pass more anger than the flipboard 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.549
 crap that you will understand what 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.930
 I'm speaking the following is what you 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.450
 have to do in this game you have to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.400
 do little jokes with a ball 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.020
 I can not get by myself alone. 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.860
 nor play enough to do 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:24.439
 calm calm demonstration do some 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.850
 thing they do by themselves is already 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.090
 I have to be able to get there on time. 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.340
 8 already gives the face already gives make download day 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.200
 by itself is already a tricky trick 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.259
 understood the problem is that when you 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.049
 come to a certain people I will not 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.570
 I will not be able to do it. 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:51.659
 in itself is already a 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 to do doing it by itself 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.540
 It's already a complicated trick. 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.149
 problem because I could do it 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.890
 to do the embassy by itself is already a 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.899
 It's kind of complicated to understand the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.450
 problem is that when you reach a 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.700
 certain number it goes and places 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.500
 another ball is made with the two old ones 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.350
 with the putz grill 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.600
 Face this game is to engage this game is 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.100
 There is no way to wrap this up. 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.780
 that doing with both hands can not 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.940
 coordinate both hands I have certain 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.280
 my brain is clearly connected that is 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.910
 a game to give definitive anger 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.800
 I like that I like is that you use what 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.860
 do with both hands you can not change 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.260
 do with 12 in different time is in 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.209
 Different time, damn time 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.190
 different in time let's go around here 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.440
 I'll be able to get there. The problem is that 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.970
 It starts with the left hand, I'll go there. 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.880
 I'll change sides, let's go to the right of a 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:58.050
 left side of the other 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:03:00.959
 now yes now if now but no 23 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.420
 aston villa for next go brazil go 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.120
 for the next, let's go guys this 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.530
 hence a block kick what you have 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.480
 what do you have to stop 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.700
 shurikens that are the ninja stars 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.650
 This one is quieter because in this 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.959
 Believe it or not, you have life, it's expensive. 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.400
 You can make three mistakes before 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.650
 start killing yourself because you do not 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.480
 can score higher is the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.820
 next you just come here click on the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.430
 screen when the rain has fallen on 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.299
 Up your head like that, I did it just for you. 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.489
 Show 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.040
 I did it just to show it off. 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.019
 the next you have to click the screen and 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.780
 from time to time and it will appear and 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.180
 these numbers only person I score not 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.420
 I understand how some give 10 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.230
 some give 9 cotton 8 is random not 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.380
 know 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.480
 I just know it's so, so let's go there. 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.340
 I'm trying to explain the good serve that 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.170
 There is life that is meant to make serrat two more. 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.720
 times before dying 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.610
 that's it, I hope so, everybody 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.200
 happy with this and you do not need 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.480
 wait for that input screen that 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.070
 it will be every time you restart the 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.739
 face flipboard 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.850
 hey I'm good at this I'm really good 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.610
 and this will 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.110
 I'm very happy, I'll be very happy. 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.420
 I'm definitely a deflector. 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.370
 shuriken very good and get on well in 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.579
 naruto 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.800
 My kids are in that guide there. 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.370
 complicated is really complicated 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.300
 I stopped to go and will have more hotel clothes 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.610
 beauty 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.039
 There are eight I do not know why because 10 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.800
 because eight are not sure I think 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.599
 Now I've lost the only problem is when 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.979
 he starts to speed up the game 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.659
 understood that if you can not stop 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.159
 because of the frequent traffic mega 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.159
 Difficult you have to use 2 of daniel 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.960
 son 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.919
 he's got a lot of Japanese there 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.169
 down 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.020
 then guess who falls head he just 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.389
 you there samurai shaolin monk at the show 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.039
 It's not from Japan and China, I 'm not 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.349
 insensitive being difference 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:01.199
 so let's go and get the child 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:04.440
 will be hitting the screen so dwarf 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.849
 strategy does not work and I think 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.889
 This is the end. 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.870
 so this is it guys the two games are 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.240

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.039

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.099
 I wanted to do this show case here for 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.440
 You my recommendation does not play a 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:25.259
 game of sneak peeks at the 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.060
 anger much more anger than the flash bank 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.180
 to get over this part 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.279
 but the one who is calm and happy is crying 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.650
 It's a cool game, man. 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:36.779
