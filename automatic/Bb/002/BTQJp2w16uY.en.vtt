lesson four point three is titled

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.680 
lesson four point three is titled
interpret<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.040> remainder<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.849> basically

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
interpret the remainder and basically

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.570 
interpret the remainder and basically
we're<00:00:12.960> going<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.320> find<00:00:13.530> out<00:00:13.650> how<00:00:13.980> we<00:00:14.040> use

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
we're going to find out how we use

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.269 
we're going to find out how we use
remainders<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.269> division<00:00:15.870> problems<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:17.010> what

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
remainders and division problems so what

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.330 
remainders and division problems so what
do<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:17.460> do<00:00:17.789> with<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.359> remainder<00:00:19.039> so<00:00:20.039> there's<00:00:20.250> a

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
do we do with the remainder so there's a

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.240 
do we do with the remainder so there's a
couple<00:00:20.760> different<00:00:21.119> ways<00:00:21.680> that<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:23.010> deal<00:00:23.189> with

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
couple different ways that you deal with

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.609 
couple different ways that you deal with
the<00:00:23.760> remainder<00:00:24.090> we're<00:00:24.720> gonna<00:00:24.840> try<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.140> first

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
the remainder we're gonna try this first

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.720 
the remainder we're gonna try this first
way<00:00:26.510> here<00:00:27.510> with<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.529> unlock<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> problem<00:00:29.490> it

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it into eight that means she's gonna

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.760 
it into eight that means she's gonna
divide<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:44.850> use<00:00:45.180> around<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> photos<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.320> her

solve a division problem with a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.049 
solve a division problem with a
remainder<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.770> way<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.280> interpret<00:00:59.730> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
remainder the way that you interpret the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.180 
remainder the way that you interpret the
remainder<00:01:00.510> depends<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> situation<00:01:02.039> in

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
remainder depends on the situation in

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.600 
remainder depends on the situation in
the<00:01:02.219> question<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:04.260> wants<00:01:05.010> us<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.129> have

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the question this one wants us to have

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.320 
the question this one wants us to have
in<00:01:06.000> equal<00:01:06.960> lengths<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:08.130> what<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.700> means<00:01:09.030> is

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
in equal lengths so what that means is

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.620 
in equal lengths so what that means is
after<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.260> 73<00:01:10.979> divided<00:01:11.520> by<00:01:11.670> 8<00:01:11.939> we're<00:01:12.540> gonna

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
after we do 73 divided by 8 we're gonna

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.469 
after we do 73 divided by 8 we're gonna
have<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.049> take<00:01:13.260> our<00:01:13.470> remainder<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.479> also

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
have to take our remainder and also

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.020 
have to take our remainder and also
split<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.170> up<00:01:16.350> evenly<00:01:16.860> into<00:01:17.280> those<00:01:17.729> eight

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
split it up evenly into those eight

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.390 
split it up evenly into those eight
different<00:01:18.960> photo<00:01:19.560> groups<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.799> let's<00:01:22.799> fill

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
different photo groups so let's fill

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.940 
different photo groups so let's fill
this<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.790> down<00:01:24.030> here<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.630> first<00:01:24.869> way<00:01:25.110> write

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
this out down here the first way write

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.300 
this out down here the first way write
the<00:01:26.130> remainder<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> fraction<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.770> divisor

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the remainder as a fraction the divisor

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.690 
the remainder as a fraction the divisor
is<00:01:29.790> eight<00:01:30.540> pieces<00:01:31.020> divisor<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.250> means<00:01:32.460> what

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
is eight pieces divisor just means what

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.630 
is eight pieces divisor just means what
are<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.880> dividing<00:01:33.299> by<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:35.040> dividend<00:01:37.820> is

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
are you dividing by and the dividend is

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.550 
are you dividing by and the dividend is
73<00:01:41.640> inches<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:43.110> our<00:01:43.409> problem<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.869> 73<00:01:45.869> divided

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
73 inches so our problem is 73 divided

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.460 
73 inches so our problem is 73 divided
by<00:01:46.740> eight<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:48.119> says<00:01:48.360> divide<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.079> find<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
by eight and it says divide to find the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.530 
by eight and it says divide to find the
quotient<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.220> remainder<00:01:50.250> they<00:01:51.149> already

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
quotient and the remainder they already

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.190 
quotient and the remainder they already
did<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:51.840> us

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
did it for us

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.999 
did it for us
they<00:01:52.439> said<00:01:52.649> 73<00:01:53.189> divided<00:01:53.579> by<00:01:53.670> eight<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.060> nine

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
they said 73 divided by eight is nine

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.050 
they said 73 divided by eight is nine
with<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.450> remainder<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.659> one<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:59.520> remainder

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
with a remainder of one the remainder

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.080 
with a remainder of one the remainder
represents<00:02:00.960> one<00:02:01.530> inch<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.430> leftover

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
represents one inch of leftover

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.600 
represents one inch of leftover
wallpaper<00:02:03.740> we're<00:02:04.740> going<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.950> take<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.310> one

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
wallpaper we're going to take that one

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.059 
wallpaper we're going to take that one
inch<00:02:05.939> that's<00:02:06.299> leftover<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.200> wallpaper<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
inch that's leftover of wallpaper and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.700 
inch that's leftover of wallpaper and
divide<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.209> into<00:02:09.390> eight<00:02:10.050> equal<00:02:10.440> parts

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
divide it into eight equal parts

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.210 
divide it into eight equal parts
to<00:02:12.520> give<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.270> those<00:02:13.510> eight<00:02:13.780> photos<00:02:14.560> that

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
to give it to those eight photos that

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.490 
to give it to those eight photos that
she<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.820> making<00:02:16.390> up<00:02:16.810> here<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.960> way<00:02:20.470> that

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
she is making up here so the way that

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.100 
she is making up here so the way that
you<00:02:20.800> do<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.580> just<00:02:21.610> very<00:02:22.600> simply

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
you do that is you just very simply

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.610 
you do that is you just very simply
write<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.950> remainder<00:02:24.280> which<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:24.730> one<00:02:25.620> over

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
write the remainder which is one over

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.350 
write the remainder which is one over
top<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.550> divisor<00:02:28.000> which<00:02:28.450> was<00:02:28.750> eight<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.940> we

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
top of the divisor which was eight so we

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.400 
top of the divisor which was eight so we
have<00:02:31.630> one<00:02:32.170> eight<00:02:33.120> four<00:02:34.120> that's<00:02:34.960> how<00:02:35.170> we're

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
have one eight four that's how we're

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.580 
have one eight four that's how we're
interpreting<00:02:35.860> our<00:02:36.370> remainder<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.320> write<00:02:38.320> the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
interpreting our remainder so write the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.490 
interpreting our remainder so write the
quotient<00:02:38.860> with<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.760> remainder<00:02:40.180> written<00:02:40.870> as<00:02:41.080> a

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
quotient with the remainder written as a

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.550 
quotient with the remainder written as a
fraction<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:43.090> would<00:02:43.300> be<00:02:43.480> nine<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:45.420> 1/8<00:02:46.560> so

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
fraction that would be nine and 1/8 so

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.670 
fraction that would be nine and 1/8 so
each<00:02:47.830> photo<00:02:48.220> will<00:02:48.340> get<00:02:48.700> nine<00:02:49.660> in<00:02:50.460> one<00:02:51.460> eight

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
each photo will get nine in one eight

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.450 
each photo will get nine in one eight
inches<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:54.000> wallpaper<00:02:55.710> okay<00:02:56.710> so<00:02:56.770> that's<00:02:57.160> the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
inches of wallpaper okay so that's the

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:06.510 
inches of wallpaper okay so that's the
first<00:02:57.910> way<00:02:58.390> to<00:03:00.450> interpret<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.630> remainder<00:03:05.520> and

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
first way to interpret the remainder and

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.490 
first way to interpret the remainder and
now<00:03:07.060> we're<00:03:07.240> gonna<00:03:07.330> look<00:03:07.570> at<00:03:07.720> another<00:03:08.140> way<00:03:08.440> to

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
now we're gonna look at another way to

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.570 
now we're gonna look at another way to
interpret<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.340> remainder<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:11.280> here<00:03:12.280> says

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
interpret the remainder so a here says

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.220 
interpret the remainder so a here says
use<00:03:13.270> only<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:14.020> quotient<00:03:14.440> so<00:03:14.860> use<00:03:15.160> only<00:03:16.230> the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
use only the quotient so use only the

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.760 
use only the quotient so use only the
answer<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.430> division<00:03:18.850> problem<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.540> just

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
answer to the division problem and just

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.700 
answer to the division problem and just
leave<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:21.400> remainder<00:03:22.440> alone

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
leave the remainder alone

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.100 
leave the remainder alone
so<00:03:24.280> for<00:03:24.520> example<00:03:24.610> been<00:03:25.150> as<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.420> tour<00:03:25.660> guide<00:03:25.690> at<00:03:26.050> a

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
so for example been as a tour guide at a

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.770 
so for example been as a tour guide at a
glassblowing<00:03:26.650> studio<00:03:26.890> he<00:03:27.580> can<00:03:27.760> take<00:03:28.000> no<00:03:28.360> more

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
glassblowing studio he can take no more

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.900 
glassblowing studio he can take no more
than<00:03:28.840> seven<00:03:29.770> people<00:03:30.130> at<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.430> time<00:03:30.760> on<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.660> tour<00:03:32.350> if

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
than seven people at a time on a tour if

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.550 
than seven people at a time on a tour if
80<00:03:33.910> people<00:03:34.300> want<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.780> see<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.050> glassblowing

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
80 people want to see the glassblowing

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.860 
80 people want to see the glassblowing
demonstration<00:03:36.400> how<00:03:36.880> many<00:03:37.090> groups<00:03:37.300> of<00:03:37.510> seven

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
demonstration how many groups of seven

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.950

divide<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.950> find<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.250> quotient<00:03:42.640> and

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
divide to find the quotient and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.780 
divide to find the quotient and
remainder<00:03:43.110> then<00:03:44.110> decide<00:03:44.560> how<00:03:44.800> to<00:03:44.860> use<00:03:45.280> the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
remainder then decide how to use the

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.000 
remainder then decide how to use the
quotient<00:03:46.000> in<00:03:46.270> the<00:03:46.390> remainder<00:03:47.050> so<00:03:47.290> they've

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
quotient in the remainder so they've

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.690 
quotient in the remainder so they've
already<00:03:48.250> done<00:03:48.700> 80<00:03:49.120> divided<00:03:49.750> by<00:03:49.870> seven<00:03:50.410> is<00:03:50.700> 11

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
already done 80 divided by seven is 11

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.300 
already done 80 divided by seven is 11
and<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.930> remainder<00:03:53.410> should<00:03:53.890> be<00:03:54.330> three<00:03:56.160> so<00:03:57.160> the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
and the remainder should be three so the

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.200 
and the remainder should be three so the
quotient<00:03:57.580> is<00:03:58.030> 11<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:59.260> remainder<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.250> 3<00:04:01.980> and

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
quotient is 11 the remainder is 3 and

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.110 
quotient is 11 the remainder is 3 and
then<00:04:04.210> it<00:04:04.390> says<00:04:04.660> Ben<00:04:05.110> can<00:04:05.410> give<00:04:05.590> tours<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.400> seven

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
then it says Ben can give tours to seven

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.990 
then it says Ben can give tours to seven
people<00:04:07.360> at<00:04:07.720> a<00:04:07.750> time<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:09.220> quotient<00:04:09.820> is<00:04:09.940> the

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
people at a time the quotient is the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.720 
people at a time the quotient is the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
number of tour groups of exactly seven

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.260 
number of tour groups of exactly seven
people<00:04:13.030> that<00:04:13.210> he<00:04:13.390> can<00:04:13.570> show<00:04:13.840> around<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:15.430> he<00:04:16.060> can

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
people that he can show around so he can

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
people that he can show around so he can
only<00:04:16.510> take<00:04:17.049> 11<00:04:17.770> groups<00:04:18.010> of<00:04:18.310> seven<00:04:18.820> people<00:04:19.290> he'd

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
only take 11 groups of seven people he'd

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.060 
only take 11 groups of seven people he'd
have<00:04:20.650> to

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
have to

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.940 
have to
make<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.550> whole<00:04:22.000> nother<00:04:22.480> group<00:04:22.930> for<00:04:23.800> these

make a whole nother group for these

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.700 
make a whole nother group for these
leftover<00:04:24.700> three<00:04:25.000> people<00:04:25.450> so<00:04:26.350> he'd<00:04:26.680> have

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
leftover three people so he'd have

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.100 
leftover three people so he'd have
eleven<00:04:27.550> groups<00:04:27.820> with<00:04:28.030> seven<00:04:28.390> people<00:04:28.810> in<00:04:28.930> it

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
eleven groups with seven people in it

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.860 
eleven groups with seven people in it
and<00:04:29.650> then<00:04:29.860> an<00:04:30.010> extra<00:04:30.520> group<00:04:30.820> with<00:04:31.030> only<00:04:31.210> three

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
and then an extra group with only three

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.560 
and then an extra group with only three
people<00:04:31.900> in<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:32.710> so<00:04:33.640> that's<00:04:33.880> what<00:04:34.060> this<00:04:34.300> says

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
people in it so that's what this says

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.970 
people in it so that's what this says
here<00:04:35.110> add<00:04:35.290> one<00:04:35.950> to<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:37.090> quotient<00:04:37.480> if<00:04:38.170> then

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
here add one to the quotient if then

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.190 
here add one to the quotient if then
gives<00:04:39.220> towards<00:04:39.610> two<00:04:39.790> eighty<00:04:40.240> all<00:04:40.690> eighty

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
gives towards two eighty all eighty

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.680 
gives towards two eighty all eighty
people<00:04:41.500> how<00:04:42.040> many<00:04:42.100> tours<00:04:42.580> will<00:04:42.880> he<00:04:43.090> give<00:04:43.390> a

people how many tours will he give a

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.900 
people how many tours will he give a
tour<00:04:44.440> can<00:04:44.650> have<00:04:44.800> no<00:04:44.980> more<00:04:45.220> than<00:04:45.370> seven<00:04:45.730> people

to<00:04:46.330> show<00:04:46.570> all<00:04:46.840> 80<00:04:47.200> people<00:04:47.650> around<00:04:47.950> then<00:04:48.310> we'll

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
to show all 80 people around then we'll

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.790 
to show all 80 people around then we'll
have<00:04:48.700> to<00:04:48.850> give<00:04:49.030> one<00:04:49.420> more<00:04:49.810> tour<00:04:50.200> for<00:04:50.650> these

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
have to give one more tour for these

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.030 
have to give one more tour for these
three<00:04:51.220> extra<00:04:51.670> people<00:04:51.880> so<00:04:52.300> that<00:04:53.050> means<00:04:53.350> not

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
three extra people so that means not

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.250 
three extra people so that means not
just<00:04:54.070> eleven<00:04:54.850> tours<00:04:55.150> he'll<00:04:55.510> now<00:04:55.720> have<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:56.140> be

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
just eleven tours he'll now have to be

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.620 
just eleven tours he'll now have to be
giving<00:04:56.590> twelve<00:04:57.070> tours<00:04:57.640> and<00:04:59.040> then<00:05:00.040> C<00:05:00.430> says<00:05:00.760> or

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
giving twelve tours and then C says or
