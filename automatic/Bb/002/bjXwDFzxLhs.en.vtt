00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:03.399
 dobrodeev intends to bagnet feeds site on 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:04.510
 bugir 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.740
 premiere of unsweetened patrick 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.249
 many often wonder 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:12.089
 should not open itself 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.249
 the first action of this text that is 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.160
 future first fruit does it follow 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.489
 pegs to get more 

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:20.800
 fruits a 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.069
 so I want to show how I do it 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:26.529
 and how I will calculate them from the beginning 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.789
 what is there in common with my daddy 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.920
 will grow in warm beds 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.300
 in a warm bed high especially 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.560
 it's not a lot of sun here 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.800
 comes the earliest at 12 sunny side 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.890
 that the sun comes 12 somewhere around five in the evening 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.350
 but it leaves here due to the fact that next to the house 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.180
 year but nonetheless 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.450
 on 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.290
 For starters, I now have this situation 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.290
 that i will show you in detail the names of this 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.150
 the dream is our course 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.970
 assembly I open what was seen of his killers 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.800
 here is the whole bush and a year 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.520
 Here is this pathos points this 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.810
 the boat he goes from the center that's about 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.590
 him often and need to ask 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.890
 his clothespin 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.060
 there are those versions that if we pinch it 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.610
 May when it's a bud 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.530
 it will start to develop as you see 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.760
 I am not in the money account for one of my own 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.560
 contrary to this did not 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.920
 here's how I look so bad already and as you can see 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.770
 it did not slow down plant growth then 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.909
 we still have fruit for a year 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.409
 pretty big for next year 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.370
 literally 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.620
 maybe standing at the fork and how would he 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.520
 pulls all the same there may not be enough 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.020
 it is for this version many pinch from 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.060
 at a fork big next in each 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.360
 the main shrine in everything from the box already too 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.560
 big 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.450
 the third fork in them 3 dropping to 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.570
 this step 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.200
 and each of these three ravaged such accounts 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.210
 forks here show it more 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.590
 that is, every star in the fork 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.059
 It turns out this is in the center of the capital 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:10.119
 and here again branches out coming 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.019
 de puddles and starts and daddy and drank 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.999
 at least flowers here 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:16.359
 daddy ears 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.119
 small but neither sit 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:20.969
 that is, a year 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.549
 this course is the largest here and it is the most 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.209
 first year started can be seen 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.400
 following 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.900
 all the same in refusal a fork goes 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.479
 the first 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.889
 development ratings 3 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:35.999
 expensive 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.579
 third fourth and each of these this 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.659
 take another kind of face 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.719
 also there are flowers i mean i wouldn't say 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.779
 what's the project 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.179
 slow down also I leave 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:48.769
 just third year 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.109
 which go below 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.129
 something that was also often asked if they should 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.709
 to pinch like tomatoes 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.519
 that's not counting all 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.010
 normal stretching and even more 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.810
 there is a flower the future in the room has opened 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.369
 but already have a son 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:06.819
 right here 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.639
 here is the following 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.979
 all the same all exactly so 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.310
 that is my opinion of me 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.849
 decided it all also at all 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.719
 what if by bed warm that is khimki 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:23.010
 cavity from the bottom they are very thermophilic 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.599
 daddies 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.819
 and if the roots don't dry up in spite of that 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:28.639
 highly 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:29.469
 such here 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.559
 if they dry up suddenly they 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:33.169
 really stop at 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:33.879
 height 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.049
 and there is a sun here 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.419
 in my climate it is not very hot climate 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:39.629
 we have 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.919
 It was weeks, but it was a plus to kill them 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.950
 14 is now plus 30 i.e. drops occur 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.499
 but nonetheless from their feet warm in 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:50.779
 the sun does not get a year 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.659
 result 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.399
 so here so here 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:58.009
 so think if you can im 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.909
 it is possible to provide such conditions 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:01.929
 recalculate 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.230
 if they sit primer color and the weather 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.550
 about a year as we press and plus 30 and plus 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.189
 14 maybe 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:11.889
 then maybe it makes sense 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.059
 pinch 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:16.549
 when you or you can't 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.129
 ensure that the monument was 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:19.390
 constant 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.470
 so that they do not dry out because 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.750
 this is someone mataev 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.409
 which calmly a week without watering 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.189
 these all the same if suddenly that 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.180
 reinsurance land 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.349
 can 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.520
 stop growing naturally 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.349
 to have feet 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:36.759
 so to speak 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.379
 now summer from 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.830
 at the plan they are always Alexei Bulk himself 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.539
 now still a small layer but nonetheless 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:44.639
 murder 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.650
 everywhere there is a match even in the warm period 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.309
 panic and ears 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:50.859
 in the ground but the year wanted to show you 

00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:53.729
 how does popovich look like cues if they are not 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.110
 calculated 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.159
 because so that you yourself are better off 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.759
 forever i'm always with the only thing i 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.500
 I advise you to watch the type of plants look at 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.150
 your own climate and think no one 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.060
 the solution for everything cannot be said that 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.810
 year and this is right more 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.460
 no way 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.759
 that is, always watch ojara always 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.580
 show only what she tried 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.639
 subscribe to the channel good luck to you
