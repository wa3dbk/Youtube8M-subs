00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello, I'm a champion from Palermo, a musician from Palermo, a student of walter savelli 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.700
 this short video to tell all those who are interested in making 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.000
 lessons with walter brands like me don't have the chance to reach the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.650
 his musical laboratory 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.560
 to try the modem online or I'm simple but above all comfortable and 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.140
 in fact it is a question of making a video call to fight 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.800
 through a famous program called ladder that you can find 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.859
 the address www.skaipe.it 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:40.350
 all you need a pc unaware that man a headset with a microphone is a 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.400
 fast adsl connection 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.070
 I personally have been doing for about a year and lectures online and I have to say that 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.500
 they are absolutely fantastic both for the cultured crossroads and for the quality 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.210
 audio 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.670
 in fact, he seems to be standing next to his studio 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.540
 for more information you can visit the site in the laboratory 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.600
 musical at www. walter savelli. it where you will find a section 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.370
 dedicated to online elections, hello everyone 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.260
 there 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
 como 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.430
 online building societies with fairies and I must say that this is truly one 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.030
 nice idea 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.170
 especially for people like me who come from far away 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.210
 and then it takes a little computer 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.240
 a phone line and that's it walter is practically like he's here 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.670
 close to me 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.670
 a bullet to study other strained stories - 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.770
 but nooo 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.940
 hi to all my name is nicola terry and I come from lover in the province of cosenza 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.500
 I'm 21 and I also study at the musical workshop of walter savelli 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.029
 through online lessons 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:11.919
 the advantage of these elections is that in addition to being comfortable for those who have one 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:15.579
 planned life, however, unable to travel to the place where 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.979
 it is carried out in the lesson and it is very much the lesson that 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.019
 generally it is done live 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.079
 we are the convenience of being able to stay in your own home and perform the 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.849
 lesson even after many kilometers 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.999
 and also very easy to organize to take the lesson I personally% 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:39.730
 using a piano a microphone unaware became the computer the come out for 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.879
 perpetuate the lesson online 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.620
 the improvements I made in 4 months of study were really 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.029
 surprising and I thank walter king maurizio for putting themselves at 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:53.029
 available to us students 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:59.569
 summary of the itachi fax music lab 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:03.579
 a positive trend collection experience 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.400
 also because they allow me to follow during the lessons despite I love 3000 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.659
 and how are you laboratory wisdom 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.220
 however in real time 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.659
 burn shoes 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.889
 and this program from the sweetest 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:17.219
 a boat 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:18.759
 pianezza 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.519
 exits immediately 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.319
 in my case I work a lot on the composition and relational arrangement 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.629
 his painting - 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.989
 also because I allow myself to send the mixer directly apart and then 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.359
 work together in real time on food 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.489
 something that will be impossible is just a photo part 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.090
 and therefore as if we were together in the studio working on the massacre
