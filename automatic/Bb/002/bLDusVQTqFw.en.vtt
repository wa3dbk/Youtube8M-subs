00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.840
 hi youtube users i am vih worm i asked for this is my first video so 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.269
 I await your comments that you think 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.509
 this is about things you did not know about vehicle 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.509
 or curiosities of this as they want to call 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.679
 the information the ambush on the internet left everything in the information box 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:23.720
 here below 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.489
 said this start 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.130
 originally one curiosity 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.839
 nir was called melo and vice versa 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.850
 an error in the edition of the manga 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.200
 they came out with the names exchanged 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.600
 and that's how they stayed forever 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.510
 curiosity number 2 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.660
 the initials of kira 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.050
 and I'm going to one after the other in the alphabet 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.220
 pmm 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.340
 I imagine 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.180
 that the author created it to note the degree of intelligence of each character 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.120
 and as well I said the name of mir was exchanged for melo by an error ' 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.300
 this would mean that you are not smarter than melo 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.480
 and l more than the 2 or that kira is in first place but as we know 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.470
 what is the idea is they would be tied 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.190
 curiosity number 3 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.430
 In chapter 2 researchers from several countries that are in the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.650
 council have a small signature with their names and a country flag at 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.670
 which belongs to each one in front of their desks 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.689
 all those names are in fact names of soccer players from the same country 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.960
 they have in their flags 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 next a small example to what I mean 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.640
 no curiosity number 4 in the manga pilot the protagonist state kagami 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.690
 a 13-year-old student who does not know the meaning of beseit 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.440
 use the uc ignored as diary 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.400
 accidentally killing classmates 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.520
 that bother him constantly 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.470
 when rick appears he gives an element that will not appear in the manga 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.320
 nor the anime the de and touré and be 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.349
 an eraser that revives the people killed by the one of ignored ut 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.479
 as long as their bodies are intact 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.290
 you will not be able to revive someone killed years ago or someone you killed 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.299
 throwing him to a bonfire 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.409
 in my opinion if they had put the de and touré and steren the manga or anime 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.980
 I would have been entertained 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.829
 Maybe they did not put it in order not to make it so long 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.569
 or who knows 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.739
 curiosity number 5 if you read yagami the other way around we get the funny phrase and 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:35.349
 Maria and 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.430
 and what does it mean 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.669
 I am a king or a homosexual 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.689
 interesting revelation that of the aeat 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.370
 curiosity number 6 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.899
 good thing is that I would rather call it a failure 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:50.339
 during the entire ballet series ripped a bunch of pages from atheism ut yl 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:53.599
 he only found that he was missing a corner 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.249
 curiosity number 7 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:56.769
 this one may seem silly 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.819
 but while to the customs of l 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.069
 look and I 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.249
 al watari always brought him the sweets they have also brought him the 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.689
 toys but melo is just chocolate and saas 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.579
 I was taking out another one suddenly 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.359
 hosts 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:11.849
 As he did 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.949
 now three things must ignore that within these curiosities 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.989
 you find religion the first 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.139
 one of the rules of the north and c 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.590
 if you want to specify details of the death 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.590
 should be done in the next six minutes and 40 seconds 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.359
 in the Bible 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.010
 the '6' represents man 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.489
 because it was created on the sixth day of creation and 40 refers to the lapse 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.599
 of time that a punishment or a hard trip 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.409
 example 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.150
 the 40 days of the flood the 40 days that Jesus spent in the desert before 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.499
 start your public life and so on 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:46.639
 the second in the first chapter 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.849
 right at the beginning you hear the song kyrie eleison 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.819
 which is the common name of an important prayer of the liturgy 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.159
 Christian 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.599
 kyrie in Greek means or sr the full text of the song is 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.799
 Lord, have mercy 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.809
 Christ tempi old man have mercy 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.809
 naharro 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.629
 the hillside 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:19.259
 and the third 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.269
 chapter 25 of the anime 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.509
 the chapter where he dies in the last part where the the sk the feet at 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.430
 air people say it's a very flat scene and 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.250
 for me the meaning of that 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.290
 it was that he showed at the same time that he considered him his friend 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.340
 and that he already knew that his own end was already close 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.540
 in the bible they show when Jesus washes his feet to play before he 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.999
 I will betray him 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.629
 now two curiosities apart 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:49.020
 first curiosity suggests and goes the screenwriter of 'the big nou wrote his 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.060
 scripts on his knees in a chair as he did 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.740
 who claimed that if he does not adopt a similar position he works 50% of his 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.349
 deduction capacity 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.949
 I think everyone the first time we saw this position we thought 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:02.639
 strange 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.050
 Well, we already know who came out 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.250
 and 2nd curiosity some schools of the People's Republic of China 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.890
 they have banned manga after some of their students started to 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.069
 buy imitations of from ignored ucs and to write the names of their professors 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.819
 or from your own classmates in the notebook 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.469
 what Chinese so asshole 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:27.019
 well those are the curiosities and the video is almost finished but before I would like 

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:29.979
 clarify two things that many people ask 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.979
 ao the shinigami 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:34.860
 as well 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.910
 this doubt is because apparently in Japan it is translated by a male voice and in 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.620
 Spanish a feminine 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.639
 and in history 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.740
 arrenta seems to like mass 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.819
 she is good woman was why she died 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:50.779
 I read there that Mass was a fan and towed and looked like it was his daughter and 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:53.689
 that's why he expressed that love towards her 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:55.180
 second question 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.419
 what happened to he did after he died 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.860
 if at the beginning river that told him that those he uses do the appointed one 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.680
 they can go to heaven or hell 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.880
 there is a theory that says that when you can not and sign to heaven or hell 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.990
 for having used the one of ignored ut will go to the world without ibra min becoming 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.180
 one of them 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.720
 another theory says that the owner of the vehicle or die as many times as 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.280
 people have killed 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.510
 in the case of air 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.860
 thousands of times 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.639
 I think there is not an official answer for this 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.710
 since they left that to the air 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.710
 good users and utu see them here is my video 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:31.150
 I hope you have entertained them 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.810
 bilongo hifter says goodbye and
