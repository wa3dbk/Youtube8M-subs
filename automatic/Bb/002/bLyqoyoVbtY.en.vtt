all<00:00:33.090> great<00:00:33.239> inventions<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> combination<00:00:34.170> of

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
all great inventions is a combination of

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.150 
all great inventions is a combination of
a<00:00:34.530> bunch<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.770> other<00:00:34.920> things<00:00:36.440> both<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.649> outpost

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
a bunch of other things both the outpost

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.950 
a bunch of other things both the outpost
and<00:00:38.430> then<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.090> other<00:00:39.239> little<00:00:39.420> system<00:00:39.809> we

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and then this other little system we

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.500 
and then this other little system we
have<00:00:39.989> here<00:00:40.230> called<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> lily<00:00:40.620> pad<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.510> why

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
have here called the lily pad and why

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.790 
have here called the lily pad and why
don't<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.719> tell<00:00:42.899> us<00:00:42.930> exactly<00:00:43.140> what<00:00:43.649> these

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
don't you tell us exactly what these

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.670 
don't you tell us exactly what these
things<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.280> nutshell<00:00:44.460> sure<00:00:45.170> as<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.500> said

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
things do in a nutshell sure as I said

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.529 
things do in a nutshell sure as I said
this<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.010> outpost<00:00:47.700> system<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.329> this

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
this is the outpost system so this

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.529 
this is the outpost system so this
basically<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.260> our<00:00:49.649> powerhouse<00:00:50.370> cart<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.059> does

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
basically is our powerhouse cart it does

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.709 
basically is our powerhouse cart it does
processing<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.530> set<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.390> our

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
processing on set and then this is our

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.810 
processing on set and then this is our
lily<00:00:55.559> pad<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.129> basically<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.699> does

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
lily pad so basically what it does

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.369 
lily pad so basically what it does
mainly<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:58.050> set<00:00:58.620> color<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.480> begin<00:01:00.780> this

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
mainly is on set color so you begin this

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.470 
mainly is on set color so you begin this
car<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.309> set<00:01:02.850> while<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.149> car<00:01:03.329> could

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
car can be on set while this car could

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.260 
car can be on set while this car could
be<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:04.159> office<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.729> kind<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.119> work

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
be in a office and they kind of can work

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.859 
be in a office and they kind of can work
in<00:01:06.420> tandem<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.900> get<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> job<00:01:07.530> done<00:01:07.909> so<00:01:08.909> this

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
in tandem and get the job done so this

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.090 
in tandem and get the job done so this
is<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.140> you're<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.409> take<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.650> set<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
is what you're going to take to set to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.800 
is what you're going to take to set to
actually<00:01:11.520> create<00:01:11.790> both<00:01:12.000> both<00:01:12.299> systems<00:01:12.659> can

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
actually create both both systems can

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.770 
actually create both both systems can
create<00:01:13.049> dailies<00:01:13.350> both<00:01:14.250> systems<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.850> create

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
create dailies both systems can create

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.590 
create dailies both systems can create
dailies<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.170> their<00:01:16.290> own<00:01:16.409> way<00:01:17.000> they<00:01:18.000> each<00:01:18.330> have

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
dailies in their own way they each have

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.090 
dailies in their own way they each have
kind<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.960> specific<00:01:19.470> thing<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.680> they<00:01:20.040> do

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
kind of a specific thing that they do

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.940 
kind of a specific thing that they do
better<00:01:20.790> than<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.540> other<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.350> one's<00:01:22.530> again

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
better than the other this one's again

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.640 
better than the other this one's again
more<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.520> processing<00:01:24.450> power<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.930> also<00:01:25.500> has

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
more for processing power and also has

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
more for processing power and also has
external<00:01:26.040> storage<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.939> more<00:01:27.090> space

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
external storage so you have more space

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.109 
external storage so you have more space
for<00:01:27.450> your<00:01:27.920> dailies<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.189> one's<00:01:29.400> more<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:29.880> on

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
set color so it's more of a creative

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.060 
set color so it's more of a creative

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
actually in look just like the bits that

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.730 
actually in look just like the bits that
are<00:02:43.460> in<00:02:43.720> technically<00:02:44.720> inside<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.590> whole

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
are in technically inside the whole

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.060 
are in technically inside the whole
system<00:02:45.980> here<00:02:46.280> sure<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:48.170> outpost<00:02:48.500> cart<00:02:48.770> kind

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
system here sure the outpost cart kind

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.970 
system here sure the outpost cart kind
of<00:02:49.190> consists<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:50.050> normally<00:02:51.050> two<00:02:51.260> towers<00:02:51.680> so

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
of consists of normally two towers so

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.170 
of consists of normally two towers so
you<00:02:52.070> have<00:02:52.190> one<00:02:52.370> tower<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:52.790> does<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.030> main

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
you have one tower that does the main

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.699 
you have one tower that does the main
processing<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.840> then<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:53.990> have<00:02:54.110> one<00:02:54.320> tower

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
processing and then you have one tower

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.370 
processing and then you have one tower
for<00:02:55.100> backup<00:02:55.820> or<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.480> can<00:02:56.630> do<00:02:56.750> processing<00:02:57.260> on

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
for backup or you can do processing on

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.840 
for backup or you can do processing on
that<00:02:57.500> as<00:02:57.620> well<00:02:57.740> kind<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.100> depends<00:02:58.459> on<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.670> show
