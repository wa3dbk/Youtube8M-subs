00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
wimax ebook reader and when we get over

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.429 
wimax ebook reader and when we get over
to<00:01:10.719> the<00:01:11.310> left<00:01:12.310> we<00:01:13.270> have<00:01:13.299> a<00:01:13.420> little<00:01:13.630> m<00:01:13.810> ID<00:01:14.020> from

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
to the left we have a little m ID from

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.709 
to the left we have a little m ID from
me<00:01:14.590> check<00:01:14.829> the<00:01:15.780> MIT<00:01:16.780> me<00:01:17.049> body<00:01:17.289> and<00:01:18.600> there<00:01:19.600> is<00:01:19.689> a

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
me check the MIT me body and there is a

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.929 
me check the MIT me body and there is a
wimax<00:01:20.139> module<00:01:20.530> in<00:01:20.619> front<00:01:20.889> of<00:01:21.039> it<00:01:21.159> so<00:01:21.490> this<00:01:21.819> is

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
wimax module in front of it so this is

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.880 
wimax module in front of it so this is
also<00:01:22.119> why<00:01:22.569> max<00:01:22.810> enabled

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
also why max enabled

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.980 
also why max enabled
so<00:01:25.490> what's<00:01:25.700> what's<00:01:25.940> what's<00:01:26.090> what's<00:01:26.479> a<00:01:26.780> huge

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
so what's what's what's what's a huge

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.560 
so what's what's what's what's a huge
advantage<00:01:27.470> of<00:01:27.860> wimax<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.550> we<00:01:28.610> compared<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:29.270> to

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
advantage of wimax and we compared it to

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.300 
advantage of wimax and we compared it to
3G<00:01:30.530> or<00:01:30.560> 3.5<00:01:31.159> g<00:01:31.670> first<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.540> all<00:01:32.920> upload<00:01:33.920> speed

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
3G or 3.5 g first of all upload speed

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.370 
3G or 3.5 g first of all upload speed
and<00:01:34.940> definitely<00:01:35.920> latency<00:01:37.990> here<00:01:38.990> are<00:01:39.140> some

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
and definitely latency here are some

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.510 
and definitely latency here are some
other<00:01:39.680> little<00:01:40.159> devices<00:01:41.350> actually<00:01:42.490> we<00:01:43.490> just

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
other little devices actually we just

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.960 
other little devices actually we just
did<00:01:43.970> our<00:01:44.530> hands-on<00:01:45.530> video<00:01:45.710> with<00:01:46.610> this<00:01:46.759> little

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
did our hands-on video with this little

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.899 
did our hands-on video with this little
media<00:01:48.190> or<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.250> media<00:01:49.900> mig<00:01:51.909> cmi<00:01:52.909> dmo<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:54.909> this

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
media or the media mig cmi dmo and this

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.740 
media or the media mig cmi dmo and this
one<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.210> was<00:01:56.570> based<00:01:56.840> on<00:01:57.020> windows<00:01:57.410> ce<00:01:57.649> e<00:01:57.680> i<00:01:58.070> think

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
one is was based on windows ce e i think

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.630 
one is was based on windows ce e i think
it's<00:01:59.750> also<00:01:59.899> again<00:02:00.380> wimax<00:02:01.190> enabled<00:02:01.869> finally

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
it's also again wimax enabled finally

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.190 
it's also again wimax enabled finally
due<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.820> our<00:02:04.850> name<00:02:05.180> netbook<00:02:05.570> music<00:02:05.930> um<00:02:06.110> of

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
and then we have an acer aspire one this

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.300 
and then we have an acer aspire one this
looks<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.450> me<00:02:26.599> like<00:02:26.629> the<00:02:27.280> d250<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:31.190> know

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
looks to me like the d250 you know

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.290 
looks to me like the d250 you know
actually<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:32.209> says<00:02:32.480> 3g<00:02:33.080> online<00:02:34.069> maybe<00:02:35.060> they

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
actually it says 3g online maybe they

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.880 
actually it says 3g online maybe they
also<00:02:35.530> squeeze<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.860> wimax<00:02:37.310> module<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:37.940> there

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.890 
also squeeze the wimax module in there
and<00:02:39.890> then<00:02:40.280> let's<00:02:40.489> head<00:02:40.640> over<00:02:40.760> here<00:02:41.239> is<00:02:41.450> mobile

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
and then let's head over here is mobile

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.460 
and then let's head over here is mobile
online<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:42.530> we<00:02:42.560> have<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.920> asus<00:02:43.310> eeepc<00:02:44.470> that

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
online so we have the asus eeepc that
