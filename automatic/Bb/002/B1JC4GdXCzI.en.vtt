we want to achieve there and it's

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.170 
we want to achieve there and it's
definitely<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.019> case<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.500> by<00:02:12.980> using<00:02:13.700> those

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
definitely the case that by using those

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.360 
definitely the case that by using those
three<00:02:14.870> companies<00:02:15.320> expertise<00:02:15.890> together<00:02:16.190> in

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.320 

it's<00:02:23.709> strange<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.190> think<00:02:24.220> but<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:24.910> just<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.180> few

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
it's strange to think but in just a few

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.970 
it's strange to think but in just a few
years<00:02:25.390> we<00:02:25.930> could<00:02:26.050> hear<00:02:26.200> these<00:02:26.349> guys<00:02:26.380> talking

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
years we could hear these guys talking

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.640 
years we could hear these guys talking
about<00:02:27.190> software<00:02:27.489> -<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:28.530> think<00:02:29.530> the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650
