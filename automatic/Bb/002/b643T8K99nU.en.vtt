00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the house keeper shut these every day

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.250 
the house keeper shut these every day
but<00:00:45.530> we<00:00:46.530> usually<00:00:46.829> don't<00:00:46.980> keep<00:00:47.250> them<00:00:47.460> shut<00:00:48.260> so

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
but we usually don't keep them shut so

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500 
but we usually don't keep them shut so
there<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.039> Ryan<00:00:50.640> doesn't<00:00:50.879> really<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.329> it

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
there it is Ryan doesn't really like it

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.779 
there it is Ryan doesn't really like it
much<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:53.039> center<00:00:53.370> here<00:00:53.610> it's

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
much because in the center here it's

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.200 
much because in the center here it's
divided<00:00:54.469> it's<00:00:55.469> actually<00:00:56.370> two<00:00:56.520> twin<00:00:56.760> beds<00:00:56.879> put

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
divided it's actually two twin beds put

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.450 
divided it's actually two twin beds put
together<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:58.289> more<00:00:58.500> European<00:00:59.039> than<00:00:59.070> I

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
together so it's more European than I

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.340

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
absolutely huge as you can tell by the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.069 
absolutely huge as you can tell by the
coffee<00:01:39.210> table<00:01:39.770> it's<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.970> don't<00:01:42.750> know<00:01:42.990> if

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
coffee table it's like I don't know if

coffee table it's like I don't know if
six<00:01:43.229> people<00:01:43.649> probably<00:01:43.920> could<00:01:44.310> fit<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.700> it's
