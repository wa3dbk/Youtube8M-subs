so<00:01:16.560> we'll<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.159> see<00:01:17.310> about<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.659> we

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
so we'll have to see about that so we

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.539 
so we'll have to see about that so we
can<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.110> ahead<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.320> open<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.250> little

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
can go ahead and open this up a little

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.450 
can go ahead and open this up a little
tab<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.150> back<00:01:22.040> pull<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.189> up<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:25.460> take

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
tab on the back pull this up and take

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.469 
tab on the back pull this up and take
everything<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.270> some

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
everything out and so we have some

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.999 
everything out and so we have some
instructions<00:01:30.990> here<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.520> different<00:01:32.520> languages

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009

instructions here in different languages
as<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.220> see<00:01:35.430> there<00:01:37.250> we<00:01:38.250> also<00:01:38.400> get<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
as you can see there we also get the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.390 
as you can see there we also get the
labels<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.710> see<00:01:40.890> each<00:01:41.040> color<00:01:41.340> has

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
labels so you can see each color has

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.950 
labels so you can see each color has
different<00:01:42.000> kind<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:43.250> things<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.430> top<00:01:44.960> movies

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.179 
also we get the USB cable so you can see
this<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.180> USB<00:02:00.450> 3<00:02:00.960> 2<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.829> think<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.270> their

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
this is USB 3 2 I think that it's their

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.740 
this is USB 3 2 I think that it's their
proprietary<00:02:05.189> port<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.790> haven't<00:02:06.210> seen<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.600> like

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750

this before and finally we have the hard

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.470 
this before and finally we have the hard
drive<00:02:09.989> itself<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.520> nice<00:02:11.760> matte<00:02:12.150> black

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
