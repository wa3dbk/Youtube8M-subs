00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.189
 number of diamonds 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.439
 for example the move Arsen Lupine and he chooses 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:59.739
 action change two adjacent cards 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.810
 in some places without turning them while he 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.049
 makes a prize combination and 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.750
 gets two diamonds case if 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.979
 a number of prize combination is collected 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.720
 central card of this combination 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:16.359
 the discharge goes away and the row closes after Arsen 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.130
 lupine and lady x comes into play 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.209
 have to choose from the five remaining 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.940
 cards 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.530
 Lady X selects 3 actions that 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.510
 allows you to flip one any 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.070
 card to the opposite side 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:32.260
 after that it is necessary to return the line 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.200
 discard a previously laid out card 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.170
 can be both left and right of the five 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.450
 the remaining cards are the third possible 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.940
 action allows you to move the card 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.980
 from one end of the row to the opposite 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.320
 while turning the card 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.750
 prohibited hot lady x 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.760
 she makes a prize combination for 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.370
 one diamond gets 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.980
 I want to note one important point of the rules 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.650
 the case when the player returns to the row 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.830
 card and at the same time makes a prize 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.840
 a combination then no diamonds he 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.510
 getting as soon as one of the players 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.480
 collects 7 or more diamonds he 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.960
 the winner of this game is blue 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.150
 diamond 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.040
 this is a fast interesting game which 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.410
 will require you to use memory and 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.600
 logical thinking to build a prize 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.760
 chain is not as difficult as few as 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.680
 prize combinations all known 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.210
 create a chain of nothing 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.520
 notable cards during 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.590
 flip the card and get a set 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.810
 perplexed opponent do not think that 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.430
 everything will be so simple opponent constantly 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.930
 will follow your actions and 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.540
 will take advantage of your very first 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.160
 miss tactics and memory is excellent 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.530
 combination for card games with 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.800
 diamonds by the way about diamonds personally 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.520
 I will leave them to myself 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.520
 steal me
