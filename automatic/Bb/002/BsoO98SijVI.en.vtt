because he was a contemporary of
Venturi's<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.220> whole<00:00:38.370> basis<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.150> this

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
Venturi's and the whole basis of this

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.979 
Venturi's and the whole basis of this
house<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.900> terms<00:00:40.080> of<00:00:40.350> how<00:00:40.920> its<00:00:41.070> ventilated<00:00:41.989> is

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
house in terms of how its ventilated is

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.570 
house in terms of how its ventilated is
on<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.379> premise<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:45.090> house<00:00:45.269> is<00:00:45.540> constructed

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
on that premise the house is constructed

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.729 
on that premise the house is constructed
out<00:00:47.580> of<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.910> heavy<00:00:47.940> mass<00:00:48.360> material<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.290> wanted<00:00:49.650> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
out of a heavy mass material I wanted to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.229 
out of a heavy mass material I wanted to
use<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> local<00:00:50.309> materials<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.720> looked<00:00:52.019> to

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
use the local materials and I looked to

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.240 
use the local materials and I looked to
use<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> butcher<00:00:54.720> system<00:00:55.170> rather<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> old

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
use a butcher system rather like the old

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.100 
use a butcher system rather like the old
church<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> medieval<00:00:57.360> church<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.809> see

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
church is the medieval church as you see

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.319 
church is the medieval church as you see
with<00:00:58.260> flying<00:00:58.590> buttresses<00:00:59.100> by<00:00:59.640> introducing

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
with flying buttresses by introducing

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.020 
with flying buttresses by introducing
flying<00:01:00.660> buttresses<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.559> could<00:01:02.280> take<00:01:02.520> away<00:01:02.670> some

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
flying buttresses I could take away some

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.150 
flying buttresses I could take away some
of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> internal<00:01:03.750> structure<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.770> let<00:01:04.949> light

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
of the internal structure to let light

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.480 
of the internal structure to let light
in<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.050> these<00:01:07.350> butcher<00:01:07.770> sees<00:01:07.979> outside

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
in so that these butcher sees outside

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.550 
in so that these butcher sees outside
have<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> dual<00:01:09.000> role<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.899> only<00:01:09.960> did<00:01:10.440> they

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
have a dual role not only did they

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.889 
have a dual role not only did they
support<00:01:10.800> this<00:01:11.130> structure<00:01:11.580> which<00:01:12.300> allows<00:01:12.630> this

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
support this structure which allows this

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.320 
support this structure which allows this
also<00:01:13.289> this<00:01:13.649> supports<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.789> the<00:01:14.910> barrel

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
also this supports this but the barrel

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.560 
also this supports this but the barrel
vault<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.680> also<00:01:16.979> act<00:01:17.550> as<00:01:17.729> part<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
vault but they also act as part of the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.260 
vault but they also act as part of the
ventilation<00:01:18.990> system<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.369> what<00:01:20.759> happens<00:01:21.119> is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
ventilation system so what happens is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.840 
ventilation system so what happens is
the<00:01:21.660> rotating<00:01:22.619> cows<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:23.130> top<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> flying

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the rotating cows on top of the flying

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.450 
the rotating cows on top of the flying
buttresses<00:01:24.300> bring<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> air<00:01:25.500> down<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.250> then

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
buttresses bring the air down and then

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.330 
buttresses bring the air down and then
across<00:01:26.750> some<00:01:27.750> ducts<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.530> through<00:01:29.189> these

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
across some ducts and through these

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
across some ducts and through these
vents<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:30.659> feed<00:01:30.930> fresh<00:01:31.380> air<00:01:31.590> into<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
vents to feed fresh air into the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.240 
vents to feed fresh air into the
building<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.750> living<00:01:37.049> spaces<00:01:37.350> are<00:01:37.740> all

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
building the living spaces are all

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.310 
building the living spaces are all
upstairs<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.900> enjoy<00:01:40.140> this
