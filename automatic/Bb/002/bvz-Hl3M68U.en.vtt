00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:12.519
 It would not have any indication anything came out. What is this expectation of 3.7% 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.859
 And there you How would this be interpreted as some positive What about another one 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.119
 I think we need to interpret it positively. 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:24.880
 In fact, it is very likely to be the bottom of the economic cycle from the fourth quarter 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.839
 Although it is still high , it seems to be optimistic that the economy is recovering soon . 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.400

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:32.579

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.579

 4 It's a live broadcast. 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:01.480
 The fact that I told them they were not stable 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:06.120
 I sat in Paris means that we will go after the ship, so keep talking 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.120
 I'm talking about the economy of the country, Paris is seated. 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:15.630

 Growth rate is now 4% 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:58.280
 Once I had an expectation for the recovery, but it was positive. 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:01.910
 It does not mean that the game is completely round the floor 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.159
 One pass will focus its overseas such as in talk 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.960
