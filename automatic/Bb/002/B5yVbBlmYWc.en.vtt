and<00:02:20.530> yeah<00:02:21.530> that's<00:02:21.799> almost<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.760> through<00:02:23.239> just

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
and yeah that's almost it through just

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.030 
and yeah that's almost it through just
building<00:02:24.890> your<00:02:24.920> roller<00:02:25.310> coaster<00:02:26.409> it's<00:02:27.409> not

building your roller coaster it's not

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.890

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
too complicated now keep watching or you

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.449 
too complicated now keep watching or you
can<00:02:36.110> speed<00:02:36.440> up<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.829> where<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.010> think<00:02:37.370> it's

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
can speed up to where I think it's

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.930 
can speed up to where I think it's
boxing<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.120> in<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:39.099> would<00:02:40.099> prefer<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.700> stay

okay<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.970> here<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:51.290> need<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.739> wedge<00:02:52.190> block

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.339 

because<00:02:56.690> your<00:02:57.140> roller<00:02:57.409> coaster<00:02:57.890> won't<00:02:58.159> turn

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
because your roller coaster won't turn

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.670 
because your roller coaster won't turn
it<00:03:00.730> well<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:02.060> don't<00:03:02.629> think<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.079> well<00:03:03.230> I've<00:03:03.409> never

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680
