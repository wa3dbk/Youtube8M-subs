00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.809
 now 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:17.289
 oo the younger ansa 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.689
 an 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.739
 thanks for this little introduction 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.739
 this 3d design program 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.130
 per hundred if it is true is not the best to deal with is the one that has 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.150
 more flash support 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.110
 that really what I'm looking for 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.420
 This is a payment program 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.720
 Per hundred but the truth is a very comfortable price can not reconcile 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.720
 have we go to the environment 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.020
 of our program 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.500
 says vd 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.810
 i started down here 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.330
 used an object 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.450
 on this side I have the one defeated 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.110
 give him the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.110
 the un what I did 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.950
 on this side I have the lights 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.160
 lights 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
 the lighting of our work what is said 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.120
 a very interesting application 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.520
 from this side we have the materials 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.940
 and well several things we will see each other one by one 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.850
 how good is that we drag and we count change one comma we drag we count 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.350
 also from other 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.910
 and good 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.290
 We have several cougar tabs that you can choose from among several various objects 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.640
 and good you can measure bathroom 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.490
 from here we want animations 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.440
 is that they are small animated shorts 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.450
 that are not good for 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.760
 to dismiss him properly 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.330
 we dragged 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.840
 democracy if both are always 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.870
 what 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.290
 start producing 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.380
 these are not very important here there is a long record vote 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:10.829
 little 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.079
 small design objects 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.049
 drag it but loose 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.049
 really good cocaine objects 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:23.689
 there are several there are several that the country is three tabs to be precise 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.359
 for the moment 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.969
 i 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.079
 but here 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.069
 well as we have seen we have left 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.849
 from here you can see several 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.739
 from several places above 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.980
 from the left or right voting it good several things 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:41.579
 so we have 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.779
 It is not our own scenario that we see tic on stage 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.819
 if you can change the color of espoo a teacher 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.359
 let's keep growing 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.899
 of mex object let's see 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.899
 all its properties is a matter of exploring them a little 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:01.529
 and from this side of the world end time very similar to france 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:06.239
 we arrived here on ebay we can see the frames that are created 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:09.549
 several wells 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.209
 from here we see the frames per second that is somewhat kitsch very 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.209
 important I'm selling does from a start 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:20.509
 the good thing is that I'm 24 for a more professional animation 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:22.860
 we'll see 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.140
 here the buttons of badosa lawsuits and here we have 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.639
 objects here are stored everything we insert 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.639
 here appeared if the steps steps 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:38.269
 hours later 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.009
 Here we go 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:42.489
 from here are the classic buttons of 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.259
 of April 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:45.239
 d 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.389
 then commented open and save 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.409
 by the way here we can stay 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.799
 new objects that work the most in Moscow as a whole 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.689
 several things 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.509
 we can create texts because we know what 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:00.649
 we grow 

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:02.679
 isis 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:04.469
 roque dÃ­az team 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:08.349
 have an object we can change the size we can do 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.909
 smaller larger is a good option if you do not want to use the 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.709
 properties 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.759
 level that we have up here 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.189
 this little Francoist says 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:20.859
 let's go to merit 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.650
 very simple designer by sectors 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.650
 we are also those options 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:30.189
 with the little arrow start avoiding the vaults 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.719
 modern and 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:34.159
 several things 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.090
 this program is going to be very useful for one 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.710
 next sectorial 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.729
 we trust makes it inevitable 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.729
 we see that here they appear okey 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.180
 let's be able to expert 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.180
 yen-hsun geometric editor 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.879
 let's see a small example quickly if we do 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.719
 quickly gil 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.210
 small 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.210
 and we are going to ascend and everything we see that completes 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.449
 and good efe is appreciated that this interesting 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.770
 we go albans 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.330
 ball what good is a merit 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.309
 if we can continue - 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:18.309
 it is for everyone small readers is very interesting 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:20.999
 we select live in 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:23.759
 we can modify it at our whim 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:24.850
 democracy 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.210
 cb the variation okey 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.070
 and good let's add a little animation to see the following 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.309
 we are dragging 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:37.409
 a material that is 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.029
 flaherty 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:41.289
 i 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.430
 we go to previous and sport 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.020
 we are going to 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.330
 originally good vector let's drag it 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.240
 verify that it says the golden sun type star 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:56.210
 the manager import more clear 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.150
 we are here there are no bull sources 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.189
 also the frames are generated 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:02.960
 according to luque 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.719
 because he called him psycho 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:06.970
 and good the truth 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.690
 it generates much faster than previous versions 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.729
 I have tried them 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.349
 and ugt 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:14.250
 efe 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.719
 here with dida 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.639
 this little introduction of this program 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.719
 he repeated it is an interesting program 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:23.249
 i 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:26.169
 it happens in many towns nearby projects 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.100
 we have from here
