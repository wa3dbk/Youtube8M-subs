to do that you need to identify the key

to do that you need to identify the key

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
any government department so we have

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.260 
any government department so we have
looked<00:01:28.289> at<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> first<00:01:28.979> two<00:01:29.219> steps<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:30.240> have

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
looked at the first two steps we have

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.999 
looked at the first two steps we have
told<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.840> reader<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:31.319> the<00:01:31.500> essay<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.979> about

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
and we have avoided copying words from

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.959 
and we have avoided copying words from
the<00:01:34.979> title<00:01:36.170> having<00:01:37.170> done<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:38.310> next<00:01:38.729> step

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
the title having done that the next step

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:40.940 
the title having done that the next step
is<00:01:39.179> to<00:01:39.329> tell<00:01:39.569> the<00:01:39.750> reader<00:01:39.959> which<00:01:40.380> direction

essay<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.270> presented<00:01:46.729> for<00:01:47.729> example<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:49.170> could

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
essay be presented for example we could

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.130 
essay be presented for example we could
add<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.679> following<00:01:50.810> although<00:01:51.810> there<00:01:51.989> are

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
add the following although there are

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.410 
add the following although there are
arguments<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.009> made<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.520> support<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.149> this

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
arguments to be made in support of this

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.080 
arguments to be made in support of this
there<00:01:55.289> is<00:01:55.500> perhaps<00:01:55.709> a<00:01:56.099> stronger<00:01:56.640> point<00:01:56.909> of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
there is perhaps a stronger point of

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.809 
there is perhaps a stronger point of
view<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.659> feels<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.259> older<00:01:58.739> people<00:01:58.920> should

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
view that feels that older people should

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.699 
view that feels that older people should
not<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.360> rely<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.259> goodwill<00:02:01.530> of

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.469 

from<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.709> we<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.670> tell<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.239> writer

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
from this we can tell that the writer

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.500
