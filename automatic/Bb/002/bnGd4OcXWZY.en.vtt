00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.220 
like ages away i really was actually
worried<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.700> fam<00:02:17.849> can<00:02:18.030> happen<00:02:18.359> to<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.599> he

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230

with them you know just with up in a big

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.330 
with them you know just with up in a big
day<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:25.200> even<00:02:25.319> with<00:02:25.469> all<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> crowds<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.250> I

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
day and even with all the crowds and I

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.699 
day and even with all the crowds and I
suppose<00:02:26.579> you<00:02:26.849> know<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.090> moni<00:02:27.359> and<00:02:28.290> I'm<00:02:28.379> seven

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
suppose you know I moni and I'm seven

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.050 
suppose you know I moni and I'm seven
weeks<00:02:28.859> out<00:02:29.040> there<00:02:29.250> which<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.489> still<00:02:29.639> loads<00:02:29.879> of

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
weeks out there which is still loads of

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.699 
weeks out there which is still loads of
time<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:30.629> anything<00:02:30.959> did<00:02:31.260> have<00:02:31.439> them<00:02:31.620> I

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
time but if anything did have them I

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.410 
time but if anything did have them I
would<00:02:31.889> be<00:02:32.159> a<00:02:32.189> little<00:02:32.400> anxious<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:33.090> suppose<00:02:33.299> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
would be a little anxious I suppose the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.429 
would be a little anxious I suppose the
first<00:02:33.599> their<00:02:33.780> way<00:02:33.930> also<00:02:34.290> he'll<00:02:34.769> be<00:02:34.920> there<00:02:36.439> I've

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
first their way also he'll be there I've

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.170 
first their way also he'll be there I've
always<00:02:37.680> loved<00:02:37.980> getting<00:02:38.129> my<00:02:38.250> nails<00:02:38.400> done<00:02:38.549> oh

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.300 

it's<00:02:42.180> an<00:02:42.659> especially<00:02:42.900> now<00:02:43.409> I<00:02:43.439> think<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:44.040> one

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
it's an especially now I think it's one

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.699 
it's an especially now I think it's one
thing<00:02:44.519> that<00:02:45.209> doesn't<00:02:45.419> change<00:02:45.599> so<00:02:46.260> it's<00:02:46.439> nice

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
thing that doesn't change so it's nice

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.050 
thing that doesn't change so it's nice
to<00:02:46.980> have<00:02:47.069> them<00:02:47.280> done<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.669> know<00:02:47.790> when<00:02:47.939> you're

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
to have them done you know when you're

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.110 
to have them done you know when you're
working<00:02:48.209> it's<00:02:48.540> nice<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.930> feel<00:02:49.549> but<00:02:50.549> you<00:02:50.579> look

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
working it's nice to feel but you look

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.839 
working it's nice to feel but you look
professional<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.810> guess<00:02:52.019> them<00:02:52.549> I've<00:02:53.549> no<00:02:53.700> it's

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
professional I guess them I've no it's

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.490 
professional I guess them I've no it's
one<00:02:54.030> treats<00:02:54.359> that<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.689> because<00:02:55.109> even<00:02:55.379> with

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
one treats that you because even with

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.530 
one treats that you because even with
massages<00:02:55.799> andthings<00:02:56.189> now<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.519> kind<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.939> it's

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
massages andthings now you kind of it's

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.559 
massages andthings now you kind of it's
not<00:02:57.780> as<00:02:57.900> comfortable<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.620> know<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.569> this

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
not as comfortable you know so and this

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.720 
not as comfortable you know so and this
is<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.109> one<00:03:01.230> thing<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.530> doesn't<00:03:02.340> really

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
is the one thing that doesn't really

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.890 
is the one thing that doesn't really
matter<00:03:03.030> about<00:03:03.269> how<00:03:03.689> big<00:03:03.900> my<00:03:04.079> bumpers<00:03:05.629> just<00:03:06.629> I

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.050 
matter about how big my bumpers just I
feel<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.469> just<00:03:07.560> feel<00:03:07.829> slower<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.639> think<00:03:08.909> that's

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
feel I just feel slower I think that's

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.659 
feel I just feel slower I think that's
actually<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.569> just<00:03:09.840> feel<00:03:10.349> slower<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:11.189> know<00:03:11.340> so

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
actually I just feel slower you know so

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.449 
actually I just feel slower you know so
and<00:03:12.200> like<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.469> like<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.709> tell<00:03:13.950> us<00:03:14.069> late<00:03:14.280> for

and like that like I tell us late for

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.159 
and like that like I tell us late for
everything<00:03:14.579> in<00:03:14.969> sweet<00:03:15.209> just<00:03:15.629> because<00:03:15.959> I

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
everything in sweet just because I

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.110 
everything in sweet just because I
actually<00:03:16.650> know<00:03:16.979> any<00:03:17.159> way<00:03:17.340> more<00:03:17.579> time<00:03:17.819> and<00:03:18.060> I'm

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
actually know any way more time and I'm

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.610 
actually know any way more time and I'm
just<00:03:18.239> like<00:03:18.359> able<00:03:18.629> to<00:03:18.690> make<00:03:18.840> myself<00:03:18.959> go<00:03:19.260> faster

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
just like able to make myself go faster

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.920 
just like able to make myself go faster
so<00:03:20.579> well<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.569> think<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:23.239> find<00:03:24.239> it's<00:03:24.599> well<00:03:24.750> my

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
so well I think I find it's well my

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.509 
so well I think I find it's well my
sleep<00:03:25.139> and<00:03:25.260> probably<00:03:25.530> isn't<00:03:25.799> as<00:03:25.889> good<00:03:26.069> and<00:03:26.340> so

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
sleep and probably isn't as good and so

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.250 
sleep and probably isn't as good and so
that<00:03:26.669> makes<00:03:26.909> that<00:03:27.180> makes<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.540> harder<00:03:27.870> maybe<00:03:28.049> as

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
that makes that makes it harder maybe as

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.199 
that makes that makes it harder maybe as
well<00:03:28.439> you<00:03:28.620> know<00:03:28.739> how<00:03:29.310> about<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.669> final<00:03:30.150> on

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
well you know how about the final on

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.490 
well you know how about the final on
Thunder<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.689> been<00:03:30.840> anxious<00:03:31.139> about<00:03:31.260> that

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
Thunder you been anxious about that

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.719 
Thunder you been anxious about that
alone<00:03:31.680> no<00:03:32.449> really<00:03:33.449> excited<00:03:34.189> because<00:03:35.189> you<00:03:35.609> know

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
that's probably the most enjoyable part

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.469 
that's probably the most enjoyable part
to<00:03:37.949> my<00:03:38.040> work<00:03:38.220> absolutely<00:03:38.970> no<00:03:39.060> but<00:03:39.209> it's<00:03:39.359> so

nerve-wrackin I mean I generally don't

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.149 
nerve-wrackin I mean I generally don't
love<00:03:45.150> crowds<00:03:45.569> though<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.199> you<00:03:46.889> know<00:03:46.979> that's

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
love crowds though so you know that's

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.550

the<00:03:47.370> only<00:03:47.639> thing<00:03:47.819> don't<00:03:48.479> it<00:03:48.629> that's<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.409> only

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
the only thing don't it that's the only

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.809 
the only thing don't it that's the only
thing<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:49.829> maybe<00:03:49.979> I'm<00:03:50.189> a<00:03:50.280> little<00:03:50.310> anxious

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
thing that maybe I'm a little anxious

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.849 
thing that maybe I'm a little anxious
about<00:03:51.150> but<00:03:51.930> of<00:03:52.019> course<00:03:52.049> in<00:03:52.349> croke<00:03:52.500> park<00:03:52.530> they

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
color I think that's what it's about so

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.820 
color I think that's what it's about so
they<00:05:32.090> would<00:05:32.240> need<00:05:32.449> to<00:05:32.630> not<00:05:33.199> have<00:05:33.380> color<00:05:33.620> on

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
they would need to not have color on

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.939 
they would need to not have color on
your<00:05:33.949> nails<00:05:34.009> so<00:05:35.440> when<00:05:36.440> guessing<00:05:36.770> French

your nails so when guessing French

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.210

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.280
