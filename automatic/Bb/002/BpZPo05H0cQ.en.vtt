on the team besides the hero unit and we

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.969 
on the team besides the hero unit and we
got<00:01:22.140> dwarf<00:01:22.500> go<00:01:22.710> boom<00:01:23.659> more<00:01:24.659> which<00:01:24.979> strategy

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
got dwarf go boom more which strategy

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.649 
got dwarf go boom more which strategy
and<00:01:26.540> also<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> water<00:01:28.500> washes<00:01:29.659> everybody

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and also so the water washes everybody

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.330 
and also so the water washes everybody
two<00:01:30.840> squares<00:01:31.200> unless<00:01:31.650> there's<00:01:31.890> something<00:01:32.100> in

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
two squares unless there's something in

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.230 
two squares unless there's something in
the<00:01:32.430> way<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.189> attack<00:01:35.579> these<00:01:35.759> corner

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the way so just attack these corner

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.700 
the way so just attack these corner
engineer's<00:01:37.159> blow<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.220> their<00:01:38.400> bodies<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:42.710> then

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
engineer's blow up their bodies and then

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.880 
engineer's blow up their bodies and then
take<00:01:44.009> out<00:01:44.189> everybody<00:01:49.100> next<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.250> clear<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> path

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
take out everybody next up clear a path

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.969 
take out everybody next up clear a path
so<00:01:52.890> what<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.490> need<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.479> make<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> pass<00:01:55.560> for

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
so what we need to do is make a pass for

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.819 
so what we need to do is make a pass for
the<00:01:56.100> warrior<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:56.909> through<00:01:57.380> his<00:01:58.380> bonus

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
the warrior to get through his bonus

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.780 
the warrior to get through his bonus
also<00:01:59.280> affects<00:02:01.070> crystals<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> crystal<00:02:02.729> is

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
also affects crystals so the crystal is

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.059 
also affects crystals so the crystal is
below<00:02:03.119> twenty<00:02:03.540> five<00:02:03.719> percent<00:02:03.750> health<00:02:04.850> the

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
below twenty five percent health the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.800 
below twenty five percent health the
warrior<00:02:08.069> will<00:02:08.220> kill<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.580> one<00:02:08.759> shot<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
warrior will kill it in one shot so the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.290 
warrior will kill it in one shot so the
way<00:02:09.929> we're<00:02:10.110> going<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.259> do<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:11.150> since<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
