00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.260
 hello welcome to this video 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.609
 today we will work our dwarf 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.810
 low so if you're right handed like 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.490
 it's your left hand 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.230
 if you're left handed it's your hand 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.589
 right this video is divided into three 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.359
 parts 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.189
 first part with exercises on 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.169
 the second part pad with some 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.669
 drills on drums and third 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.109
 parties we will implement everything 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.109
 that with rhythms and son 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.840
 a strong hand that is able to go to 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.250
 this speed being comfortable then 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.470
 your weak hand she she goes to 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.390
 maximum at this speed and when you 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.560
 make friezes and fast what will happen 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.700
 to pass is that your strong hand she 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.900
 will keep up but your hand weak 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.580
 was going to be completely picking it up 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.230
 so that's why you have to 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.200
 work your weak hand separately 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.360
 to narrow the gap with the strong hand 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.530
 work it would only be for two 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.880
 weeks a little bit every day 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.590
 your weak hand and you'll see the 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.330
 spectacular results on our curly 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.130
 they will be much faster 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.600
 much cleaner much more 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.530
 regular second good reason that I 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.540
 see to work by weak hand 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.830
 is that if you play crusader on 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.780
 your battery you are going to hit your 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.250
 snare with the left hand and 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.479
 to have rhythmics that groove it 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.190
 have to be able to put 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.990
 different intensities in your strikes 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.180
 so very strong costs that are called 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.500
 the accents of normal blows or 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.360
 very weak shots that are called 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.380
 kids note and that's this palette of 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.420
 nuances in your game that will create 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.740
 for the first exercise out of the four 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.340
 first time we will hit with our 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.360
 left stick 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.560
 so that will give 1 2 3 4 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.060
 So we're going to play with the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:51.140
 metronome at 80 beats per minute 3 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:51.140
 and 4 and 1 2 3 4 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 1 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.900
 this is the end of the exercises 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.610
 now we will start having fun 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.530
 little with rhythms and queues 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.620
 of applications so we will start with 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.630
 a beginners rhythm so this rhythm he 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.280
 is based on the chacha so big 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.110
 crate on time one and three crates 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.970
 clear on your 2 and 4 and hi-hat on 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:40.569
 the times and the and each time so that 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:42.760
 give a little 3 and so we'll start from 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.500
 this base but we will add ghost 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.120
 offbeat rating so nice kids 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.100
 and notes played very low it's 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.840
 notes for which we will start 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.760
 it really hits a few 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.739
 centimeters of the snare so these 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.650
 kids note we'll put one so if 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.440
 we count on the American one i and to 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.650
 the end like that we'll put one in 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.130
 very early on the i of 1 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:11.019
 then on the 1 of 2 and the i of 3 so 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:17.190
 that's what it is - that n 2 everything is there two 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.190
 fruit l2 for in 2 yes 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.409
 what
