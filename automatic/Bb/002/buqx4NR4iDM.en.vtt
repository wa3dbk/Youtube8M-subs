00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
that and going forward the horses then

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.910 
that and going forward the horses then
see<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.640> fence<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.570> runs<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
see the fence and just runs at it and

little bit what we're going to do now is
we're<00:01:13.080> going<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> use<00:01:13.380> some<00:01:13.590> poles<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
we're going to use some poles on the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.820 
we're going to use some poles on the
floor<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> reason<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.180> jump<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.750> site<00:01:16.080> but

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
floor and the reason to jump in site but

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.320 
floor and the reason to jump in site but
we're<00:01:16.920> gonna<00:01:17.040> introduce<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.670> poles<00:01:17.909> into<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
we're gonna introduce the poles into the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330 
we're gonna introduce the poles into the
canter<00:01:18.689> we're<00:01:18.869> gonna<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:20.130> going

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
canter we're gonna get that just going

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.700 
canter we're gonna get that just going
down<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.759> popping<00:01:21.060> over<00:01:21.240> every<00:01:21.720> single<00:01:21.930> pole

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
down and popping over every single pole

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.620 
down and popping over every single pole
we're<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> use<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> jump<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.479> this

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
we're not going to use a jump at this

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.719 
we're not going to use a jump at this
stage<00:01:24.900> once<00:01:25.799> that's<00:01:26.070> happening<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
stage once that's happening and the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.550 
stage once that's happening and the
horse<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:26.970> relaxed<00:01:27.479> over<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> poles<00:01:27.930> we're

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
horse is relaxed over the poles we're

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.280 
horse is relaxed over the poles we're
then<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> add<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.549> jump<00:01:29.840> now<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> poles

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
then going to add a jump now the poles

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.830 
then going to add a jump now the poles
are<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.890> educate<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.840> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
are then going to educate the the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.690 
are then going to educate the the
levelness<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.770> fence<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
levelness to the fence and the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.840 
levelness to the fence and the
regularity<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.900> stride<00:01:37.229> pattern<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
regularity and the stride pattern as the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.359 
regularity and the stride pattern as the
hall<00:01:39.030> starts<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.600> join<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.470> together<00:01:40.710> with

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
hall starts to join that together with

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.760 
hall starts to join that together with
the<00:01:41.549> jump<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> end<00:01:42.229> we're<00:01:43.229> then<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.680> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the jump at the end we're then going to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.520 
the jump at the end we're then going to
withdraw<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.729> poles<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.479> then<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.259> hopefully

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
withdraw the poles so then we hopefully

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.090 
withdraw the poles so then we hopefully
end<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> situation<00:01:47.520> where<00:01:48.210> those<00:01:48.360> is
