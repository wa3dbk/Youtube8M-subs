00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.869 

see<00:04:10.169> I<00:04:10.199> could<00:04:10.409> there's<00:04:10.949> actually<00:04:11.430> built-in

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
see I could there's actually built-in

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.699 
see I could there's actually built-in
effects<00:04:12.239> but<00:04:12.509> I<00:04:12.540> could<00:04:12.750> turn<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:13.169> off<00:04:13.379> and

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
effects but I could turn that off and

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.640 
effects but I could turn that off and
mute<00:04:14.189> it<00:04:14.220> out<00:04:14.489> but<00:04:15.209> it's<00:04:15.359> still<00:04:15.479> sending<00:04:16.320> that

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
mute it out but it's still sending that

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.670 
mute it out but it's still sending that
signal<00:04:17.299> here<00:04:18.299> it's<00:04:18.539> still<00:04:18.720> sending<00:04:19.109> it<00:04:19.289> to<00:04:19.470> the

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
signal here it's still sending it to the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.330 
signal here it's still sending it to the
FX<00:04:20.039> end<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:21.000> this<00:04:21.599> will<00:04:22.349> actually<00:04:22.740> pick<00:04:22.950> up<00:04:23.130> my
