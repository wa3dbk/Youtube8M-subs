the<00:03:33.040> system<00:03:33.370> will<00:03:33.640> reboot<00:03:33.820> now<00:03:34.000> in<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.420> few

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
the system will reboot now in a few

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.030 
the system will reboot now in a few
seconds<00:03:35.020> it<00:03:35.140> will<00:03:35.230> start<00:03:35.530> with<00:03:35.740> your<00:03:35.860> new

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
seconds it will start with your new

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.680 
seconds it will start with your new
configuration<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.270> it's<00:03:37.390> going<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.540> do<00:03:37.660> a

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
configuration so it's going to do a

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.690 
configuration so it's going to do a
reboot<00:03:37.900> with<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.290> new<00:03:38.410> software<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.070> I'll

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
reboot with the new software and I'll

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.280 
reboot with the new software and I'll
see<00:03:39.850> if<00:03:39.880> I<00:03:40.030> can<00:03:40.180> film<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.720> splash<00:03:40.990> screen

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
see if I can film that and splash screen

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.470 
see if I can film that and splash screen
when<00:03:41.860> it<00:03:41.890> decides<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.580> display<00:03:42.910> that<00:03:43.090> and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
when it decides to display that and

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.510 
when it decides to display that and
there<00:03:43.870> we<00:03:43.990> go<00:03:44.200> I<00:03:44.580> guess<00:03:45.580> that's<00:03:45.760> pretty<00:03:45.970> cool

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
there we go I guess that's pretty cool

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.700 
there we go I guess that's pretty cool
and<00:03:48.520> then<00:03:48.670> back<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.090> our<00:03:49.210> except<00:03:49.600> it<00:03:50.560> looks

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
and then back to our except it looks

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.200 
and then back to our except it looks
like<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:51.040> did<00:03:51.190> keep<00:03:51.400> my<00:03:51.580> settings<00:03:52.000> in<00:03:52.180> here

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
like it did keep my settings in here

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.380 
like it did keep my settings in here
same<00:03:53.140> version<00:03:53.530> 4<00:03:53.770> -<00:03:53.980> 1<00:03:54.190> -<00:03:54.430> double<00:03:54.760> oh<00:03:54.880> except

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
same version 4 - 1 - double oh except

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.790 
same version 4 - 1 - double oh except
this<00:03:55.540> which<00:03:55.720> should<00:03:55.900> have<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.170> night<00:03:56.410> vision

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
this which should have the night vision

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.550 
this which should have the night vision
mode<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.660> don't<00:03:58.660> quite<00:03:58.870> know<00:03:59.050> how<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.380> works

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
mode I don't quite know how that works

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.510 
mode I don't quite know how that works
maybe<00:03:59.920> that<00:04:00.220> is<00:04:00.400> a<00:04:01.680> setting<00:04:02.680> or<00:04:02.890> only<00:04:03.280> I<00:04:03.370> think

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
maybe that is a setting or only I think

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.010 
maybe that is a setting or only I think
I<00:04:03.730> read<00:04:03.940> it<00:04:04.030> only<00:04:04.120> works<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.630> one<00:04:04.810> of<00:04:04.930> the

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
I read it only works and one of the

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.500 
I read it only works and one of the
colors<00:04:05.350> maybe<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:06.820> should<00:04:07.060> know<00:04:07.210> when<00:04:07.420> the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
colors maybe it should know when the

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.900 
colors maybe it should know when the
lights<00:04:07.690> come<00:04:07.900> on<00:04:08.050> I<00:04:08.440> don't<00:04:08.680> know<00:04:08.770> I<00:04:08.980> will<00:04:09.730> play

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
lights come on I don't know I will play

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.520 
lights come on I don't know I will play
with<00:04:09.940> this<00:04:10.270> but<00:04:10.510> that<00:04:10.660> is<00:04:10.690> how<00:04:11.020> you<00:04:11.080> upgrade

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
with this but that is how you upgrade

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.080 
with this but that is how you upgrade
your<00:04:11.560> navigation<00:04:12.190> software<00:04:12.370> obviously<00:04:12.970> be

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
your navigation software obviously be

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.510 
your navigation software obviously be
very<00:04:13.300> careful<00:04:13.690> doing<00:04:13.840> this<00:04:13.960> don't<00:04:14.710> disobey

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
very careful doing this don't disobey

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.700 
very careful doing this don't disobey
instructions<00:04:16.450> because<00:04:16.870> if<00:04:17.020> that<00:04:17.170> screws<00:04:17.560> up

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:17.710 
instructions because if that screws up

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.039 
instructions because if that screws up
you<00:04:18.640> could<00:04:18.880> get<00:04:19.120> your<00:04:19.270> whole<00:04:19.419> car<00:04:19.660> screwed<00:04:19.930> up

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
you could get your whole car screwed up

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.479 
you could get your whole car screwed up
I<00:04:20.140> also<00:04:20.290> highly<00:04:20.650> recommend<00:04:20.710> doing<00:04:21.220> this<00:04:21.310> when

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
I also highly recommend doing this when

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.580 
I also highly recommend doing this when
your<00:04:21.609> battery<00:04:21.940> has<00:04:22.030> a<00:04:22.150> sufficient<00:04:22.660> charge

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
your battery has a sufficient charge

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.780 
your battery has a sufficient charge
if<00:04:23.650> it's<00:04:23.830> been<00:04:23.950> sitting<00:04:24.190> in<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.340> garage<00:04:24.370> for

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
if it's been sitting in the garage for

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.070 
if it's been sitting in the garage for
two<00:04:24.910> months<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:25.210> open<00:04:25.540> it<00:04:25.630> up<00:04:25.720> you<00:04:25.840> start

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
two months you open it up you start

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.810 
two months you open it up you start
messing<00:04:26.260> with<00:04:26.440> stuff<00:04:26.650> computers<00:04:27.310> lights<00:04:27.580> on

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
messing with stuff computers lights on

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.940 
messing with stuff computers lights on
that<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.450> probably<00:04:28.870> just<00:04:29.050> not<00:04:29.230> a<00:04:29.290> good<00:04:29.410> idea

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
that is probably just not a good idea

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.490 
that is probably just not a good idea
