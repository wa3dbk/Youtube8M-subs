00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.179
 good afternoon today end of April 2015 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:14.429
 years upon request 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:17.130
 pigeons from near abroad to 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.600
 somehow appearance information 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.880
 my next edition favor I chose 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.000
 option to make 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:32.510
 a short movie like this 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.860
 informational and posting it in youtube 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.940
 third edition has appeared 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.930
 from the series of creative beekeeping 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.719
 called extreme wintering book 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.100
 also staffed 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:52.460
 video chronicle of important moments 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.460
 of this book 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.850
 but about what I would like in addition 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.760
 say take this opportunity since 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.650
 appeared speculation information 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:13.530
 my research and practical 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.320
 observations i am now footage of these 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.400
 three editions 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.880
 I put in u-tube for a general review and 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.799
 more and more wide 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:33.890
 information familiarization using 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.329
 I also want to focus on 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.740
 my latest developments and 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.740
 further experiments research 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.740
 more 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.420
 perceive more perception 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.720
 gets and got from technology 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:02:00.729
 queen isolation topic 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:04.040
 wintering opportunities for several queens 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.380
 Originally originally tried 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.160
 wide format insulator options 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.020
 mary with partition inside 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.489
 winter 2 uterus in one monolithic 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:20.720
 an insulator but recent my research 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:22.370
 given the opportunity to apply so 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:29.590
 called insulator modules 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:32.350
 that is, the insulator is as compact as possible 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.810
 for one uterus 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.810
 it can also be applied matrix 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.260
 formed along the middle wall here 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.040
 the uterus and it moves naturally upwards 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.680
 and posterior wall to this insulator to this 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.640
 main uterus can join 2 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.430
 uterus pre- find which 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.709
 was another family 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.900
 isolated and some time in and that 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.329
 same family night people daur on then 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.600
 rapport connects then there are options 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:11.299
 several of these insulator modules are all 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:17.269
 further their research practically 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:20.870
 and and experiments i will lay out in 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:25.569
 youtube to beekeepers practice 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.810
 might have the opportunity 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:33.170
 positive results obtained 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.440
 apply in their practice on their 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.620
 apiaries 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:45.400
 cottage after this video will be 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:52.250
 All three video versions of mine are presented . 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:56.959
 books for general use and 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.390
 familiarization all good luck 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.790
 view and successfully apply on 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.790
 their apiaries 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.790
 meetings
