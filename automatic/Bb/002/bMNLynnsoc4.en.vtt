this high seven heart megahertz on this
device<00:05:16.750> right<00:05:17.750> now<00:05:17.870> we<00:05:17.930> think<00:05:18.080> it's<00:05:18.350> about<00:05:18.800> 500

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
device right now we think it's about 500

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.409 
device right now we think it's about 500
38<00:05:20.000> megahertz<00:05:20.210> I<00:05:20.660> believe<00:05:20.930> it<00:05:21.830> has<00:05:22.550> about<00:05:22.760> 256

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
38 megahertz I believe it has about 256

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:24.909 
38 megahertz I believe it has about 256
megabytes<00:05:23.600> of<00:05:23.960> RAM<00:05:24.139> so<00:05:24.380> it's<00:05:24.500> but<00:05:24.620> roughly

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
megabytes of RAM so it's but roughly

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:33.430 
megabytes of RAM so it's but roughly
half<00:05:25.280> what<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:27.070> evo<00:05:28.070> has<00:05:28.340> ah<00:05:30.130> that's<00:05:31.130> about<00:05:31.400> it
