welcome to micro be version 3 step L

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.169 
welcome to micro be version 3 step L
adjusting<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.270> cyclic<00:00:06.690> swashplate<00:00:07.020> limit

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.250 

we're<00:00:12.179> gonna<00:00:12.269> step<00:00:12.660> into<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:14.059> step<00:00:15.059> L<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
we're gonna step into the step L the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:25.950 
we're gonna step into the step L the
setup<00:00:16.590> menu

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.490 

I<00:00:26.050> like<00:00:26.710> to<00:00:26.830> use<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.449> voltmeter<00:00:28.449> in<00:00:28.929> conjunction

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
I like to use a voltmeter in conjunction

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:38.240 
I like to use a voltmeter in conjunction
with<00:00:30.269> listening<00:00:31.269> to<00:00:31.329> the<00:00:31.570> servos<00:00:32.020> buzz<00:00:36.960> but

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
with listening to the servos buzz but

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.040 
with listening to the servos buzz but
you<00:00:39.250> can<00:00:39.460> do<00:00:39.579> it<00:00:39.699> without<00:00:39.820> a<00:00:40.000> voltmeter<00:00:40.360> you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
you can do it without a voltmeter you

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.840 
you can do it without a voltmeter you
just<00:00:41.260> got<00:00:41.440> to<00:00:41.530> listen<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.860> those<00:00:42.070> servos<00:00:42.579> so<00:00:42.820> I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
just got to listen to those servos so I

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.110 
just got to listen to those servos so I
recorded<00:00:43.300> that<00:00:43.510> noise<00:00:43.900> too<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:48.430> goal<00:00:48.670> of<00:00:48.699> this

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
recorded that noise too the goal of this

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.680 
recorded that noise too the goal of this
step<00:00:49.479> is<00:00:49.750> to<00:00:49.809> get<00:00:50.229> as<00:00:50.559> much<00:00:51.000> swashplate<00:00:52.000> throw

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
step is to get as much swashplate throw

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.780 
step is to get as much swashplate throw
as<00:00:52.930> possible<00:00:54.180> without<00:00:55.180> binding<00:00:56.519> you<00:00:57.519> got<00:00:57.699> to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
as possible without binding you got to

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.819 
as possible without binding you got to
check<00:00:58.030> it<00:00:58.269> in<00:00:58.539> a<00:00:59.670> high-low<00:01:00.670> in<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.449> middle<00:01:01.829> get

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
check it in a high-low in the middle get

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.930 
check it in a high-low in the middle get
as<00:01:02.949> much<00:01:03.160> as<00:01:03.340> you<00:01:03.489> can<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.830> then<00:01:06.490> look<00:01:06.700> at<00:01:06.789> your

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
as much as you can and then look at your

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.460 
as much as you can and then look at your
status<00:01:07.450> light<00:01:09.119> if<00:01:10.119> your<00:01:10.450> status<00:01:10.750> light<00:01:11.140> didn't

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
status light if your status light didn't

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.710 
status light if your status light didn't
come<00:01:11.679> on<00:01:11.979> or<00:01:12.160> if<00:01:12.399> it's<00:01:12.550> purple<00:01:13.060> you're<00:01:13.570> gonna

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
come on or if it's purple you're gonna

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.290 
come on or if it's purple you're gonna
have<00:01:14.110> to<00:01:14.440> decrease<00:01:15.429> the<00:01:15.729> length<00:01:15.970> of<00:01:16.149> your

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
have to decrease the length of your

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.560 
have to decrease the length of your
servo<00:01:16.660> arm<00:01:16.960> or<00:01:17.789> increase<00:01:18.789> the<00:01:18.970> length<00:01:19.179> of<00:01:19.450> the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
servo arm or increase the length of the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:28.940 
servo arm or increase the length of the
outer<00:01:19.810> swashplate<00:01:20.440> balls<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:27.250> you<00:01:27.940> do<00:01:28.300> that

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
outer swashplate balls if you do that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.179 
outer swashplate balls if you do that
then<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.130> have<00:01:30.159> to<00:01:30.549> go<00:01:30.700> back<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:33.579> steps<00:01:34.090> G

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
then you have to go back and do steps G

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:45.389 
then you have to go back and do steps G
J<00:01:36.189> and<00:01:36.520> K<00:01:37.350> again<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:41.380> if<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:41.829> get<00:01:42.159> a<00:01:44.399> blue

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
J and K again but if you get a blue

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.899 
J and K again but if you get a blue
light<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:45.670> course<00:01:46.030> you're<00:01:46.299> good<00:01:46.570> I<00:01:47.520> was<00:01:48.520> on<00:01:48.700> the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
light of course you're good I was on the

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.249 
light of course you're good I was on the
I<00:01:48.939> was<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.390> red<00:01:49.659> on<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.439> verge<00:01:50.710> of<00:01:50.920> going<00:01:51.280> blue

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
I was of red on the verge of going blue

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.850 
I was of red on the verge of going blue
so<00:01:53.259> that<00:01:53.290> was<00:01:53.619> good

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
so that was good

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.620 
so that was good
micro<00:01:56.860> beast<00:01:57.070> talks<00:01:57.340> about<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.909> control<00:01:58.390> loop

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
micro beast talks about the control loop

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.370 
micro beast talks about the control loop
all<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:58.930> time<00:01:59.259> in<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.530> manual<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:01.630> since

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
all the time in the manual and the since

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.950 
all the time in the manual and the since
the<00:02:02.530> micro<00:02:02.920> beast<00:02:03.130> controls<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.420> servos

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
the micro beast controls the servos

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.539 
the micro beast controls the servos
including<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.070> travel<00:02:08.160> when<00:02:09.160> they<00:02:09.310> talk

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
including the travel when they talk

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.460 
including the travel when they talk
about<00:02:09.579> the<00:02:09.940> control<00:02:10.359> loop<00:02:10.570> they're<00:02:11.049> talking

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
about the control loop they're talking

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.690 
about the control loop they're talking
about<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.950> resolution<00:02:12.989> it'd<00:02:13.989> be<00:02:14.230> like<00:02:14.440> if<00:02:15.070> you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
about the resolution it'd be like if you

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.599 
about the resolution it'd be like if you
were<00:02:16.660> setting<00:02:17.019> up<00:02:17.079> a<00:02:17.200> regular<00:02:17.560> helicopter<00:02:17.769> and

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:18.609 
were setting up a regular helicopter and

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.849 
were setting up a regular helicopter and
you<00:02:19.540> had<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.959> cut<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.440> servo<00:02:20.980> throw<00:02:21.370> way<00:02:21.760> down

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
you had to cut the servo throw way down

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.750 
you had to cut the servo throw way down
there<00:02:23.859> just<00:02:24.040> wouldn't<00:02:24.250> be<00:02:24.519> much<00:02:24.700> of

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
there just wouldn't be much of

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.970 
there just wouldn't be much of
resolution<00:02:25.510> there<00:02:25.750> for<00:02:26.049> your<00:02:26.170> transmitter<00:02:26.799> to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
resolution there for your transmitter to

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.640 
resolution there for your transmitter to
work<00:02:27.160> with<00:02:27.430> same<00:02:28.060> way<00:02:28.239> with<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.570> control<00:02:29.019> loop

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
work with same way with the control loop

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.189 
work with same way with the control loop
I<00:02:30.989> had<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.410> lengthen<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.220> slot<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:34.060> my<00:02:34.329> in<00:02:35.139> a

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:35.199 
I had to lengthen the slot in my in a

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:37.620 
I had to lengthen the slot in my in a
rotation<00:02:35.980> bracket<00:02:36.459> by<00:02:36.820> about<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.090> quarter<00:02:37.570> of

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
rotation bracket by about a quarter of

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.030 
rotation bracket by about a quarter of
an<00:02:37.750> ant

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
an ant

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.250 
an ant
because<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.189> fold<00:02:40.489> down<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:41.120> alignment<00:02:42.019> pin

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
because it fold down the alignment pin

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.880 
because it fold down the alignment pin
was<00:02:42.650> hitting<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.099> bottom<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.610> slot<00:02:43.909> so<00:02:44.890> I

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
was hitting the bottom of the slot so I

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.429 
was hitting the bottom of the slot so I
took<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.159> off<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.700> got<00:02:46.879> a<00:02:46.909> dremel<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:48.079> very

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
took it off I got a dremel and very

00:02:48.439 --> 00:03:00.360 
took it off I got a dremel and very
carefully<00:02:49.720> lengthened<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.900> slot

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.340 

the<00:03:00.880> other<00:03:01.000> option<00:03:01.480> would<00:03:01.630> have<00:03:01.690> been<00:03:01.810> raising

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
the other option would have been raising

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.559 
the other option would have been raising
the<00:03:02.740> swashplate

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
the swashplate

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.000 
the swashplate
by<00:03:04.569> making<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:07.540> rods<00:03:07.810> going<00:03:08.260> from<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.590> servo

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
by making the rods going from the servo

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.570 
by making the rods going from the servo
to<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.370> balls<00:03:09.580> longer<00:03:10.270> I<00:03:11.190> didn't<00:03:12.190> want<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.459> do

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
to the balls longer I didn't want to do

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.380 
to the balls longer I didn't want to do
that<00:03:12.610> because<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:14.520> follower<00:03:15.520> arms<00:03:16.090> were

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
that because the follower arms were

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.020 
that because the follower arms were
perfectly<00:03:17.020> level<00:03:17.410> at<00:03:17.530> zero<00:03:17.770> pitch<00:03:18.100> so<00:03:19.000> I

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
perfectly level at zero pitch so I

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.110 
perfectly level at zero pitch so I
wanted<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.450> keep<00:03:19.660> him<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:19.870> way<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:21.670> thought

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
wanted to keep him that way so I thought

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.180 
wanted to keep him that way so I thought
the<00:03:22.270> easiest<00:03:22.690> way<00:03:22.930> was<00:03:23.080> lengthen<00:03:23.709> that<00:03:23.830> slot

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
the easiest way was lengthen that slot

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.309 
the easiest way was lengthen that slot
and<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.459> worked<00:03:24.670> out<00:03:24.819> good<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.780> this<00:03:29.020> turned

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
and that worked out good so this turned

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.520 
and that worked out good so this turned
out<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.680> be<00:03:29.830> a<00:03:29.860> pretty<00:03:30.250> long<00:03:30.340> process<00:03:34.530> checked

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
out to be a pretty long process checked

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.340 
out to be a pretty long process checked
it<00:03:35.680> high<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.340> low<00:03:36.580> and<00:03:37.030> all<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.330> corners<00:03:37.870> and

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
it high and low and all the corners and

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.030 
it high and low and all the corners and
I<00:03:39.420> just<00:03:40.420> kept<00:03:40.660> getting<00:03:40.840> this<00:03:41.080> little<00:03:41.739> bit<00:03:41.890> of

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
I just kept getting this little bit of

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.580 
I just kept getting this little bit of
binding<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:42.700> in<00:03:43.180> some<00:03:43.480> corners<00:03:43.930> or<00:03:44.050> another<00:03:44.320> I

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
binding and in some corners or another I

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.440 
binding and in some corners or another I
had<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.730> start<00:03:46.030> over<00:03:46.239> a<00:03:46.420> couple<00:03:46.690> of<00:03:46.810> times<00:03:48.450> and

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
had to start over a couple of times and

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.690 
had to start over a couple of times and
I<00:03:49.540> wanted<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:49.900> get<00:03:50.080> at<00:03:50.500> least<00:03:50.560> ten<00:03:51.010> degrees

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
I wanted to get at least ten degrees

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.890 
I wanted to get at least ten degrees
so<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:54.360> kept<00:03:55.360> fiddling<00:03:55.750> with<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:55.989> and<00:03:56.430> finally

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
so I kept fiddling with it and finally

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.449 
so I kept fiddling with it and finally
it<00:03:58.900> come<00:03:59.200> in<00:03:59.380> I<00:03:59.530> got<00:03:59.709> ten<00:03:59.980> degrees<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:03.220> took

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
it come in I got ten degrees it took

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.380 
it come in I got ten degrees it took
some<00:04:03.670> messing<00:04:04.120> with

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
some messing with

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.150 
some messing with
I've<00:04:04.780> still<00:04:05.049> got<00:04:05.110> binding<00:04:05.739> in<00:04:05.829> there<00:04:05.950> in<00:04:06.040> that

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
I've still got binding in there in that

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.650 
I've still got binding in there in that
corner<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:09.670> I'm<00:04:09.790> using<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.390> an<00:04:11.200> old<00:04:12.660> almost

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
corner and I'm using a an old almost

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.380 
corner and I'm using a an old almost
dead<00:04:14.049> battery<00:04:16.079> because<00:04:17.079> I<00:04:17.200> didn't<00:04:17.530> want<00:04:17.739> to

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
dead battery because I didn't want to

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.730 
dead battery because I didn't want to
use<00:04:19.390> my<00:04:20.519> life's<00:04:21.519> battery<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.410> don't<00:04:23.410> know

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
use my life's battery I don't know

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.320 
use my life's battery I don't know
cuz<00:04:24.039> I<00:04:24.160> know<00:04:24.220> I'm<00:04:24.460> gonna<00:04:24.580> be<00:04:24.760> stolen<00:04:25.210> the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
cuz I know I'm gonna be stolen the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.659 
cuz I know I'm gonna be stolen the
servos<00:04:25.750> I<00:04:26.020> didn't<00:04:26.350> want<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.650> stress<00:04:27.130> them<00:04:27.400> to

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
servos I didn't want to stress them to

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.180 
servos I didn't want to stress them to
God

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:44.140 

like<00:04:34.190> I<00:04:34.310> finally<00:04:34.669> got<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.240> here

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.680 

ended<00:04:44.870> up<00:04:45.020> with<00:04:45.290> just<00:04:46.750> over<00:04:47.750> 10<00:04:47.990> degrees<00:04:49.690> which

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
ended up with just over 10 degrees which

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.040 
ended up with just over 10 degrees which
is<00:04:50.900> good<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.880> I<00:04:53.000> was<00:04:53.150> glad<00:04:53.360> this<00:04:53.570> step<00:04:53.870> was

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
is good and I was glad this step was

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.219 
is good and I was glad this step was
over<00:04:54.350> and<00:04:54.470> I<00:04:54.560> wasn't<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.949> only<00:04:55.010> one

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
over and I wasn't the only one

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.659 
over and I wasn't the only one
my<00:04:57.229> little<00:04:57.380> voltmeter<00:04:57.919> thought<00:04:58.220> it<00:04:58.340> was<00:04:58.460> time

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
my little voltmeter thought it was time

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.710 
my little voltmeter thought it was time
to<00:04:58.729> quit<00:04:59.120> -<00:04:59.389> I<00:05:01.030> swear<00:05:02.030> I<00:05:02.090> didn't<00:05:02.510> touch<00:05:02.660> that

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
to quit - I swear I didn't touch that

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.810 
to quit - I swear I didn't touch that
thing<00:05:03.110> it<00:05:03.320> just<00:05:03.500> fell<00:05:03.740> off<00:05:03.919> on<00:05:04.160> its<00:05:04.340> own

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
thing it just fell off on its own

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.050 
thing it just fell off on its own
that<00:05:05.660> was<00:05:05.840> funny<00:05:06.190> but<00:05:07.190> go<00:05:07.340> ahead<00:05:07.430> step<00:05:07.820> out<00:05:08.030> of

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
that was funny but go ahead step out of

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:15.840 
that was funny but go ahead step out of
