00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.530
 hello everyone here fologo gamer 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.980
 and as you can see with this 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.150
 skin 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.789
 today we find ourselves for my 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.759
 second fashion presentation and I 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.880
 decided to present the fashion Aimers 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:28.300
 which means hammer in English that 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:32.439
 just released for 1.7.2 and that was 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.850
 created by grimm 3212 or grimm 32-12 I 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.980
 do not know how to say the name 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.700
 will be displayed on the screen anyway so 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.530
 this mode adds hammers in the game 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.660
 that actually allow to break all 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.090
 the blocks of the game almost as 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.590
 quickly that creative auction 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.320
 so it's very useful for the 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.770
 terraforming or to get down to life in 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.780
 the mines 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.970
 it's a bit expensive but it's very 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.630
 helpful and then I'll all of you them 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:02.680
 present one by one and it's gone 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:06.969
 so to make each each hammer 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.360
 you need this little object here 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:12.130
 which is called the body item so for the 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.120
 do you do it you will have to do 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.010
 2 gold and a diamond so you can 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.170
 also trade put them to the 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.619
 place of gold and their instead of iron 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.270
 it's not there are two different clubs and 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.010
 once you have that you 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.710
 will use it to make each 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.290
 hammer first hammer the hammer into 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.250
 wood then you have to know that we 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:40.060
 can make a wooden one by singing 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.479
 gold stone made of iron and diamonds and 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.540
 more 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.820
 finally here it is in the order of the most 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.409
 sustainable at least sustainable the wood he stands 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.900
 breaks very quickly while the diamond there 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.820
 breaks after a lot of use 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.490
 so then the crabs are there so at 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.130
 every time actually you make him 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.240
 also added you explain that I 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.520
 does a little machine to put 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:09.399
 automatically the day to not see 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:12.099
 so go back a brief I go astray I 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.560
 go astray so you do each time 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.690
 the same pattern but for each material 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.070
 different 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.710
 every time a market like this so 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.130
 I all the kraft will be in 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.450
 the article but I show them here 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.970
 unfortunately we can not be delighted 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.930
 the hammers I tried we can not 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.620
 but maybe in the future 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.560
 versions the author will then add them the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.580
 problem with that is why I said 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.190
 that it was good for the potting soil 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.840
 to pretend is that when we break 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.540
 blocks in fact so I do not expect in 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.620
 creative because otherwise it changes nothing 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.540
 but when we cash in blocks we want 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.430
 not recover them so it's really 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.650
 to dig to larach to make 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.060
 terraforming but it's not too much for 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.550
 perhaps it is to prepare a 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.290
 mine but the valley of the blogs I 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:04.010
 get back up quickly so it's a 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.060
 little slower to break up minerals 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.190
 so you see a little bit more 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.650
 long but we do not get them back so that's 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.570
 really these military then just 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.890
 after that comes from a village but not seen 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:20.280
 duke pretty much okay so here I am going to 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:24.500
 re- crest 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:29.459
 we stuffed it does not produce holes 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.170
 here and so here's the presentation 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.730
 is over it was a little fashion all 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.840
 simple but very useful for 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.330
 survival adventures one has to make the 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.220
 terraforming so we end up all 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.560
 immediately on my desk for how 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.750
 install this mode so we find ourselves 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.110
 on my desk for how to install this 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.300
 fashion 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.190
 then you will need three files all 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.060
 the links will be in the arctic and he 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.000
 you will need the file grimm 32 12 body 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.060
 you will need the fashion hammers file 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.070
 1.7.2 and will of course forge in 1.7.2 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.330
 so to install loudly I can have 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.390
 launched at least once 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:08.160
 minecraft in 1.7.2 so if it's not 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.560
 already done you start your game so the 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.169
 time it starts there and then you 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:18.359
 do better profile any 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:22.380
 I already have you finally make new 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.789
 profile and you put 1.7.2 and you 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.320
 start the game so I already know 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.340
 so I do it again 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.830
 and once I'm going to run you 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.260
 can do it but then you run 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.120
 the forging installer you 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.190
 downloaded so I have a small window 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.480
 will open 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.280
 from there you can insert either the 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.220
 client version is the server version 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.920
 so multiplayer or solo month mode and 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.510
 finally I use the word in this so what 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.760
 tutorial is to install it solo 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.080
 and you do ok so I do not want the 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.000
 do not do it either because I already did 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.260
 but when you hit ok there is 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.810
 will have a small window that will open in 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.180
 saying everything has been installed and you 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.460
 can the farm and then you do 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.950
 after yes the windows key of your 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.490
 keyboard with air keys at the same time and 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:10.050
 you write like those 6% abdat to% is 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:12.270
 ok then you look for your point 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.410
 minecraft and you go to the folder 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:20.430
 fashion and you just have to slip 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.890
 Fashion hammers and body grim like this 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.450
 here 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.450
 then you go back to your game 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:33.060
 you can if you already have a profile 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.350
 with forge you can use it if 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.540
 you do not have any new ones 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:42.120
 profile you call him when you want 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:44.370
 i will call it down 1 fashion dais and 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.910
 you put use the version of frau 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.880
 1.7.2 barley and it should be complete 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.610
 by 1024 and you make save prove 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.580
 profile and the eye you press play 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.020
 everything works well and you can play 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.910

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.450

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.450
