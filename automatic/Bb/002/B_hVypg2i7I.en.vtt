00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
four is to three aspect ratio which is

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.319 
four is to three aspect ratio which is
not<00:01:46.409> wide<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.700> know<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.970> always<00:01:48.390> prefer<00:01:49.159> the

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
not wide so you know I always prefer the

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.660 
not wide so you know I always prefer the
wider<00:01:51.329> ones<00:01:51.689> as<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.500> gives<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.640> know

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
wider ones as it just gives you you know

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.450 
wider ones as it just gives you you know
you<00:01:54.119> know<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.240> wide<00:01:54.659> lens<00:01:54.899> effect<00:01:55.399> anyway<00:01:56.399> so

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you know that wide lens effect anyway so

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.950 
you know that wide lens effect anyway so
you<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.210> all<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.479> these<00:01:57.600> settings

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
you know you have all of these settings

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.330 
you know you have all of these settings
and<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.259> keep<00:01:58.409> changing<00:01:58.799> them<00:01:58.950> depending

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
and you can keep changing them depending

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.679 
and you can keep changing them depending
upon<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.700> lighting<00:02:00.000> environment<00:02:00.570> the

you<00:02:41.190> know<00:02:41.280> basically<00:02:41.640> what<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.120> does<00:02:42.270> is<00:02:42.480> it

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
you know basically what it does is it

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.840 
you know basically what it does is it
takes<00:02:42.840> twice<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.770> number<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.070> frames<00:02:44.340> every

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
takes twice the number of frames every

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.330 
takes twice the number of frames every

second the video is being recorded

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.370 
second the video is being recorded
obviously<00:02:48.120> there<00:02:48.270> are<00:02:48.300> options<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.840> lower

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
obviously there are options to lower

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.260 
obviously there are options to lower
down<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.740> resolution<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.820> they<00:02:51.030> can<00:02:51.180> be

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
down the resolution so that they can be

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.820 
down the resolution so that they can be
emailed<00:02:51.630> over<00:02:51.750> or<00:02:52.080> they<00:02:52.200> could<00:02:52.350> be<00:02:52.380> sent<00:02:52.620> over

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830

while what's really disappointing is

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.710 
while what's really disappointing is
that<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.070> g2<00:02:59.310> does<00:02:59.520> not<00:02:59.700> provide<00:03:00.030> any<00:03:00.270> color

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
from the portion where you zoom into so

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.620 
from the portion where you zoom into so
it<00:03:31.800> just<00:03:32.010> picks<00:03:32.190> up<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.940> know<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.209> basically

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
it just picks up you know it basically

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.140

activates the mic which is facing in

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.880 
activates the mic which is facing in
that<00:03:36.180> direction<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:36.959> kind<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.530> picks<00:03:37.739> up

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
that direction and kind of picks up

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.250 
that direction and kind of picks up
audio<00:03:38.250> only<00:03:38.519> from<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.120> portion<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:40.230> can

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
audio only from that portion you can

flash<00:03:45.540> on<00:03:45.750> or<00:03:46.170> off<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:48.150> here's<00:03:48.360> a

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
flash on or off so here's a

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.509 
flash on or off so here's a
demonstration<00:03:48.630> of<00:03:49.230> touch<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.769> focus<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.400> as

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
fast to zoom out and salsette much like

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.570 
fast to zoom out and salsette much like
the<00:04:08.700> galaxy<00:04:09.090> s4<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.720> g2<00:04:10.080> can<00:04:10.350> have<00:04:10.680> both<00:04:11.040> both

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
and you can obviously change the shape

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.180 
and you can obviously change the shape
from<00:04:24.780> square<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.410> something<00:04:25.860> else

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.770 
you require so that's it guys about the
camera<00:04:37.740> of<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.160> LG<00:04:38.490> g2<00:04:38.850> I<00:04:39.030> personally<00:04:39.600> think

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
camera of the LG g2 I personally think

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.840 
camera of the LG g2 I personally think
this<00:04:39.960> is<00:04:40.140> better<00:04:40.350> than<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.560> Galaxy<00:04:40.980> s4<00:04:41.310> but<00:04:41.700> it

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
this is better than the Galaxy s4 but it

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.910 
this is better than the Galaxy s4 but it
does<00:04:42.030> lag<00:04:42.270> filters<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.080> effects<00:04:43.440> that<00:04:43.890> I

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
does lag filters and effects that I

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.070 
does lag filters and effects that I
really<00:04:44.220> like<00:04:44.400> in<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.640> s4<00:04:45.000> apart<00:04:45.780> from<00:04:45.930> that
