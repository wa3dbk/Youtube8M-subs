00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.839
 power opportunity increase 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.009
 public media performance 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:14.860
 also forming feedback with 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.070
 the public conversation took part 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.910
 first deputy chairman 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.020
 the government of Dagestan Anatoly 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.980
 Caribbean Acting Minister

 print and information mara sun hajiyev 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:28.109
 government performance 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.199
 medium last depends on 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.099
 its technical capabilities 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.649
 anticipating the conversation from the very 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.059
 efficacy and ramazan abdulatipov 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.110
 studied the chair equipment 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.440
 or main republican 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.790
 TV Tv decided to hold a meeting 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.250
 advanced information 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.020
 technology 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.680
 two types are not seen here but in general 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.850
 I was pleased that using 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.330
 available resources fisherman journalists 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.100
 give out competitive 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.569
 product 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:53.899
 already large studio roundtable chapter 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.349
 Dagestan noted that the main role of any 

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:58.139
 state but the media is to attach 

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:01.289
 population culture the very first task 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.099
 state media 

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:04.320
 information 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.500
 it is unacceptable in Dagestan for 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.810
 conservation 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.810
 three weeks of childhood left 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.300
 this is the main task 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.120
 to mean people they made fools 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.939
 so that people understand both societies 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.340
 will surprise 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.930
 how not to be what should we give 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.050
 to the state that he himself must do 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.370
 state families 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.370
 certainly under-funded 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.550
 this is the first 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.410
 second conclusion 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.100
 government media does not justify those 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.310
 money that is allocated 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.310
 are invested 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.460
 Now do it yourself coming out of these 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.670
 houses what actions 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.750
 i am with cis states which 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.450
 really actively working 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.800
 patriotic 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.630
 not deeply interested 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.050
 analyzes which process 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.390
 happens 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.570
 at the level 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.570
 philosophical songs of chao daeva 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:13.849
 does it understand when 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.920
 such people were called almost enemies 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.319
 fatherland which is actually painted 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.319
 what is this feeling going on 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.219
 so the issue of state media 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.599
 This is a very important question of the means. 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.139
 mass media 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.929
 the ministry 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.019
 meets and 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.699
 information 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.099
 it's just the same 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.099
 the forces that could contribute 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.490
 treatment society cleansing society 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.269
 television 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.709
 we should not have society 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.790
 anti-state media in work on 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.180
 promotion of state activities 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.659
 media authorities 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.230
 which is financed by the state 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.079
 Abdulatipova assigns a special role 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.799
 because they must create 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.930
 specific format of action for others 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.550
 mass media 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.930
 we still have a lot of goals literate 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.359
 of journalists 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.729
 have selflessly told reporters i 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:13.419
 journalist who have already given their lives 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.419
 for the right to tell the truth 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:21.199
 as law enforcement 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.749
 there are structures 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:24.329
 general history which is honest 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.329
 works and sacrifices his life 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.159
 so the society which is in 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.499
 transition state 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.599
 contains its structure very much 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.599
 and a quality future and 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.369
 substandard 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:44.779
 who pull society back 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:48.139
 medieval and so on and so forth 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.459
 minister help me too revenge 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.319
 journalistic community 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.229
 form state 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.240
 information policy 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.240
 and implement this policy 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.659
 and implement this policy 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.379
 vodka conversion 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.379
 which in the republic of dagestan europe 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.839
 very few analytical 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.329
 of materials 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.889
 or 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.389
 argue about the words spoken supposedly 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.389
 it is not so 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.699
 or even lovelace accepted 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.449
 in order to change the situation in 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.949
 Republic needs a breakthrough in public 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.039
 consciousness considers payment this year 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.719
 a breakthrough is possible only 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:35.330
 mass media participation 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.710
 Information Dagestan 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.430
 journalism needs to be directed to 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.400
 qualitatively 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.540
 new chickens today republican 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.660
 media are not well aware of the demands of society 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.699
 viewer reader needs 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:46.419
 analytical materials 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.039
 need to create political talk show 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.460
 animation studio to make films 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.669
 different languages ​​about traditions and life 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.580
 Dagestanis 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.400
 ok modern 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.699
 working media 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.020
 There will be nothing 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.850
 I know that there will be nothing to invest 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.389
 do not save money 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.569
 Here are the promising directions of Turkey 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:11.679
 on the contrary we must consider the ways 

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:14.679
 will be next year 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.349
 I hope there is also not well developed 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.729
 television 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.520
 Dagestan survived the meter and then the blog system 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.620
 rub 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.620
 Dagestan must have its own league site 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.840
 Internet in media publications of various kinds 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.340

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.900
 about how it is done 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.830
 the transfer to the figure reported to the director 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.070

 Said by speakers 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.800
 further development of analog 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.670
 television hopelessly 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.580
 and therefore there is a possibility 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.120
 termination of activities 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.410

 on digital broadcasting what's next with 

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:29.459
 I am still unclear with regional ones 

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:31.069
 what is necessary to take action 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:32.229
 preservation of regional 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:34.719
