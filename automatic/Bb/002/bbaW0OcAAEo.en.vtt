00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.820
 today, the new cvt can be driven 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.960
 in the subaru forester and around that too 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.660
 I am here on a test 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.600
 driven test track and right there will 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.609
 I'll go back ten 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.900
 Points stands for continuously variable 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.000
 transmission 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.070
 but so far could automatic cvt 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.410
 gear come convince the lay on 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.960
 so-called rubber band effect in its 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.640
 Follow the engine in the worst case 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.980
 hold and the car hesitant 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.200
 accelerates with the joint of 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.270
 schaeffler and subaru developed cvt 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.129
 gear lineartronic the third 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 generation should now be different 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.539
 the cvt gear does exactly what it does 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.950
 should and indeed traction 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.850
 uninterruptible pre-drive on 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.550
 all axes 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.030
 that means we do not notice when regulated 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.350
 becomes 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.750
 and right here in fast-driven 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.120
 curves I notice, however, that in the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.949
 At first the seats did not sit enough 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.369
 Offer 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:08.130
 the 106 tons suv is from a 177 kw 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.080
 strong gasoline powered in 75 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.080
 seconds are reached 100 mph 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.500
 the efficiency of the cvt transmission 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.210
 so far only with lower 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.940
 torques could be combined 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.830
 now finds more attention after 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.390
 schaeffler that shed limbs band 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.640
 against the newly developed link chain 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.009
 have exchanged are now torques 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.940
 up to 500 newton meters over the cvt 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.940
 gearbox adjustable 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.480
 and torque is mostly in the terrain 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.120
 asked here is our suv show that 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.280
 it's actually a cross-country skier 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.680
 new road stability program export 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.350
 provides up to 40 km / h for good 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.420
 Traction on all wheels additional 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.600
 the berkaer and 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.600
 downhill help and 220 mm ground clearance 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.740
 with the vorster we want both the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.730
 Customers address the leisure time 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.480
 are oriented 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.330
 who ever go to the terrain 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.920
 in addition to use on the street too 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.740
 ever want to pull in the trailer 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.690
 terrain horse trailers trailers us 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.070
 have tempered by two tons 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.210
 that starts this target audience and 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.390
 lower ground clearance 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.680
 fuel consumption and seating comfort and 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.790
 good driving characteristics 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.430
 these are the attributes that surely are 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.350
 family or the recreational athlete though 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.370
 also the hunter of something more 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.810
 Ground clearance needed to appeal 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.120
 appealing is now also the exterior design 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.480
 of apron of headlight and the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:01.030
 Radiator grille have been completely redesigned 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.030
 the page is the same as the 2012 model 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.519
 the large lettering on the tail show 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.349
 the backman clearly which subaru 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.829
 with what features right in front of him 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.810
 drives subaru sees himself in 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.609
 Germany as a niche importer 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.689
 that means you have a turnover of 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:28.389
 almost 10,000 vehicles with 0 3 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:30.099
 market share, subaru is definitely one 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.650
 Manufacturer of the in Germany no 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.239
 great influence has with the cvt 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.790
 Third generation automatic transmission 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.980
 schaeffler delivers to subaru 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.139
 efficiently and reliably the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.599
 The system of operation of the 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.250
 line tonic the forrester without 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.120
 Traction interruption speeds up 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.120
 convinced
