00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
we're going to be using casein protein

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.070 
we're going to be using casein protein
powder<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.029> that's<00:00:21.119> kind<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.570> important

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
my peanut butter in a microwavable safe

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.940 
my peanut butter in a microwavable safe
cup<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.299> microwave<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.170> around<00:01:07.409> 15

cup in microwave it for around 15

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.359 
cup in microwave it for around 15
seconds<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:09.390> easier<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> stir<00:01:10.530> into<00:01:10.950> our

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.429 
seconds so it's easier to stir into our
casein<00:01:12.030> protein<00:01:12.450> powder<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.260> that's

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
casein protein powder so that's

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.230 
casein protein powder so that's
completely<00:01:13.860> optional<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.970> if<00:01:15.090> you

completely optional you can do it if you
want<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.409> go<00:01:16.500> ahead<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> do

want but I'm going to go ahead and do
that<00:01:17.070> today<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:17.939> we're<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.119> going<00:01:18.420> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
that today and then we're just going to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.399 
that today and then we're just going to
add<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:19.110> right<00:01:19.350> into<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.100> bowl<00:01:21.409> you'll

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409

add that right into the bowl you'll
notice<00:01:22.799> after<00:01:22.979> 15<00:01:23.580> seconds<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> microwave

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
notice after 15 seconds in the microwave

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.570 
notice after 15 seconds in the microwave
it's<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.020> lot<00:01:25.229> softer<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.100> that's<00:01:26.310> definitely

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
it's a lot softer and that's definitely

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.940 
it's a lot softer and that's definitely
easier<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.540> mix<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.439> then<00:01:28.590> our<00:01:28.710> last

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
easier to mix and then our last

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.950 
easier to mix and then our last
ingredient<00:01:29.250> before<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.270> put<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
ingredient before we put this in the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.140 
ingredient before we put this in the
freezer<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.710> little<00:01:31.770> bit<00:01:32.100> will<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.729> around

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
freezer for a little bit will be around

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.260 
freezer for a little bit will be around
a<00:01:33.390> quarter<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.259> cup<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.680> almond<00:01:35.460> milk<00:01:35.490> now

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
a quarter of a cup of almond milk now

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.719

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.039 
cookie dough so you don't want to add
too<00:01:43.979> much<00:01:44.220> because<00:01:44.579> then<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.180> will<00:01:45.299> become<00:01:45.479> too

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
too much because then it will become too

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.050 
too much because then it will become too
liquidy<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.560> basically<00:01:47.070> become<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> soup<00:01:47.729> so

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
liquidy and basically become a soup so

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.090 
liquidy and basically become a soup so
don't<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.899> it's<00:01:49.350> better<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.680> add<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
don't do that it's better to add a

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.039 
don't do that it's better to add a
little<00:01:50.399> bit<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.909> almond<00:01:51.390> milk<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:51.840> water

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
little bit of almond milk or water

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.929 
little bit of almond milk or water
whatever<00:01:52.439> you're<00:01:52.710> using<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.520> adding<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
whatever you're using just adding a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.260 
whatever you're using just adding a
little<00:01:54.119> bit<00:01:54.270> at<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> time<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.229> way

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
little bit at a time and that way

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.200 
little bit at a time and that way
you<00:01:56.329> won't<00:01:56.539> make<00:01:56.719> it<00:01:56.780> too<00:01:57.229> liquidy<00:01:57.710> too<00:01:57.859> fast

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
you won't make it too liquidy too fast

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.459 
you won't make it too liquidy too fast
so<00:01:59.210> I'm<00:01:59.329> just<00:01:59.450> going<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.659> add<00:01:59.810> a<00:01:59.840> little<00:02:00.229> bit

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
so I'm just going to add a little bit

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.719 
so I'm just going to add a little bit
into<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.920> ball<00:02:01.130> at<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.369> time<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:04.070> you'll<00:02:04.640> be

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
into the ball at a time and you'll be

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.029 
into the ball at a time and you'll be
able<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.149> tell<00:02:05.360> once<00:02:06.079> you<00:02:06.229> start<00:02:06.530> up<00:02:06.710> if<00:02:06.920> you

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039
