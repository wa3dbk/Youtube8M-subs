 well we can also carve the carrots 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.500

 seasoning here is the marinade ready 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:23.100
 I thought a little bit of names he did not

 you just have to drop the nets 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.789
 in the dish impregnating them well 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.740
 marinade 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.319
 once completed we reserves to 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.020
 24 hours cool down the time they 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.520
 cook slowly with a juice of 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.189
 lemon white wine and who take the 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.119
 aromas of all ingredients 24 hours 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.560
 it gives us time to do the 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.939
 stewed onions quite 2 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:51.039
 millions white basic then we avoid the 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:56.500
 sculpture for the onion compote 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:57.640
 almost half of that scared piece and we 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.700
 do not forget we're in normandy they're there 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.860
 added to the onions to little wine 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.969
 white and 3 tablespoons sugar 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.750
 powdered stew that the culprits have 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:13.180
 consulted to remove the town logo 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.640
 to behave as it depends on the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.099
 firepower of the onion fouda 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.250
 count a good 2000 to three quarters 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.530
 time is always stir to avoid 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.030
 that it takes deep down I like it 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.549
 it's a recipe for people 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.960
 take time because of the compote 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.300

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.040
