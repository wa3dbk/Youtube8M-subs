versus the Ascend pp7 the wall way S&amp;P 7
and<00:00:09.960> which<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.860> actually<00:00:11.130> feels<00:00:11.700> almost<00:00:12.059> like

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
and which is actually feels almost like

and which is actually feels almost like
an<00:00:12.360> iphone<00:00:12.450> 6<00:00:12.929> because<00:00:13.740> it's<00:00:13.950> so<00:00:14.130> thin<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.730> all

an iphone 6 because it's so thin and all
that<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.630> where<00:00:15.750> i<00:00:15.780> can<00:00:16.109> see<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
that and where i can see the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.070 
that and where i can see the
next-generation<00:00:16.800> iphone<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.699> iphone<00:00:18.180> 6<00:00:18.720> here

next-generation iphone the iphone 6 here

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.410 
next-generation iphone the iphone 6 here
to<00:00:19.289> become<00:00:19.580> even<00:00:20.580> thinner<00:00:20.850> than<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> current

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
to become even thinner than the current

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.910 
to become even thinner than the current
generation<00:00:21.600> iphone<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.710> see<00:00:22.800> it

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
generation iphone so you can see it

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.880 
generation iphone so you can see it
either<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> right<00:00:23.490> side<00:00:24.230> so<00:00:25.230> start<00:00:25.800> off

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
either on the right side so start off

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.220 
either on the right side so start off
here<00:00:26.160> let's<00:00:26.820> check<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.539> thickness<00:00:28.109> you

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
here let's check out the thickness you

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.259 
here let's check out the thickness you
can<00:00:28.380> see<00:00:28.560> here<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.890> according<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
can see here that according to the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.900 
can see here that according to the
renders<00:00:30.689> everything<00:00:30.840> seems<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
renders everything seems like the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.940 
renders everything seems like the
hallway<00:00:32.910> p<00:00:33.480> 7<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> little<00:00:34.739> bit

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
hallway p 7 is going to be a little bit

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.819 
hallway p 7 is going to be a little bit
taller<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:38.000> also<00:00:39.000> when<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.540> put<00:00:39.989> them<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.530> top

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
taller and also when we put them on top

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.310 
taller and also when we put them on top
of<00:00:40.890> each<00:00:41.100> other<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.780> kind<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.140> see

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
of each other here you can kind of see

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
of each other here you can kind of see
that<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> next<00:00:43.890> iPhone<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.460> expected<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.210> be

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
that the next iPhone is expected to be

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.630 
that the next iPhone is expected to be
not<00:00:46.289> as<00:00:46.559> wide<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.480> these<00:00:48.480> p<00:00:49.350> 7<00:00:49.739> which<00:00:50.460> is

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
not as wide as these p 7 which is

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.540 
not as wide as these p 7 which is
interesting<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.680> then<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:52.949> also<00:00:53.100> check

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
interesting and then we can also check

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.049 
interesting and then we can also check
out<00:00:53.699> thickness<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.690> these<00:00:55.489> akc<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.610> seems<00:00:56.850> like

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
out thickness on these akc it seems like

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.510 
out thickness on these akc it seems like
it<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.539> mean<00:00:57.840> definitely<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.530> 16<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.039> possible

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
it I mean definitely that 16 is possible

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.849 
it I mean definitely that 16 is possible
in<00:00:59.640> terms<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.090> design<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.690> hey<00:01:01.500> if

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
in terms of it design because hey if

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.410 
in terms of it design because hey if
Huawei<00:01:02.670> p<00:01:03.510> 7<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.710> hallway<00:01:05.580> if<00:01:05.820> they<00:01:06.240> can

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
Huawei p 7 or if hallway if they can

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.539 
Huawei p 7 or if hallway if they can
produce<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.930> phone<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:08.220> obviously

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
produce a phone like this then obviously

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.060 
produce a phone like this then obviously
we<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.479> get<00:01:09.659> an<00:01:09.900> iphone<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.500> work<00:01:10.650> exactly

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
we can get an iphone to work exactly

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.899 
we can get an iphone to work exactly
like<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.110> 6<00:01:13.380> 15<00:01:14.159> millimeter<00:01:14.580> thickness

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
like this so 6 15 millimeter thickness

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.120 
like this so 6 15 millimeter thickness
this<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.140> next<00:01:16.350> generation<00:01:16.409> iphone

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
this one and the next generation iphone

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.859 
this one and the next generation iphone
is<00:01:17.280> expected<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.350> around<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:20.509> that<00:01:21.509> area

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
is expected to be around that that area

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.620 
is expected to be around that that area
around<00:01:22.140> six<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.890> seven<00:01:23.130> millimeters<00:01:23.630> which

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
around six and seven millimeters which

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.260 
around six and seven millimeters which
could<00:01:24.869> definitely<00:01:25.080> be<00:01:25.409> some<00:01:25.920> nice<00:01:26.490> nice

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
could definitely be some nice nice

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.539 
side and this one of course next iPhone
is<00:01:36.990> also<00:01:37.229> expect<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> 4.7<00:01:38.430> inch

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
is also expect to have a 4.7 inch

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.370 
is also expect to have a 4.7 inch
display<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.960> actually<00:01:40.049> having

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
display and this one is actually having

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.170 
display and this one is actually having
a<00:01:40.439> little<00:01:40.650> bit<00:01:40.770> bigger<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.939> point<00:01:42.090> is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
a little bit bigger and this point is

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.270 
a little bit bigger and this point is
having<00:01:42.450> 5<00:01:42.720> inch<00:01:42.930> display<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.920> probably

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
having 5 inch display that can probably

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.210 
having 5 inch display that can probably
explain<00:01:44.520> why<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.850> feels<00:01:45.060> low<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.659> by<00:01:45.840> god<00:01:46.220> but

explain why it feels low but by god but
you<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.430> see<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:47.820> happened<00:01:48.149> doesn't

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
