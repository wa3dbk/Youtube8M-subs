00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 all right 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.139
 today in online drawing we will draw the 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.430
 face of a woman a little stylized 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.680
 teenager and we'll see some 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.320
 differences with respect to the face of 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.260
 adult we start by drawing a circle 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.940
 we drew a line from the middle this one 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.670
 will help to draw the face in a way 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.050
 symmetric then we draw two lines 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.970
 slightly inclined 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.550
 for the face as the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.640
 chin gets smaller as a 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.950
 Water drop pointing up 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.559
 then we draw this horizontal line 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.390
 very close to the circle and then starting 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.449
 from these points the face becomes more 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.760
 pointy all this part is similar to 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.370
 an equilateral triangle but a little 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.829
 flattened by removing the tip we obtain 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.899
 the chin for being a woman 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.329
 we draw the neck thinner than the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.630
 face at this time we already have in 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.910
 basic the drawing of the head 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.380
 to draw the eyes we measure all the 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.600
 head from the chin to the 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.370
 crown and divide it into two parts 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.920
 but at the top it will be 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.660
 slightly larger before 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.330
 teach us that the human head measures 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.490
 equal of the eyes up that of 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.460
 the eyes down but this varies 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.170
 according to age for example a baby measures 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.120
 more of the eyes upwards than of the 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.800
 eyes down 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.890
 this difference is fading in 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.290
 childhood but it's still that way in the 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.300
 teenager hardly notice but also 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.340
 measures more of the eyes up than of 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.380
 the same ones down 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.359
 another fundamental difference is that the 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.399
 Eyes in the teenager look very big 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:40.039
 because the face is not finished yet 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.560
 grow here we draw them too 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.240
 great to accentuate this difference 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.609
 it should be noted so that you draw them well 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.280
 that the points where it ends and the 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.110
 eye must draw a diagonal the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.539
 nose will be as wide as the separation 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.149
 between both eyes, we trace its outline 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.250
 here we start with a circle that is the 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.630
 tip of the nose 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.969
 we mark the bottom part and draw 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.369
 two lines the wings of the analysis are 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.810
 they point outside and then towards 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.390
 in 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.910
 after drawing the mouth we draw the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.099
 these are the draw eyebrows far from 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.349
 the eyes as you can see in the 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.620
 Masculine face the eyebrows are very 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.870
 near the eyes the further we push them away 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.239
 of the most feminine eyes will look and 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.459
 will also reduce the age from there this 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.830
 separation the ears we draw them 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.780
 small between the eyebrows and the nose 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.480
 also the small ears can 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.340
 indicate youth we aim last 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.890
 that the jaw is very small and 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.049
 pointy in a man is always more 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.150
 big and square if you take into account 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.540
 this the face that I draw will look more 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.750
 youth 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.280
 now we will draw in more detail 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.150
 only it should be noted that as 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.340
 about a woman 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.560
 you have to use after your rounds and avoid 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.989
 the abrupt breaks the hair 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.140
 bulging will confer youth for this 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.810
 reason this exceeds all this marked area 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.450
 in red the abundant hair and the head 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.709
 big confer youth 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:11.519
 reviewing we have that big eyes 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:16.379
 big head small jaw hair 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:19.889
 bulging raised eyebrows thin neck 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:23.569
 and rounded strokes are the formula for 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:25.640
 draw a youthful and feminine face 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.739
 immediately we indicate the shadows of 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.019
 face with helped the light comes from 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.249
 top right after indicating 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.519
 the darkness in the hair 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:36.170
 we make a coloring copy 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.030
 we start with basic colors and plants 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.420
 that simply indicate darkness and 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.459
 light little by little we are making nuances and 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.340
 placing more darkness where it 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.439
 requires we light our eyes and go 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.060
 molding little by little with the help of a 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.099
 brush that does not work with all its 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.650
 opacity and using the tool 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.810
 finger photoshop to join the different 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.120
 areas of shadows 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.299
 then we light up the hair and we give the 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.609
 last touches a colored like this can 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.129
 take about three hours to add 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.610
 details and give nuances but in the end 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.500
 we get the desired result 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.440
 we hope as always that this class will 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.079
 it is illustrative comments dale like if 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.700
 you liked subscribe to see more classes 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.910
 drawing and check the links at the end 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.800
 to see how other faces are drawn 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.750
 it is also in the description follows 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.750
 practicing and see you another time
