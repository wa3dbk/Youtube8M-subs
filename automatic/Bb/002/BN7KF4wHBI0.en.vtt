good<00:04:09.329> I<00:04:09.570> bet<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.410> this<00:04:10.829> is<00:04:10.980> why<00:04:11.130> we've<00:04:11.340> had

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
good I bet and this is why we've had

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.640 
good I bet and this is why we've had
such<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.820> slow<00:04:12.120> curve<00:04:12.390> getting<00:04:13.019> better<00:04:13.200> let's

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
such a slow curve getting better let's

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.890 
such a slow curve getting better let's
see<00:04:13.920> if<00:04:14.100> we<00:04:14.400> can<00:04:14.730> do<00:04:15.239> something<00:04:15.480> extraordinary

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
see if we can do something extraordinary

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.740 
see if we can do something extraordinary
here<00:04:16.500> in<00:04:16.650> this<00:04:17.190> thing<00:04:17.459> was<00:04:17.820> made<00:04:17.850> 21st<00:04:18.510> and

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
here in this thing was made 21st and

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.330 
here in this thing was made 21st and
with<00:04:18.900> all<00:04:18.989> our<00:04:19.109> little<00:04:19.350> things<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.709> be<00:04:20.160> kind

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
to the people who were wrong and maybe

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.770 
to the people who were wrong and maybe
wouldn't<00:04:22.979> get<00:04:23.099> that<00:04:23.130> little<00:04:23.580> decency<00:04:24.300> curve

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
wouldn't get that little decency curve

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.770 
wouldn't get that little decency curve
to<00:04:24.990> go<00:04:25.169> from

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
to go from
