00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
and I had to cut it off because this

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.780 
and I had to cut it off because this
actually<00:04:01.110> it's<00:04:01.260> broke<00:04:01.590> just<00:04:02.459> like<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.730> said

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
actually it's broke just like I said

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.210 
actually it's broke just like I said
what<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:03.390> just<00:04:04.230> be<00:04:04.349> careful<00:04:04.500> when<00:04:04.830> doing<00:04:05.129> it

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
what so just be careful when doing it

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.250 
what so just be careful when doing it
because<00:04:05.550> it<00:04:05.790> can<00:04:06.300> get<00:04:06.420> annoying<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:07.019> just

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
because it can get annoying you just

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.440 
because it can get annoying you just
want<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.500> push<00:04:07.739> it<00:04:07.920> in<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.280> here<00:04:08.700> won't<00:04:08.879> remain

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
want to push it in and here won't remain

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.729 
want to push it in and here won't remain
skin<00:04:09.750> under<00:04:09.989> braking

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
skin under braking

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.660 
skin under braking
so<00:04:11.280> hopefully<00:04:11.519> this<00:04:11.970> goes<00:04:12.209> in<00:04:12.480> by<00:04:13.080> itself

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
so hopefully this goes in by itself

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.229 
so hopefully this goes in by itself

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.830 
careful because it's it's probably gonna
break<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.300> did<00:04:36.720> on<00:04:36.840> me<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:39.180> do<00:04:39.300> that<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.630> both

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
break I did on me and do that to both

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.300 
break I did on me and do that to both
sides<00:04:42.020> okay<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:43.080> after<00:04:43.260> you<00:04:43.470> finish<00:04:43.710> you

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
sides okay so after you finish you

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.200 
sides okay so after you finish you
should<00:04:44.550> look<00:04:44.729> like<00:04:44.790> this<00:04:45.210> I<00:04:45.950> had<00:04:46.950> to<00:04:47.040> put<00:04:47.580> hot

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
should look like this I had to put hot

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.990 
should look like this I had to put hot
blow<00:04:48.510> on<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:49.010> because<00:04:50.010> it<00:04:50.220> was<00:04:50.310> just<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:50.850> just

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
blow on it because it was just you just

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.670 
blow on it because it was just you just
kept<00:04:51.300> breaking<00:04:51.510> apart<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:52.229> then<00:04:52.410> probably

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
kept breaking apart and then probably

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.550 
kept breaking apart and then probably
will<00:04:53.070> for<00:04:53.340> you<00:04:53.490> so<00:04:54.330> just<00:04:54.360> have<00:04:54.960> patience<00:04:55.440> and
