00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
Anika 6 and some guys might also be

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.109 
Anika 6 and some guys might also be
wondering<00:01:04.320> why<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.830> should<00:01:05.100> use<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.700> weapon

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
wondering why you should use this weapon

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.480 
wondering why you should use this weapon
over<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.810> your<00:01:06.990> eco<00:01:07.380> well<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.280> obvious

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
over to this your eco well one obvious

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.969 
over to this your eco well one obvious
reason<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.360> because<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.110> need<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.500> get<00:01:10.710> ten

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
reason is because you need to get ten

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.039 
reason is because you need to get ten
headshots<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.760> order<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> unlock<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:12.869> your

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
headshots in order to unlock it as your

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.410 
headshots in order to unlock it as your
ego<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.619> obviously<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.880> want<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.270> use<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
ego so obviously if you want to use a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.060 
ego so obviously if you want to use a
desert<00:01:15.810> eagle<00:01:15.930> you're<00:01:16.439> going<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> get

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
desert eagle you're going to have to get

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.160 
desert eagle you're going to have to get
a<00:01:17.100> ten<00:01:17.340> headshots<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.479> go<00:01:18.689> over<00:01:18.869> so

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
a ten headshots with this you go over so

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.990 
a ten headshots with this you go over so
forget<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> pretty<00:01:20.790> useless

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
forget that it is a pretty useless

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.789 
forget that it is a pretty useless
pistol<00:01:21.600> especially<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.290> compare<00:01:22.500> this

such an amazing weapon it outperforms

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.240 
such an amazing weapon it outperforms
the<00:01:27.570> unique<00:01:27.869> estates<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.500> every<00:01:28.950> single

mind<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.720> those<00:01:45.930> things<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> lot

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
mind is that those things have a lot

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.920

better ending downside of accuracy which

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.240 
better ending downside of accuracy which
means<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.380> you're<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> lot<00:01:50.070> more

one<00:01:54.930> unique<00:01:55.350> thing<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.860> found<00:01:56.189> about<00:01:56.369> this

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
one unique thing that I found about this

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.030 
one unique thing that I found about this
revolver<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.840> there<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.320> no<00:01:58.590> trigger

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
revolver is that there is no trigger

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
fingers though because I'm not exactly

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.480

sure<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.960> dice<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.799> add<00:02:05.040> the

sure the dice is going to add the
trigger<00:02:05.700> delay<00:02:05.909> when<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.600> weapon<00:02:07.049> launches

to<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.890> public<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.000> look<00:02:09.119> at<00:02:09.270> the

to the public like if you look at the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.839 
to the public like if you look at the
estimate<00:02:09.869> 40<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.379> example<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.220> used<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.640> not

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
estimate 40 for example you used to not

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.490 
estimate 40 for example you used to not
have<00:02:12.180> any<00:02:12.390> trigger<00:02:12.930> delay<00:02:13.110> well

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
have any trigger delay well

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.560 
have any trigger delay well
so<00:02:13.590> ever<00:02:13.800> but<00:02:14.190> after<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> couple<00:02:14.850> patches<00:02:15.150> the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
so ever but after a couple patches the

so ever but after a couple patches the
dice<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:16.110> decided<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.680> put<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.860> trigger<00:02:17.130> delay

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
dice just decided to put a trigger delay

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.010 
dice just decided to put a trigger delay
on<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.880> I'm<00:02:18.030> not<00:02:18.060> exactly<00:02:18.300> sure<00:02:18.540> about<00:02:18.660> that

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
on so I'm not exactly sure about that

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.410 
on so I'm not exactly sure about that
I'm<00:02:19.290> crossing<00:02:19.740> my<00:02:19.770> fingers<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.610> as<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.910> worker

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
I'm crossing my fingers but as a worker

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.570 
I'm crossing my fingers but as a worker
state<00:02:21.810> right<00:02:22.050> now<00:02:22.080> there<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.920> no<00:02:23.190> trigger

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
state right now there is no trigger

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.600 
state right now there is no trigger
delay<00:02:23.820> which<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.630> thing<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.110> pretty<00:02:25.530> amazing

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
delay which a thing is pretty amazing

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.100 
delay which a thing is pretty amazing
now<00:02:26.850> let's<00:02:27.180> look<00:02:27.300> at<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.480> stats<00:02:27.780> with<00:02:27.960> this

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
now let's look at the stats with this

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.080 
now let's look at the stats with this
pistol<00:02:28.500> real<00:02:28.680> quick<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.220> as<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.700> can<00:02:29.820> see

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
pistol real quick and as you can see

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.420 
pistol real quick and as you can see
this<00:02:30.420> gun<00:02:30.660> has<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.870> rate<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.110> fire<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.440> 210

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
this gun has a rate of fire of 210

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.880 
this gun has a rate of fire of 210
rounds<00:02:32.730> per<00:02:32.850> minute<00:02:33.000> which<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.570> very<00:02:34.230> very

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
rounds per minute which is very very

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.060 
rounds per minute which is very very
comparable<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.970> SWE<00:02:36.690> pistol<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.380> fact<00:02:37.709> I'm

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
comparable to the SWE pistol in fact I'm

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.070 
comparable to the SWE pistol in fact I'm
going<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.310> put<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.580> SW<00:02:39.060> for<00:02:39.240> its<00:02:39.360> test<00:02:39.630> at<00:02:39.810> the

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
going to put the SW for its test at the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.560 
going to put the SW for its test at the
bottom<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.010> unica<00:02:41.430> 6<00:02:41.459> at<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.880> top<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.420> as

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
bottom and the unica 6 at the top and as

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.110 
bottom and the unica 6 at the top and as
you<00:02:42.690> can<00:02:42.780> see<00:02:42.840> there's<00:02:43.650> just<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.340> many<00:02:44.550> similar

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
you can see there's just so many similar

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.570 
you can see there's just so many similar
things<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.630> SW<00:02:46.140> reported<00:02:46.560> pistol<00:02:47.070> with

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
things to the SW reported pistol with

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.370 
things to the SW reported pistol with
the<00:02:47.610> exception<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.570> aim<00:02:48.750> downside

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
the exception of the aim downside

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.860 
the exception of the aim downside
accuracy<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:50.550> when<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.090> comes<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:51.390> close-range

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
accuracy so when it comes to close-range

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.650 
accuracy so when it comes to close-range
engagements<00:02:52.190> SW<00:02:53.190> 40<00:02:53.489> is<00:02:53.640> hands-down<00:02:54.180> going<00:02:54.600> to

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
in mind is that this pistol has a

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.380 
in mind is that this pistol has a
freakin<00:03:07.620> three<00:03:07.950> time<00:03:08.250> scope<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.060> when<00:03:09.270> it

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
freakin three time scope so when it

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.030 
freakin three time scope so when it
comes<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.750> medium<00:03:10.140> range<00:03:10.290> engagements<00:03:10.500> you

comes to medium range engagements you

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.560 
comes to medium range engagements you
can<00:03:11.430> put<00:03:11.610> that<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:11.790> with<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.180> combination

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
can put that on with the combination

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.780 
can put that on with the combination
heavy<00:03:13.170> barrel<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:14.130> can<00:03:14.370> pretty<00:03:14.700> much

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
heavy barrel and you can pretty much

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.900 
heavy barrel and you can pretty much
rack<00:03:15.390> people<00:03:16.200> in<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.680> medium<00:03:17.130> range<00:03:17.310> distance

switched back to this pistol and a lot

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.860 
switched back to this pistol and a lot
of<00:03:28.980> enemies<00:03:29.430> weren't<00:03:29.880> expected<00:03:30.450> for<00:03:30.630> me<00:03:30.750> to

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
of enemies weren't expected for me to

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.479

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
get a head shot with it because when it

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.789 
get a head shot with it because when it
comes<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.850> Magnum<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.660> have<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:33.989> be<00:03:34.200> really

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
comes to Magnum you have to be really

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.979 
comes to Magnum you have to be really
really<00:03:34.860> accurate<00:03:35.370> but<00:03:35.820> well<00:03:36.269> start<00:03:36.660> using<00:03:36.810> a

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
really accurate but well start using a

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.050 
really accurate but well start using a
three<00:03:37.200> time<00:03:37.410> scope<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:38.040> makes<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.640> lot

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
three time scope it makes it a lot

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.240 
three time scope it makes it a lot
easier<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:39.900> get<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.200> head<00:03:40.440> shot<00:03:40.709> up<00:03:40.830> between<00:03:41.100> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
easier to get a head shot up between the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.250 
easier to get a head shot up between the
close<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.760> medium<00:03:42.000> range<00:03:42.180> engagement<00:03:43.019> and

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
close to medium range engagement and

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.410 
close to medium range engagement and
that's<00:03:43.829> what<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.070> found<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:44.730> pistol<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.299> be

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
that's what I found this pistol to be

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.420 
that's what I found this pistol to be
very<00:03:45.690> special<00:03:46.230> because<00:03:46.410> first<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:47.070> all<00:03:47.160> it

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
very special because first of all it

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.039 
very special because first of all it
does<00:03:47.640> not<00:03:47.850> have<00:03:48.150> any<00:03:48.360> trigger<00:03:48.750> lace

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
does not have any trigger lace

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.590 
does not have any trigger lace
whatsoever<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.950> also<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:50.850> can<00:03:51.030> attach<00:03:51.390> the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
whatsoever and also you can attach the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.479 
whatsoever and also you can attach the
three-time<00:03:52.079> scope<00:03:52.410> which<00:03:52.680> allows<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.280> to

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
three-time scope which allows you to

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.060 
three-time scope which allows you to
easily<00:03:53.760> get<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.630> headshot<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.500> close<00:03:55.769> to

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.770 
easily get a headshot in a close to
medium<00:03:56.340> range<00:03:56.730> engagements<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.720> know

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
medium range engagements and I know

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.360 
medium range engagements and I know
they're<00:03:58.140> also<00:03:58.320> selling<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.739> flaws<00:03:58.980> such<00:03:59.220> as<00:03:59.340> a

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
they're also selling the flaws such as a

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.000 
they're also selling the flaws such as a
reloading<00:03:59.910> time<00:04:00.060> which<00:04:00.329> takes<00:04:00.600> 4.1<00:04:01.560> seconds

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
reloading time which takes 4.1 seconds

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.670 
reloading time which takes 4.1 seconds
which<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.280> flat-out<00:04:03.120> ugly<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.290> damage

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
which is flat-out ugly and the damage
