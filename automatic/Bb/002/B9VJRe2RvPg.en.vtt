00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.810 
can see a little bit of details on my
camera<00:02:01.960> but<00:02:02.260> not<00:02:02.290> too<00:02:02.590> many<00:02:02.799> but<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.430> course<00:02:03.460> we

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
camera but not too many but of course we

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.609 
camera but not too many but of course we
assume<00:02:04.240> then<00:02:04.450> quite<00:02:04.750> a<00:02:04.780> bit<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.170> it's<00:02:05.320> only<00:02:05.500> a

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
assume then quite a bit and it's only a

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.590 
assume then quite a bit and it's only a
two<00:02:05.799> megapixel<00:02:05.950> camera<00:02:06.580> in<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.700> front<00:02:06.729> which

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
two megapixel camera in the front which

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.570 
two megapixel camera in the front which
is<00:02:07.750> actually<00:02:07.930> enough<00:02:08.229> for<00:02:08.440> selfies<00:02:08.860> but<00:02:09.459> of

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
is actually enough for selfies but of

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.580 
is actually enough for selfies but of
course<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.850> don't<00:02:09.940> want<00:02:10.149> any<00:02:10.330> details<00:02:11.020> as<00:02:11.380> you

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
course you don't want any details as you

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.170 
course you don't want any details as you
can<00:02:11.709> see<00:02:11.920> we<00:02:12.040> have<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.520> basic<00:02:12.940> android

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
can see we have the basic android

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.880 
can see we have the basic android
installed<00:02:13.740> with<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:14.770> little<00:02:15.130> bit<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:16.890> what

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
installed with a little bit of what

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.000 
installed with a little bit of what
happened<00:02:18.700> here<00:02:21.569> no<00:02:22.569> you<00:02:23.230> go<00:02:23.440> with<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.709> little

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
happened here no you go with a little

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.220 
happened here no you go with a little
bit<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.580> mark<00:02:25.030> hotel<00:02:25.180> software<00:02:25.720> inside<00:02:26.050> but

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
bit of a mark hotel software inside but

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.960 
bit of a mark hotel software inside but
not<00:02:26.410> too<00:02:26.530> much<00:02:26.560> if<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:26.980> just<00:02:27.190> drop<00:02:27.700> down<00:02:27.850> the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
not too much if you just drop down the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.150 
not too much if you just drop down the
screen<00:02:28.180> can<00:02:28.360> see<00:02:28.540> it's<00:02:28.660> really<00:02:29.260> not<00:02:29.739> like<00:02:29.800> the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
screen can see it's really not like the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.520 
screen can see it's really not like the
regular<00:02:30.310> vanilla<00:02:30.670> Android<00:02:31.270> Android<00:02:31.840> 4.3<00:02:32.350> is

regular vanilla Android Android 4.3 is
actually<00:02:32.800> here<00:02:32.980> inside<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.820> mini<00:02:34.000> as

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
actually here inside in the mini as

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.020 
actually here inside in the mini as
there<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.840> also<00:02:35.019> LTE<00:02:35.500> category<00:02:36.040> for<00:02:36.280> gps<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:37.000> gps

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
there is also LTE category for gps a gps

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.470 
there is also LTE category for gps a gps
and<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.440> 18th<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:39.040> internal<00:02:39.970> memory<00:02:40.120> from

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
and and 18th of internal memory from

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.060 
and and 18th of internal memory from
which<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.810> can<00:02:41.019> actually<00:02:41.230> use<00:02:41.380> even<00:02:41.769> 6

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
which you can actually use even 6

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.040 
which you can actually use even 6
gigabytes<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:42.760> that's<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.150> quite<00:02:43.540> cool<00:02:43.810> but<00:02:43.959> you

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
gigabytes so that's a quite cool but you

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.259 
gigabytes so that's a quite cool but you
can<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.260> course<00:02:44.290> expand<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.610> with<00:02:45.820> the

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
can of course expand that and with the

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.930 
can of course expand that and with the
two<00:02:46.450> lemak<00:02:46.780> microsd<00:02:47.440> slot<00:02:47.560> on<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.860> side<00:02:47.980> it's

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
two lemak microsd slot on the side it's

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.570 
two lemak microsd slot on the side it's
what<00:02:49.090> else<00:02:49.300> we<00:02:49.420> want<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.660> show<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:50.110> the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
are all done here with the mini s and we

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.860 
are all done here with the mini s and we
will<00:02:55.690> also<00:02:55.840> also<00:02:56.590> show<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.160> mini<00:02:58.030> i<00:02:58.330> just

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
quickly so there's not the standard

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.660 
quickly so there's not the standard
keyboard<00:03:07.810> disease<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.680> then<00:03:08.860> alcatel

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
keyboard disease and then alcatel

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.600 
keyboard disease and then alcatel
keyboard<00:03:10.120> can<00:03:10.750> flip<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.140> screen<00:03:11.410> which<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.460> a

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
keyboard can flip the screen which is a

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.340 
keyboard can flip the screen which is a
little<00:03:13.030> bit<00:03:13.180> laggy<00:03:13.390> could<00:03:13.810> be<00:03:13.930> faster<00:03:14.320> but

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
little bit laggy could be faster but

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.710 
little bit laggy could be faster but
it's<00:03:15.100> all<00:03:15.250> right<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.880> yeah<00:03:16.120> this<00:03:16.270> is<00:03:16.390> actually

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
it's all right and yeah this is actually

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.840 
it's all right and yeah this is actually
