this<00:00:40.040> helicopter<00:00:40.520> is<00:00:40.760> specially<00:00:41.210> designed<00:00:41.239> to

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
this helicopter is specially designed to

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.660 
this helicopter is specially designed to
be<00:00:41.780> very<00:00:41.989> very<00:00:42.379> stable<00:00:42.650> especially<00:00:42.920> in<00:00:43.430> hover

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
be very very stable especially in hover

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.930 
be very very stable especially in hover
right<00:00:44.660> here<00:00:44.870> it<00:00:45.110> requires<00:00:45.830> very<00:00:46.250> minimal

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
right here it requires very minimal

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.750 
right here it requires very minimal
stick<00:00:47.360> input<00:00:47.750> just<00:00:48.110> keep<00:00:48.379> it<00:00:48.559> in<00:00:48.680> hover<00:00:48.890> as<00:00:49.640> you

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
stick input just keep it in hover as you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.510 
stick input just keep it in hover as you
can<00:00:49.910> see<00:00:50.059> here<00:00:50.239> I'll<00:00:50.330> let<00:00:50.420> go<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.690> six<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.520> it

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
can see here I'll let go the six and it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.570 
can see here I'll let go the six and it
actually<00:00:53.530> takes<00:00:54.530> a<00:00:54.680> little<00:00:54.860> time<00:00:55.010> for<00:00:55.220> it<00:00:55.550> to

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
actually takes a little time for it to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.520 
actually takes a little time for it to
drift<00:00:55.820> out<00:00:56.030> of<00:00:56.059> position

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.800 

so<00:01:01.040> this<00:01:01.220> helps<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.700> beginning<00:01:02.150> helicopter

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
so this helps the beginning helicopter

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.450 
so this helps the beginning helicopter

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
definitely addressed this issue with a

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.530 
definitely addressed this issue with a
lot<00:01:52.800> of<00:01:52.979> different<00:01:53.490> programming<00:01:53.880> parameters

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
lot of different programming parameters

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.540 
lot of different programming parameters
and<00:01:54.750> also<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.560> fine-tuning<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.190> rotor<00:01:56.340> head

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
over the place and the helicopter is

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.990 
over the place and the helicopter is
still<00:02:03.780> staying<00:02:04.620> in<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:06.000> correct<00:02:06.270> position

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:44.530 

yeah<00:02:36.670> even<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.270> is<00:02:37.420> huh

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.640 

once<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.660> have<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:45.900> helicopter<00:02:46.290> pretty

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
once you have this helicopter pretty

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.160 
once you have this helicopter pretty
trimmed<00:02:46.920> out<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.100> mean<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.910> has<00:02:48.330> minimal<00:02:48.810> drift

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
trimmed out I mean it has minimal drift

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.640 
trimmed out I mean it has minimal drift
as<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.220> can<00:02:50.340> see<00:02:50.520> here<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:51.720> takes<00:02:51.930> longer<00:02:52.290> for

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
as you can see here it takes longer for

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.840 
as you can see here it takes longer for
it<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.740> drift<00:02:53.010> out<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.220> control

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
it to drift out of control

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.030 
it to drift out of control
unlike<00:02:54.540> most<00:02:54.750> helicopters<00:02:55.350> out<00:02:55.560> there<00:02:55.740> just

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
unlike most helicopters out there just

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.160 
unlike most helicopters out there just
because<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.580> fine<00:02:56.790> tuned<00:02:57.030> rotor<00:02:57.270> head<00:02:57.480> and

things about this new helicopter right
here<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:48.270> know<00:03:48.390> out<00:03:48.569> of<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.750> box<00:03:48.900> is

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
here you know out of the box is

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.870 
here you know out of the box is
specifically<00:03:49.680> designed<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.370> come<00:03:50.580> out<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.730> the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
controls and this helicopter is actually

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.030

detuned<00:03:56.910> quite<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.600> bit<00:03:57.870> just<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.680> help<00:03:58.860> the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
detuned quite a bit just to help the

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.620 
detuned quite a bit just to help the
beginning<00:03:59.370> consumer<00:03:59.880> transition<00:04:00.510> from

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
beginning consumer transition from

beginning consumer transition from
coaxial<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:01.530> MSR<00:04:02.400> helicopters<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.569> blade

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
coaxial and MSR helicopters to the blade

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.440 
coaxial and MSR helicopters to the blade
400<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.440> CP<00:04:04.680> pro<00:04:04.890> 2<00:04:04.950> helicopters<00:04:05.310> as<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.270> saw

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
400 and CP pro 2 helicopters as you saw

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.479 
400 and CP pro 2 helicopters as you saw
in<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.660> video<00:04:06.780> it's<00:04:07.200> very<00:04:07.530> very<00:04:07.860> stable<00:04:08.130> you

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
in the video it's very very stable you

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.400 
in the video it's very very stable you
can<00:04:08.610> let<00:04:08.760> go<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.030> sticks<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:09.540> it'll<00:04:10.200> drift

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
can let go the sticks and it'll drift

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.190 
can let go the sticks and it'll drift
minimal<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.820> so<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:12.269> can<00:04:12.420> actually<00:04:12.570> you<00:04:13.110> know

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
minimal and so you can actually you know

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.600 
minimal and so you can actually you know
bang<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.560> sticks<00:04:13.800> around<00:04:13.950> without<00:04:14.340> it

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
bang the sticks around without it

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.090 
bang the sticks around without it
without<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.330> moving<00:04:15.989> at<00:04:16.290> lower<00:04:16.530> speeds

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
without it moving at lower speeds

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.180 
without it moving at lower speeds
now<00:04:17.970> this<00:04:18.419> helicopter<00:04:18.900> once<00:04:19.470> you're<00:04:19.739> more

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
now this helicopter once you're more

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.760 
now this helicopter once you're more
experienced<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.540> can<00:04:21.690> actually<00:04:21.810> bind<00:04:22.290> it<00:04:22.560> to

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
experienced you can actually bind it to

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.900 
experienced you can actually bind it to
a<00:04:23.040> DF<00:04:23.490> 7<00:04:23.700> or<00:04:23.910> dx6i<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:25.280> do<00:04:26.280> your<00:04:26.430> own<00:04:26.550> bottle

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
a DF 7 or dx6i and do your own bottle

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.840 
a DF 7 or dx6i and do your own bottle
curves<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:28.500> then<00:04:28.770> actually<00:04:29.280> take<00:04:29.460> advantage

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
curves and then actually take advantage

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.000
