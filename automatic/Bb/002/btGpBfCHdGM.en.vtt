realistically Sarkin gives this deck a
lot<00:06:49.850> more<00:06:50.090> reach<00:06:50.330> power<00:06:50.630> and<00:06:50.990> value<00:06:51.200> he's<00:06:52.160> an

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 
lot more reach power and value he's an

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.100 
lot more reach power and value he's an
important<00:06:52.700> addition<00:06:53.150> and<00:06:53.330> I<00:06:53.390> think<00:06:53.690> green<00:06:53.900> red

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
important addition and I think green red
