00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
one of the common questions I often get

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:03.290 
one of the common questions I often get
about<00:00:02.669> velomobile

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
about velomobile

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.160 
about velomobile
is<00:00:03.750> whether<00:00:04.319> they're<00:00:04.529> able<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.799> climb<00:00:04.980> Hills

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.170 
is whether they're able to climb Hills

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
and the 70 millimeter brakes so we're

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.910 
and the 70 millimeter brakes so we're
just<00:06:29.630> gonna<00:06:29.810> let<00:06:29.990> those<00:06:30.110> cool<00:06:30.410> down<00:06:30.650> a<00:06:30.680> little

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
just gonna let those cool down a little

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.670 
just gonna let those cool down a little
bit<00:06:31.100> because<00:06:31.370> I<00:06:32.120> was<00:06:32.480> running<00:06:32.630> them<00:06:32.960> pretty

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
bit because I was running them pretty

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.000 
bit because I was running them pretty
hard<00:06:33.860> there<00:06:35.410> all<00:06:36.410> right<00:06:36.530> so<00:06:36.590> I'm<00:06:36.740> just<00:06:36.800> going

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
hard there all right so I'm just going

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.920 
hard there all right so I'm just going
to<00:06:37.070> take<00:06:37.250> it<00:06:37.400> easy<00:06:37.550> on<00:06:37.790> this<00:06:38.000> final<00:06:38.480> descent

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
to take it easy on this final descent

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.660 
to take it easy on this final descent
and<00:06:40.510> head<00:06:41.510> for<00:06:41.750> home<00:06:41.920> it's<00:06:42.920> a<00:06:43.070> bit<00:06:43.220> of<00:06:43.310> a<00:06:43.400> rough

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:43.670 
and head for home it's a bit of a rough

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.270 
and head for home it's a bit of a rough
road<00:06:44.000> you<00:06:44.510> can<00:06:44.720> see<00:06:44.750> that<00:06:45.170> it<00:06:45.290> needs<00:06:45.500> a<00:06:45.710> needs<00:06:46.160> a

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
road you can see that it needs a needs a

road you can see that it needs a needs a
lot<00:06:46.460> of<00:06:46.490> work<00:06:46.730> so<00:06:47.120> I<00:06:47.500> have<00:06:48.500> to<00:06:48.590> keep<00:06:48.740> some<00:06:48.950> speed

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.220 
lot of work so I have to keep some speed

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.210
