00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.490
 hello then today I you 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.710
 found for a small dryden studio 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.690
 assos today what are we going 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.490
 do we just customize 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.250
 a pair of sandals so Cecilia 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.340
 started but normally she's like 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.420
 that I think finally I chose this kind 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.820
 sandals because simply 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.890
 because we all have sandals like that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.359
 who hangs out and I wanted to add 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.590
 a little bit of color they 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.239
 know and now I like 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.829
 nice with small bridges that we have 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.809
 advantage is that it will give a 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.000
 new life to your shoes and that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.489
 not very expensive so what I have 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.329
 done is that sir buy some 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.370
 points 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.620
 I took churches to upholster because 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.420
 that there it is there you will see to my 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.930
 friend I wanted a little bridge mutated for 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.780
 pass through the leather the son's dain 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.289
 good that simple cotton thread but 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.940
 need something special 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.979
 little ones so you can 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.200
 either it's simpler anyway if I 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.690
 had them this way and after you 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.140
 can just have the 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.850
 a chain bridge so here I already 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.950
 approached to gain a little your playfulness 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.760
 it's a small chain 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.860
 looked like this at first and small 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.320
 rings that you're going to hang on to this 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.510
 little chain and then little ones 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.300
 funny things for example there are some 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.190
 boyfriends I do not know where we are 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.020
 call it that plastic for 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.240
 hang on to weary us to consume 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.190
 a little you can really have fun 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.320
 to put a little what you have 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.580
 little medallions really what you 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:52.200
 so want to comment I'll go 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:55.560
 show how to relate a lot to our 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.940
 chain so it's better if there is a soul 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.810
 and a clip I do not have to 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.820
 disposition 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.930
 so I'll do it by hand but 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.350
 it's still a little simpler if 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.690
 you have a small little clip so 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.300
 actually in function if you want a 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.649
 pompon or two pontoons ie a 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.100
 color of bankruptcy with colors 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.770
 candy 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.380
 you started to put on your little ones 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.810
 rings that you will have previously 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.640
 open where threading them between the two 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.110
 like that so if you have a clamp this 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.880
 will be much faster and then that 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.310
 will do less harm to the fingers and then that 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.560
 will remove - the happy manic that you 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.350
 could have done it because there so much 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.250
 tell you that my dollar polish 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.510
 there is nothing in thirty seconds 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.680
 I will have pretty shoes all so 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.230
 this is just to show you what 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.900
 I already did you close better than 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.810
 that's the little rings and at the end you 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.910
 find with these 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.950
 and if you put that a game of pong 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.410
 give up face to simply 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.910
 and so these little seconds why we 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.310
 did them like that they were raising for 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.850
 hang them on our shoe this 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.910
 way so this is the funny part 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:06.560
 where you are going to bring your 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:10.890
 needles take a little bit of thread 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:16.110
 do 1 1 at the end so I'm going to close 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:21.240
 their mouths and there we go tar put 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.770
 your little pompons so there the goal 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.020
 it is to make them a bit outdated as 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.270
 I'm doing so, then and below 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.530
 we start from below what you 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.250
 did your best so that's okay 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.250
 stay stuck 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:42.790
 to partly force once 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.440
 it's done you cut, I advise you 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.220
 to take different pills at 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.959
 every time we go we're going to sew at three 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.700
 many places first place there 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.060
 to fix then in the middle 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.170
 and then gold at the end like that hop you 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.760
 are sure that it does not move if they 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.170
 really wanted to be sure many more 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.800
 places but as it is a little 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.520
 difficult 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:09.489
 I chose a little ease ever and 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:18.970
 this is the first 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:22.230
 laniel makes the shot and I think that 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.230
 which can be pretty good 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.100
 so once you have finished your 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.080
 behind we will continue in a strong one 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.680
 little bit there and we'll end up 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.680
 small wools 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.220
 once it's done you go to 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.110
 the other side 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.200
 so if you have one end his competition 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.760
 very little more than today 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.250
 that once you have cuts and all 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.770
 the little ones who backs them and was of a 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.650
 any other pedigree for fond on go 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.600
 pass the decoration of the princes and go 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.360
 how are we going to trigger small 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.730
 straps simply with his 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.830
 little things so on all the 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.590
 pieces online or even to drugs and 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.750
 in Paris we could easily and with 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.120
 the rest of our pumps we will cut into 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.830
 concept pot for placement and not 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.840
 of particular place to the fact really 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.730
 randomly it will be more beautiful 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.790
 do not want that there is a side too 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.650
 perfect finally I do not want to hold 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.030
 maybe to the floor after it's up to you 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.770
 to see if you have shown any 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.040
 more structured thing was doing everything to 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.040
 does the right 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:47.650
 as we have a little bit of Thursday 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:52.690
 is rather simple cut out small 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:55.240
 sweets and the two girls who exceeds 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.690
 they are these turnovers passing a wire 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.490
 of time I did for that one 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.010
 unlike previously how 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.870
 I put on my account and I will pass 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.870
 directly by the long illness 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.380
 that's okay once it's 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.960
 finished 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.940
 many more colors you can the 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.130
 wear with a little white dress or 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.640
 with denim for example it will be very 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.620
 well 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.890
 so if for so much will compensate know 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.420
 not even how everything is so beautiful if 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.130
 you have not and colors the happy game 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.080
 do not hesitate to do with two colors 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.150
 if you have others block especially 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.050
 do not hesitate if you have a meter more 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.550
 far not really like you want 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.800
 I think it can be very nice 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.350
 for the summer here I hope it will 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.350
 find him me quickly for others 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.270

 find me on instagram for 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:52.380
