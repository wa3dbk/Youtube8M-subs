00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.420 

replayability<00:02:43.360> it's<00:02:44.360> pretty<00:02:44.630> pretty<00:02:45.050> long

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
replayability it's pretty pretty long

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.930 
replayability it's pretty pretty long
long<00:02:46.430> buff<00:02:46.790> like<00:02:47.030> it's<00:02:47.330> like<00:02:48.100> really<00:02:49.100> long<00:02:49.310> so

long buff like it's like really long so

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.240 
long buff like it's like really long so
i<00:02:49.970> mean<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.630> could<00:02:50.780> be<00:02:50.959> played

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.180 

but<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:56.110> know<00:02:56.260> it's<00:02:56.440> gonna<00:02:56.530> be<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.860> exactly

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
but you know it's gonna be the exactly

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.060 
but you know it's gonna be the exactly
the<00:02:57.310> same<00:02:57.580> cuz<00:02:57.820> it's<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.030> book<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:59.530> i<00:02:59.830> guess

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
the same cuz it's the book so i guess

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.760 
the same cuz it's the book so i guess
i'll<00:03:00.250> give<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.460> a<00:03:00.610> 10<00:03:01.300> and<00:03:03.600> multiplayer<00:03:04.770> you
