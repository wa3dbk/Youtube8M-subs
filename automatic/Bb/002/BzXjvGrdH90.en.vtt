00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.340
 hello good to all physical mantis people 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.160
 I am going to explain to you today I am going to talk to you 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.650
 about the origin of zombies this at 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.560
 what we call stinkers are my 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.600
 subtractors these thin ones do not go there 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.910
 There have always been many people as you 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.239
 it has been thought good where they came from 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.640
 these roads and what was their origin 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.070
 Well, that's what we 're going to talk about 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.989
 today although you already know that the map of Kim 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.600
 oberto you have the first map that came out in 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.840
 whites 1 does not mean that in order 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.649
 that is correct when I and you 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.980
 I spoke a while ago about the order 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:59.960
 of the two maps of ekin oberto had of 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.180
 five I already told you that the eclipse was 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.180
 very important in the order of about what 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.300
 what is the story of zombies the eclipse 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.280
 it was very important when in kino 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.649
 virtues we were out there in the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.750
 patio and we saw the puddles of water 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:19.310
 we realized that that storm that 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.630
 there was and that eclipse had already passed the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:28.100
 Eclipse had already concluded 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.960
 so I said that first in the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.900
 chronological order first was five 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:39.050
 because if you remember when the 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.120
 presidents talking said Kennedy the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.760
 time does not stop and those who look at 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.680
 past will be lost to the future 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.170
 and then the storm was heard 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.100
 the arena could hear the thunder 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.070
 lightning and thunder and then it was in 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.619
 the key moment that was in that very 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.110
 moment was when when down at the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.210
 laboratories because everything was happening 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.780
 And then, the 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.200
 zombies then 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.709
 knowing that because I said that was the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.190
 start and then came in the order 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.620
 chronological came here not from the totem 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:23.080
 since it was already the moment after 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.590
 have happened that then 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.130
 the zombies these jazz does not go like 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.860
 I know that as I know that in another video 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.720
 that had already been experimenting here 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.240
 in face down with the gas or not going then 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.310
 of course that means yes 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.150
 they were experimenting with gas not 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.730
 goes here in five those those zombies 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.090
 stinky those men those crawlers 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.160
 those zombies came from here because 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.530
 they were experiencing who five 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.060
 that's why when we started 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.550
 up here that's why he wanted 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.550
 start here the video at the start here 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.770
 these zombies do not leave us why because 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.750
 up here they were not in their zombies 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.580
 they were down where they were 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.980
 experimenting with them and until not 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.620
 we activate the current they can not 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.720
 access here can not go up until 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.780
 until we do not have the current 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.390
 activated then we got off down and 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.520
 here already if you could leave because 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.350
 its origin was from here of these 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.200
 laboratories here were 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.810
 experimenting with them and that's why their 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.360
 origin is from here then though 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.090
 we are in that not of the totem and 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.879
 in king over totten 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.280
 and those zombies come out their origin is from here 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.989
 and that's why they were here 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.450
 experimenting with the gun noval and what 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.140
 we see here 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.599
 we peek here and here you see the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.330
 can you gas novas then here 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.550
 they were experimenting with those 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.470
 zombies that in an origin because you already know 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.780
 they have pants 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.230
 so if you wear pants these 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.090
 zombies were human before they were 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.940
 humans but by experimenting with them 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.709
 they suffered mutations and 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.170
 they turned into what zombies are 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.120
 these disgusting aspects of gun nova and 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.479
 that's why they explode and salt comes out of the gas 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.959
 novak and not then what relationship does 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:24.650
 this with the total ratio campaign 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.360
 because here they experimented with them 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.479
 and the gas does not go because you already know that 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.200
 comes from the history of the campaign 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.510
 then total relationship with the campaign 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.700
 I wanted to say it because it was important not to 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.250
 just to know a little more of these 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.410
 zombies and their origin but for knowing 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.290
 also a little more than what is the 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.970
 chronological order of the maps then 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.880
 people, I hope you liked it 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.240
 a greeting we already know how are the origin 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.860
 of these stinky zombies give you like 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.860
