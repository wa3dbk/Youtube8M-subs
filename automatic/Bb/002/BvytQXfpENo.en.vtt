what has school given to you I used to

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.220 
what has school given to you I used to
work<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.949> school<00:00:29.070> for<00:00:29.460> two<00:00:29.699> years<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.330> it

work in a school for two years and it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.229 
work in a school for two years and it
just<00:00:31.349> made<00:00:31.590> me<00:00:31.830> open<00:00:32.250> my<00:00:32.399> eyes<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> see

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
just made me open my eyes just to see

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.280 
just made me open my eyes just to see
how<00:00:34.880> education<00:00:35.880> really<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:39.290> limiting

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
how education really is limiting

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.080 
how education really is limiting
humanity<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.460> big<00:00:41.640> way

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
humanity in a big way

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.940 
humanity in a big way
the<00:00:42.180> present-day<00:00:42.719> educational<00:00:43.410> system<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the present-day educational system and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.639 
the present-day educational system and
when<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.879> talk<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> root<00:00:45.539> word<00:00:45.780> education

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
when we talk of the root word education

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.819 
when we talk of the root word education
of<00:00:47.399> Education<00:00:48.120> which<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.960> Jakari<00:00:49.350> from<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
of Education which is a Jakari from the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.299 
of Education which is a Jakari from the
Latin<00:00:50.129> which<00:00:50.340> means<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.760> bring<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:52.309> I

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
Latin which means to bring out and I

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.639 
Latin which means to bring out and I
feel<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.940> being<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.870> school<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.320> realized

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
feel and being in that school I realized

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.450 
feel and being in that school I realized
that<00:00:56.180> instead<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.239> bringing<00:00:57.510> out<00:00:58.039> the<00:00:59.039> talents

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
that instead of bringing out the talents

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.240 
that instead of bringing out the talents
of<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> children<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:01.079> were<00:01:01.140> putting<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
of the children they were putting in and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.149 
of the children they were putting in and
really<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.210> truly<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.780> more<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.199> an

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
really and truly it was more of an

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.910 
really and truly it was more of an
indoctrination<00:01:05.540> Center<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.590> I'm<00:01:07.710> just

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
indoctrination Center and I'm just

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.590 
indoctrination Center and I'm just
realizing<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:10.490> school<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.880> its<00:01:12.180> truest

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
realizing that school in its truest

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.200 
realizing that school in its truest
sense<00:01:13.460> can<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.909> beautiful<00:01:15.210> thing<00:01:15.540> because

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
sense can be a beautiful thing because

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.649 
sense can be a beautiful thing because
what<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.110> most<00:01:19.620> loved<00:01:19.950> about<00:01:20.159> school<00:01:20.659> was

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
what I most loved about school was

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.850 
what I most loved about school was
meeting<00:01:22.140> other<00:01:22.290> people<00:01:22.530> meeting<00:01:23.250> other

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
meeting other people meeting other

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.340 
meeting other people meeting other
sharing<00:01:25.860> experiences<00:01:26.640> not<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.840> sitting<00:01:28.200> in

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
sharing experiences not just sitting in

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.560 
sharing experiences not just sitting in
the<00:01:28.470> classroom<00:01:29.010> where<00:01:29.250> when<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.909> Sun<00:01:30.119> was<00:01:30.330> hot

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the classroom where when the Sun was hot

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.790 
the classroom where when the Sun was hot
and<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.900> want<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.259> outside<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.740> play

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
and you want to go outside and play

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.640 
and you want to go outside and play
football<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:32.970> essentially<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:34.530> of

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
football but essentially a lot of

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.100 
football but essentially a lot of
parents<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.970> dumped<00:01:36.390> their<00:01:36.509> children<00:01:36.960> in

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
parents just dumped their children in

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.469 
parents just dumped their children in
these<00:01:37.320> schools<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.100> expect<00:01:38.520> them<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.820> have

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
these schools and expect them to have

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.120 
these schools and expect them to have
some<00:01:39.720> kind<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.110> knowledge<00:01:40.350> when<00:01:40.770> they<00:01:40.890> come

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
some kind of knowledge when they come

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.200 
some kind of knowledge when they come
out<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.520> essentially<00:01:43.130> look<00:01:44.130> at<00:01:44.190> you<00:01:44.399> how<00:01:45.149> can

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
out but essentially look at you how can

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.980 
out but essentially look at you how can
they<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:46.500> any<00:01:46.619> different<00:01:47.040> from<00:01:47.130> you

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
they have be any different from you

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.359 
they have be any different from you
because<00:01:48.990> they're<00:01:49.290> receiving<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.860> same<00:01:50.070> kind

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
because they're receiving the same kind

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.580 
because they're receiving the same kind
of<00:01:50.490> programming<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.990> me<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
of programming and for me it's like a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.930 
of programming and for me it's like a
lot<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.860> school<00:01:56.190> a<00:01:56.490> lot<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
lot of the school a lot of the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.719 
lot of the school a lot of the
curriculum<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.860> really<00:01:59.190> about<00:01:59.310> freeing

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
curriculum is not really about freeing

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.850 
curriculum is not really about freeing
humanity<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.450> about<00:02:00.690> keeping<00:02:00.960> humanity<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
humanity is about keeping humanity and

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.510 
humanity is about keeping humanity and
bondage<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.869> oh<00:02:03.869> well<00:02:04.470> don't<00:02:04.800> worry<00:02:05.039> about<00:02:05.190> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
bondage and oh well don't worry about it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.730 
bondage and oh well don't worry about it
well<00:02:05.729> okay<00:02:06.420> who<00:02:06.780> cares<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.289> that's<00:02:07.500> what's

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
well okay who cares and that's what's

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.540 
well okay who cares and that's what's
become<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.369> humanity<00:02:09.000> nobody<00:02:09.420> cares<00:02:09.750> anymore

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
become of humanity nobody cares anymore

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.720 
become of humanity nobody cares anymore
so<00:02:11.550> essentially<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:13.709> cycle<00:02:14.160> continues

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
so essentially the cycle continues

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.280 
so essentially the cycle continues
because<00:02:14.970> it's<00:02:15.239> never<00:02:15.420> ending<00:02:15.660> there<00:02:16.019> is<00:02:16.110> no

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
because it's never ending there is no

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.140 
because it's never ending there is no
beginning<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.860> there's<00:02:17.069> no<00:02:17.280> end<00:02:17.489> everything

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
beginning and there's no end everything

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.130 
beginning and there's no end everything
can<00:02:18.540> repeat<00:02:18.900> itself<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:21.060> cycle<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:22.019> in

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
can repeat itself in this cycle just in

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.690 
can repeat itself in this cycle just in
a<00:02:22.200> different<00:02:22.380> way<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.040> for<00:02:23.700> me<00:02:23.850> in<00:02:24.840> my<00:02:25.079> mind

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
a different way and for me in my mind

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.979 
a different way and for me in my mind
education<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:26.820> his<00:02:26.940> truest<00:02:27.329> sense<00:02:27.540> should<00:02:27.840> be

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
education in his truest sense should be

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.800 
education in his truest sense should be
bringing<00:02:28.290> out<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.920> gifts<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.660> someone<00:02:30.660> it

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
bringing out the gifts of someone it

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.940 
bringing out the gifts of someone it
should<00:02:30.959> just<00:02:31.110> be<00:02:31.200> we<00:02:32.130> should<00:02:32.340> be<00:02:33.950> facilitating

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
should just be we should be facilitating

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.800 
should just be we should be facilitating
children<00:02:35.370> because<00:02:35.640> children<00:02:35.670> who<00:02:36.329> are<00:02:36.540> in

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
children because children who are in

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.550 
children because children who are in
this<00:02:37.049> dimensions<00:02:37.769> also<00:02:37.980> teach<00:02:38.400> us<00:02:39.560> because

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
this dimensions also teach us because

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.840 
this dimensions also teach us because
they<00:02:40.799> say<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:42.269> older<00:02:42.660> someone<00:02:43.049> becomes

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
they say that the older someone becomes

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.120 
they say that the older someone becomes
the<00:02:44.850> more<00:02:45.060> they<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:46.079> more<00:02:46.320> they<00:02:46.500> descend<00:02:46.920> into

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
the more they the more they descend into

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.890 
the more they the more they descend into
matter<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:48.450> more<00:02:48.660> they<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.850> vibration<00:02:51.540> slows

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
matter the more they the vibration slows

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.560 
matter the more they the vibration slows
down<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.680> as<00:02:53.340> children<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.880> vibration<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.540> so

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
down and as children the vibration is so

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.110 
down and as children the vibration is so
high<00:02:54.870> that's<00:02:55.079> why<00:02:55.260> they're<00:02:55.470> moving<00:02:55.910> about<00:02:56.910> all

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
high that's why they're moving about all

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.170 
high that's why they're moving about all
over<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> place<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.549> they<00:02:59.549> don't<00:02:59.670> have<00:02:59.970> so

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
over the place and they don't have so

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.660 
over the place and they don't have so
much<00:03:00.360> nonsense<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:01.079> their<00:03:01.230> minds<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.799> for<00:03:02.549> me

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
much nonsense in their minds and for me

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.130 
much nonsense in their minds and for me
that's<00:03:02.880> what<00:03:03.060> it's<00:03:03.209> all<00:03:03.329> about<00:03:03.359> to<00:03:03.840> realize

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
that's what it's all about to realize

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.650 
that's what it's all about to realize
that<00:03:04.440> education<00:03:04.730> in<00:03:05.730> its<00:03:05.880> truest<00:03:06.180> sense<00:03:06.390> is

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
that education in its truest sense is

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.110 
that education in its truest sense is
also<00:03:06.959> about<00:03:08.390> letting<00:03:09.390> go<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.870> information

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
also about letting go of information

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.340 
also about letting go of information
forgetting<00:03:12.120> what<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.750> think<00:03:13.049> you<00:03:13.170> know

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
forgetting what you think you know

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.099 
forgetting what you think you know
because<00:03:13.920> we're<00:03:14.370> living<00:03:14.519> in<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:15.150> very

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
because we're living in a very

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.080 
because we're living in a very
mysterious<00:03:16.650> universe<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.640> anybody<00:03:17.850> that

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
mysterious universe and anybody that

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.759 
mysterious universe and anybody that
claims<00:03:18.660> they<00:03:18.870> know<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.230> truth<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.739> a

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
claims they know the truth is a

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.509 
claims they know the truth is a
charlatan<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.609> lying<00:03:21.269> because<00:03:21.840> this<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.519> the

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
charlatan and lying because this is the

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.530 
charlatan and lying because this is the
grand<00:03:23.760> question<00:03:24.329> nobody<00:03:25.109> knows<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:26.540> it's

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
grand question nobody knows and it's

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.619 
grand question nobody knows and it's
this<00:03:27.870> question<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.859> which

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
this question in which

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.160 
this question in which
moves<00:03:30.319> everything<00:03:30.739> around<00:03:31.010> in<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.430> cosmos

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
moves everything around in the cosmos

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.750 
moves everything around in the cosmos
and<00:03:33.909> for<00:03:34.909> me<00:03:35.090> as<00:03:35.469> long<00:03:36.469> as<00:03:36.709> education<00:03:37.609> is

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
and for me as long as education is

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.899 
and for me as long as education is
raising<00:03:38.299> these<00:03:38.420> questions<00:03:38.799> then<00:03:39.799> that<00:03:40.549> that

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
raising these questions then that that

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.849 
raising these questions then that that
will<00:03:41.090> always<00:03:41.269> be<00:03:41.540> beneficial<00:03:42.200> but<00:03:42.499> as<00:03:42.620> long<00:03:42.829> as

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
will always be beneficial but as long as

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.739 
will always be beneficial but as long as
education<00:03:43.579> is<00:03:43.700> saying<00:03:43.909> we<00:03:44.060> have<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.359> answer

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:44.749 
education is saying we have the answer

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:48.720 
education is saying we have the answer
then<00:03:45.739> there's<00:03:46.069> a<00:03:46.129> problem<00:03:46.540> because<00:03:47.620> education

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
then there's a problem because education

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.599 
then there's a problem because education
in<00:03:49.730> its<00:03:50.269> most<00:03:51.040> authentic<00:03:52.040> state<00:03:52.340> should<00:03:52.579> be

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
in its most authentic state should be

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.500 
in its most authentic state should be
setting<00:03:53.030> us<00:03:53.150> free<00:03:54.609> not<00:03:55.609> keeping<00:03:56.209> us<00:03:56.359> in

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
setting us free not keeping us in

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.220 
setting us free not keeping us in
