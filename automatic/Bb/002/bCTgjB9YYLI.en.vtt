our powers and especially in season four

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.350 
our powers and especially in season four
and<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.520> episode<00:01:50.909> think<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.240> had<00:01:51.329> a

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and with this episode think you had a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.819 
and with this episode think you had a
little<00:01:51.659> bit<00:01:51.780> more<00:01:51.899> opportunity<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.470> do<00:01:52.710> that

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
little bit more opportunity to do that

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.130 
little bit more opportunity to do that
especially<00:01:53.009> with<00:01:53.490> Meredith<00:01:53.939> um<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.960> this

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
especially with Meredith um in this

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.190 
especially with Meredith um in this
episode<00:01:55.579> but<00:01:56.579> they<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:57.030> course<00:01:57.060> Lydia<00:01:57.960> gets

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
episode but they of course Lydia gets

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.719 
episode but they of course Lydia gets
answers<00:01:58.619> but<00:01:58.890> that's<00:01:59.009> more<00:01:59.189> because<00:01:59.490> she's<00:01:59.700> a

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
answers but that's more because she's a

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.179 
answers but that's more because she's a
smart<00:02:00.000> person<00:02:00.360> amalia<00:02:01.200> even<00:02:01.590> being<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.799> smarter

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
Explorer powers this was definitely more

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.380 
Explorer powers this was definitely more

of her using our smarts to figure out
her<00:02:23.570> powers<00:02:23.990> and<00:02:24.260> really<00:02:24.380> not<00:02:24.650> um<00:02:24.950> learning

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
her powers and really not um learning

more about our powers or really what
it's<00:02:27.770> like<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.160> see<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:28.700> that<00:02:28.850> was<00:02:28.940> a

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
it's like to see that so that was a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.340 
it's like to see that so that was a
little<00:02:29.150> disappointing<00:02:29.660> because<00:02:29.750> again<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.110> was

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
little disappointing because again I was

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.510 
little disappointing because again I was
really<00:02:30.500> looking<00:02:30.620> forward<00:02:30.800> seeing<00:02:31.250> more<00:02:31.490> of

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
really looking forward seeing more of

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.580 
really looking forward seeing more of
the<00:02:31.700> Lydia's<00:02:32.000> powers<00:02:32.510> but<00:02:32.720> we<00:02:33.260> didn't<00:02:33.470> see

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
the Lydia's powers but we didn't see

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.040 
the Lydia's powers but we didn't see
that<00:02:33.620> here<00:02:34.100> um<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:35.000> like<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.450> whole<00:02:35.570> cross<00:02:35.780> game

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
that here um I like the whole cross game

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.100 
that here um I like the whole cross game
I<00:02:36.080> thought<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.560> was<00:02:36.710> fun<00:02:36.980> um<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:38.930> the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
I thought that was fun um is this the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.600 
I thought that was fun um is this the
best<00:02:39.230> episode<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.620> season<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.130> wouldn't<00:02:40.400> say<00:02:40.550> so

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
best episode of season I wouldn't say so

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.340 
best episode of season I wouldn't say so
again<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.300> does<00:02:41.540> feel<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.780> little<00:02:41.810> filler<00:02:42.140> is

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
again it does feel a little filler is

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.410 
again it does feel a little filler is
she's<00:02:42.500> not<00:02:42.620> like<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:43.100> lot<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.550> chakra<00:02:43.940> moments

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
she's not like a lot of chakra moments

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.780 
she's not like a lot of chakra moments
and<00:02:44.570> not<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.500> lot<00:02:45.680> progression<00:02:46.340> but<00:02:46.520> it<00:02:46.640> was<00:02:46.730> a

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
and not a lot progression but it was a

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.430 
and not a lot progression but it was a
fun<00:02:47.000> episode<00:02:47.480> still<00:02:47.780> again<00:02:48.080> there's<00:02:48.290> some
