cutting the app and click a half a

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.750 
cutting the app and click a half a
cabbage<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:26.319> doesn't<00:02:26.650> say<00:02:26.769> how<00:02:26.920> many<00:02:26.980> celery's

in half everything is going there

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.850 
in half everything is going there
