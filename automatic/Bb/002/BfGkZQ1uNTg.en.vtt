00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
for the Philadelphia charge I wasn't the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.080 
for the Philadelphia charge I wasn't the
starting<00:01:08.070> goalkeeper<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.730> didn't<00:01:08.940> get<00:01:09.030> very

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
starting goalkeeper so I didn't get very

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.110 
starting goalkeeper so I didn't get very
many<00:01:09.330> games<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.900> all<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.230> 2003<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.370> so<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
many games in all of 2003 and so the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.250 
many games in all of 2003 and so the
best<00:01:12.300> thing<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.630> my<00:01:13.310> professional<00:01:15.080> journey<00:01:16.080> I

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
best thing for my professional journey I

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.890 
best thing for my professional journey I
guess<00:01:16.380> was<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.580> make<00:01:17.790> sure<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> find<00:01:18.300> a<00:01:18.450> place<00:01:18.660> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
guess was to make sure I find a place to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.390 
guess was to make sure I find a place to
where<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.050> can<00:01:19.290> play<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.620> games<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.370> time

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
where I can play in games all the time

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
game every week for a whole entire

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.859 
game every week for a whole entire
season<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.760> I<00:01:32.760> needed<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:33.479> my<00:01:33.600> game

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
season and I needed that for my game

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.810 
season and I needed that for my game
decision-making<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.280> my<00:01:35.340> confidence

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
decision-making and for my confidence

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.109 
decision-making and for my confidence
she<00:01:36.330> was<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.020> my<00:01:37.140> best<00:01:37.320> players<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.119> you

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
she was one of my best players and you

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.960 
she was one of my best players and you
really<00:01:39.570> saved<00:01:39.810> us<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.990> lot<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.710> times<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.940> I

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
really saved us a lot of times so I

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.490 
really saved us a lot of times so I
think<00:01:42.750> she<00:01:42.869> was<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> best

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
think she was the best

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.840 
think she was the best
aurélia<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.009> think<00:01:44.280> she<00:01:44.399> was<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.670> best

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
aurélia I think she was the best

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.270 
aurélia I think she was the best
goalkeeper<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:47.090> whole<00:01:48.590> there<00:01:49.590> are<00:01:49.619> times<00:01:50.009> I

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
goalkeeper in whole there are times I

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.889 
goalkeeper in whole there are times I
showed<00:01:50.550> up<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:50.970> wrong<00:01:51.210> field<00:01:51.600> for

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
showed up to the wrong field for

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.770 
showed up to the wrong field for
chaining<00:01:52.910> because<00:01:53.910> you'd<00:01:54.119> find<00:01:54.390> out<00:01:54.540> like

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
chaining because you'd find out like

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.469 
chaining because you'd find out like
that<00:01:55.110> day<00:01:55.380> we're<00:01:55.800> training<00:01:56.100> yeah<00:01:56.460> maybe<00:01:57.180> what

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
that day we're training yeah maybe what

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.450 
that day we're training yeah maybe what
it<00:01:57.600> really<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:58.020> different<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:58.860> we

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
it really was different because we

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.859 
it really was different because we
didn't<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.729> our<00:01:59.880> own<00:02:00.090> field<00:02:00.420> because<00:02:00.750> we

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
didn't have our own field because we

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.150 
didn't have our own field because we
have<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.320> moved<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.800> then<00:02:01.979> everything

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
have just moved in and then everything

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.219 
have just moved in and then everything
so<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:02.940> now<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.300> totally<00:02:03.540> none<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.170> that

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
so but now it's totally none of that

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.870 
so but now it's totally none of that
mattered<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.710> me<00:02:04.890> because<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.340> team<00:02:05.520> was<00:02:05.700> so

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
mattered to me because the team was so

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.270 
mattered to me because the team was so
great<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.569> that<00:02:06.959> was<00:02:07.140> good<00:02:07.410> yeah<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.069> a

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
great and that was good yeah we have a

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.010 
great and that was good yeah we have a
lot<00:02:08.490> of<00:02:08.640> fun<00:02:08.850> together<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.240> their<00:02:09.569> passion
