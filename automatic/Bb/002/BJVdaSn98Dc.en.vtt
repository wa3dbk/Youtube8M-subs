fit<00:01:24.920> on<00:01:25.070> there<00:01:25.190> properly<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:26.330> you<00:01:26.840> just<00:01:26.870> slide

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
fit on there properly so you just slide

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.970 
fit on there properly so you just slide
the<00:01:27.320> phone<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:27.590> there<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:29.440> has<00:01:30.440> a<00:01:30.470> tight<00:01:30.740> fit

there's<00:01:31.280> no<00:01:31.460> wiggling<00:01:31.700> around<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.480> then<00:01:33.200> the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
there's no wiggling around and then the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.740 
there's no wiggling around and then the
top<00:01:34.370> portion<00:01:34.640> of<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:34.940> case<00:01:35.120> here's<00:01:35.420> got<00:01:35.630> these

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
top portion of the case here's got these

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.840 
top portion of the case here's got these
little<00:01:35.900> edges<00:01:36.290> right<00:01:36.410> here<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:37.370> those<00:01:37.610> have<00:01:37.820> to

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
little edges right here so those have to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
little edges right here so those have to
go<00:01:37.970> in<00:01:38.240> there<00:01:38.620> first<00:01:40.180> get<00:01:41.180> them<00:01:41.300> in<00:01:41.390> there<00:01:41.570> and

go in there first get them in there and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.180 
go in there first get them in there and
then<00:01:42.440> just<00:01:42.650> kind<00:01:42.830> of<00:01:42.950> pop<00:01:43.130> down<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.400> back<00:01:43.730> here

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
then just kind of pop down the back here

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.710 
then just kind of pop down the back here
the<00:01:46.190> screw<00:01:46.520> areas<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:48.500> then<00:01:49.460> screw<00:01:49.820> in<00:01:50.000> the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
the screw areas and then screw in the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.300 
the screw areas and then screw in the
case<00:01:50.930> of<00:01:50.960> that<00:01:51.260> way<00:01:51.380> it's<00:01:51.710> not<00:01:51.770> going<00:01:51.890> anywhere

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
case of that way it's not going anywhere

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.590 
case of that way it's not going anywhere
so<00:01:53.680> yeah<00:01:54.680> that's<00:01:54.860> basically<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.510> what<00:01:56.510> the

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600

then a the only thing I'm not too fond

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.819 
then a the only thing I'm not too fond
of<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.799> is<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.250> back<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:26.480> wish<00:02:27.109> it<00:02:27.230> had<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.560> same

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829

like<00:02:28.430> rounded<00:02:28.939> edge<00:02:29.120> as<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.840> front<00:02:30.109> does

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
like rounded edge as the front does

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.539 
like rounded edge as the front does
because<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.769> would<00:02:30.950> make<00:02:31.099> a<00:02:31.129> little<00:02:31.370> more

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549
