00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
through this hole like that and then you

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.779 
through this hole like that and then you
want<00:00:50.269> to<00:00:50.329> spin<00:00:50.809> it<00:00:50.989> around<00:00:51.109> and<00:00:52.719> out<00:00:54.519> okay

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
want to spin it around and out okay

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.549 
want to spin it around and out okay
just<00:00:56.179> like<00:00:56.479> that<00:00:58.299> okay<00:01:00.489> show<00:01:01.489> you<00:01:01.729> that<00:01:01.909> again

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
so through the hole spin it upwards

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.969 
so through the hole spin it upwards
it<00:01:07.969> might<00:01:08.270> get<00:01:08.479> it'll<00:01:09.350> feel<00:01:09.649> like<00:01:09.799> it's

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979
