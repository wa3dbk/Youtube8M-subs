 Good evening today in our country the protagonists have been some works that 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.250
 to detect them we are two satellite images after emphasizing the batteries of 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.670
 visible face of the works 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.040
 some of which is more in the difference between the two channels behind his back 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.580
 especially when they are very thin 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.790
 with these images of canalis red sea therefore networks 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.910
 massa in clouds that is the hair of high clouds that appears over the east of the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.470
 country 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.130
 Serene is very blurred the very sporadic time 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.460
 they have little access treaty on the Balearic archipelago we do not speak 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.350
 It's practically an issue and we lose a little of it if we change the channel 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.450
 at the same time but we can see this event from the west of the country almost 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.110
 disappear those clouds would be as if we had satellite over you 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.120
 us looking with our eyes and we can not see the very thin pressures 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.920
 xxi transparent in cannes or the Balearic archipelago we see that yes 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.180

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.730
 this in this case we have very low clouds are stuck to the ground and the channel 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.830
 infrared the other the dpt difference of temperature instead high clouds and 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.840
