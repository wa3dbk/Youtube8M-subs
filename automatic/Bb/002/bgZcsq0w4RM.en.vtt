00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.259
 I do not know why 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.769
 very good everyone here we started this 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.949
 video that is the trailer of rising the 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:33.579
 first video for my channel I'm a newbie and 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.590
 nothing to bring the clc we have 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.829
 available from April 16 for 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.829
 xbox and a month later we will have it 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.250
 for playstation3 since xbox has 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:48.129
 exclusivity one month before the 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.729
 playstation 3 users here we see the 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:55.989
 maps of the new tlc since they are four 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:58.469
 maps plus a zombie map in this dlc 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.359
 we will not have any weapon like 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.820
 we had in the past that we have done 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.050
 look at the first map is magma is in the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.960
 center of the angels 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:15.070
 and this is a pretty big map with 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.070
 ups and downs with lava in the middle 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.670
 they wanted to crash if they wanted 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.939
 make maps with a little bit of glass that 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.490
 interact ses with the map and the wing 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.689
 Bavarian will progress little by little 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.789
 we will have to be careful with her 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.210
 like this mister then here we have in 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.220
 core which is the smallest map is like 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.079
 if we said an amphitheater and in the video 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.060
 They say that whoever is on stage 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.720
 You will control everything I think 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.049
 that will be the center of all the shots 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.520
 more than anything so I play with 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.200
 PlayStation 3 will have to wait for a 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.840
 little to have it and I'll leave 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.209
 saying that I thought it was good here 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.020
 we have the vertigo map the third the 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:00.549
 third map the third map of this tlc 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.380
 that takes place in india in about 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.600
 skyscraper 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.250
 and it is all up to this map 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.349
 what's good is that you can jump 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.360
 get hooked as we see right now in the 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.390
 video you can jump hook 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.970
 one place to another and you have to have a lot 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.040
 Beware of falling because at that point 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.519
 with a small shot you're going down 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.830
 and the last of the maps is a study that 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.470
 it's a remake of the feeling race that 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.190
 we had already many people in the past 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:33.280
 asked them to do it and have it 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.130
 modified a little bit although basically 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.740
 it's the same we have alien ships 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.940
 to the pirate ship dinosaurs the west 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.560
 everything happens here we also have a 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.830
 medieval castle 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.140
 everything runs around in the middle and fuck 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.110
 how fast to the video here we have what 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.300
 important is the zombies the move of 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.930
 the dead that passes in prison 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.930
 alcatraz 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.099
 they wanted to make a map a tad 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.930
 different something else I do not know how to say it 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.349
 sinister and the truth that they have not 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.349
 got 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.349
 takes place on Alcatraz Island as 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.260
 I already told you if someone wants to read 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.120
 more about her looking for in google is 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.900
 a prison and here we have the four 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.519
 the four characters that have changed 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.220
 not only same as other editions I have 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.620
 to look for the names because I had them 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.260
 out there are four characters 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.360
 different so nothing much you want to 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.730
 play the truth 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.740
 we'll wait for them to go to play 3 that 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.440
 have the xbox may already be playing 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.480
