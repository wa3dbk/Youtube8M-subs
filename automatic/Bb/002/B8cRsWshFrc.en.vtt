have been ironed out one other thing I
wanted<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.229> sort<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.830> mention<00:01:23.159> quickly<00:01:23.340> in

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
wanted to sort of mention quickly in

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.890 
wanted to sort of mention quickly in
this<00:01:23.729> video<00:01:24.030> because<00:01:24.210> I've<00:01:24.420> been<00:01:24.450> getting

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
this video because I've been getting

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
this video because I've been getting
this<00:01:24.990> question<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.619> lot<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> past<00:01:26.670> couple

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
this question a lot in the past couple

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.749 
this question a lot in the past couple
of<00:01:27.090> weeks<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.570> when<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> camera<00:01:29.159> axe<00:01:29.369> going

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
of weeks is when is the camera axe going

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.929 
of weeks is when is the camera axe going
to<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:29.909> back<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.299> stock<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.759> currently<00:01:32.759> I'm

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
to be back in stock and currently I'm

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.640 
to be back in stock and currently I'm
saving<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.420> about<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.720> week<00:01:34.049> but<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.439> that's

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
saving it's about a week but that that's

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.580 
saving it's about a week but that that's
a<00:01:34.829> pretty<00:01:35.009> aggressive<00:01:36.350> timescale<00:01:37.350> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
a pretty aggressive timescale it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.830 
a pretty aggressive timescale it
definitely<00:01:38.220> could<00:01:38.369> turn<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> little

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
definitely could turn out to be a little

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.859 
definitely could turn out to be a little
bit<00:01:39.990> longer<00:01:40.259> than<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.820> problem<00:01:42.750> is

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
bit longer than that the problem is

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.450 
bit longer than that the problem is
basically<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.740> pipeline<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
basically that the pipeline for a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.139 
basically that the pipeline for a
hardware<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.899> get<00:01:46.049> made<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:47.850> know<00:01:47.939> pretty

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
hardware to get made is you know pretty

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.679 
hardware to get made is you know pretty
long<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.200> kind<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.860> ran<00:01:49.979> into<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.060> chinese

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
long and I kind of ran into the chinese

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.819 
the camera or various sensors and we
used<00:03:58.419> it<00:03:58.569> with<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.870> trigger<00:03:59.079> trap<00:03:59.380> mobile

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
used it with the trigger trap mobile

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.420 
used it with the trigger trap mobile
software<00:04:01.109> so<00:04:02.109> those<00:04:02.319> are<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.530> new<00:04:02.980> software

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
software so those are the new software

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.280 
software so those are the new software
menus<00:04:04.209> I'm<00:04:04.389> not<00:04:04.510> going<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.750> go<00:04:04.900> over<00:04:04.930> those

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
menus I'm not going to go over those

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.849 
menus I'm not going to go over those
again<00:04:06.419> also<00:04:07.419> to<00:04:07.480> sort<00:04:07.900> of<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.079> core<00:04:08.410> menus

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
again also to sort of the core menus

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.259 
again also to sort of the core menus
that<00:04:09.040> are<00:04:09.099> installed<00:04:09.730> by<00:04:10.090> default<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:12.269> added

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
that are installed by default I added

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.440 
that are installed by default I added
some<00:04:13.959> new<00:04:14.200> things<00:04:14.680> I'll<00:04:15.010> just<00:04:15.190> mine<00:04:15.910> people<00:04:16.329> of

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
some new things I'll just mine people of

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.550 
some new things I'll just mine people of
those<00:04:16.720> there's<00:04:18.269> in<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.840> valve<00:04:20.139> menu<00:04:20.530> I

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
those there's in the valve menu I

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.130 
those there's in the valve menu I
actually<00:04:20.769> made<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.280> most<00:04:21.519> changes<00:04:22.240> I<00:04:22.450> did<00:04:23.110> a

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
actually made the most changes I did a

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.800 
actually made the most changes I did a
complete<00:04:23.469> rework<00:04:24.039> of<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.340> valve<00:04:24.550> menu<00:04:25.030> to

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
complete rework of the valve menu to

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.750 
complete rework of the valve menu to
make<00:04:26.200> it<00:04:26.409> easier<00:04:27.010> for

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
make it easier for

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.490 
make it easier for
people<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:28.900> navigate<00:04:30.150> basically<00:04:31.150> now<00:04:31.540> as<00:04:31.900> you

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
people to navigate basically now as you

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.590 
people to navigate basically now as you
you<00:04:33.100> picked<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.520> number<00:04:33.880> of<00:04:33.970> valves<00:04:34.180> in<00:04:34.450> this

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
you picked the number of valves in this

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.810 
you picked the number of valves in this
first<00:04:34.870> event<00:04:35.080> menu<00:04:35.650> most<00:04:35.950> people<00:04:36.280> use<00:04:36.520> just

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
first event menu most people use just

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.310 
first event menu most people use just
one<00:04:36.880> but<00:04:37.750> you<00:04:38.050> can<00:04:38.320> use<00:04:39.190> up<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.720> four<00:04:40.720> valves

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
one but you can use up to four valves

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.460 
one but you can use up to four valves
and<00:04:41.500> then<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:42.720> impacts<00:04:43.720> what<00:04:44.020> you'll<00:04:44.200> see<00:04:44.440> on

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
and then that impacts what you'll see on

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.760 
and then that impacts what you'll see on
the<00:04:45.220> next<00:04:45.400> pages<00:04:45.840> basically<00:04:46.840> I<00:04:47.020> remove<00:04:47.590> a

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
the next pages basically I remove a

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.590 
the next pages basically I remove a
bunch<00:04:47.980> of<00:04:48.070> options<00:04:48.280> that<00:04:48.610> you<00:04:48.820> don't<00:04:49.000> need<00:04:49.180> if

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
bunch of options that you don't need if

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.370 
bunch of options that you don't need if
you<00:04:50.110> only<00:04:50.380> select<00:04:50.980> one<00:04:51.070> valve<00:04:51.490> so<00:04:52.360> that<00:04:52.390> people

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
you only select one valve so that people

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.130 
you only select one valve so that people
don't<00:04:53.410> get<00:04:53.740> lost<00:04:54.010> in<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.610> long<00:04:55.570> menuing

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
don't get lost in the long menuing

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.010 
don't get lost in the long menuing
system<00:04:56.970> I<00:04:57.970> also<00:04:58.450> added<00:04:58.900> this<00:05:00.210> flash<00:05:01.210> based<00:05:01.690> on

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
system I also added this flash based on

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.770 
system I also added this flash based on
drop<00:05:02.290> one<00:05:02.710> so<00:05:02.980> basically<00:05:03.430> that's<00:05:03.940> a<00:05:04.180> timing

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
drop one so basically that's a timing

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.560 
drop one so basically that's a timing
option<00:05:05.200> some<00:05:05.530> people<00:05:05.830> prefer<00:05:05.950> this<00:05:06.570> the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
option some people prefer this the

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.510 
option some people prefer this the
default<00:05:07.750> used<00:05:08.200> to<00:05:08.380> be<00:05:08.500> no<00:05:08.740> in<00:05:09.100> fact<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.490> only

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
default used to be no in fact the only

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.450 
default used to be no in fact the only
option<00:05:10.120> used<00:05:10.270> to<00:05:10.420> be<00:05:10.510> no<00:05:10.660> but<00:05:11.500> that's<00:05:12.130> where

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
option used to be no but that's where

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.930 
option used to be no but that's where
the<00:05:12.540> flash<00:05:13.540> delay<00:05:13.990> is<00:05:14.200> based<00:05:14.470> on<00:05:14.820> sort<00:05:15.820> of<00:05:15.880> the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
the flash delay is based on sort of the

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.990 
the flash delay is based on sort of the
last<00:05:16.180> drop<00:05:16.570> but<00:05:17.350> it<00:05:18.340> does<00:05:18.550> make<00:05:18.730> it<00:05:18.910> a<00:05:18.970> bit

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
last drop but it does make it a bit

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.540 
last drop but it does make it a bit
easier<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.690> do<00:05:20.560> some<00:05:20.770> calculations<00:05:21.430> and

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
easier to do some calculations and

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.470 
easier to do some calculations and
figure<00:05:21.760> out<00:05:21.880> when<00:05:22.030> you<00:05:22.120> want<00:05:22.300> things

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
figure out when you want things

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.050 
figure out when you want things
happening<00:05:22.960> if<00:05:23.140> you<00:05:23.320> set<00:05:24.070> this<00:05:24.220> to<00:05:24.400> yes<00:05:24.610> so<00:05:25.030> I

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
happening if you set this to yes so I

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.160 
happening if you set this to yes so I
made<00:05:25.240> that<00:05:25.390> the<00:05:25.570> default<00:05:27.480> also<00:05:28.480> another<00:05:28.720> big

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
made that the default also another big

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.800 
made that the default also another big
addition<00:05:29.440> I<00:05:29.680> did<00:05:29.890> on<00:05:30.190> this<00:05:30.400> version<00:05:31.180> is<00:05:31.420> this

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
addition I did on this version is this

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.400 
addition I did on this version is this
auto<00:05:32.320> calibrate<00:05:33.160> mode<00:05:33.400> so<00:05:33.670> this<00:05:33.820> will<00:05:34.410> take

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
auto calibrate mode so this will take

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.250 
auto calibrate mode so this will take
you<00:05:35.740> through<00:05:36.100> setting<00:05:37.060> up<00:05:37.240> your<00:05:37.420> valve<00:05:37.690> so

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
you through setting up your valve so

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.540 
you through setting up your valve so
that<00:05:38.290> you<00:05:38.650> can<00:05:38.890> get<00:05:39.390> colliding<00:05:40.390> drops<00:05:41.550> without

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
that you can get colliding drops without

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.490 
that you can get colliding drops without
having<00:05:43.300> to<00:05:43.390> do<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:43.660> math<00:05:43.840> yourself<00:05:44.020> it<00:05:44.350> just

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
having to do the math yourself it just

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.060 
having to do the math yourself it just
kind<00:05:44.650> of<00:05:44.710> you<00:05:45.340> hit<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:46.410> select<00:05:47.410> button<00:05:47.800> a<00:05:48.040> few

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
kind of you hit the select button a few

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.860 
kind of you hit the select button a few
times<00:05:48.250> and<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:50.830> in<00:05:51.280> a<00:05:51.970> few<00:05:52.180> minutes<00:05:52.210> will<00:05:52.660> have

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
times and you in a few minutes will have

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.290 
times and you in a few minutes will have
your<00:05:53.170> water<00:05:53.920> droplets<00:05:54.490> colliding<00:05:57.120> here's<00:05:58.120> all

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
your water droplets colliding here's all

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.410 
your water droplets colliding here's all
of<00:05:58.510> the<00:05:58.720> settings<00:05:59.170> for<00:05:59.550> valve<00:06:00.550> one<00:06:00.910> if<00:06:01.150> you<00:06:01.270> had

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
of the settings for valve one if you had

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.570 
of the settings for valve one if you had
more<00:06:01.600> valves<00:06:01.990> enabled<00:06:02.440> you'd<00:06:02.590> see<00:06:02.860> more

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
more valves enabled you'd see more

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.050 
more valves enabled you'd see more
options<00:06:04.300> here<00:06:05.550> another<00:06:06.550> thing<00:06:06.850> I<00:06:06.970> added<00:06:07.390> was

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
options here another thing I added was

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.210 
options here another thing I added was
this<00:06:10.110> use<00:06:11.110> flash<00:06:11.560> one<00:06:12.250> port<00:06:12.670> as<00:06:12.970> you<00:06:13.810> can

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
this use flash one port as you can

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.440 
this use flash one port as you can
select<00:06:15.220> either<00:06:15.370> camera<00:06:15.970> which<00:06:16.150> is<00:06:16.300> the

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
select either camera which is the

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.360 
select either camera which is the
default<00:06:16.600> so<00:06:17.080> that<00:06:17.230> means<00:06:17.440> you<00:06:17.890> want<00:06:18.070> a<00:06:18.130> camera

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
default so that means you want a camera

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.170 
default so that means you want a camera
cable<00:06:18.850> plugged<00:06:19.120> into<00:06:19.330> this<00:06:19.570> port<00:06:20.820> some<00:06:21.820> people

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
cable plugged into this port some people

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.300 
cable plugged into this port some people
don't<00:06:22.990> need<00:06:23.260> it<00:06:23.410> to<00:06:23.530> trigger<00:06:23.770> their<00:06:23.920> camera

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
don't need it to trigger their camera

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.380 
don't need it to trigger their camera
and<00:06:24.400> they<00:06:24.460> just<00:06:24.610> wanted<00:06:24.880> to<00:06:25.000> have<00:06:25.150> another

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
and they just wanted to have another

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.250 
and they just wanted to have another
flash<00:06:25.840> attached<00:06:26.770> so<00:06:27.130> you<00:06:27.190> can<00:06:27.840> turn<00:06:28.840> this<00:06:29.050> to

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
flash attached so you can turn this to

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.440 
flash attached so you can turn this to
flash<00:06:29.560> and<00:06:30.040> then<00:06:30.220> you<00:06:30.820> should<00:06:31.000> have<00:06:31.090> a<00:06:31.120> flash

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
flash and then you should have a flash

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.760 
flash and then you should have a flash
plugged<00:06:31.810> into<00:06:31.990> here<00:06:32.200> and<00:06:32.230> you<00:06:32.380> can<00:06:32.470> have<00:06:32.590> two

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
plugged into here and you can have two

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.100 
plugged into here and you can have two
flashes<00:06:33.310> without<00:06:33.580> having<00:06:34.030> something<00:06:34.930> like

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
flashes without having something like

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.140 
flashes without having something like
the<00:06:36.480> multi<00:06:37.620> flash

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
the multi flash

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.730 
the multi flash
and<00:06:43.230> another<00:06:44.230> thing<00:06:44.350> i<00:06:44.950> added<00:06:45.430> was<00:06:45.910> on<00:06:46.300> the

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
and another thing i added was on the

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.120 
and another thing i added was on the
intervalometer<00:06:47.740> menu<00:06:48.340> now<00:06:49.860> when<00:06:50.860> you

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
intervalometer menu now when you

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.370 
intervalometer menu now when you
activate<00:06:51.970> you<00:06:52.960> can<00:06:53.350> do<00:06:53.530> manual<00:06:54.130> grampians<00:06:54.700> so

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
activate you can do manual grampians so

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.680 
activate you can do manual grampians so
basically<00:06:56.380> this<00:06:56.530> means<00:06:56.770> that<00:06:57.570> branding<00:06:58.570> is

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
basically this means that branding is

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.530 
basically this means that branding is
sort<00:06:58.900> of<00:06:58.930> adjusting<00:06:59.710> the<00:06:59.830> ball<00:07:00.070> value<00:07:00.550> so<00:07:00.880> you

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:01.540 
sort of adjusting the ball value so you

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.720 
sort of adjusting the ball value so you
can<00:07:01.810> actually<00:07:02.110> use<00:07:02.710> the<00:07:02.890> up<00:07:03.040> and<00:07:03.130> down<00:07:03.250> arrows

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730 
can actually use the up and down arrows

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.560 
can actually use the up and down arrows
to<00:07:03.760> change<00:07:04.590> the<00:07:05.590> bulb<00:07:05.920> setting<00:07:06.460> you<00:07:07.210> can<00:07:07.240> see

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
to change the bulb setting you can see

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.320 
to change the bulb setting you can see
it<00:07:07.690> change<00:07:08.110> in<00:07:08.320> there<00:07:08.500> so<00:07:09.430> this<00:07:09.670> is<00:07:09.700> nice<00:07:10.030> if

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330 
it change in there so this is nice if

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.760 
it change in there so this is nice if
you<00:07:10.690> know<00:07:10.780> you're<00:07:10.960> taking<00:07:11.080> pictures<00:07:11.530> of<00:07:11.560> a

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
you know you're taking pictures of a

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.890 
you know you're taking pictures of a
sunset<00:07:12.040> or<00:07:12.280> something<00:07:12.760> and<00:07:13.030> it<00:07:13.480> keeps<00:07:13.720> getting

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
sunset or something and it keeps getting

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.440 
sunset or something and it keeps getting
dimmer<00:07:14.260> and<00:07:14.500> dimmer<00:07:14.670> and<00:07:15.670> you<00:07:16.120> want<00:07:16.330> to

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.450 
dimmer and dimmer and you want to

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.410 
dimmer and dimmer and you want to
increase<00:07:16.840> your<00:07:16.990> bulb<00:07:17.530> duration<00:07:18.250> between<00:07:19.000> each

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:19.420 
increase your bulb duration between each

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.600 
increase your bulb duration between each
photo<00:07:19.720> you<00:07:19.960> can<00:07:20.080> do<00:07:20.200> that<00:07:20.350> manually<00:07:20.740> now<00:07:21.720> and

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610 
photo you can do that manually now and

photo you can do that manually now and
you<00:07:24.610> know<00:07:24.730> other<00:07:25.000> than<00:07:25.210> that<00:07:25.600> I<00:07:25.840> fixed<00:07:26.620> a<00:07:26.950> bunch

of bugs and things but you know that's I

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.340 
of bugs and things but you know that's I

think the major things I added since the

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.300 
think the major things I added since the
five<00:07:33.070> dot<00:07:33.280> three<00:07:33.490> software<00:07:33.940> and<00:07:34.950> of<00:07:35.950> course

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.310

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:40.510 
go to the programming page which I'll

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.770 
go to the programming page which I'll
put<00:07:40.690> a<00:07:40.720> link<00:07:40.930> to<00:07:41.020> in<00:07:41.380> the<00:07:41.980> show<00:07:42.160> notes<00:07:42.630> get<00:07:43.630> the
