00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
will make them a little bit kind of

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.149 
will make them a little bit kind of
denser<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.479> little<00:01:52.810> bit<00:01:52.899> thicker<00:01:53.139> so<00:01:53.469> you<00:01:53.919> have

them and making them darker if that's

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.459 
them and making them darker if that's
what<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.000> have<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.209> do<00:02:10.420> once<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.260> pick<00:02:11.439> the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.469 
what you have to do once you pick the

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:12.869 
what you have to do once you pick the
right<00:02:11.620> product<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.159> all<00:02:12.340> about<00:02:12.370> picking<00:02:12.849> the

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
right product is all about picking the

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:13.400 
right product is all about picking the
right

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
right

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.720 
right
and<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.010> where<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.370> be<00:02:14.460> kind<00:02:14.670> of

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and this is where it can be kind of

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.460 
and this is where it can be kind of
tricky<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.570> basic<00:02:15.870> rule<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.110> thumb<00:02:16.170> would

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
tricky so the basic rule of thumb would

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.900 
tricky so the basic rule of thumb would
be<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.770> right<00:02:16.920> shade<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.490> if<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.820> have

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
be can the right shade is if you have

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.640 
be can the right shade is if you have
really<00:02:18.150> dark<00:02:18.360> hair<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:19.080> want<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.290> go<00:02:19.410> half<00:02:19.620> a

shade<00:02:19.950> lighter<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.270> shade<00:02:21.570> lighter<00:02:21.930> if

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
shade lighter to a shade lighter if

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.200 
shade lighter to a shade lighter if
you've<00:02:22.620> got<00:02:22.740> bleached<00:02:23.040> blond<00:02:23.400> hair<00:02:23.700> bleached

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210
