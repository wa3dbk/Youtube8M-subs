00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.420
 and 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.960
 sandra I say to myself with the object of 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.430
 improve the appearance of your face in 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.560
 especially the area around the 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.030
 eyes what we find is basically 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.239
 an excess of skin on the upper eyelid 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.920
 some fat bags that loomed in 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.290
 the lower eyelid and they give the 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.700
 tired eye or tired eye 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.280
 then one of the main 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.020
 objectives with her is to remove that 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.879
 surplus fat that exists in the 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.160
 lower eyelid to eliminate that 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.510
 feeling and step improve the crease 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.040
 of the upper eyelid what which 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.260
 will give more expressiveness to your look 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.900
 the complementary treatment in the future 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.550
 would be to make a fractional co2 laser that 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.409
 allows us to improve also the 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.790
 physical appearance of the skin in the area 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.409
 around the eyes or also 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.000
 we could extend it to the whole of 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.000
 the load with it we can have a 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.560
 major impact on facial rejuvenation 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.659
 conjugating two very important things in 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.280
 the youth of a face that are a 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.210
 good appearance for your skin and a 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.210
 shocking look 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.590
 ac is a fractional laser that 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.689
 could do perfectly with 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.580
 local anesthetic but in some cases 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.229
 it's like using sedation that 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.870
 depends on the level of tolerance to pain 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.730
 that each person has 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.380
 today we are going to do a procedure 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.540
 complementary rejuvenation 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.270
 facial which is the fractional co2 laser 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.010
 well the procedure consists of 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.050
 use a laser equipment that is 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.820
 that we have here through which we are going 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.890
 to do a series of shots on the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.440
 surface of your skin every shot has 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.680
 an area of ​​plus or minus one centimeter 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.680
 square 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.290
 suppose that this tablet we have 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.600
 here is the thickness of the skin we are going to 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.310
 use this laser to make the drill 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.619
 through a number of points 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.240
 determined in programming in a 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.179
 area of ​​one square centimeter we can 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.650
 schedule to make 25 points 50 points 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.860
 75 points 100 points 150 or up to 200 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.860
 points 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.260
 very well already we concluded the session of 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.790
 laser and we cover that the whole area of ​​the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.900
 surface of the face what we observe 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.090
 immediately it's a bit of 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.069
 redness of the skin and stippling 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.500
 superficial that is achieved appreciate that is 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.019
 the result of laser shots 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.870
 fractionated now what follows is to do 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.900
 a cure we can expose the 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.640
 skin or we can use a healing 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.260
 inclusive that in this case they would be 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.239
 microphone tapes that form as a 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.420
 full face mask on the surface 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.420
 of the skin 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.550
 at that time we are going to prepare one of 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.040
 the most traditional desserts of the 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.860
 French cuisine called creme 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.010
 Brulee has more egg cream sugar 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.230
 of milk a little of whole milk the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.820
 vanilla that can be used from this 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.500
 way or you can use essence of 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.160
 vanilla here we already have serve the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.260
 buds in this case we have six flames 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.240
 in total one chooses one yolk for each 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.760
 diner add them to the pot 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.830
 we mix a spoonful of sugar for 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.970
 each yolk we use a container 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.500
 apart 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.210
 let's put on the cream of milk 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.580
 You can use pure milk cream or 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.820
 can make a fraction of cream 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.980
 milk with whole milk let's open the 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.930
 vanilla leaf because what are we going to 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:53.430
 get are the seeds that are in your 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:54.600
 inside because we already have the milk and the 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.220
 blend with the vanilla at the point 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.470
 perfect it is important that it is hot 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.590
 but not that it comes completely boiled 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.440
 just before the boiling point 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.760
 now mix that we have 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.340
 the yolks along with the sugar go 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.660
 slowly adding the milk with the 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.000
 object that is not going to be cut there 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.070
 that put small portions follow the 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.010
 adding little by little to make the mixture 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:23.150
 until the totality of the 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.400
 combination and the next step is to put 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.320
 this mixture in these containers that 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.080
 we are here prepared to take them to 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.340
 oven for about 25 30 minutes and 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.820
 later we passed them to 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.820
 fridge 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:48.159
 Now let's do the process of 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.470
 caramelize the surface when spinning train 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:52.960
 brühl in then we take some sugar 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.370
 brunette or white sugar if you prefer 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:01.349
 that is not uniformly on the 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.349
 surface of the creme brulee 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.010
 very well so we conclude the preparation 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.410
 of the creme brulee and I enjoyed 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.580
 you cook a little bit that is one of 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.580
 my favorite passions 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.130
 Hello 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.340
 we were while accelerating the 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.700
 process was really short I had been 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.260
 only then three days totally 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.300
 still here we see the detail of what 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.840
 we did on the lower ship to say is 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.150
 quite evident the bags that have 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.250
 extremes bring a talk of the ship that 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.700
 completely divided the contour to 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.600
 all around the crumb 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.770
 basically the frame procedure 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:55.470
 perform eyelid surgery with a 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.180
 target defined much better the customer 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.550
 from its top remove the aspect 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.620
 of tired eye that was what there was more 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.390
 it disturbed him very well let's review 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.210
 how is the healing in all 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:09.060
 sites and remembers the eyes and the scars 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.450
 very tenuous and already feels very soft that 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.020
 she no longer looks tired as she looked before and the 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.880
 scarring is fortunately 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.680
 wonderful fill with or more content 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.040
 there is what is fundamental about the 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.040
 surgery 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.550
 the foot 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.500
 later but will be more expressive 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.440
 remove from indoor sport than 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.850
 fundamentally do I finish everything 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.400
 a tired 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.170
 Bogota very happy I think that the 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.660
 doctor has lent a lot of staff 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.300
 maybe from now as 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.380
 basically the recommendations have 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.090
 what to do with the care of scars 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.860
 excludes always keeping 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.270
 the care of the national outbreaks the 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.720
 final result only what 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.040
 we have from the second month of 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.630
 postoperative 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.510
 and by now it is evident 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.440
 how it ended up being the result 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.080
 after 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.180
 thank you very much is super happy the 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.430
 truth as it does not remember very 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.409
 well as you see the photos as the 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.989
 change is very big that they will look for 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:17.469
 a good professional not to go to 

00:07:13.989 --> 00:07:19.479
 put the economic part but for its 

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:21.429
 health and its integrity in agility 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:22.869
 for everyone and it is very important to have in 

00:07:21.429 --> 00:07:25.659
 account and in general in any surgery 

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:27.380
 facial see together the face of 

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:29.570
 patient 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:33.400
 achieve highlight positive attributes 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.400
 what the person has
