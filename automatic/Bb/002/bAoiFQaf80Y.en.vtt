 immediately from the first chest and it was 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.750
 even good 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.190

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:12.640

 revision here so here it will be 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:44.330
 look good in principle remember and 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:48.830
 not so this kind of helmet of the king can 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.520
 let's say how the king is looking so looks like this 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.520
 arsenal 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:02.959
 here we are such here we are imbued 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.740
 still can be other chests tamiya 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.000
 principle, not all opened 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.780
 so we have such a helmet on the hood 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.209
 honestly no different in either way and 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.140
 either way he didnâ€™t even notice the principle 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.830
 what are you i added this just like 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.560
 put on still 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.950
 Well here's a mask all live, I had 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.730
 in fact , such a cloak 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.390
 a mask that separates the chopstick head 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.910
 cuts well so here i am principle this is not 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.220
 I will wear what I have set the all 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.330
 it seems to me to be a better option 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.770
 team recruited 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:46.770
 so that we can immediately open with you 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.530
 commander find what's the problem here 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.760
 they are the neighbors news 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.490
 think for us open here we need 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.670
 good ghosts and 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.880
 and on the Kuiper mask and on the storm all nonsense 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:07.100
 I want to send them here and suddenly you go 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.100
 but did not expect to open it 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:21.720
 I'm good 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:28.590
 evil mask naklofen such a villain 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.590
 so open buy ether do 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.080
 I will honestly say 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.880
 very lucky but the external tanks 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.100
 you 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.780
 things but what I wanted are two things they 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:53.250
 fell out no much delight us for a year now 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:57.030
 so and so generally not bad and do it 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:00.810
 here and three pieces bottom is generally they do not have 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:04.740
 colors kei curtains two pieces delivering it on 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.840
 the marina will be his day , but you is not the same 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.880
 without it, the back will catch like this 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:17.960
 but it seems to me that everything lives with my stuff 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:22.290
 better this is also a very good thing 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.840
 it changes the weather in our parts can 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:28.650
 be either to rain 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.560
 it is not fair for him to rain 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.620
 but even the gum where it does not rain there they 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.750
 everything else you principle everything if 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.010
 for the first time there described a channel like 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.010
 good luck everyone all bye
