with like idealistic starts but
nevertheless<00:02:54.330> they're<00:02:55.330> not<00:02:55.540> super<00:02:55.870> easy<00:02:56.200> to

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
nevertheless they're not super easy to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.199 
nevertheless they're not super easy to
get<00:02:56.620> either<00:02:56.890> which<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.340> probably<00:02:57.670> contributes

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
get either which is probably contributes

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.910 
get either which is probably contributes
to<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.420> fact<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.690> they're<00:02:58.900> reasonably<00:02:59.260> rare

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.180 

so<00:03:05.920> yeah<00:03:06.100> sixteen<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:07.600> my<00:03:07.720> 17<00:03:08.019> ICBMs<00:03:08.890> will

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
so yeah sixteen of my 17 ICBMs will

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.199 
so yeah sixteen of my 17 ICBMs will
connect<00:03:09.580> on<00:03:10.410> Frederick<00:03:11.700> killing<00:03:12.700> lots<00:03:12.970> and

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
connect on Frederick killing lots and

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.810 
connect on Frederick killing lots and
lots<00:03:13.360> of<00:03:13.450> his<00:03:13.600> team<00:03:13.750> is<00:03:13.930> redlining<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.560> rest

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
lots of his team is redlining the rest

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.370 
lots of his team is redlining the rest
and<00:03:15.820> that<00:03:16.420> should<00:03:16.630> really<00:03:16.900> keep<00:03:17.049> him<00:03:17.230> out<00:03:17.350> of

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
and that should really keep him out of

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.750 
and that should really keep him out of
my<00:03:17.530> hair<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:17.980> don't<00:03:18.160> like<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.459> worry<00:03:18.610> about

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
my hair that I don't like to worry about

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.110 
my hair that I don't like to worry about
Khan<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:20.160> giggle<00:03:21.160> mesh<00:03:21.519> but<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:21.850> killed

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
Khan and giggle mesh but I killed

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:32.009 
Khan and giggle mesh but I killed
Gilgamesh<00:03:22.630> as<00:03:22.780> primary<00:03:23.320> stack<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.720> have<00:03:31.930> to

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
Gilgamesh as primary stack so I have to

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.110 
Gilgamesh as primary stack so I have to
worry<00:03:32.170> only<00:03:32.530> really<00:03:33.250> about<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.730> Mongol

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
worry only really about the Mongol

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.930 
worry only really about the Mongol
remnants<00:03:34.840> from<00:03:35.380> his<00:03:35.799> war<00:03:36.220> with<00:03:36.400> Gilgamesh

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
remnants from his war with Gilgamesh

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.090 
remnants from his war with Gilgamesh
coming<00:03:37.360> up<00:03:37.480> on<00:03:37.630> me<00:03:37.840> which<00:03:38.560> are<00:03:38.739> far<00:03:38.950> less

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
coming up on me which are far less

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.120 
coming up on me which are far less
advanced<00:03:39.459> than<00:03:39.580> yoga<00:03:40.090> matches<00:03:40.360> troops<00:03:41.130> in

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
advanced than yoga matches troops in

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.090 
advanced than yoga matches troops in
Gilgamesh<00:03:42.700> is<00:03:42.850> retaliation<00:03:43.209> with<00:03:43.600> ICBMs

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
Gilgamesh is retaliation with ICBMs

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.940 
Gilgamesh is retaliation with ICBMs
which<00:03:45.100> I'm<00:03:45.850> going<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.299> show<00:03:46.480> before<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:47.290> end

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
which I'm going to show before I end

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.800 
which I'm going to show before I end
this<00:03:48.070> segment<00:03:48.310> by<00:03:48.760> hitting<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.150> turn<00:03:49.390> right

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
this segment by hitting in turn right

00:03:49.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
this segment by hitting in turn right
about<00:03:49.989> now

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.310 

so<00:04:02.830> let's<00:04:03.190> see<00:04:03.340> where<00:04:03.490> the<00:04:03.580> IBM's<00:04:04.200> ICBMs<00:04:05.200> are

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
so let's see where the IBM's ICBMs are

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:14.700 
so let's see where the IBM's ICBMs are
fired<00:04:05.590> oh<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:10.810> hit<00:04:11.170> on<00:04:11.470> me<00:04:12.540> my<00:04:13.540> SD<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:14.230> did<00:04:14.560> not

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
fired oh it hit on me my SD I did not

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:32.810 
fired oh it hit on me my SD I did not
intercept<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:19.170> hope<00:04:20.170> that<00:04:20.530> one<00:04:20.680> did<00:04:26.700> one<00:04:27.700> more

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.430 

yeah<00:04:33.820> he<00:04:34.000> retook<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:34.510> city<00:04:34.750> with<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:34.960> gunship

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
yeah he retook that city with a gunship

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:47.220 
yeah he retook that city with a gunship
and<00:04:35.910> that's<00:04:36.910> fine<00:04:37.300> for<00:04:37.330> this<00:04:37.780> round<00:04:45.840> I'm<00:04:46.840> going

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
and that's fine for this round I'm going

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.250 
and that's fine for this round I'm going
to<00:04:47.320> be<00:04:47.500> retaking<00:04:48.070> cash<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.990> moving<00:04:49.990> into<00:04:50.170> the

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
to be retaking cash and moving into the

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.700 
to be retaking cash and moving into the
Sumerian<00:04:50.710> capital<00:04:50.860> as<00:04:52.020> quickly<00:04:53.020> as<00:04:53.230> possible

Sumerian capital as quickly as possible
before<00:04:54.040> he<00:04:54.130> can<00:04:54.280> generate<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.640> lot<00:04:54.820> more

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
before he can generate a lot more

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.290 
before he can generate a lot more
tactical<00:04:55.570> nukes<00:04:56.340> next<00:04:57.340> time<00:04:57.580> on<00:04:57.610> let's<00:04:58.060> play

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
tactical nukes next time on let's play

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.990 
tactical nukes next time on let's play
civilization<00:04:58.710> 40<00:05:01.950> what's<00:05:02.950> going<00:05:03.190> on<00:05:03.280> here
