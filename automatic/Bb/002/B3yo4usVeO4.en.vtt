 after the concerts I learned to be 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.920
 the bad sometimes I am a bad person but at 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.870
 unless I'm real I did not start writing for 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.270
 fashions critical texts from critics who 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.520
 you know criticize you are the typical guy 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.260

 I do not think I'm going to turn pages 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.340
 you imagine what is given of you is a 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.620
 maximum value without reality 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.540
 it will break you will fall you have to prove it 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.580
 with words not with tears you want 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.920
 compete with the notes that never lose 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.200
 before criticism, think about listening 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.330
 and learn look at the syllables that you shoot 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.430
 these people get the ones and can 5 pay the 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.590
 gram of powerful phrases with what 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.750
 I have enough left over enough food 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.490
 hot and hug me because the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.320
 others are luxuries that I can never pay 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.600
 least I'm poor for losing that 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.670
 -said- for not needing tea 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.500
 dead that without art the day you have 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.540
 leprosy would come back in the clubs for 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.700
 hit me, it stained my hand 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.980
 blood for those people who for keeping 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.530
 the teeth would sell up their mother to 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.420
 some cabbages another auto shit in strength 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.180
 I'm talking about what goes in your ass 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.040
 remember is in my flag the union of 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.080
 the ports but so compact that 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.600
 flights seem a no default 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.920
 you can avoid listening to this solid and 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.960
 to shake 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.330
 tell your friends to stop thinking 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.140
 we have the rap formula 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:21.080
 behind 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:25.090
 the charity is here is no longer the 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.090
 meeting of the sexy 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.040
 do not repeat me fashion pretty rap the 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.290
 that we go back to the days the other time we come 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.330
 strong four loads to work with 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.370
 pal that is hiding why I decided to talk 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.830
 with these three to get this 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.350
 pump without criteria in my mystery be 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.660
 no longer prepared to smile too 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.820
 serious if you're alone, the 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.430
 hemisphere made rhythms will hurt and you 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.740
 you will remove from the middle I am a kind of fog 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.500
 I thought that they do not let you see the horizon 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.290
 until crouching the poison head for your 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.050
 ears many noises confess that here 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.150
 the good returns and you fixing 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.730
 your bedroom because the only dust that 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.040
 they throw this on your desk 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.380
 it sounds not that by default it made a theme 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.000
 how is it mandatory by default 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.600
 new shit that comes to split the 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.550
 neck 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.710
 you try to make yourself normal that nobody 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.990
 I want to look for you you just found 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.940
 the litter come fierce waiting 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.860
 we planted with the insect is in my 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.870
 sector have a sixth me 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.670
 turned into a reactor and reacted by 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.670
 your rap remains in my engines
