00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.410
 boiled and shredded chicken four 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.460
 tablespoons cream cheese cheese 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.430

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.129
 in this opportunity I did in the middle 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:40.519
 liter of milk or half of the other 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.399
 recipe and I got two thick scripts 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.949
 of this diameter have to be 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.429
 bones for this recipe and on the other 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:52.519
 side we have super fast bechamel and 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:54.639
 rich and easy that they will be seeing 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.289
 in the thumbnail we have up here 

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:59.420
 if you want they can press there when 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.459
 finish the video to see the recipe for 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.140
 Bechamel super easy do not miss it 

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:07.900
 we are also going to need a bowl 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:13.000
 to take to the oven let's start 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.540
 putting half of the béchamel in the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.540
 source 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.740
 I, as I have prepared it, is a 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:25.960
 little bit hard but nothing happens because 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.020
 then everything returns to its course 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.670
 now let's put of the 4 tablespoons 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.560
 let's put 2 tablespoons of cheese 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:39.040
 cream together with the villain in 12 and laos 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.030
 the other two are going to reserve 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.240
 very well so far we are seeing now 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.320
 we are going to 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.159
 mix the béchamel with the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.619
 quesito and we will add the little 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.619
 that we already had prepared boiled with 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.479
 salt if you want you can put spices 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.049
 also when the I boil 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.549
 I just put salt on it so it shows 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.290
 the flavor of the mel visa also that is 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.920
 important 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.430
 we are not going to mix the ritual carefully 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.430
 Y 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.600
 this is going to be done as an acre mint 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.400
 good to go forward I already have 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.160
 here armed a few but I'm going to 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.350
 show how easy it is and we grab a 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.450
 spoonful of filling 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.160
 we extend it in the middle so 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.140
 let's put a little bit more so that 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.020
 be little more 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.800
 gender I quote and then what I do is 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.010
 double for inside here and for inside 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.950
 here see like this and now if I start to 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.480
 screw so that the filling does not come out 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.550
 this is very good to do another type 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.350
 of fillings that they carry that are more 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.910
 flojitos this in this case no but there 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.960
 others that are weaker if it comes out 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.620
 all filling by the corners 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.830
 well now let's throw it up to the 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.450
 Bechamel with the cheese covering well 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:12.260
 all this that I do not drop anything a 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.510
 a little hot so well generous this 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.760
 has to be well genre cited today to 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.900
 book because I'm going to do with 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.900
 Plated different 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.260
 let's rest a little bit like that for 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.650
 that afterwards is free do not burn the 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.650
 pancake 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.490
 and so we're going to put the cheese and what 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.680
 let's take the oven to gratinar this 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.150
 It may be done a long time before 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.250
 it is not necessary that you do it in the 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.220
 last moment before serving can 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.770
 prepare and have it ready for when 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.740
 come the generous guests with the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.850
 cheese that this gives a little touch 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.800
 spectacular 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.590
 well, we're going to take it to the oven 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.260
 until it's free I wanted 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.930
 show them a different dish and I 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.160
 I'm going to do in this one, but in 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.110
 actually you have to be in a source 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.970
 appointment to oven for after what 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.130
 let's finish serving we put it to 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.050
 gratin and from there we serve it to the plate 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.620
 of course but I 'm going to make them 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.310
 here we are going to grab a cree what are we going to 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.450
 accommodate 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:22.280
 let's grab a spoonful of stuffing 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.280
 and we are going to put it like this 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:31.139
 let's put as well chin chin dice 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.240
 perfect now we're going to double it for the 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.860
 half half moon and we're going to crush it 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.080
 I will turn the dish so that it 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.470
 see better and we're going to crush it 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.570
 little bit so that the filling is distributed 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.250
 Be careful when folding so you do not 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.350
 break them if they break them 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.570
 No total fire problem to 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.289
 covered with the bechamel that saves us 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.389
 of all this we are going to do so 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.050
 and we will find you the best way to 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.770
 accommodate it later in the dish ok ya 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.770
 this we are going to add the bechamel 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.770
 over 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:13.380
 The more they call me, the better 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:18.510
 Do not burn the packets with the 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:21.720
 You want me to perfect now after 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.790
 this we add the cheese to 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.689
 gratin 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.879
 that is very rich 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.229
 that this the quesito al gratin makes the 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:33.249
 little brown is going to give you that 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:36.709
 special touch apart from the samur 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:39.510
 good and so we take it to the oven until 

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:42.720
 that is free 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.360
 want to finish the guys there this is 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.680
 the result we just pulled out the oven 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.500
 you have a little bit of olive oil 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.540
 because I like it 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.490
 the taste of olive oil when 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.560
 we get something out of the oven like that on the 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.600
 quesito is spectacular now what 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.230
 let's do is place and show them 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.570
 how can they be good 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.460
 We are going to try to place , I will try 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.730
 that I do not break, I'm not going to help 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.680
 with this skimmer is that it's a little 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.230
 complicated to see if we can place it 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:15.420

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.800
 end of the recipe 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:31.449
 you can place how you want to use the 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.639
