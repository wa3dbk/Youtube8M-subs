 Mom, this is a perfect recipe 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.489
 this recipe is also simple because 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.079
 you do not have to use the oven or anything 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.420
 I was going to be delicious, look, I have 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.700
 here three sticks of celery and we're going to 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.360
 cut well finally let's cut it 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.360
 first in strips 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.670
 since they are the strips we are going 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.680
 cutting and now to see the we are going to 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.300
 chop a little more so there are more 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.430
 thin so do not worry if you do not 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.070
 so these are super - chiquitas 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.199
 slices of africa now yes we are going to 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.300
 put on the table the tip of the 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.850
 knife and let's drop the tip 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.430
 from below helping us with the fist of the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.430
 hand for this shape and chopping more 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.530
 finely now yes in pencil are the 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.120
 own chopped super finely and now 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.650
 we go with apples the secret to 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.690
 any pair of apple salads 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.430
 apple is that they use apples from 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.890
 different colors because each color 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.140
 remember that fruits mean that 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.820
 is feeding you differently 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.710
 besides that the apples the flavors 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.840
 they are very different from an apple to 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.729
 another so mix these flavors 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.050
 is what gives the magic touch so that 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.820
 be delicious 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.090
 so we cut our apples and 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.159
 now if we are going to cut them into squares 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.960
 be sure to remove the seeds and 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.789
 sticks of the apple and you're ready 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.859
 our mix and now we go with the 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.740
 sweet part of this recipe I have for 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:55.719
 here half a cup of cottage cheese or cheese 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.850
 ricotta my friends who live in the usa what 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.469
 find as ricotta cheese make sure 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.270
 when they buy it, whoever does not 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.869
 Bring salt if it's not enough to touch 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.420
 I miss and I have half a cup of yogurt 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.099
 natural or you can use yogurt from 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.200
 vanilla I'm going to use yogurt from 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.819
 vanilla that is already sweetened and everything 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.250
 then you do not need more sugar 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.510
 the one that brought the vanilla yogurt like that 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.390
 let's put it in this 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.630
 container 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.030
 and I'm going to add a splash of lemon 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.440
 just a trickle because it's very 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.760
 expensive lemon and let's mix very well 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.740
 remember that the ingredients you can 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.330
 find in the description box for 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.190
 take you directly to our blog 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.860
 and you can print them 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.800
 We are going to add 3 tablespoons of nuts and 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.810
 around here a quarter cup of raisins 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.350
 and now yes in our three twigs of 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.150
 apple and the three small apples we're going 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.330
 to put all this to mix everything very 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.330
 all right 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.230
 mix all the ingredients so that 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.480
 go stirring with that flavor and have 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.040
 careful because cottage cheese and cheese 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.160
 ricotta when they do not come very processed 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.020
 they have you hard like 2 to 3 days so 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.480
 the apple apart is oxidized so I'll 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.310
 I recommend that you make this recipe 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.950
 just when you're going to eat an average 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.130
 hour before eating it, it does not last 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.830
 pretty so much time 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.900
 and here our salad is ready and 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.480
 Now let's place it in a container and 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.430
 ready to serve at any time of 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.770
 day at any event if you have 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.650
 guests if you have a barbecue now 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.450
 to prepare something really rich mom 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.820
 healthy for people who struggle with 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.130
 the sugar this is perfect remember 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.650
 that fruit fructose is always 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.430
 the best option so like oats 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.430
 let's try 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.260
 one 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.900
 it has to be in a house it is not 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.340
 delicious as you can see the recipe 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.990
 original wears cream and you do not need 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.180
 cream but the absolute yogurt the one 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.040
 much more delicious taste and also with 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.720
