in<00:02:03.520> towards<00:02:03.820> your<00:02:03.940> movement<00:02:04.330> and<00:02:04.510> your

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600

in towards your movement and your
movement<00:02:05.080> quality<00:02:05.290> and<00:02:05.830> I<00:02:06.159> definitely<00:02:06.369> for

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
movement quality and I definitely for

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.240 
movement quality and I definitely for
the<00:02:06.850> first<00:02:07.150> time<00:02:07.450> saw<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.259> relaxing<00:02:09.069> and

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
the first time saw you relaxing and

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.670 
the first time saw you relaxing and
trusting<00:02:09.880> your<00:02:10.209> natural<00:02:10.750> sexiness<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.530> I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
trusting your natural sexiness and I

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.320 
trusting your natural sexiness and I
think<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.130> came<00:02:12.280> out<00:02:12.340> in<00:02:12.670> moments<00:02:12.880> and

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
think that it came out in moments and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.960 
think that it came out in moments and
your<00:02:13.480> head

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.300 

but<00:02:18.690> still<00:02:18.990> there's<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:19.830> something<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.100> I

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
but still there's just something that I

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.190 
but still there's just something that I
think<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.640> goes<00:02:20.790> against<00:02:21.330> your<00:02:21.390> natural<00:02:21.750> like

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
think it goes against your natural like

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.830 
think it goes against your natural like
feisty<00:02:22.500> itch<00:02:22.860> which<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.190> love<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.760> respect<00:02:23.840> but

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
feisty itch which I love and respect but

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.810 
feisty itch which I love and respect but
what<00:02:25.350> happens<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.740> sometimes<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.190> force<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
what happens is sometimes you force the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.420 
what happens is sometimes you force the
move<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.690> much<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.650> just<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:29.190> still

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
move so much that it just it still

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.280 
move so much that it just it still
distorts<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.030> oh<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.540> was<00:02:30.660> only<00:02:30.900> more<00:02:31.260> so

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290
