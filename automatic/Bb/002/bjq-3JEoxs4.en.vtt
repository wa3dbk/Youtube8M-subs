is<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.270> good<00:04:34.300> I<00:04:36.090> really<00:04:37.090> like<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.449> void<00:04:37.599> cooler

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
is so good I really like the void cooler

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.779 
is so good I really like the void cooler
I<00:04:38.169> mean<00:04:38.470> obviously<00:04:38.770> they<00:04:38.919> setting<00:04:39.250> it<00:04:39.340> up<00:04:39.460> in

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
I mean obviously they setting it up in

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.029 
I mean obviously they setting it up in
such<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.030> way<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.330> it's<00:04:40.660> much<00:04:41.229> more<00:04:41.410> fun<00:04:41.470> and

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
such a way that it's much more fun and

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.930 
such a way that it's much more fun and
overall<00:04:42.819> just<00:04:42.849> a<00:04:43.090> better<00:04:43.300> card<00:04:43.830> but<00:04:44.940> because

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
overall just a better card but because

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.140 
overall just a better card but because
it<00:04:46.060> wouldn't<00:04:46.270> usually<00:04:46.360> work<00:04:46.690> this<00:04:47.139> well<00:04:48.120> for<00:04:49.120> a

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
it wouldn't usually work this well for a

00:04:49.150 --> 00:05:06.780 
it wouldn't usually work this well for a
while<00:04:51.870> hmm

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.270 

and<00:05:07.420> have<00:05:07.690> lethal<00:05:10.080> let's<00:05:11.080> put<00:05:11.260> the<00:05:11.380> taunter

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
and have lethal let's put the taunter

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:21.350 
and have lethal let's put the taunter
out<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:19.060> void<00:05:19.210> quad<00:05:19.510> I<00:05:19.660> think<00:05:19.840> that's<00:05:19.990> it

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
out and the void quad I think that's it

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.239 
out and the void quad I think that's it
just<00:05:22.360> go<00:05:22.480> with<00:05:22.630> that<00:05:22.660> it's<00:05:22.990> fine<00:05:23.230> it's<00:05:24.160> okay
