00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
I should just deep condition it but I

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.569 
I should just deep condition it but I
stay<00:03:12.169> in<00:03:12.319> the<00:03:12.469> back<00:03:12.500> just<00:03:12.919> to<00:03:13.010> see<00:03:13.040> how<00:03:13.400> it

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
stay in the back just to see how it

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
this looks but now it maybe if I just um

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.569 
this looks but now it maybe if I just um
deep<00:03:41.180> condition<00:03:41.599> my<00:03:41.629> hair<00:03:41.870> then<00:03:42.769> it<00:03:43.220> will<00:03:43.430> go

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579

deep condition my hair then it will go
back<00:03:43.849> but<00:03:44.389> for<00:03:44.629> now<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:45.109> is<00:03:45.319> like<00:03:45.470> really

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
back but for now this is like really

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.789
