believes to be the images for the lego

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.849 
believes to be the images for the lego
star<00:00:16.199> wars<00:00:16.230> sets<00:00:16.740> for<00:00:17.670> 2014<00:00:18.390> i<00:00:18.859> personally

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
star wars sets for 2014 i personally

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.980 
star wars sets for 2014 i personally
haven't<00:00:20.279> seen<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.939> images<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.600> new<00:00:21.750> set

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
haven't seen the images for the new set

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.900 
haven't seen the images for the new set
so<00:00:22.230> i<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.470> only<00:00:22.560> speculate<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.400> these<00:00:23.730> are

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
so i can only speculate that these are

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.870 
so i can only speculate that these are
real<00:00:24.289> however<00:00:25.289> these<00:00:25.590> could<00:00:25.890> be<00:00:26.039> fake<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:26.640> i

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
real however these could be fake but i

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.480 
real however these could be fake but i
truly<00:00:27.240> think<00:00:27.539> these<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> real<00:00:28.230> images<00:00:28.769> so

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
truly think these are the real images so

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.120 
truly think these are the real images so
