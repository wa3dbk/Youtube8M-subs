these<00:00:03.090> this<00:00:03.689> is<00:00:03.870> my<00:00:04.020> review<00:00:04.560> of<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:05.190> best

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
these this is my review of the best

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.340 
these this is my review of the best
generative<00:00:05.940> all<00:00:06.060> weapons<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.629> borderlands<00:00:07.080> 2

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
generative all weapons in borderlands 2

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.879 
generative all weapons in borderlands 2
now<00:00:08.099> these<00:00:08.400> weapons<00:00:09.150> are<00:00:09.330> not<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:10.019> uniques<00:00:10.620> or

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
now these weapons are not the uniques or

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.410 
now these weapons are not the uniques or
the<00:00:11.010> legendaries<00:00:11.610> they're<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.969> very<00:00:12.090> vers

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
the legendaries they're the very vers

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.820 
the legendaries they're the very vers
the<00:00:12.660> purple<00:00:12.990> weapons<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:13.530> can<00:00:13.650> be<00:00:13.799> generated

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
the purple weapons that can be generated

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.919 
the purple weapons that can be generated
randomly<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.790> game<00:00:14.969> because<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.570> find<00:00:15.780> them

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
randomly in the game because I find them

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.840 
randomly in the game because I find them
to<00:00:16.049> me<00:00:16.199> more<00:00:16.590> rewarding<00:00:17.190> when<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.369> find<00:00:17.699> them

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
to me more rewarding when you find them

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.849 
to me more rewarding when you find them
because<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.330> actually<00:00:18.510> go<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.900> get<00:00:19.199> them<00:00:20.810> now

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
because you actually go and get them now

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.019 
because you actually go and get them now
these<00:00:22.859> weapons<00:00:23.640> may<00:00:23.910> not<00:00:24.090> be<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.840> best<00:00:26.029> like

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
these weapons may not be the best like

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.019 
these weapons may not be the best like
damage<00:00:27.660> or<00:00:27.930> accuracy<00:00:28.410> or<00:00:28.560> fire<00:00:29.039> rate<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:29.849> all

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
damage or accuracy or fire rate but all

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.849 
damage or accuracy or fire rate but all
around<00:00:30.300> combining<00:00:30.900> all<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> stats<00:00:31.380> they<00:00:31.679> are

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
around combining all the stats they are

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.220 
around combining all the stats they are

this<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:37.980> review<00:00:38.160> i'm<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.700> be

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
this in this review i'm going to be

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.610 
this in this review i'm going to be
looking<00:00:39.000> at<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.390> shotgun<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.079> found<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
looking at the shotgun that I found and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.840 
looking at the shotgun that I found and
produced<00:00:42.920> now<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.579> manufacturer<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
produced now the manufacturer like the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.380 
produced now the manufacturer like the
SMG<00:00:47.850> does<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.329> matter<00:00:49.850> it's<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.180> flavor

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
SMG does not matter it's just a flavor

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.840 
SMG does not matter it's just a flavor
thing<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.170> no<00:00:52.739> matter<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.610> it's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
thing so no matter what you get it's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.279 
thing so no matter what you get it's
just<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.180> be<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.480> little<00:00:54.809> bit<00:00:54.989> different

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
just going to be a little bit different

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.900 
just going to be a little bit different
like<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> Jacobs<00:00:55.829> are<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.760> not

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
like the Jacobs are going to be it's not

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
like the Jacobs are going to be it's not
going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.149> automatic<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.660> going<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.840> be

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
going to be automatic it's going to be

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.139 
going to be automatic it's going to be
as<00:00:58.800> fast<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.520> pull<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> trigger<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
as fast as you can pull the trigger and

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.260 
as fast as you can pull the trigger and
whatnot<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:01.590> reason<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.920> chose<00:01:02.489> Hyperion<00:01:03.120> is

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
whatnot the reason I chose Hyperion is

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.929 
whatnot the reason I chose Hyperion is
because<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.960> negative<00:01:04.320> recoil<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.309> it

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
because of that negative recoil the it

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.730 
because of that negative recoil the it
becomes<00:01:06.360> more<00:01:06.570> accurate<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.470> fire

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
becomes more accurate the more you fire

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.090 
becomes more accurate the more you fire
it<00:01:08.270> now<00:01:09.270> looking<00:01:09.960> at<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.200> now<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.439> might<00:01:10.920> change

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
it now looking at it now I might change

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.130 
it now looking at it now I might change
it<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> something<00:01:11.460> else<00:01:11.729> because<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:13.080> doesn't

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
it to something else because it doesn't

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.010 
it to something else because it doesn't
fire<00:01:13.619> fast<00:01:13.920> enough<00:01:14.220> for<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.150> does<00:01:15.689> not<00:01:15.840> become

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
fire fast enough for and does not become

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.850 
fire fast enough for and does not become
accurate<00:01:16.560> enough<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.860> make<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.100> viable<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:18.030> I

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
accurate enough to make that viable so I

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.890 
accurate enough to make that viable so I
might<00:01:19.860> change<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> Jacobs<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
might change it to Jacobs just because I

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.840 
might change it to Jacobs just because I
think<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.560> gives<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> little<00:01:23.189> bit<00:01:23.400> more<00:01:23.549> crit

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
think it gives it a little bit more crit

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.969 
think it gives it a little bit more crit
like<00:01:24.150> there's<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.450> hidden<00:01:24.720> crit<00:01:25.229> option<00:01:25.710> for

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
like there's a hidden crit option for

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.460 
like there's a hidden crit option for
Jacobs<00:01:26.400> which<00:01:26.700> isn't<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> stats<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.439> I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
Jacobs which isn't in the stats so I

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.679 
Jacobs which isn't in the stats so I
might<00:01:28.770> actually<00:01:28.950> change<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.700> aside

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
might actually change it to that aside

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.760 
might actually change it to that aside
from<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.829> found<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> combination

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
from this I found that the combination

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.179 
from this I found that the combination
of<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> Hyperion<00:01:35.759> grip<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.960> Bandit<00:01:37.829> barrel

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
of the Hyperion grip the Bandit barrel

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.580 
of the Hyperion grip the Bandit barrel
the<00:01:38.880> Hyperion<00:01:39.659> site<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.200> doesn't<00:01:40.500> really

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the Hyperion site it doesn't really

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.440 
the Hyperion site it doesn't really
matter<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.040> site<00:01:41.220> it's<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.579> how<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
matter the site it's just how what the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.139 
matter the site it's just how what the
range<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.810> want<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.549> Hyperion

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
range you want on it is and the Hyperion

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.719 
range you want on it is and the Hyperion
stock<00:01:45.479> combined<00:01:46.079> with<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.710> shotgun<00:01:47.070> shell

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
stock combined with the shotgun shell

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.969 
stock combined with the shotgun shell
accessory<00:01:48.360> which<00:01:48.659> adds<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.170> shit<00:01:49.500> ton<00:01:49.710> more

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
accessory which adds a shit ton more

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.560 
accessory which adds a shit ton more
damage<00:01:50.369> more<00:01:50.579> accuracy<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.420> like

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
damage more accuracy and just like

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.810 
damage more accuracy and just like
another<00:01:51.750> she'll<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.860> ear<00:01:53.009> pellets<00:01:53.490> sorry

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
another she'll like ear pellets sorry

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.929 
another she'll like ear pellets sorry
not<00:01:54.149> she'll<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.799> number<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.250> pelleted

bull<00:02:04.829> weapon<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.820> made<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.360> electric

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
bull weapon now I made it electric

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.719 
bull weapon now I made it electric
because<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.710> my<00:02:07.860> other<00:02:07.979> views<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.670> I

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
because like in my other views that I

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.880 
because like in my other views that I
talked<00:02:09.000> about<00:02:09.289> electricity<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> most

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
talked about electricity is the most

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.960 
talked about electricity is the most
viable

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
viable

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.540 
viable
it<00:02:12.840> does<00:02:13.170> more<00:02:13.410> damage<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.830> shields<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.460> it

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
it does more damage to shields and it

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.350 
it does more damage to shields and it
has<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.000> dot<00:02:15.210> damage<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:16.500> may<00:02:17.070> not<00:02:17.820> do<00:02:18.030> as

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
has that dot damage it may not do as

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.120 
has that dot damage it may not do as
much<00:02:18.510> damage<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.900> flesh<00:02:19.320> as<00:02:19.710> fire<00:02:20.700> does<00:02:21.080> but

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
much damage to flesh as fire does but

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.650 
much damage to flesh as fire does but
you<00:02:23.130> need<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.550> get<00:02:23.640> past<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.030> shield's<00:02:24.420> first

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
you need to get past the shield's first

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.060 
you need to get past the shield's first
and<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.020> may<00:02:25.140> not<00:02:25.260> do<00:02:25.440> as<00:02:25.560> much<00:02:25.710> damage<00:02:25.740> to

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
and it may not do as much damage to

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.710 
and it may not do as much damage to
armor<00:02:26.520> but<00:02:28.130> armor<00:02:29.130> as<00:02:29.340> corrosion<00:02:30.030> does<00:02:30.390> but

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
armor but armor as corrosion does but

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.390 
armor but armor as corrosion does but
corrosion<00:02:31.230> does<00:02:31.380> less<00:02:31.560> damage<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:32.010> shields

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
corrosion does less damage to shields

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.920 
corrosion does less damage to shields
and<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.670> health<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.120> then<00:02:33.210> explosive<00:02:33.720> does

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
and to health and then explosive does

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.600 
and to health and then explosive does
the<00:02:34.170> less<00:02:34.440> damage<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.860> shields<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.490> only

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
the less damage the shields and it only

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.580 
the less damage the shields and it only
has<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:35.940> AoE<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.750> most<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.260> time<00:02:37.410> you're

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
has that AoE and most of the time you're

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.200 
has that AoE and most of the time you're
going<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.740> be<00:02:37.890> doing<00:02:38.040> precision<00:02:38.880> attacks

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
going to be doing precision attacks

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.050 
going to be doing precision attacks
against<00:02:39.690> one<00:02:40.100> opponent<00:02:41.100> one<00:02:41.550> opponent<00:02:41.790> at<00:02:42.000> a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
against one opponent one opponent at a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.780 
against one opponent one opponent at a
time<00:02:42.300> unless<00:02:42.570> you're<00:02:42.720> using<00:02:42.840> launchers<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:44.459> I

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
time unless you're using launchers so I

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.540 
time unless you're using launchers so I
found<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.810> electricity<00:02:46.200> combined<00:02:46.950> with<00:02:47.250> all

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
found that electricity combined with all

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.970 
found that electricity combined with all
of<00:02:47.670> these<00:02:47.820> different<00:02:48.540> pieces<00:02:49.200> produces<00:02:49.830> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
of these different pieces produces the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.500 
of these different pieces produces the
best<00:02:50.010> stats<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.730> all-around<00:02:51.090> weapon<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:54.030> yeah

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
best stats and all-around weapon so yeah

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.020 
best stats and all-around weapon so yeah
I<00:02:54.930> believe<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:56.010> next<00:02:56.280> time<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.459> will<00:02:56.790> be<00:02:56.910> doing

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
I believe that next time I will be doing

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.410 
I believe that next time I will be doing
a<00:02:57.510> review<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.620> sniper<00:02:58.890> rifle<00:02:59.280> so<00:03:00.000> please

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
a review of the sniper rifle so please

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.760 
a review of the sniper rifle so please
stay<00:03:00.600> tuned<00:03:00.810> I've<00:03:01.050> been<00:03:01.200> epsilon<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.890> goodbye
