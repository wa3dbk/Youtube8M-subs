00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.439
 hello all I rockies of the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.389
 welcome this new barbie video 4 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.800
 the opportunities we are going to how to get 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.800
 the achievement another game called well 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.260
 placed basically we avoid is to kill 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.300
 10 enemies 11 4 is the first 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.380
 location where you can find the c4 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.630
 later 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.180
 there's another one where having can be good 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.699
 for others are achieved but they 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.859
 I advise you to do it in difficulty 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.260
 obviously it 's easy since they will have to 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.199
 go armed with the c4 in the hands to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.110
 to be able to kill the enemies is the 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.120
 pacenses 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.969
 a high teaching difficulty they will be 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.190
 muriÃ£ nippes really what they can not 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.660
 get so easy trying to leave 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.309
 follow a lot because if love comes 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.200
 you will understand peat bog begin to kill in 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.120
 the 10 specific enemies that is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.710
 as you would die staten discover and 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.710
 do not let yourself hurt too much 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.490
 This is the second location where 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.160
 to be able to find the c4 in case 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:10.150
 has been finished in mind because when 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.000
 you take the c4 only gives them the 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.710
 possibility of catching 5 then here the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.060
 second does the utilization since there 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.460
 many enemies that can 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.220
 help to complete the achievement of the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.010
 trophy if at that time already reaching 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.870
 final I did not kill the 10 enemies 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.150
 they will have to repeat the mission again 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.040
 since there are no more enemies later 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.790
 which is then I hope you have them 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.479
 liked 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.479
 this option 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.140

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.250
