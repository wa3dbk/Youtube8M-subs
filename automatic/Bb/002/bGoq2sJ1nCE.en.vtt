00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.330
 today we will see your shooters 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.220
 and the functioning of those issues 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.730
 we go there 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.190
 this is a grand piano let's see the 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.790
 pedals the right pedal that already 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.790
 you know all 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.180
 with the right pedal 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.140
 on the grand piano we see how 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.779
 they raise 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.410
 the dampers that are these from here in 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.410
 this case 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.040
 here we can see it better because they are 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.860
 on top of the ropes 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.079
 let's see the pedal and half 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.260
 which is called tonal pedal in this case 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:58.019
 because it does not function as sardines but 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.019
 that keeps the note 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.059
 and does not mix the following 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.059
 instead with the right pear tree 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.110
 all sounds are mixed with hector 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.110
 for we can not touch 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.970
 Y 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.490
 this tone will remain this tone and the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.860
 others will not mix 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.860
 this here that is the left pedal 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.870
 which is the one that made achievements 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.870
 they will sound softer 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.930
 the operation of the left pedal in 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.950
 the grand piano is different as you can 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:48.869
 observe when I squeeze 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.869
 the keyboard slides 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.020
 this pedal is also called a 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.030
 chord and now we'll see why 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.859
 that this is the grand piano inside 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.340
 we see how the ropes are 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:06.359
 horizontally the hammers 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.359
 the dampers 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.989
 and 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.469
 here the hammer hits from below to 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.159
 up because the ropes are on 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.159
 the hammers 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.890
 and now we'll see what the pedal does 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:29.840
 left of a rope 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.500
 As you can see slide the hammers 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.190
 it is called a chord 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.270
 with the expensive piano keys 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.440
 It is composed of three strings 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.150
 and when we press 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.379
 the left pedal 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.379
 the hammers 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.040
 and just hit a string 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.530
 I hope you liked this video 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.550
 they can know birthday cola 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.550
 see you in the next
