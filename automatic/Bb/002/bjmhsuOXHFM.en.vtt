00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.509
 yes hello people i am two wii ds and 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.880
 although it was often asked in comments 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.800
 and also by private message like me 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.269
 get the information as I search for it 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.490
 which search criteria and so on and 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.920
 so on, and we are here on the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.109
 main account I currently have 28,000 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.720
 Coins and the exchange pile is bulging 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.550
 filled with in shape from this week 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.720
 For example , he appears like this 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.920
 free even more often and cisco me 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.160
 Just hope you're off 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.370
 few investments then not so anyway 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.010
 a lot of fifa games come here directly 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.320
 to the search criteria and though gives up 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.750
 every case with the minimum price one 8500 there 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.309
 is also in shape and level 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.559
 gold content will vary if you have to 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.480
 also with the one with the minimum price 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.710
 silver does not vary in shape 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.100
 are worth as much as golden ones 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.230
 Information from the deposit price so with me 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.649
 immediately fix price is here simply spd 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.969
 on 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.469
 Of course you can also limit 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.510
 if you were one hundred thousand you had to go with it 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.100
 You still could have had as budget 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.830
 50,000 is actually relative 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.270
 of course you can still do that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.710
 choose here in any position 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.750
 or a position 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.840
 I do that with us less but 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.500
 I'm just looking for then we look 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.030
 just for example never see 14,500 ok 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.299
 is not offered is still too 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.270
 expensive 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.090
 I usually search only in the form 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.009
 which are already offered 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.340
 or keep the good information to 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.259
 example are looking for which possibly 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.259
 good to act is never partie 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:41.440
 you can fit again 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:44.980
 but it does not matter 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.660
 Of course, you can also said then 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.840
 the formation and positions 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.960
 we are now only times as posing 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.150
 4 1 2 2 1 because 422 is the most popular 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.030
 setting up and there go the players 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.130
 clearly more away than in others 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.630
 formations such as 341 or 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.450
 like this 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.100
 that is relatively clear that I am here 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.240
 are more expensive 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.150
 you have players on every position 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.320
 is busy and yes I am pretty 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.020
 Here is a good example 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.050
 example de guzmán in the zdf relies on the 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.060
 have commanded observation list 13 1150 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.020
 you have to have a little bit of both now 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.220
 Netherlands look where you are down there 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:32.150
 Netherlands z barclays premier league 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.980
 and swansea because he thinks I exist that way 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.260
 the at 28,000 lattice impressed how 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.480
 much how expensive the battery at 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.489
 Let's have a look at Rossmann if he's for 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.180
 It's not 18001, that's you 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.930
 go right back to the 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.530
 Observation list 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.640
 depending on how the player is running and 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.030
 offers on him 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.550
 here it is still 180 customers 20,000 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.489
 this immediately comes for 18,000 bagdad 41 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.400
 22 That's why 14,000 bid is up 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.680
 every case really good profit in it 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.830
 I actually do it evening two 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.870
 Finds somehow calmer in the evening 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.610
 but why can i show mine with it 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.980
 then I have more concentration 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.720
 to trade and look first here 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.650
 maybe there are more de 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.470
 Guzmán the bargains are here 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.540
 was offered to a 15,000 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.910
 outbid here that nothing cheaper 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.560
 18,000 50 go watch 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.010
 you have to stand now at 14 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.740
 1150 and I am now a border I will 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.600
 be 150 to 16,000 that is, go along 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.860
 nevertheless still nearly 2000 coins profit 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.590
 Of course you can do it too 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.970
 vary until how much you go with her 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.410
 also can only go so much with 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.510
 they accounted for only 100 coins win 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.210
 relative does not matter is actually yours 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.970
 thing and looks good for 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.260
 with this de guzmán would actually be 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.630
 in hours, that would be correct 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.560
 good bargain for 14,500 in form im 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.480
 To get 4122 and yes we still have 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.980
 So that's what I call horny 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.930
 show effect here for 14,400 have him 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.870
 now get it and pack it on the 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.880
 market for 18,500 so the nicks 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.960
 cheaper has best in place for 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.790
 twelve hours and over the night 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.190
 so everyone pays them over the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.270
 Most see and then that is 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.520
 probably higher that you 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.010
 be bought 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:25.730
 yes, that's the way it was 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.010
 trading tip may be coming soon 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.960
 Follow a few others and everyone 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.250
 I want to say goodbye says three 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.250
 people until next time
