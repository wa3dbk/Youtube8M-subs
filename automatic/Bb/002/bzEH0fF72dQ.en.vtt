00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.920
 hi everyone today decided to do a 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.029
 video tutorial on how to enlarge a 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.130
 video 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.010
 Let me explain better, there is never an example 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.349
 happened using movie maker or others 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.450
 tar video programs that end up 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.020
 of the conversion the video will check with 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.820
 the two black side bars today I will 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.260
 I will even teach you what I will program 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.260
 use to remove these two 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.970
 fingers when converted with this 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.470
 program at the video the video will become a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.720
 full screen 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.579
 sorry for the repetition anyway 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.160
 now we're going to see how and what 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.750
 let's lose use here we are on 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.879
 desktop of my computer 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.059
 sorry for the mess but the full 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.440
 of music icons and other things anyway 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.440
 now we're going to see what program 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.129
 use the program this is it 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.980
 call to the wings of free video converter 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.780
 I 've already got it here once 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.620
 the program will open this one 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.920
 window us to edit video 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.080
 we should take a video obviously 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.090
 drag from the desktop we put it here 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.939
 we wait for it to load but it is 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.210
 fast at least hopefully mine 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.520
 computer here we did then 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.530
 see here is the video here where there is the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.570
 my little dick there is the video for us 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.500
 remove two black side bars 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.729
 we have to press the edit button 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.020
 another window will open 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.020
 here is the video 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.490
 sorry but in computers today a little 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.940
 lance is doing a lot of things anyway 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.610
 here we see that the video is very small 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.790
 I don't know why that little movie 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.170
 maker made me work anyway 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.560
 this one would be the original video e 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.730
 here how it will become then to us for 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.760
 change it just pull it down and up 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:58.290
 this thing here that highlights it doing 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:02.380
 as you can see the video yes 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.829
 enlarges the screen 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.470
 if we do so if I do 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.940
 leave 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.420
 the water preview will be seen that more 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.420
 big 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.560
 however once we have decided 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.440
 what greatness to give to our video 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.440
 press the button on the ok button 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.720
 here then now once does once 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.620
 avoiding the video, just crush yourself 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.980
 star will leave the program with all 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.010
 below says how many minutes are left 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.500
 he usually shoots a few minutes high 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.640
 he says maybe 20 minutes but they pass 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.489
 just just 5 del problem 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.409
 program anyway once they are 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.040
 spent those five ten minutes on 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:04.760
 video will be converted and will be on screen 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.020
 full or as well we decided 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.910
 however now I don't register all 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.910
 conversion if not the video become be 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.000
 long here we are again almost here 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.950
 finished converting the video we wait 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.330
 here 15 seconds 16 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.489
 anyway and I will put in description 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.629
 download of this program that is 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.629
 totally free 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:36.760
 yes what petit 10 11 already the counter a 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:40.990
 a little bit silly, however, the program is 99 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.700
 give one for 109 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.280
 however when it is finished it comes out 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.510
 this window with the writing that is 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.120
 completed 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.360
 we will click on ok and one will open 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.330
 folder where there is video this is here 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.990
 the final video the converted one 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:02.580
 without two black fingers crush 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.580
 above so let's look at the preview 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.720
 here we are with the converted video 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.540
 here it is as you can see a lot more 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.970
 enlarged I remember that windows media 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.870
 player the bars at the top puts them at 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.850
 will 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.160
 but if one loads the video on youtube 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:27.380
 you see it in full screen or with we 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.950
 decided to enlarge it anyway 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.169
 I'm here in HD quality 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:37.330
 so I also show you what you see 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.330
 good example I send forward here 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.330
 see you see very well 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.550
 however, I also have other qualities 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.449
 the lower ones depend a bit like 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.350
 you want 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.240
 sure that if one does in quality hd weigh 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.310
 more, however, the video will be seen a lot 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.260
 much better 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.760
 I was about to forget that with this 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.330
 program 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:07.110
 if we wish we can only convert the videos 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:09.570
 Here I've got put in mp4 h 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:14.690
 however there are other formats including 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:21.240
 for psp ps3 apple tv iphone ipod 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:25.680
 windowsmobile xbox 360 and xbox 360 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:28.289
 then there is vma or all other formats 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.550
 anyway I hope my video is there 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:34.320
 liked it if you want to put it like it 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.850
 subscribe to the channel share this 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.370

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.229
 do you prefer the next tutorial I don't know 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.760
 what will i do better than this is a 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:45.570
 a bit messy indeed I also had 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.310
 problems with the pc that the pieces it has 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.789
 recorded the video was taken me 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.099
 jumped however I solved it and the 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:56.550
