00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
October I started noticing that I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.810

started<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.780> whole<00:00:52.140> bunch<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.920> network

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
started to get a whole bunch of network

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.209 
started to get a whole bunch of network
timeouts<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.020> didn't<00:00:55.320> think<00:00:55.500> anything<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.039> it

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
timeouts so didn't think anything of it

and I asked all these things I mean and
I've<00:01:45.540> tried<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.500> many<00:01:46.560> things<00:01:46.740> I'll<00:01:47.040> try

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
I've tried so many things I'll try

IP address and the DMZ or demilitarized
zone<00:01:53.430> I've<00:01:54.060> tried<00:01:54.509> replacing<00:01:54.869> my<00:01:55.200> splitter

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
zone I've tried replacing my splitter

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.620 
zone I've tried replacing my splitter
I've<00:01:56.159> tried<00:01:57.710> directly<00:01:58.820> connecting<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.149> tried

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
I've tried directly connecting I tried

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.109 
I've tried directly connecting I tried
what<00:02:00.840> well<00:02:01.049> taking<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.460> connections

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
what well taking all of the connections

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.060 
what well taking all of the connections
for<00:02:03.420> my<00:02:03.570> splitter<00:02:03.899> except<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> one<00:02:04.799> that

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
for my splitter except for the one that

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.730 
for my splitter except for the one that

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
if you are with Comcast I suggest that

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.880 
if you are with Comcast I suggest that
you<00:02:42.920> get<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.519> modem<00:02:44.150> instead<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.410> the

you get the modem instead of the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.850 
you get the modem instead of the
all-in-one<00:02:46.519> routers<00:02:47.209> those<00:02:47.450> routers<00:02:48.049> do<00:02:48.590> not

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
all-in-one routers those routers do not

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.069

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
for friendly fire um but I highly

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.569 
for friendly fire um but I highly
recommend<00:03:10.280> again<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.200> get<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.980> modem

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
recommend again that you get the modem

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.020 
recommend again that you get the modem
with<00:03:14.150> Comcast<00:03:14.510> now<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.980> downside<00:03:16.280> with

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
with Comcast now the downside with

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.900 
with Comcast now the downside with
getting<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.930> modem<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.829> Comcast<00:03:19.069> is<00:03:19.549> that<00:03:19.730> you

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
getting the modem of Comcast is that you

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.530 
getting the modem of Comcast is that you
lose<00:03:20.239> your<00:03:20.630> Wi-Fi<00:03:21.560> connectivity<00:03:22.549> so<00:03:23.030> you

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
lose your Wi-Fi connectivity so you

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.110 
lose your Wi-Fi connectivity so you
would<00:03:23.690> need<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.170> purchase<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.920> router<00:03:25.519> all

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
would need to purchase a router all

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.729 
would need to purchase a router all
right<00:03:26.329> that's<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.660> only<00:03:26.900> downside<00:03:27.139> to<00:03:27.709> it

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
right that's the only downside to it

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.699 
right that's the only downside to it
however<00:03:28.280> if<00:03:28.910> you<00:03:29.420> are<00:03:29.480> ever<00:03:29.930> Matt<00:03:30.350> and<00:03:30.530> fair

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
however if you are ever Matt and fair

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.729 
however if you are ever Matt and fair
like<00:03:30.889> I<00:03:31.100> am<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.639> love<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.780> play<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.959> game<00:03:33.019> then

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
like I am and love to play the game then

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.770 
like I am and love to play the game then
this<00:03:34.370> is<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:35.000> great<00:03:35.299> exchange<00:03:35.540> all<00:03:36.170> right<00:03:36.380> so
