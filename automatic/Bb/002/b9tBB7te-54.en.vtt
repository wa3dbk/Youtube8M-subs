a look at the footage and I have a

when<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.280> cracked<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.940> think<00:02:11.070> it<00:02:12.070> was<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.550> rock

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
when it cracked I think it was a rock

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.640 
when it cracked I think it was a rock
but<00:02:14.290> here<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.720> iPhone<00:02:16.720> 5s<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.440> the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
but here is the iPhone 5s and the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.380 
but here is the iPhone 5s and the
otterbox<00:02:18.100> preserver<00:02:18.160> after<00:02:18.790> we<00:02:18.880> drove<00:02:19.150> over

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
otterbox preserver after we drove over

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
it with a car many many many times I

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.560 
it with a car many many many times I
think<00:02:22.750> we<00:02:22.989> did<00:02:23.170> about<00:02:23.890> six<00:02:23.970> run<00:02:24.970> overs<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:25.450> so

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
think we did about six run overs and so

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.210 
think we did about six run overs and so
I<00:02:25.600> think<00:02:25.720> that's<00:02:25.959> probably<00:02:26.320> five<00:02:26.709> more<00:02:27.040> than

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
I think that's probably five more than

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.470 
I think that's probably five more than
you<00:02:27.310> would<00:02:27.430> usually<00:02:27.640> because<00:02:28.150> by<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.360> time

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
you would usually because by the time

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.880 
you would usually because by the time
you<00:02:28.750> figure<00:02:28.930> out<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.320> your<00:02:29.440> phone's<00:02:29.709> not

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
you figure out that your phone's not

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.470 
you figure out that your phone's not
with<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.280> you've<00:02:30.459> driven<00:02:30.760> over<00:02:31.000> you're<00:02:31.330> not

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
with you you've driven over you're not

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.750 
with you you've driven over you're not
gonna<00:02:31.660> back<00:02:32.110> up<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.560> then<00:02:32.709> drive<00:02:33.459> over<00:02:33.580> it

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
gonna back up and then drive over it

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.340 
gonna back up and then drive over it
again<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:33.970> then<00:02:34.180> back<00:02:34.390> up<00:02:34.420> but<00:02:34.750> then<00:02:34.870> do<00:02:35.230> it

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
again and then back up but then do it

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.449 
again and then back up but then do it
again<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:36.250> as<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.550> can<00:02:36.700> tell<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.690> inside<00:02:38.080> is

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
again so as you can tell the inside is

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.460 
again so as you can tell the inside is
definitely<00:02:39.459> very<00:02:39.489> very<00:02:40.000> crunchy<00:02:40.870> which<00:02:41.170> means

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
definitely very very crunchy which means

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.360 
definitely very very crunchy which means
that's<00:02:41.769> well<00:02:43.019> my<00:02:44.019> screen<00:02:44.320> is<00:02:44.470> definitely

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
that's well my screen is definitely

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.300 
that's well my screen is definitely
broken<00:02:45.640> but<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.330> phone<00:02:46.630> still<00:02:47.049> works

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
broken but the phone still works

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.449 
broken but the phone still works
surprisingly<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.670> I'm<00:02:48.910> very<00:02:49.769> curious<00:02:50.769> I'm<00:02:51.250> a

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
surprisingly so I'm very curious I'm a

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.150 
surprisingly so I'm very curious I'm a
little<00:02:51.730> afraid<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.060> take<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.420> apart<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:54.010> is

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
little afraid to take it apart that is

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.610 
little afraid to take it apart that is
the<00:02:54.400> only<00:02:54.720> damage<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:55.930> see<00:02:57.870> sticker<00:02:58.870> that

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
the only damage that I see sticker that

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.650 
the only damage that I see sticker that
is<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.920> only<00:03:00.100> damage<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.760> really<00:03:01.209> see<00:03:01.510> on

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
is the only damage that I really see on

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.509 
is the only damage that I really see on
this<00:03:01.900> case<00:03:02.230> there<00:03:02.530> isn't<00:03:02.799> really<00:03:03.100> anything

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
this case there isn't really anything

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.910 
this case there isn't really anything
else<00:03:03.910> like<00:03:04.690> it's<00:03:04.870> still<00:03:05.140> together<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.709> didn't

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
else like it's still together it didn't

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.449 
else like it's still together it didn't
come<00:03:06.040> apart<00:03:06.329> so<00:03:07.329> uh<00:03:07.410> let's<00:03:08.820> crack<00:03:09.820> it<00:03:09.970> open<00:03:10.090> and

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
come apart so uh let's crack it open and

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:19.740 
come apart so uh let's crack it open and
see<00:03:12.459> what<00:03:12.610> happens

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.289 

well<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:21.110> looks<00:03:21.290> like<00:03:21.439> there's<00:03:22.120> looks<00:03:23.120> like

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
well it looks like there's looks like

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.880 
well it looks like there's looks like
there's<00:03:23.450> moisture<00:03:24.079> that<00:03:24.170> actually<00:03:24.500> made<00:03:24.709> it

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
there's moisture that actually made it

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.630 
there's moisture that actually made it
into<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.760> case<00:03:26.150> as<00:03:26.569> you<00:03:26.629> can<00:03:26.840> tell<00:03:27.049> that's

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
into the case as you can tell that's

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.860 
into the case as you can tell that's
water<00:03:28.640> on<00:03:28.879> the<00:03:28.970> inside<00:03:29.269> of<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.450> case<00:03:29.629> on

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
water on the inside of the case on

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.410 
water on the inside of the case on
guessing<00:03:30.319> when<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.620> case<00:03:30.890> compressed<00:03:31.579> snow

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
guessing when the case compressed snow

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.089 
guessing when the case compressed snow
actually<00:03:32.629> got<00:03:32.930> into<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.379> so<00:03:33.530> that's<00:03:33.620> actually

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
actually got into it so that's actually

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.330 
actually got into it so that's actually
kind<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.310> good<00:03:34.519> to<00:03:34.670> know<00:03:35.409> there's<00:03:36.409> definitely

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
kind of good to know there's definitely

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:51.490 
kind of good to know there's definitely
glass<00:03:38.060> shards<00:03:39.129> galore<00:03:40.129> no<00:03:40.970> it's<00:03:48.069> well<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:51.200> is

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
glass shards galore no it's well that is

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.170 
glass shards galore no it's well that is
a<00:03:51.769> very<00:03:52.720> cracked<00:03:53.720> screen<00:03:56.019> what<00:03:57.019> I<00:03:57.170> do<00:03:57.379> I<00:03:58.180> was

actually<00:04:55.729> want<00:04:55.909> to<00:04:56.060> touch<00:04:56.389> this<00:04:56.840> part<00:04:57.199> of<00:04:57.409> the

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
actually want to touch this part of the

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.370 
actually want to touch this part of the
phone<00:04:57.740> given<00:04:58.130> that<00:04:58.280> it's<00:04:58.430> glass<00:04:59.030> so<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.110> case

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
phone given that it's glass so the case

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.939 
phone given that it's glass so the case
the<00:05:00.770> screen<00:05:01.039> protector<00:05:01.190> didn't<00:05:02.090> actually

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
the screen protector didn't actually

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.760 
the screen protector didn't actually
break<00:05:03.949> like<00:05:04.220> there<00:05:04.370> is<00:05:04.490> no<00:05:04.669> hole<00:05:05.180> in<00:05:05.770> the

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
break like there is no hole in the

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.800 
break like there is no hole in the
screen<00:05:07.159> protector<00:05:07.280> I'm<00:05:08.270> guessing<00:05:08.690> when<00:05:08.780> I

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
screen protector I'm guessing when I

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.710 
screen protector I'm guessing when I
drove<00:05:09.139> over<00:05:09.380> it<00:05:09.909> going<00:05:10.909> forward<00:05:11.240> when<00:05:11.389> I<00:05:11.419> kind

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
drove over it going forward when I kind

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.719 
drove over it going forward when I kind
of<00:05:11.810> peeled<00:05:12.260> my<00:05:12.409> tires<00:05:12.710> and<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:13.039> wet<00:05:13.190> pavements

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
of peeled my tires and the wet pavements

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.700 
of peeled my tires and the wet pavements
the<00:05:14.270> phone<00:05:14.479> actually<00:05:14.780> got<00:05:14.930> kicked<00:05:15.229> back<00:05:15.470> it

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
the phone actually got kicked back it

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.469 
the phone actually got kicked back it
actually<00:05:15.800> got<00:05:16.070> shot<00:05:16.400> back<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.849> I'm<00:05:16.940> guessing

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
actually got shot back and I'm guessing

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.110 
actually got shot back and I'm guessing
that's<00:05:17.720> when<00:05:18.320> this<00:05:18.789> shattering<00:05:19.789> actually

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
that's when this shattering actually

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.629 
that's when this shattering actually
occurred<00:05:20.570> the<00:05:21.139> pavement<00:05:21.560> isn't<00:05:21.860> flat<00:05:22.159> so<00:05:22.520> it

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
occurred the pavement isn't flat so it

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.279 
occurred the pavement isn't flat so it
wasn't<00:05:22.909> flat<00:05:23.120> concrete<00:05:23.449> I'm<00:05:23.900> guessing<00:05:24.199> that

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
wasn't flat concrete I'm guessing that

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.019 
wasn't flat concrete I'm guessing that
we<00:05:24.409> compressed<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:24.889> case<00:05:25.159> enough<00:05:25.550> that<00:05:25.820> the

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:26.029 
we compressed the case enough that the

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:28.170 
we compressed the case enough that the
touch<00:05:26.240> can<00:05:26.419> actually<00:05:26.690> touched<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.169> ground

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
touch can actually touched the ground

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.350 
touch can actually touched the ground
there's<00:05:29.180> probably<00:05:29.630> a<00:05:29.719> good

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
there's probably a good

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.380 
there's probably a good
you<00:05:31.200> know<00:05:31.730> quarter<00:05:32.730> inch<00:05:32.940> of<00:05:33.120> clearance

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
you know quarter inch of clearance

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.970 
you know quarter inch of clearance
between<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:33.930> ground<00:05:34.140> and<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.650> touchscreen

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
between the ground and the touchscreen

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.710 
between the ground and the touchscreen
with<00:05:35.220> this<00:05:35.370> case<00:05:35.550> I'm<00:05:35.730> guessing<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.210> car<00:05:36.480> the

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
with this case I'm guessing the car the

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.150 
with this case I'm guessing the car the
weight<00:05:36.840> of<00:05:36.960> the<00:05:37.020> car<00:05:37.170> was<00:05:37.290> just<00:05:37.380> too<00:05:37.560> heavy<00:05:37.800> so

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
weight of the car was just too heavy so

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.130 
weight of the car was just too heavy so
again<00:05:38.850> we<00:05:39.090> learned<00:05:39.330> that<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:39.750> OtterBox

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
again we learned that the OtterBox

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.300 
again we learned that the OtterBox
preserver<00:05:40.460> will<00:05:41.460> protect<00:05:42.390> your<00:05:42.780> iPhone<00:05:43.320> 5s

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
preserver will protect your iPhone 5s

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.230 
preserver will protect your iPhone 5s
generally<00:05:44.790> over<00:05:45.210> one<00:05:46.220> car<00:05:47.220> drive<00:05:47.850> over

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
generally over one car drive over

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.210 
generally over one car drive over
incidents<00:05:48.990> but<00:05:49.380> if<00:05:49.470> you<00:05:49.560> do<00:05:49.680> it<00:05:49.770> six<00:05:50.040> times

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
incidents but if you do it six times

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.350 
incidents but if you do it six times
there's<00:05:50.550> a<00:05:50.610> good<00:05:50.760> chance<00:05:50.970> it's<00:05:51.120> going<00:05:51.300> to

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
there's a good chance it's going to

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.500 
there's a good chance it's going to
break<00:05:51.540> but<00:05:51.750> again<00:05:52.560> six<00:05:53.490> times<00:05:53.790> so<00:05:54.270> what<00:05:54.390> do<00:05:54.450> you

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
break but again six times so what do you

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.270 
break but again six times so what do you
guys<00:05:54.600> think<00:05:54.660> do<00:05:55.020> you<00:05:55.050> think<00:05:55.140> the<00:05:55.440> iPhone<00:05:55.860> 5s

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
guys think do you think the iPhone 5s

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.190 
guys think do you think the iPhone 5s
was<00:05:56.970> protected<00:05:57.480> by<00:05:57.510> the<00:05:57.660> OtterBox<00:05:58.110> preserver

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
was protected by the OtterBox preserver

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.980 
was protected by the OtterBox preserver
it<00:05:58.740> did<00:05:58.950> let<00:05:59.130> in<00:05:59.250> water<00:05:59.520> and<00:05:59.820> it<00:06:00.000> did<00:06:00.240> my<00:06:00.660> screen

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
it did let in water and it did my screen

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.420 
it did let in water and it did my screen
is<00:06:01.140> shattered<00:06:01.530> but<00:06:01.650> it<00:06:01.770> is<00:06:01.830> still<00:06:01.950> usable

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
is shattered but it is still usable

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.159 
is shattered but it is still usable
generally<00:06:02.790> so<00:06:02.940> in<00:06:03.150> an<00:06:03.419> emergency<00:06:03.570> I<00:06:03.870> think<00:06:03.960> I

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
generally so in an emergency I think I

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.570 
generally so in an emergency I think I
could<00:06:04.290> probably<00:06:04.470> make<00:06:04.620> an<00:06:04.830> emergency<00:06:05.310> call

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
could probably make an emergency call

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.820 
could probably make an emergency call
