00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello to all today we get 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.130
 found or by applications like 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.770
 you know I want to vary a 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.900
 little themes on my channel so that's 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.759
 still today's application is a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.660
 dating app you go to me 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.059
 to say one more 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.800
 but no she is different from the others 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.140
 and yes because it is an application of 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.430
 instant dating fast we go 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.890
 start first with a few 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.830
 explanations why how etc and 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.080
 then we'll go to a demo and a 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.460
 staging because yes enzo and me 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.289
 we staged for I must play 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.329
 that I have a little trouble understanding at 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.800
 early how it was not working if I 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.540
 actually discussed with the creator of 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.309
 the application that me who contacted me 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.500
 to explain his project finally his 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.910
 application of the blow and I have a little pain in 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.710
 understand so I asked a lot of 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.780
 questions and when I really understood 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.520
 the application I told myself it's too much 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.719
 well you have to page and the 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.329
 apps on my phone 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.070
 it's called somo the application has for 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.500
 purpose to make you meet people 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.270
 who are around you or around 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.820
 you and therefore automatically in time 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.469
 real instantaneously because you 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.730
 the open you actually see on your 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.710
 screen all the people who get 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.869
 find close to you and so 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.030
 in your shovel and m and so in time 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.260
 real because suddenly if you alone 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.700
 at home you will see no one on your 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.990
 screen thanks to that we could go back in 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.119
 contact with people who are 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.770
 around you type as well friends 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.420
 or contexts of your repertoire 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.890
 it's a lot of unknowns so everything 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.950
 first of all that you understood it is a 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.330
 easy way his stress to get into 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.770
 contact with strangers because 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.150
 that obviously go talk to someone 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.590
 it's much harder than contact 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.420
 and you his phone for someone 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.490
 out of your perimeter and green can not 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.200
 more talk is over you must not miss 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.450
 the check mark when you're chatting with 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.000
 someone the conversations were going 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.280
 message fades 60 seconds after 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.320
 reading and conversely for people 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.610
 that you know these two possible 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.130
 because if for example evening time 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.229
 and that there is your friend who must arrive 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.430
 but what a message bomb and well 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.530
 you can see very well on your 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.450
 screen when she arrives in the place where 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.619
 you find this will one day put that 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.320
 bother an alert is that it you 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.909
 notifies when a friend or someone 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.049
 other repertoire arrives in the place 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.650
 where you are, that can be good 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.690
 you pleasure 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.240
 do you have an appointment for me? 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.860
 to say either to spy because you 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.479
 can very well be connected to 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.790
 the application but without being seen 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.700
 you can see without being seen 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.560
 we do not need anything to talk to one or 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.470
 a stranger to find him on facebook 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.450
 you need his name at least for him 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.090
 send a text message you need his number at 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.010
 minimum like for cutter instagram it 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.930
 need the nickname but there you do not have 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.910
 need strictly nothing we will spend 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.190
 now at the staging and at the 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.050
 demo I was lying all that and yes for those 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.420
 who are wondering why they chose 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.910
 reduce the location perimeter 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.550
 they explained to me that he wanted 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.350
 really focused on the small perimeter and 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.540
 on the snapshot because for 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.070
 remote discussions there are already full 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.840
 of things that exist facebook the 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.150
 chatting emails to the sick brief 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.270

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.600
 short let's get to the staging 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:15.140
 I was quietly at the restaurant 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.140
 when suddenly came to ends 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.930
 at 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.930
 at 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.200
 e 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:49.689
 he looked at me like 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:53.879
 of his number celebrated palace there 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.879
 and as he is sure this moment 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 bino 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.400
 it 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.040
 1 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.720
 m 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.740
 1 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.080
 it 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.550
 this is for staging so as 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.289
 you can see it's really very 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.710
 easy very fast rise does not break the 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.240
 head 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.469
 I 'm not used to 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.780
 to meet people is clear and clear 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:58.250
 puts it clearly in the evening when I 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.469
 make friends, I'll use them 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.870
 to be notified when the person that 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:04.789
 I'm waiting to go into the perimeter or to 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.259
 spy even but often and people 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.539
 who tell you no but I'm sick 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:11.719
 I just straw everything and then we 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.099
 cross at the exit we say and well there you 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.229
 the trouble of crossing them you will be 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.060
 directly who you lie here in short 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.469
 I thought it could be nice 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.479
 present the application I had 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:24.050
 appreciated because it is different from 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.939
 what we see all the time I had 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.199
 notification new conversations 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:29.990
 what is he going to talk to me now 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:33.620
 there is a guy who comes to talk to him and I 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:36.469
 swear says fit there is a badger 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.000
 who just spoke 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:39.949
 so I was saying what is this really a 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.229
 fun way to meet people and 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:44.270
 to talk to them about his stress think the 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:46.099
 stress of the rake live in fact 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.840
 he does not know will tell me the comments 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:49.520
 under thought navigation once you 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.770
 have tested it I can not wait to see your 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.229
 opinion otherwise what else ben nothing just 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.509
 good test of the application good 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:58.610
 encounter and good spying 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:01.099
 we find ourselves waiting on facebook 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.900
 twitter and instagram and we end up 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:04.639
 very quickly in the next videos 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.860
 do not forget the laity and for more 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:09.229
 beauty gold videos and it will be a pleasure 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.710
 that I would make it very very 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.710
 fast and girl
