as good as any third person game I've

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.310 
as good as any third person game I've
ever<00:01:36.210> seen<00:01:36.570> where<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.869> third<00:01:37.170> person

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
ever seen where the third person

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.620 
ever seen where the third person
animations<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.040> perfect<00:01:38.430> environment<00:01:38.880> we're

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
animations are perfect environment we're

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.450 
animations are perfect environment we're
not<00:01:39.780> doing<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.049> first<00:01:40.470> person<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.189> it's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
not doing that first person and it's

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.950 
not doing that first person and it's
it's<00:01:41.700> there's<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.180> whole<00:01:42.509> bunch<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.840> these

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
it's there's a whole bunch of these

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.359 
it's there's a whole bunch of these
kinds<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.380> things<00:01:43.439> these<00:01:43.680> little<00:01:43.950> little

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
kinds of things these little little

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.859 
kinds of things these little little
things<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.850> might<00:01:45.299> have<00:01:45.420> been<00:01:45.450> considered

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
things that might have been considered

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.749 
things that might have been considered
weaknesses<00:01:46.350> or<00:01:46.409> giving<00:01:46.979> those<00:01:47.100> attention<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
weaknesses or giving those attention and

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.460 
weaknesses or giving those attention and
we<00:01:47.909> care<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.299> make<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.600> know<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:48.930> care<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.350> make

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
we care to make you know we care to make

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.880 
we care to make you know we care to make
the<00:01:49.590> best<00:01:49.710> experience<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.430> make<00:01:50.579> so

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
the best experience we can make so

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.070 
the best experience we can make so
we<00:01:50.950> want<00:01:51.400> to<00:01:51.460> cover<00:01:51.580> that<00:01:51.790> stuff<00:01:52.000> too<00:01:52.210> we<00:01:52.930> like

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
we want to cover that stuff too we like

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.560 
we want to cover that stuff too we like
to<00:01:53.200> be<00:01:53.320> seamless<00:01:53.740> as<00:01:53.860> possible<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.570> we've

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
to be seamless as possible and we've

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.600 
to be seamless as possible and we've
developed<00:01:55.930> some<00:01:56.110> techniques<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:56.740> we<00:01:56.830> use<00:01:56.860> to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
developed some techniques that we use to

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.950 
developed some techniques that we use to
help<00:01:57.700> draw<00:01:58.030> our<00:01:58.150> attention<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.659> things<00:01:58.810> that

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
help draw our attention to things that

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.590 
help draw our attention to things that
matter

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.240 

and<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.530> experience<00:02:07.950> these

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
and so if you have to experience these

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.340 
and so if you have to experience these
techniques<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:09.110> understand<00:02:10.110> how<00:02:10.229> they<00:02:10.319> work

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
techniques to understand how they work

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.170 
techniques to understand how they work
and<00:02:10.679> understand<00:02:11.190> how<00:02:11.310> good<00:02:11.490> they<00:02:11.670> are<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.000> how

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and understand how good they are and how

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.750 
and understand how good they are and how
it<00:02:12.300> feels<00:02:12.540> right<00:02:13.230> but<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.520> really

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
it feels right but it's it's really

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.340 
it feels right but it's it's really
exciting<00:02:15.209> new<00:02:15.300> thing<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:15.930> far<00:02:16.170> there

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
exciting new thing and so far there

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.470 
exciting new thing and so far there
hasn't<00:02:16.500> really<00:02:16.650> been<00:02:16.860> much<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.480> nothing

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
hasn't really been much of this nothing

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.940 
hasn't really been much of this nothing
like<00:02:18.630> what<00:02:18.810> we're<00:02:18.959> doing<00:02:18.989> ever<00:02:19.470> done<00:02:19.739> in<00:02:19.890> a

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
like what we're doing ever done in a

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.860 
like what we're doing ever done in a
first-person<00:02:20.310> shooter<00:02:20.670> before<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:21.569> really

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
first-person shooter before to really

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.050 
first-person shooter before to really
harness<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.860> power<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.370> see<00:02:23.730> what<00:02:23.880> we're

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
harness the power and see what we're

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.020 
harness the power and see what we're
going<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.270> see<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.660> next-generation<00:02:25.020> gaming

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
going to see in next-generation gaming

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.910 
going to see in next-generation gaming
it's<00:02:27.030> not<00:02:27.270> at<00:02:27.450> launch<00:02:27.660> its<00:02:28.170> after<00:02:28.500> launch<00:02:28.709> its

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
it's not at launch its after launch its

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.229 
it's not at launch its after launch its
actually<00:02:29.250> when<00:02:29.370> we're<00:02:29.489> able<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.760> harness<00:02:29.970> all

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
actually when we're able to harness all

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.020 
actually when we're able to harness all
of<00:02:30.330> these<00:02:30.660> processors<00:02:31.489> it's<00:02:32.489> going<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:32.910> get

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
of these processors it's going to get

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.510 
of these processors it's going to get
better<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.569> better<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.200> better<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.739> we're

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
better and better and better and we're

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.620 
better and better and better and we're
going<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.700> we're<00:02:35.940> going<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.150> do<00:02:36.239> that<00:02:36.390> on<00:02:36.510> all

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
going to we're going to do that on all

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.360 
going to we're going to do that on all
the<00:02:36.750> platforms<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:37.410> mean<00:02:37.560> all<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.800> all<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
the platforms I mean all of all the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.460 
the platforms I mean all of all the
platforms<00:02:38.550> have<00:02:38.910> multi-platform

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
platforms have multi-platform

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.170 
platforms have multi-platform
multiprocessor<00:02:40.470> capability<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.850> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
multiprocessor capability and so the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.699 
multiprocessor capability and so the
future<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.720> next<00:02:42.750> generation<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.500> going<00:02:43.590> to

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
future the next generation is going to

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.190 
future the next generation is going to
continue<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.190> be<00:02:44.280> amazing<00:02:44.819> even<00:02:45.480> even<00:02:45.870> after

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
continue to be amazing even even after

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.570 
continue to be amazing even even after
we<00:02:46.290> have<00:02:46.470> our<00:02:46.500> fixed<00:02:46.890> platform<00:02:47.310> when<00:02:47.459> we're

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
we have our fixed platform when we're

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.070 
we have our fixed platform when we're
moving<00:02:47.670> forward<00:02:48.000> from<00:02:48.180> there<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.540> here<00:02:48.690> and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
moving forward from there to here and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.330 
moving forward from there to here and
we're<00:02:49.440> excited<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.739> be<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.860> part<00:02:49.890> of
