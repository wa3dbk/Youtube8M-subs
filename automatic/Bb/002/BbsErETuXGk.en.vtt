00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.519

 And that sounds funny from Denmark 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.400
 intended 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.400
 and there is now around and boy 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.690

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.200
 Being that you are something special too 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.910
 his 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.910
 I have often wished for that 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.990
 Good morning sparrow I would have 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.090
 really no further that you one 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.500
 Of course, superhero , I suggest 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.800
 We skip tomorrow and test times a 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.800
 border 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.120
 I came already falls 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.230
 a superhero name must be cool and 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.550
 be understandable 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.550
 you need a disposal 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.430
 hello i can not mom my now 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.540
 name is the flow whereby the insects 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.540
 possible to escape more 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.610
 is not your job to save her what 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.410
 me yes that's what superheroes 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.060
 do 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.290
 that is not so good that it is much 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.160
 Too dangerous to destroy everything is 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.160
 ant 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.520
 who are you I am with you 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.250
 bayer is strangely short 77 minutes 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.110
 is released from 0 years and starts 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.780
 expected in Germany from 27 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.670
 march 2014 in German cinemas and 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.170
 tells the story of pelle pelle 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.550
 is a little boy who is in the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.870
 School did not really like it 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.489
 girl has that hard of 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.930
 terrorist twin would feel 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.400
 the whole time ready and can 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.890
 only with one or the other place 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.150
 at elementary school friends than he 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.130
 one day in the clashes 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.959
 but was bitten by an ant 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.580
 he suddenly has superhero skills 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.010
 can be a multiple of its weight 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.510
 wear when you crawl up he is and 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.120
 boy he decides along with 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.530
 his little companion is throwing a costume 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.780
 and try the world a little bit too far 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.819
 improve and there is and go in the reason 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.549
 not the parody but a tribute 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.489
 as a children's movie to the big warner dc 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.349
 comics or disney marvel strip because 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.790
 the film researched thoroughly 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.170
 Many well-known superheroes say so too 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.940
 that is already a matter of course 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.590
 marvel and summarizes a little something 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.239
 superhero constantly have in common why 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.890
 balls would behave in one way or another 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.269
 but this is the way it is 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.010
 designed it into the superhero 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.840
 film for the little ones is so have 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.430
 I noticed in the press demonstration that 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.440
 especially the three to ten year olds 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.569
 have fun at this place strip 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.040
 because of course completely useless comes 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.350
 partly illogical are the effects 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.720
 not terribly elaborate foreign 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.670
 consuming it is of course a Danish 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.620
 Fan where just not the multi million 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.209
 budget behind it but it is with 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.980
 very much rather a tribute like 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.959
 even the very small just this 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.340
 superheroes genre so you can with pelle 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.359
 and especially then too 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.760
 ask why the movie probably 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.440
 only in quotation marks 77 minutes goes 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.310
 you do not want the story to be unnecessary 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.170
 extend and also the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.310
 Concentration of something younger 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.829
 then not quite so much 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.200
 strain and thus is missing the 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.019
 introduction to this genre and one 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.940
 really nice little sweet bows 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.049
 this direction gets from me as 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.599
 superhero movie with a lot 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.250
 comedic impact and the many 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.290
 sweet little moment six and a half of 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.720
 ten possible points in this genre 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.370
 and in total a strip yes then must 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.230
 Of course you can not see but you can 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.510
 you see, he has his very own 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.459
 Charm from me a total of decent five 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.079
 of ten possible points for that 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.310
 and yes I'm curious what you too 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.049
 The film says to ever face 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.470
 should get as I said you have to 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.940
 Not 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.829
 you can also see on blu-ray or dvd 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.440
 I want to go through with mine 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.880
 thumbing your thumb since we have this 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.440
 might let it remain if not 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.120
