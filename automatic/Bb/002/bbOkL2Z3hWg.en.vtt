the background like the rest of the
level<00:04:18.139> like<00:04:18.260> if<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:18.500> look<00:04:18.680> really<00:04:19.039> closely

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850

actually<00:04:26.600> mystic<00:04:27.289> melody<00:04:27.680> I<00:04:28.150> added<00:04:29.150> that<00:04:29.300> just

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
actually mystic melody I added that just

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.879 
actually mystic melody I added that just
because<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:29.960> knew<00:04:30.139> it<00:04:30.289> was<00:04:30.410> in<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.650> level<00:04:30.979> and

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
because I knew it was in the level and

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.370 
because I knew it was in the level and
why<00:04:33.889> not<00:04:34.100> really<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:35.240> that's<00:04:35.990> pretty<00:04:36.169> much<00:04:36.260> it

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
why not really so that's pretty much it

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.190 
why not really so that's pretty much it
