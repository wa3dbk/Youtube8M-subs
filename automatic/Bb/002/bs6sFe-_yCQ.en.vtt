what this promotes in the practice is

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.200 
what this promotes in the practice is
when<00:00:35.500> you<00:00:35.620> bring<00:00:35.830> an<00:00:35.980> adult<00:00:36.340> patient<00:00:36.640> into<00:00:37.180> the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
practice and you do not seek them in the

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.640 
practice and you do not seek them in the
chair<00:00:40.210> you<00:00:40.390> allow<00:00:40.720> them<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.140> seat<00:00:41.350> themselves

chair you allow them to seat themselves
they<00:00:42.640> will<00:00:42.879> put<00:00:43.059> their<00:00:43.269> head<00:00:43.479> in<00:00:43.659> that

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
they will put their head in that
