00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:19.740
 professionals today we want a little 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:23.730
 funny program write that always 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.849
 again constantly things are ops folder 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.240
 program files will always be 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.399
 open again and as far as I know 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.239
 do not stop the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.660
 unless you drive npc down and 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.460
 this program can do that if longer 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.690
 running it can cause the pc 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.000
 but smears as I said yes yes 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.520
 before doing a reboot or 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.070
 Just shut down and how it works 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:02.539
 explain yourself now ye need 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.539
 first a new text document 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:16.210
 that saves us no matter where we are 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:25.880
 just ask virus point 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:32.500
 very important point b at then has become 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:35.330
 already created a batch file 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:45.560
 Now we write in our virus 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:51.140
 combat editor echo often empty step 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.920
 Step start and then you can 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:59.090
 now choose any file 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:03.940
 I'll just open the kkk here 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:10.850
 places or are simply a couple 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:14.050
 music files in there instead of kkk if we have that 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.050
 save network 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.150
 We then went to see each other 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.790
 provided 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:30.440
 this is not yet the annoying 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:37.500
 it will not be until we get up here 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:42.230
 colon states and write here 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.880
 bottom motto start 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.160
 I will not do that now because 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.570
 we said it can cause the 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.150
 pc under drives in any case will that 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.970
 now done so because god state if 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:02.310
 the ece arrived he jumps again 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:06.330
 to state in the fall and would lead 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.060
 back in folder kakÃ¡ out and so now 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.890
 continue until the computer is 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.440
 someday always creates and sections 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.530
 I hope you liked it writes 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.680
