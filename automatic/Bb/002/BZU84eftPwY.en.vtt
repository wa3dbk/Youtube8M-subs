aliens casa.com i'm going to be showing
you<00:00:17.610> a<00:00:17.640> combination<00:00:18.300> today<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:19.050> involves<00:00:19.440> a

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
you a combination today that involves a

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.230 
you a combination today that involves a
literature<00:00:19.830> slow<00:00:20.130> moves<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.610> a<00:00:20.700> lot<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.940> arm

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
literature slow moves and a lot of arm

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.030 
literature slow moves and a lot of arm
controls<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.110> kind<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.320> looks<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:22.529> it's

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
controls so in kind of looks like it's

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.530 
controls so in kind of looks like it's
actually<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> three<00:00:23.670> step<00:00:23.880> turn<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.390> looks

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
actually a three step turn but it looks

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.820 
actually a three step turn but it looks
like<00:00:24.599> this<00:00:25.790> switch<00:00:26.790> and<00:00:27.150> then<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.349> it's

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
like this switch and then this and it's

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.729 
like this switch and then this and it's
switch<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.640> then<00:00:29.820> frame<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.540> and<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.470> switch

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
switch and then frame it and it's switch

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.740 
switch and then frame it and it's switch
so<00:00:32.340> what's<00:00:32.610> happening<00:00:32.970> here<00:00:33.060> I'm<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.690> be

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
so what's happening here I'm going to be

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.240 
so what's happening here I'm going to be
adding<00:00:33.899> some<00:00:34.020> other<00:00:34.260> things<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.860> but

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
adding some other things to it but

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.979 
adding some other things to it but
that's<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> basic<00:00:35.640> move<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.660> kind<00:00:36.810> of<00:00:36.840> goes

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
that's the basic move so it kind of goes

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.810 
that's the basic move so it kind of goes
like<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:38.360> then<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:40.050> been<00:00:40.380> then<00:00:41.190> said<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
like then then then it been then said it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.610 
like then then then it been then said it
is<00:00:43.430> then<00:00:44.430> okay<00:00:44.880> so<00:00:45.210> that's<00:00:45.359> the<00:00:45.539> basic<00:00:45.840> be<00:00:45.989> so

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
is then okay so that's the basic be so

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.900 
is then okay so that's the basic be so
what's<00:00:46.829> happening<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.250> wonder<00:00:47.609> what<00:00:47.699> a<00:00:47.730> three

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
what's happening is wonder what a three

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.430 
what's happening is wonder what a three
step<00:00:48.090> turn<00:00:48.149> three<00:00:48.660> step<00:00:48.840> turn<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.289> should

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
step turn three step turn you should

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.720 
step turn three step turn you should
know<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.679> by<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.219> don't<00:00:50.340> make<00:00:50.579> sure

okay so make sure that the last four is
always<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.210> top<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:20.369> key<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.119> this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
always on the top so the key get in this

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.090 
always on the top so the key get in this
combination<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.750> actually<00:01:22.079> the<00:01:22.140> arms<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.979> is

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
combination is actually the arms this is

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.999 
combination is actually the arms this is
really<00:01:23.250> key<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:25.110> we're<00:01:25.259> doing<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.649> we<00:01:25.829> gonna

really key so we're doing is we gonna
start<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.610> make<00:01:27.030> sure<00:01:27.060> one<00:01:27.390> arm<00:01:27.600> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
start like this make sure one arm is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.080 
start like this make sure one arm is
lifted<00:01:28.110> I'll<00:01:28.619> write<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.100> point<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
lifted I'll write to you point to the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.840 
lifted I'll write to you point to the
left<00:01:30.360> drop<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.049> left<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:32.189> turn<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
left drop the left as you turn to the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.819 
left drop the left as you turn to the
other<00:01:33.030> side<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.659> do<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.930> motion<00:01:34.799> here

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
other side you can do this motion here

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.410 
other side you can do this motion here
which<00:01:35.219> is<00:01:35.369> framing<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.450> head<00:01:36.719> with<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:38.009> arm

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
which is framing the head with your arm

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.319 
which is framing the head with your arm
okay<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.979> turn<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.670> one<00:01:41.820> sees<00:01:42.060> them

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
okay as you turn so this one sees them

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.719 
okay as you turn so this one sees them
okay<00:01:42.719> so<00:01:43.200> slowly<00:01:43.740> i'm<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.280> very<00:01:44.430> slow

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
okay so slowly i'm going to go very slow

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.800 
okay so slowly i'm going to go very slow
here<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.090> I'm<00:01:45.149> gonna<00:01:45.240> take<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> step<00:01:45.659> with<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
here so I'm gonna take a step with the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.330 
here so I'm gonna take a step with the
left<00:01:46.130> left<00:01:47.130> right<00:01:47.780> left<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:49.439> at<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.710> end<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
left left right left but at the end the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.160 
left left right left but at the end the
one<00:01:50.610> at<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.789> end<00:01:51.060> I'm<00:01:51.600> actually<00:01:51.750> switching

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
one at the end I'm actually switching

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.109 
one at the end I'm actually switching
the<00:01:52.380> arm<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.920> arm<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.460> framed<00:01:53.729> my<00:01:53.939> head

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the arm the arm that just framed my head

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.849 
the arm the arm that just framed my head
right<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.390> goes<00:01:54.810> down<00:01:55.289> and<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> other

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859 
right here goes down and then the other

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:57.740 
right here goes down and then the other
one<00:01:56.100> goes<00:01:56.430> up<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.359> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
one goes up so it's going to be the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.929 
one goes up so it's going to be the
opposite<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.289> how<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.500> started<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.549> started

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
opposite of how I started if I started

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.090 
opposite of how I started if I started
like<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.259> I'm<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.560> frame<00:02:01.710> my<00:02:01.920> head

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.029 
like this I'm going to frame my head
with<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> arm<00:02:02.549> that's<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.939> as<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.750> turn<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.500> when

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.249 
with the arm that's up as I turn on when
I<00:02:05.070> land<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.820> got<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.060> make<00:02:06.180> sure<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.659> end<00:02:06.990> up<00:02:07.109> like

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
I land I got to make sure to end up like

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.350 
I land I got to make sure to end up like
this<00:02:07.469> I'm<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:08.100> doing<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.490> kind<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.759> clumsy

step on the left five and six and seven
and<00:02:18.230> frames<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.680> arms<00:02:20.100> with<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.550> right<00:02:20.850> here<00:02:21.090> we

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
and frames the arms with a right here we

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.800 
and frames the arms with a right here we
go<00:02:21.270> one<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.200> two<00:02:23.660> I'm<00:02:24.660> dropping<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.350> right

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
go one and two I'm dropping the right

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.300 
go one and two I'm dropping the right
I just<00:02:26.050> friend<00:02:26.319> my<00:02:26.530> arms<00:02:26.830> width<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.190> it

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
I just friend my arms width and it

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.010 
I just friend my arms width and it
listed<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.760> left<00:02:27.970> it's<00:02:28.300> not<00:02:28.450> very<00:02:28.630> hard<00:02:28.870> to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
listed in the left it's not very hard to

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.309 
listed in the left it's not very hard to
move<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.290> do<00:02:29.470> okay<00:02:30.370> but<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.180> does<00:02:31.480> kind<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.750> you

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
move to do okay but it does kind of you

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.130 
move to do okay but it does kind of you
know<00:02:32.349> quite<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:32.860> little<00:02:33.040> bit<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.250> explanation

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
know quite a little bit of explanation

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.300 
know quite a little bit of explanation
but<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.349> does<00:02:35.530> going<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:35.830> feel<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:35.980> little<00:02:36.040> bit

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
but it does going to feel a little bit

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.220 
but it does going to feel a little bit
natural<00:02:36.790> in<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.030> way<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.720> looks<00:02:37.900> beautiful

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
natural in a way and it looks beautiful

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.080 
natural in a way and it looks beautiful
I<00:02:38.530> think<00:02:39.099> it's<00:02:39.310> one<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.640> most<00:02:39.790> beautiful

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
I think it's one of the most beautiful

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.790 
I think it's one of the most beautiful
ways<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.569> can<00:02:40.720> frame<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.200> three<00:02:41.410> scepter

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
ways you can frame a three scepter

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.420 
ways you can frame a three scepter
personally<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:43.150> my<00:02:43.930> style<00:02:44.140> daya<00:02:44.500> right<00:02:45.010> arm<00:02:45.220> up

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
personally so my style daya right arm up

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.059 
personally so my style daya right arm up
five<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:46.000> six<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.420> seven<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.930> turn<00:02:47.410> frame

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
five and six and seven and turn frame

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.130 
five and six and seven and turn frame
with<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> right<00:02:48.670> drop<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.450> right<00:02:49.690> lift<00:02:49.989> the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
with the right drop the right lift the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.020 
with the right drop the right lift the
left<00:02:50.319> and<00:02:50.650> then<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.310> get<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:51.580> frame<00:02:51.880> right

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
left and then you get this frame right

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.670 
left and then you get this frame right
here<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:52.750> what<00:02:52.989> we<00:02:53.080> going<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.319> do<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.590> this

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
here so what we going to do and this

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.290 
here so what we going to do and this
frame<00:02:54.040> i'm<00:02:54.220> going<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.430> give<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.730> back<00:02:54.910> like

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
frame i'm going to give that back like

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.590 
frame i'm going to give that back like
extended<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.349> course<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.819> then<00:02:58.150> we're<00:02:58.480> gonna

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
extended of course and then we're gonna

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.900 
extended of course and then we're gonna
drop<00:02:58.810> still<00:02:59.319> got<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.650> right<00:03:00.040> arm<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.519> then

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
drop still got that right arm and then

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.850 
drop still got that right arm and then
we're<00:03:01.120> going<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.299> focus<00:03:01.480> here<00:03:01.870> on<00:03:02.080> drop<00:03:02.530> in<00:03:02.739> the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
we're going to focus here on drop in the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.309 
we're going to focus here on drop in the
left<00:03:03.130> over<00:03:03.790> here<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.150> do<00:03:04.660> upper<00:03:04.930> body<00:03:05.140> and

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
left over here and do upper body and

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.440 
left over here and do upper body and
relations<00:03:07.860> so<00:03:08.860> that'll<00:03:09.130> be<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.250> five<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.030> six

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
relations so that'll be a five and six

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.809 
relations so that'll be a five and six
seven<00:03:10.750> eight<00:03:11.440> remember<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.010> combination<00:03:12.640> is

statement stuff from here again are we
going<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:34.959> do<00:03:35.049> about<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.530> right<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:36.010> then<00:03:36.250> do

going to do about the right and then do

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.150 
going to do about the right and then do
upper<00:03:37.209> body<00:03:37.420> in<00:03:37.690> deletions<00:03:38.380> or<00:03:38.709> maybe<00:03:38.950> like<00:03:39.100> a

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
upper body in deletions or maybe like a

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.580 
upper body in deletions or maybe like a
couple<00:03:39.609> counts<00:03:40.150> four<00:03:40.329> counts<00:03:40.660> here<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:40.989> then

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
couple counts four counts here and then

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.500 
couple counts four counts here and then
on<00:03:41.920> turning<00:03:42.430> into<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.730> other<00:03:42.880> side<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:43.480> again

right and hope and and sometimes I do
that<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.630> little<00:03:58.720> bit<00:03:58.870> faster<00:03:59.230> so<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.500> guys<00:03:59.709> can

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
that a little bit faster so you guys can

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.080 
that a little bit faster so you guys can
see<00:03:59.980> how<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:00.340> actually<00:04:00.519> supposed<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:00.940> look

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
see how it actually supposed to look

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.259 
see how it actually supposed to look
like<00:04:01.209> um<00:04:02.040> no<00:04:03.040> one<00:04:03.190> was<00:04:03.280> all<00:04:03.489> done<00:04:03.670> would<00:04:04.150> the

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
like um no one was all done would the

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.879 
like um no one was all done would the
beat<00:04:04.420> so<00:04:04.660> they<00:04:05.109> don't<00:04:05.290> offense<00:04:05.530> obvious<00:04:05.799> on

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
beat so they don't offense obvious on

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.289 
beat so they don't offense obvious on
the<00:04:06.010> beat<00:04:06.160> it's<00:04:06.340> gonna<00:04:06.459> be<00:04:06.579> slow<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:06.819> be<00:04:07.060> fast

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
the beat it's gonna be slow to be fast

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.270 
the beat it's gonna be slow to be fast
it's<00:04:07.630> such<00:04:07.959> you<00:04:08.230> hiding<00:04:08.590> fast<00:04:08.859> you<00:04:08.980> want<00:04:09.069> to<00:04:09.190> go

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
it's such you hiding fast you want to go

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.490 
it's such you hiding fast you want to go
with<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.459> so<00:04:09.700> look<00:04:10.239> like<00:04:10.420> this<00:04:10.569> five<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:11.200> six

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
with it so look like this five and six

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.190 
with it so look like this five and six
and<00:04:11.739> seven<00:04:11.829> and<00:04:12.310> eight<00:04:12.489> one<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.660> two<00:04:13.989> and

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
and seven and eight one and two and

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.250 
and seven and eight one and two and
three<00:04:14.319> and<00:04:14.739> four<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.519> five<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.180> six<00:04:16.690> and

seven and eight eight one and two and

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.700 
seven and eight eight one and two and
three<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:21.039> four<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:21.850> five<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:22.539> six<00:04:23.080> and

three and four and five and six and
seven<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.400> eight<00:04:25.289> okay<00:04:26.289> so<00:04:26.860> that's<00:04:27.310> a

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
seven and eight okay so that's a

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.210 
seven and eight okay so that's a
combination<00:04:27.610> for<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.479> is<00:04:28.720> i<00:04:29.289> called<00:04:30.100> it

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
combination for you it is i called it

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.950 
combination for you it is i called it
for<00:04:30.490> slow<00:04:30.820> move<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:31.360> it<00:04:31.450> doesn't<00:04:31.720> mean<00:04:31.810> the

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
for slow move but it doesn't mean the

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.600 
for slow move but it doesn't mean the
count<00:04:32.260> is

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
count is

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.339 
count is
slow<00:04:32.759> and<00:04:32.969> I<00:04:33.030> think<00:04:33.240> it's<00:04:33.389> very<00:04:33.900> important<00:04:34.319> to

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
slow and I think it's very important to

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:35.899 
slow and I think it's very important to
point<00:04:34.560> out<00:04:34.710> sometimes<00:04:35.189> because<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.550> music<00:04:35.639> is

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
point out sometimes because the music is

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.640 
point out sometimes because the music is
real<00:04:36.090> slow<00:04:36.240> which<00:04:36.479> means<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.199> fall<00:04:37.469> into

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
real slow which means that you fall into

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.409 
real slow which means that you fall into
melody<00:04:38.159> uniform<00:04:38.699> gonna<00:04:38.849> beat<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.180> find

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
melody uniform gonna beat you find

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.559 
melody uniform gonna beat you find
something<00:04:39.719> that<00:04:39.840> goes<00:04:39.960> then<00:04:41.479> instead<00:04:42.479> of

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:42.569 
something that goes then instead of

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.240 
something that goes then instead of
following<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.080> Boom<00:04:43.409> Boom<00:04:43.439> Boom<00:04:43.860> Boom<00:04:44.069> Boom

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
following the Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.219 
following the Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom
Boom<00:04:44.460> Boom<00:04:44.669> either<00:04:44.939> say<00:04:45.419> follow<00:04:45.689> the<00:04:45.780> melody

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
Boom Boom either say follow the melody

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.529 
Boom Boom either say follow the melody
not<00:04:46.439> the<00:04:46.560> beat<00:04:46.800> in<00:04:47.129> this<00:04:47.430> one<00:04:47.669> that<00:04:48.240> doesn't

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
not the beat in this one that doesn't

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.029 
not the beat in this one that doesn't
mean<00:04:48.659> that<00:04:48.689> the<00:04:48.900> couch<00:04:49.169> of<00:04:49.379> the<00:04:49.500> malady<00:04:49.919> is

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
mean that the couch of the malady is

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.529 
mean that the couch of the malady is
slow<00:04:50.520> but<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.180> moose<00:04:51.419> feel<00:04:52.669> slow<00:04:53.669> so<00:04:54.180> big

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
slow but the moose feel slow so big

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.119 
slow but the moose feel slow so big
difference<00:04:54.870> there<00:04:55.139> we'll<00:04:55.560> talk<00:04:55.710> about<00:04:55.860> that<00:04:55.979> a

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
difference there we'll talk about that a

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.159 
difference there we'll talk about that a
little<00:04:56.219> bit<00:04:56.430> more<00:04:56.699> and<00:04:57.599> you<00:04:57.719> do<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:57.930> align

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
little bit more and you do that align

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.540 
little bit more and you do that align
our<00:04:58.409> moves<00:04:58.650> like<00:04:58.860> things<00:04:59.099> to<00:04:59.219> follow<00:04:59.370> the

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
our moves like things to follow the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.580 
our moves like things to follow the
Melly<00:04:59.789> rather<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.270> fall<00:05:00.449> on<00:05:00.569> thee<00:05:00.810> didn't

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
Melly rather the fall on thee didn't

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.679 
Melly rather the fall on thee didn't
feel<00:05:01.770> slow<00:05:02.069> but<00:05:02.340> they<00:05:02.430> really<00:05:02.699> aren't<00:05:02.819> slow<00:05:03.539> if

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:03.689 
feel slow but they really aren't slow if

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:05.540 
feel slow but they really aren't slow if
you<00:05:03.810> count<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.229> moves<00:05:04.500> so<00:05:04.770> like<00:05:04.889> you<00:05:05.099> see<00:05:05.310> my

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
you count the moves so like you see my

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.640 
you count the moves so like you see my
count<00:05:05.819> here<00:05:06.000> wasn't<00:05:06.210> really<00:05:06.509> slow<00:05:06.689> count<00:05:06.930> but

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
count here wasn't really slow count but

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.610 
count here wasn't really slow count but
the<00:05:07.800> moves<00:05:08.039> felt<00:05:08.819> like<00:05:09.000> they<00:05:09.180> were<00:05:09.300> slow<00:05:10.169> the

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
the moves felt like they were slow the

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.830 
the moves felt like they were slow the
turn<00:05:10.830> of<00:05:10.860> hobby<00:05:11.069> not<00:05:11.310> but<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:12.479> could<00:05:12.599> have<00:05:12.719> been

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
turn of hobby not but it could have been
