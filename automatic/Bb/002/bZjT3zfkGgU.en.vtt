00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.470 
vibrant colors as you see you can plate
like<00:02:28.569> that<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.930> it's<00:02:29.019> really<00:02:29.170> easy<00:02:29.909> as<00:02:30.909> so<00:02:31.239> all

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
like that and it's really easy as so all

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.600 
like that and it's really easy as so all
you<00:02:31.780> can<00:02:31.930> turn<00:02:32.049> it<00:02:32.170> sideways<00:02:32.409> and<00:02:32.890> play<00:02:33.459> like

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
you can turn it sideways and play like

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.039 
you can turn it sideways and play like
that<00:02:33.790> i<00:02:33.849> think<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.329> is<00:02:34.360> intended<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.900> play

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
that i think it is intended to play

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.750 
that i think it is intended to play
sideways<00:02:35.470> as<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.709> score<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.129> placed<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.610> way

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
sideways as the score is placed that way

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.750 
sideways as the score is placed that way
but<00:02:37.629> um<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.739> doesn't<00:02:38.920> really<00:02:39.069> bother<00:02:39.250> me<00:02:39.430> both

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
but um it doesn't really bother me both

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.149 
but um it doesn't really bother me both
ways<00:02:40.000> play<00:02:40.329> really<00:02:40.810> well<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.769> reason<00:02:42.040> why<00:02:42.129> I

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
ways play really well the reason why I

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.069 
ways play really well the reason why I
like<00:02:42.370> this<00:02:42.519> game<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.000> much<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.540> it's<00:02:43.900> just

but it's really addictive and really fun

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.970 
but it's really addictive and really fun
there<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.680> no<00:02:51.180> real<00:02:52.290> story<00:02:53.290> made<00:02:53.530> or<00:02:53.650> anything

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
there is no real story made or anything

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.400 
there is no real story made or anything
to<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.190> game<00:02:54.400> or<00:02:54.760> even<00:02:55.000> though<00:02:55.840> it's<00:02:55.989> champ<00:02:56.260> is

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
to the game or even though it's champ is

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.190 
to the game or even though it's champ is
called<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:56.799> championship<00:02:57.310> mode<00:02:57.489> there<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.629> no

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
called the championship mode there is no

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.030 
called the championship mode there is no
real<00:03:00.989> hard<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.079> explain<00:03:02.290> it's<00:03:02.530> basically<00:03:02.950> just

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
real hard to explain it's basically just

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.550 
real hard to explain it's basically just
you<00:03:03.760> go<00:03:03.909> through<00:03:04.150> levels<00:03:04.629> against<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.049> cpu<00:03:05.230> so

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
you go through levels against the cpu so

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.830 
you go through levels against the cpu so
it's<00:03:05.890> basically<00:03:06.069> just<00:03:06.370> like<00:03:06.609> one<00:03:06.819> player<00:03:07.090> but

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
it's basically just like one player but

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.580 
it's basically just like one player but
you<00:03:08.379> got<00:03:08.560> in<00:03:08.829> levels<00:03:09.250> so<00:03:10.079> it's<00:03:11.079> not<00:03:11.319> a

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
you got in levels so it's not a

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.580 
you got in levels so it's not a
groundbreaking<00:03:12.400> game<00:03:13.150> but<00:03:13.989> I<00:03:14.019> just<00:03:14.260> love<00:03:14.470> it
