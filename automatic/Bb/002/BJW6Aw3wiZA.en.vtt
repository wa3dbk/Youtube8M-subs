00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
how well it worked you know being

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.239 
how well it worked you know being
someone<00:05:07.790> of<00:05:08.240> scientific<00:05:09.050> background

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:10.249 
someone of scientific background

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:12.339 
someone of scientific background
I<00:05:10.339> have<00:05:10.669> two<00:05:10.849> masters<00:05:11.269> degrees<00:05:11.299> i<00:05:11.839> was

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
I have two masters degrees i was

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.369 
I have two masters degrees i was
wondering<00:05:13.309> how<00:05:13.759> it<00:05:13.939> works<00:05:14.179> and<00:05:14.479> i<00:05:15.199> still

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.379 
wondering how it works and i still

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.909 
wondering how it works and i still
wonder<00:05:15.589> how<00:05:16.309> it<00:05:16.519> works<00:05:16.789> i<00:05:17.149> guess<00:05:18.139> there<00:05:18.769> is

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
wonder how it works i guess there is

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.799 
wonder how it works i guess there is
more<00:05:19.279> to<00:05:19.429> life<00:05:19.459> than<00:05:20.409> we<00:05:21.409> normally<00:05:21.939> see<00:05:22.939> there

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:23.809 
more to life than we normally see there

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:25.779 
more to life than we normally see there
was<00:05:23.989> more<00:05:24.139> to<00:05:24.259> consciousness<00:05:24.679> than<00:05:25.189> what<00:05:25.609> we

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
was more to consciousness than what we

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.879 
was more to consciousness than what we
perceive<00:05:26.919> regular<00:05:27.919> person<00:05:28.279> to<00:05:28.639> see
