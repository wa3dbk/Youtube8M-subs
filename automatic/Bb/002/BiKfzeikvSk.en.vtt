00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
two copies of ataxia problem right I

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.220 
two copies of ataxia problem right I
initially<00:04:07.000> started<00:04:07.090> testing<00:04:07.599> three<00:04:07.989> of<00:04:08.109> them

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
initially started testing three of them

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.839 
initially started testing three of them
and<00:04:08.349> that<00:04:08.469> gave<00:04:08.829> me<00:04:08.980> too<00:04:09.189> much<00:04:09.310> exposure<00:04:09.640> to

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
and that gave me too much exposure to

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.330 
and that gave me too much exposure to
the<00:04:10.060> fast<00:04:10.299> x<00:04:10.599> like<00:04:10.780> burn<00:04:11.019> or<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:11.739> blue<00:04:12.069> I<00:04:12.159> read

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
the fast x like burn or the blue I read

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.339 
the fast x like burn or the blue I read
delver<00:04:12.730> or<00:04:13.000> when<00:04:13.420> somebody<00:04:13.780> goes<00:04:13.959> with<00:04:14.260> the

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
delver or when somebody goes with the

delver or when somebody goes with the
guy's<00:04:14.469> a<00:04:14.620> saint<00:04:14.799> traft<00:04:15.069> you're<00:04:15.340> just<00:04:15.489> doing

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
guy's a saint traft you're just doing

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.310 
guy's a saint traft you're just doing
too<00:04:15.760> much<00:04:15.879> damage<00:04:15.939> to<00:04:16.299> yourself<00:04:16.359> but<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.109> hand

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
too much damage to yourself but the hand

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.710 
too much damage to yourself but the hand
information<00:04:17.560> is<00:04:17.919> crucial<00:04:18.299> one<00:04:19.299> thing<00:04:19.539> I<00:04:19.660> would

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
information is crucial one thing I would

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.499 
information is crucial one thing I would
find<00:04:20.109> is<00:04:20.350> that<00:04:20.579> plan<00:04:21.579> against<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.030> taxing

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:22.509 
find is that plan against the taxing

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:24.150 
find is that plan against the taxing
decks<00:04:22.810> like<00:04:23.080> rug<00:04:23.289> delver<00:04:23.500> things<00:04:23.889> of<00:04:24.009> that

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
decks like rug delver things of that

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.390 
decks like rug delver things of that
nature<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:26.020> could<00:04:26.350> win<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.710> game<00:04:26.889> as<00:04:27.100> long<00:04:27.370> as

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
nature you could win the game as long as

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.189 
nature you could win the game as long as
you<00:04:27.610> knew<00:04:27.759> which<00:04:27.970> order<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.449> cast<00:04:28.660> things<00:04:28.990> it

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
you knew which order to cast things it

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.590 
you knew which order to cast things it
so<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.100> probe<00:04:30.400> with<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.729> hand<00:04:31.000> information

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
so the probe with that hand information

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.909 
so the probe with that hand information
you<00:04:31.690> would<00:04:31.780> know<00:04:31.990> if<00:04:32.199> you<00:04:32.229> shouldn't<00:04:32.620> run<00:04:32.770> your

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
you would know if you shouldn't run your

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.909 
you would know if you shouldn't run your
goth<00:04:33.220> in<00:04:33.430> into<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.600> snare<00:04:34.990> or<00:04:35.289> if<00:04:35.710> you<00:04:35.800> should

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
goth in into the snare or if you should

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.420 
goth in into the snare or if you should
play<00:04:36.070> around<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.340> peers<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:38.080> using<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:39.070> it

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
play around the peers so using that it

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.430 
play around the peers so using that it
becomes<00:04:39.759> very<00:04:39.849> very<00:04:40.360> helpful<00:04:40.599> actually<00:04:41.110> does

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
becomes very very helpful actually does
