 he publishes the book over and over again 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.920
 then pimp the plane over the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.609
 Notrutsche activated is exactly that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.400
 procedure in such a situation of 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.210
 adapted to the weather and then in the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.800
 moment where it is clear that this destination 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.669
 Lost is immediately the search and 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.669
 rescue service alerted 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.930
 one possibility is an interpretation 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.730
 of course conceivable

 extremely workload and warm in the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.140

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.180
 plane under control 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.920
 the priority in today's situation 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.780
 is clearly only the plane first 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.000
 aircraft only stabilizing the problem 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.439
 to solve 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.020

 They fly over which options I have and 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.460
 only in third place is the topic 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.420
 communication 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.890
 that means I make funkspruch to the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.180
 fusion from or 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.180
 answer answered hardened 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.350
 the fact that the pilots are not 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.660
 Report with the foot break answer 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.300
 can also just do ladies 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.580
 have that they are busy that they 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.100
 just have everyone's hands busy and 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.810
 at the moment often not even having a party 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.750
 the airport security hear because they 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.310
 are busy figuring out 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.200
 what happens a song how do we get 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.390
 the planes stabilized again like 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.540
 we get out of this 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.540
 situation
