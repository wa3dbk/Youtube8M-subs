00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.360
 iljo everyone knows xvie ron 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.100
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.020
 video a bit special since I you 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.789
 do I'm going to make the presentation 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.820
 from my minecraft server 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.740
 so this is a server pvp faction on 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.060
 still hesitates to put kim moths 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.339
 dance because it attracts a lot of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.289
 little blows these things there and them 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.060
 so here we are made valves made 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.040
 coughing is no problem so who 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.720
 currently found in one point this 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.700
 tip 2 and who will be and to be 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.250
 obviously 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.000
 so we're right now at 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.789
 good 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.469
 finally the spawn village at least so 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.980
 to explain the concept we have 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.199
 wanted to do me and women 38 to spawn 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.940
 medieval so this is where we 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.890
 so the little house is 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.989
 it's very nice 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.989
 then below you have the rules 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.250
 who are here so I want to say that 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.860
 it's not a map that have to download 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.210
 it's really us who did it 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.030
 then left out of the spawn 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.410
 we have the staff room were 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.990
 fully me who do them so here's it 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.560
 with little npc cuckoo there is me 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.090
 here is a little all the staff the bridge 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.950
 also then the server still in 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.329
 construction unfortunately it will do 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.770
 a lot of time building a 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.210
 medieval house it takes little 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.820
 almost an hour and a half hours to 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.829
 a small house is actually the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.259
 principle is that every house is a 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.590
 shop so there for example it's the shop 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.960
 tools you see so there are all beautiful 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.430
 pick up weapons and all that after you 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.840
 have the teleport room which in 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.969
 shape of caves we wanted to do 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.460
 a pretty original thing and so here we are 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.110
 thought about that we'll go where the hours 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.799
 so here is nethered a small 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.600
 nice cave here is the canvas 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.250
 spider flat we will go back there 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.610
 this is the day you show it we did 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.330
 a mine so I'm going 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.490
 and hop so see a mine anyway 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.810
 with a lot of resources for those who 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.430
 come to find because there 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.900
 not a lot of people who have 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.729
 the vacuum intelligence yesterday to come 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.400
 in the mine 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.630
 So here again a little shock but 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.800
 we will immediately go see the pvp fac 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.720
 I do not know if there are people but he 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.330
 must be 3 4 connect the knowledge 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.280
 just opened just three days ago we 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.650
 go there is a war that follows me hello 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.410
 So here we are at the pvp faction 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.940
 So here is a castle in a castle 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.480
 basic and we really did not do 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.400
 shit for not being vulgar easy 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.110
 and good brief 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.390
 so here are already factions and 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.459
 a little fifteen faction ago 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.510
 already 75 hours register 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:53.260
 even if only 5 connected so 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.120
 if people bring me pub finally 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.519
 advertise me and report to me 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.799
 people who often stay 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.180
 on the server I'll manage and I 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.650
 will make sure to always arrange them 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.540
 in the sense that I will give them 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.099
 items if they really bring back a lot 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.790
 of people why not put them a 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.290
 grade 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.870
 by the way we'll have a look at the 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.190
 room degrade fast done and so that's it 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.690
 so if you advertise me I 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.280
 rewards you want is no concern 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.280
 besides the anchin room leaves here 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.680
 so here are the grades apps and there I 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.190
 sell an ip on tito so this is all 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.079
 enchanted at the level 10 thousand then in 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.250
 down there are still houses like I 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.489
 you said he was under the bridge 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:38.530
 so we will take this little path 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:40.000
 toulouse sees the device we go down to 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.480
 it is long still that way I will 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.609
 the rope 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.260
 so you see there we come to house of the 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.670
 low that are not yet finished courses 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.440
 and you see with really just the 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:56.220
 structure so here is the little fountain 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:58.660
 there the houses the bridge goes underneath 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.209
 that's what I forgot to 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.370
 to show you to tell you so no he 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.040
 seems to me that I have not forgotten anything about 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.799
 this I tell you come many there will be 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.669
 two ip addresses in in the 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.530
 description an ip address that's called 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.389
 amnesia like the server world and a 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.519
 ip address to numbers in case that one 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.870
 of media year does not work because there is 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.829
 some people who have bugs and 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.960
 when they want to connect with 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.750
 amnesia its mark kang connect of blah 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.060
 blah blah blah blah blah so that's it 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.020
 say goodbye come many that me 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.650
