00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
is a set in neck and you can see it's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.740

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
got a contoured back here and a single

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.170 
got a contoured back here and a single
cutaway<00:01:52.370> let's<00:01:53.370> begin<00:01:53.580> at<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.760> clean<00:01:53.940> sound

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
cutaway let's begin at the clean sound

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.120 
cutaway let's begin at the clean sound
and<00:01:54.420> because<00:01:54.900> these<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.290> active<00:01:55.620> pickups<00:01:55.860> you

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and because these are active pickups you

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.340 
and because these are active pickups you
would<00:01:56.370> think<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:57.030> they<00:01:57.510> would<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.840> kind<00:01:58.260> of

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
would think that they would be kind of

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.250 
would think that they would be kind of
clean<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.770> articulate<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.930> quite<00:02:01.230> the

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
clean and articulate and it's quite the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.570 
clean and articulate and it's quite the
opposite<00:02:01.650> it's<00:02:01.800> actually<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> little<00:02:02.310> more

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
opposite it's actually a little more

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.030 
opposite it's actually a little more
high<00:02:03.000> output<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.480> little<00:02:03.660> dirty<00:02:04.050> so<00:02:04.650> let's<00:02:04.860> hear

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
high output a little dirty so let's hear

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.550 
high output a little dirty so let's hear
what<00:02:05.160> that<00:02:05.190> sounds<00:02:05.670> like

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
what that sounds like

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:27.550
