 our nissan branches and that 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.310
 can you appreciate it 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.080
 in good people let's talk 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.110
 specifically the truck we have seen 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.140
 that has grown in all its dimensions 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.390
 and also what is the interior this without 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.800
 certainly also motivates drives that is 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.260
 much more luxury than it was previously 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.910
 well practically this new nissan 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.520
 patrol brings standard equipment with 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:28.240
 with the highest top of the line range by 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:32.190
 tell you something has a 5600 engine with 317 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.200
 horses hoop rin 20 that has cameras in 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.540
 front side panels has 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.750
 bous sound and seats 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.750
 perforated to be divided in the seats 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.330
 Finally, it is a car that is extremely 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.360
 luxurious that able to compete against the 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.979
 European brands and against other 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.979
 top of the line Japanese that are 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.450
 available on the market 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.520
 Guatemalan and global good if people 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.380
 wants to know more about how they can 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.880
 make an appointment with you now 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.130
 we have 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.780
 units of this vehicle in each of 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.729
 our branches are already starting 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.069
 release nissan majadas or nissan 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.860
 road el salvador so that they can 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.110
 get to see line and something that I wanted 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.450
 comment that the whole part is 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.090
 technology that nissan presents in the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.099
 pattern and in the murano has an effect of 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.290
 waterfall in the rest of the line up of 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.090
 nissan in and is part of the new image 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.950
 that we want to transfer to our 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.340
 consumers and brand lovers 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.050
 here in guatemala in this 2011 good 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.250
 many thanks from ebers and of course 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.500
 congratulations for the event is 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.360
 beautiful actually thank you and they are 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.360
 invited to try them thank you very much 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.010
 we meet juliet irate he is 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.260
 the directly regional director of what 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.060
 what are the shields in the company 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.070
 walmart you are only going to be able to 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.410
 actually explain why you choose 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.460
 this model specifically for this 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.500
 type of shield 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.970
 of course, yes, with pleasure in the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.160
 shield one always look for two 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.170
 parameters one is security and another is 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.460
 safety security is the level of 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.920
 protection that will be placed on 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.570
 vehicle and safety is how is the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.550
 vehicle after having been shielded 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.430
 in the leader levels that there are in 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.320
 Central America a level that is managed 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.690
 much of that protection against ak-47 and 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.790
 m-16 we are talking about a peso 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.490
 approximately 1,400 ibex to be 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.440
 add to the nissan patrol vehicle has 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.750
 Load capacity characteristics of 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.760
 suspension and motor that are optimal 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.400
 for this weight we are talking about that 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.050
 a vehicle with a minimum engine 4000 that 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.270
 which is recommended for that high level of 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.580
 production against with 7 m 16 the duck 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.010
 it has a 5.6 liters of power per 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.740
 so much is let's say optimally 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.700
 trained for that kind of weight 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.200
 obviously what he uses with the shield is 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.200
 gain time then the ability to 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.120
 reaction 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.800
 with that higher level of armor 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.530
 obviously if we put a level of 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.650
 smaller shield is still greater is very 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.760
 well prepared the other obviously is the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.810
 handling how the center of 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.239
 gravity how is the management of 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.680
 vehicle after to damage the weight all 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.180
 vehicles can be eliminated but not 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.950
 all shielding levels apply to 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.630
 all the vehicles when one was looking 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.459
 a high quality or greater shielding 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.810
 protection always wants the center 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.010
 of gravity or how the weight is 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.410
 distributed between the axis of the entrance 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.700
 rear axle is a modification what 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.710
 minimum possible with respect to the original 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.350
 so that the car is obviously the most 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.060
 possible similar to how the client 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.470
 try the good agency I also have the 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.630
 opportunity can see one of his 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.010
 jobs we have here a model 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.540
 fully armored let's talk 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.570
 specifically that this was done 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.550
 truck as not the vintage process 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.200
 has four phases the first is the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.460
 disassembly where we do not 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.380
 We recommend the client come because 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.810
 we practically removed everything and left the 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.820
 vehicle in the skeleton or the shell 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.130
 There, air bags are removed 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.960
 computers boards are removed all 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.270
 the accessories the next phase of 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.860
 body armor where we protect 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.740
 all the cabin for example in this 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.660
 model is shielded from the roof the 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.370
 floor what we call wall of fire 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.810
 front of board all the 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.639
 body all videos so 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.289
 that regardless of the angle by 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.760
 where the impact always comes from 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.639
 bump into ballistic material 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.220
 we call ballistic steel and for 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.840
 another side is the part of the parties 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.340
 the critical areas such as the battery 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.380
 that an impact is received for the 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.270
 vehicle and the tires as you said 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.250
 that equally if they give the tires 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.270
 also for the car what it does not look for is 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.280
 that the client has the time 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.139
 enough to go out in the area 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.150
 risk and obviously that the car never 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.350
 stand still good is something very 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.120
 important that really when one 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.160
 buy an armored car warranty 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.530
 all sensations you have with the 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.820
 mark in sant us with that what 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.710
 we carry is to an agreement where 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.700
 obviously there is a very 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.590
 direct 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.120
 workshop agency and skill 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.350
 Now what we do not want is that the 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.820
 client encounters the problem 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.080
 that often happens that it reaches the 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.910
 agency the law of look at the car is 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.740
 armored is no longer guaranteed that's 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.630
 uncomfortable for the customer are vehicles and 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.520
 are not cheap what we are looking for is that 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.930
 always the customer was introduced and if it is 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.370
 guarantee of the now or the 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.690
 agency obviously with the agreement that 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.420
 we have the client will never go out 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.550
 harmed there is a part that is 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.050
 armored guarantee for everything 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.450
 we modify and that we obviously accept 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.950
 as such and a part that is of the 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.800
 agency or vehicle brand 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.700
 because they are areas that we do not touch 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.530
 when I thank you very much for the information 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.850
 The cro has been very useful for all 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.850
 our viewers thank you very much
