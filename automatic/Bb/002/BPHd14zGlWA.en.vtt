00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 to all good morning agreed upon 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.770
 learn to watch I bring you this video 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.779
 to inform you a couple of things first 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.340
 nothing like the title promises because if 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.769
 my name is because I got tired that the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.240
 son of a bitch of desert say my name and 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.950
 as I do not use more friends but for 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.250
 render but you directly 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.350
 what is my name diego so very good 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.840
 days for people who said a year ago 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.010
 and peak after is the second place of 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.430
 I want to report that there were some 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.140
 problems on youtube and a few days ago 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.599
 first of all but the problem 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.399
 main thing is that it takes a long time in I do not know 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.309
 what is called the process in processing the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.420
 videos and says processing videos 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.420
 basically I leave as four videos 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.239
 to upload and maybe a video upload 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.620
 120 minutes and then the other 8 hours 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.020
 is processing I know with what I 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.430
 recontra remains and I do not know especially the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.719
 videos so that's why I did not upload a video 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.000
 today but that is uploading this video 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.260
 short to tell them so good and 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.390
 then there is also the issue that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.280
 youtube is oversaturated I have the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.810
 connection ok and it tells me that it takes like 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.360
 800 minutes to upload a fucking video 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.430
 as I still follow the peak I say it good 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.950
 that's why you're delaying the videos I'm 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.780
 filming the rock green day left 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.430
 we are doing several replicates a 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.040
 crow surely if we go with the roots 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.750
 and other and good also did this video 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.450
 to inform them that I made a bet 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.740
 with Ivan there we are on the skype Ivan 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.590
 which is to say about the people pretty much 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.890
 like the play or the people that they 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.470
 will make catriel and today they go and the bet is 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.380
 what to see I am learning to play 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.360
 endow and I say is learning quarterly and 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.000
 I think the bet has already said that 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.030
 is the one who first wins a one 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.100
 against each other to term year will 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.700
 have to pay the other alive to me 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.570
 to pay 16 each erp 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.130
 and I 'm going to pay you the 50 x that I 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.020
 is going to take to finance basically everything 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.670
 the channel for a very long time because 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.420
 I told them the lole is easy to 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.539
 to learn 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.610
 dow people can not go to that 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.810
 baldÃ³n because it's just easier and 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.340
 he told me the opposite that the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.110
 lhotse people goes directly to dota 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.020
 because it 's easier so I told him 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.759
 look in a year or so you learn everything 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.799
 on Friday he said surely in the same 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.599
 you turn on and so I said look at me 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.299
 I get into the ones that serve me 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.220
 enough for the channel because there's a lot 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.569
 people who ask me what comes from 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.849
 books lessons I really do not have 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.819
 the most fucking idea and this gives me a very 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.099
 good foot to start I dedicate a 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.450
 year he took me 50 kits because I'm sure 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.209
 that with one year of experience you do not have wings 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.000
 and well Ivan believed the same and we're going 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.760
 in what division states there and the truth 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 that what he says and has no foundation 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.630
 because here if you come diamond of the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.069
 it's still diamond I'm still rising and 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.230
 already within a year 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.410
 Say you will not have chances at the most 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.840
 to be gold 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.900
 it's going to be silver and you know it is 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.430
 skillful but let's see what happens 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.800
 well the description better we leave it 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.360
 for another another time because I have 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.490
 arguing a lot so and that 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.020
 ended the bet so in a year 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.990
 we will have to play and I really do not 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.540
 I want to pay 100 dollars in rpp so 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.190
 let's give the best or see yourself to play more 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.040
 or less in a year we will do 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.630
 the best of 6 or three games scored 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.980
 other sendic games will then be played 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.500
 one game in total and one game in 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.530
 line alternately and the one that ends 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.940
 taking advantage will win so good 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.740
 for reports that said to document 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.930
 my progress has relaxed because I have 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.610
 playing with 60 with curves or I'm 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.290
 uploading the videos to another channel that 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.000
 believe so I create this channel for 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.980
 inform them that I have another channel 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.390
 we want to learn from today and they will see 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.310
 to me your perspective there are not many people 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.950
 that plays lowell so good that 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.380
 basically the video and Ivan means 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.630
 something else 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.790
 If they want to get involved, I'll tell them 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.770
 those that already more or less fit the link 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:50.050
 they are going to laugh a lot because for now it 's 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:52.300
 very bad what teams are not intimidated 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.610
 I wanted to be nothing aggressive for them 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.990
 is missing a lot for now and good and if not 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.750
 can put the channel of Ivan that started 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.160
 recently they also pay tribute to lol 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.360
 he taught people to play me 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.130
 He was teaching to play, I 'm 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.140
 teaching for him more or less like the 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.120
 leather to your curious prize pretty 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.500
 fast so good let's see how 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.420
 whatever the things you want to talk a 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:16.090
 little bit of your channel since we are 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:18.190
 my channels are mr 4 3 6 and bar after 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.630
 like all the links in the valleys and 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.410
 nothing if it's a little abandoned 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.660
 now with the reappearance of season 4 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.540
 I will upload enough tutorials that will 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.820
 can be practical so nothing 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.250
 we see there or in learning to lole ar 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.570
 worth and perfect and then the last thing 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.790
 I wanted to say is that I'm going to continue 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.370
 uploading a daily video so with that 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.110
 do not worry the next is the channel 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.450
 secondary will be there to go 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.720
 going up one in every 20 matches that 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.970
 play so it will be a video per week 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.930
 a video every two videos per week a 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.919
 thing like that 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.650
 so well let's hope it is solved 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.960
 YouTube problems I hope that you 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.780
 like my name I hope I do not get too dense 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.090
 but so I'm going also this in this video 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.040
 that they do not lynch me and I hope they know 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.540
 support the bet so good I hope 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.130
 that you liked have all the 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.520
 links in the description and see you the 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.000
 next 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.000
 bye Bye
