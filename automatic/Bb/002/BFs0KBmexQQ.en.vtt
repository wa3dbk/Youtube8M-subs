00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.200 
there was a time when any off-road
excursions<00:00:16.289> required<00:00:17.130> liberal<00:00:17.609> use<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
excursions required liberal use of the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.910 
excursions required liberal use of the
winch<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:18.630> modern<00:00:18.930> four-wheel<00:00:19.289> drives<00:00:19.650> are

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
winch use is a bit of a rarity but it

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.590 
winch use is a bit of a rarity but it
can<00:00:22.980> still<00:00:23.310> happen<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:24.180> here's<00:00:24.420> an
