 doing this look that to me in what 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.559
 I really liked the truth 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.049
 it was a day that was super boring 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.540

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.880
 I hope you like them like 20n 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.119

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.520
 half orange golden brown down and 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.169

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.919
 If you want to swim, do not start 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.809
 previously what I did was apply 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.360
 a concealer to unify all my 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.330
 eyelid and now that I'm going to put is the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.010
 color of your dni come the number 30 yes 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:46.640
 what is this color like and just what 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.640
 I'm going to apply with my fingers all over the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.190
 eyelid mobile 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.230
 let's move on to what would be shadows in 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.579
 this occasion to use only the palette 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.999
 of color that brings all these colors 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.820
 If it is the 16 color mark and we are going to 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:07.210
 use one how much by we will start to 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.900
 use this that is like a reddish 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:15.600
 We are going to drink a lot and I'm going to 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.590
 concentrate right in the center of my eye 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.590
 in this way 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.060
 will clean brochita and I will go blurring 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.560
 a little the edges 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.560
 towards the sides 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.130
 the next color that I'm going to use is 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.630
 this one that is next to the little one and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.000
 what to explain exactly with the same 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.730
 brush I will take quite a quantity the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.260
 product and I'm going to apply it in what I 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.260
 was left of the lacrimal space 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.300
 in this way and I'm going to lower it a bit 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.960
 down here he does not feel like taking that 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:05.270
 exterminator well in black pencil and 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.270
 I'm going to roll every girl and water 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.440
 and to tarnish delineate a bit now 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.440
 out of my eye 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.280
 and now I 'm going to blur it a little bit 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.280
 in the place only 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.390
 and above sign that says I will 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.770
 apply this lovely green color 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.500
 It's beautiful we took the shot 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:45.200
 with the tip of the brush and then go 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.200
 applying doing from side to side 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.770
 my that in our way then what I'm going 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.890
 to do is to use this moralito 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.780
 you stop to paddle like that but do not know 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.520
 can appreciate the color 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.090
 and you can apply it in the part that does not 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.800
 I have raised free 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.170
 in this part itself and I'm taking it 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.690
 towards the depth we are going to 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.690
 concentrate well on this part 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.420
 all right 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.200
 and now I'm going to take a science 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.200
 depth 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.930
 and then I used a skewer 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.770
 whatever they have to determine me 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.980
 even to take this flat that is for 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:51.650
 for shadows and stop the union a bit 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:55.629
 of green and moral and is here 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.629
 I'm going to play the edges well 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.090
 a little bit more 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.550
 after using my umbrella to 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.250
 illuminate the arch of the eyebrows that 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.250
 I always use it and I'm going to light it 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.209
 and apply mascara this time 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.209
 using this urban delete 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.740
 and I'm going to apply it to both my eyelashes 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.740
 superior and interior 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.440
 and good girls have all been for 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.630
 the option has been chosen above all that is 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.430
 very useful and can use 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.530
 this look for any kind of occasion 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.290
 or event for what you want the 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.010
 true that I loved how it was 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.020
 unfortunately, there is no camera 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.000
 can appreciate exactly how are the 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.950
 colors but the truth that they are enough 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.600
 striking above all the green below 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.400
 it's divine I love that green and good 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.290
 that nothing this is the final finish 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.940
 I hope that the route where we are 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.940
 watching in the next video bay
