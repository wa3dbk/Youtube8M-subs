00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.410
 the report's chor marjorie tie I'll show you two 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.389
 video to ager force '9 600 of ater 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.109
 and in addition to 1 4 8 3 0 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.669
 if you're looking for a board that has a little more than the basics but 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.039
 also does not want to spend that future on this whole steel issue. 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.460
 options on the market 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.740
 they have in construction more or less similar to this very fine body 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.550
 and that's why they fit only an ex-steering wheel edu cabinet of your monkey 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.390
 are the so-called low profile cards 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.950
 besides not taking up so much space 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.590
 the plates also do not heat much like those models with two 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.380
 graphic processors and speaking some technical features 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.190
 they are also very similar 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.040
 the two have 512 average of 19 babies of three and are built with a 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.250
 55 nanometer processor 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.240
 only here the geforces leaves in front of the body of memory 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.320
 which has 900 megahertz 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.560
 while that which 4 3 0 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.860
 has only 575 mega refi 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.340
 but at the time we'll see who took the best even was this board of amb 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.890
 in the tests that we did here in infolab and with the crisis that is the game 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.600
 heavier today 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.510
 this board did 16 frames per second more or less while the amd model 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:31.929
 day 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.950
 did 14 ps 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.520
 already in the teeth marks the two boards practically tied 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.820
 they made 1,500 and 500 points 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.870
 others on average in the other and machines in 3d which is the best program for 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.369
 evaluate the 3d graphics 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.020
 the collections of the two are identical they have 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.210
 two vehicle doors in one s10 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.130
 It's good to know that before you buy such a board you need a 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.420
 source in your midfield 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.400
 who has at least 550 vacancies 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.880
 to 9,613 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.520
 is in stores for about 550 reais 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.390
 and 4 8 3 0 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.530
 costing an average of 500 reais depending on the manufacturer
