again<00:00:50.340> tough<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.120> get<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.510> shot<00:00:52.250> I'm<00:00:53.250> sitting<00:00:53.579> up

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
again tough to get a shot I'm sitting up

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.850 
again tough to get a shot I'm sitting up
here<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.719> don't<00:00:55.110> know<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> be

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
here it I don't know it's going to be

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.880 
here it I don't know it's going to be
tight<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.250> that's<00:00:56.760> tiny<00:00:57.120> house<00:00:57.360> smokes<00:00:57.890> gonna

tight but that's tiny house smokes gonna
be<00:00:59.280> cozy<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:01.050> guess<00:01:01.170> probably<00:01:01.590> what<00:01:01.829> I'm

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
be cozy so I guess probably what I'm

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.290 
be cozy so I guess probably what I'm
going<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.129> do<00:01:02.219> today<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.460> shop<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> window

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
going to do today is shop for a window

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.750 
going to do today is shop for a window
for<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.140> didn't<00:01:04.350> know<00:01:04.439> exactly<00:01:04.640> what<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
for that we didn't know exactly what the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.250 
for that we didn't know exactly what the
dimensions<00:01:06.030> were<00:01:06.390> gonna<00:01:06.540> look<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.930> or<00:01:07.170> what

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
dimensions were gonna look like or what

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.390 
dimensions were gonna look like or what
kind<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.470> window<00:01:07.619> was<00:01:07.799> going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.010> fit<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.189> there

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
kind of window was going to fit in there

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.920 
kind of window was going to fit in there
so<00:01:08.670> that's<00:01:09.150> kind<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:09.630> I'm<00:01:09.750> gonna

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
so that's kind of what I'm gonna

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.560 
so that's kind of what I'm gonna
probably<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.400> go<00:01:11.520> find<00:01:11.700> today<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.270> we
