have one you can get one for a dollar at

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
have one you can get one for a dollar at
the<00:01:07.439> dollar<00:01:08.189> tree<00:01:09.020> that's<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.170> minute<00:01:11.270> see

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the dollar tree that's what a minute see

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.370 
the dollar tree that's what a minute see
if<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.540> actually<00:01:12.570> fits<00:01:13.110> my<00:01:13.770> phone<00:01:15.380> so

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
if it actually fits my phone so

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.039 
if it actually fits my phone so
hopefully<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.400> does<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.360> find<00:01:21.659> where<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
hopefully it does so you find where the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.020 
hopefully it does so you find where the
slits<00:01:22.350> are<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:23.369> all<00:01:23.520> right<00:01:23.700> though<00:01:23.850> like

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
slits are it's all right though like

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.490 
slits are it's all right though like
there's<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.390> cutout<00:01:24.600> slit<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
there's a cutout slit and then the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.819 
there's a cutout slit and then the
little<00:01:25.770> volume<00:01:26.670> buttons<00:01:27.390> are<00:01:27.570> there<00:01:27.840> there's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
little volume buttons are there there's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.870 
little volume buttons are there there's
a<00:01:28.920> wide<00:01:29.310> slit<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> bottom<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.930> charge<00:01:31.409> it

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
a wide slit for the bottom to charge it

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.050 
a wide slit for the bottom to charge it
um<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.799> mean<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.369> don't<00:01:35.520> know<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.939> other

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
um so I mean I don't know if the other

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.789 
um so I mean I don't know if the other
ones<00:01:36.240> are<00:01:36.360> more<00:01:36.509> snug<00:01:36.810> than<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.619> can

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
ones are more snug than that you can

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.640 
ones are more snug than that you can
kind<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.100> play<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.869> maybe<00:01:39.869> maybe<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
kind of just play with it maybe maybe a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.310 
kind of just play with it maybe maybe a
little<00:01:40.829> bit<00:01:40.979> looser<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.729> my<00:01:41.880> opinion<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> you

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
little bit looser in my opinion so you

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.069 
little bit looser in my opinion so you
may<00:01:43.560> want<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.909> different<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.810> right

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
may want to get a different this right

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.660 
may want to get a different this right
here<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.470> docking<00:01:46.979> station<00:01:47.009> that's<00:01:47.549> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
here is a docking station that's a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.469 
here is a docking station that's a
dollar<00:01:48.170> docking<00:01:49.170> stations<00:01:50.180> should<00:01:51.180> really

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
dollar docking stations should really

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.539 
dollar docking stations should really
only<00:01:51.600> bit<00:01:51.869> off<00:01:52.020> because<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:52.799> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
only bit off because it's just like the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.600 
only bit off because it's just like the
plug<00:01:54.530> anyway<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.590> I'm<00:01:56.009> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.159> see<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.520> this

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
plug anyway so I'm going to see if this

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.550 
plug anyway so I'm going to see if this
will<00:01:56.729> actually<00:01:56.909> charge<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.420> my<00:01:57.450> phone<00:01:57.600> docking

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
will actually charge up my phone docking

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.420 
will actually charge up my phone docking
station<00:01:59.329> sync<00:02:00.329> your<00:02:00.420> iPad<00:02:00.899> or<00:02:01.439> charge<00:02:02.280> your

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
station sync your iPad or charge your
