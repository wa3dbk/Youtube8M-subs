00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
a lot different though than spunky or

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.180 
a lot different though than spunky or
rogue<00:01:00.300> legacy<00:01:00.620> we're<00:01:01.620> definitely<00:01:01.739> going<00:01:01.980> for

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
rogue legacy we're definitely going for

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.709 
rogue legacy we're definitely going for
a<00:01:02.250> more<00:01:02.460> classic<00:01:02.969> adventure<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.600> you'd

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
a more classic adventure that you'd

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.690 
a more classic adventure that you'd
expect<00:01:04.080> from<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.439> Castlevania<00:01:05.159> or<00:01:05.280> Metroid

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
expect from like Castlevania or Metroid

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.609 
expect from like Castlevania or Metroid
or<00:01:05.790> any<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.970> those<00:01:06.060> games<00:01:06.320> but<00:01:07.320> we're<00:01:07.439> using

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
or any of those games but we're using

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.960 
or any of those games but we're using
the<00:01:07.770> procedural<00:01:08.159> generation<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.700> make<00:01:08.850> sure

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the procedural generation to make sure

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.300 
the procedural generation to make sure
that<00:01:09.180> every<00:01:09.450> new<00:01:10.080> game<00:01:10.320> isn't<00:01:10.770> exactly<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that every new game isn't exactly the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.280 
that every new game isn't exactly the
same<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> last<00:01:11.850> time<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.210> played<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:13.140> when

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
same as the last time you played so when

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.870 
same as the last time you played so when
you<00:01:13.350> first<00:01:13.560> start<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> new<00:01:13.950> game<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you first start a new game we have a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.609 
you first start a new game we have a
massive<00:01:15.090> repository<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.960> possible<00:01:16.380> rooms

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
massive repository of possible rooms

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.289 
massive repository of possible rooms
that<00:01:16.890> could<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.189> each<00:01:17.280> area<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.850> we

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that could be in each area and we

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.480 
that could be in each area and we
generate<00:01:18.750> completely<00:01:19.560> different<00:01:20.189> dungeons

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
generate completely different dungeons

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.179 
generate completely different dungeons
each<00:01:20.700> time<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:22.409> only<00:01:22.560> happens<00:01:22.830> once<00:01:23.040> at

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
each time so that only happens once at

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.260 
each time so that only happens once at
the<00:01:23.220> beginning<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.670> game<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.150> you

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the beginning of the game and then you

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.179 
the beginning of the game and then you
can<00:01:24.420> save<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.049> start<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.590> die<00:01:25.710> from<00:01:26.009> where

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
can save and start if you die from where

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.640 
can save and start if you die from where
you<00:01:26.280> last<00:01:26.430> saved<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:27.780> totally<00:01:28.439> rogue

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
you last saved so it's not totally rogue

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.350 
you last saved so it's not totally rogue
where<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.979> start<00:01:29.070> all<00:01:29.310> over<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.270> are

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
where you just start all over but we are

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.789 
where you just start all over but we are
planning<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.750> adding<00:01:30.840> an<00:01:31.110> extra<00:01:31.229> modes<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
planning on adding an extra modes of the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
planning on adding an extra modes of the
game<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.280> people<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.210> stuff<00:01:33.420> feel

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
game so people that like that stuff feel

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.440 
game so people that like that stuff feel
free<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.860> let's<00:01:35.729> say<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> play<00:01:36.150> through<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
free so let's say I play through the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.359 
free so let's say I play through the
entire<00:01:36.479> game<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.500> does<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.890> an<00:01:38.009> end<00:01:38.159> game
