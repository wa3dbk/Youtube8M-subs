00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.029
 it's a artemis soil methods and today they 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.790
 I bring some survival zombies a 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.480
 village is a round the round of 20 to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.760
 21 and as you can see here but I start 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.650
 that had killed me before and I'm going to 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.270
 teach the strategy that good that I have 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.970
 seen that it works very well on this map 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.250
 it's because I did not know it here because here 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.900
 you have is for only good in a player 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.250
 a single good player a little bit of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.830
 stamina but this mine is not necessary 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.120
 because good is not that you can not see 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.460
 a lot because you do not have to run a lot 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.649
 you just have to jump a lot you know 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.239
 to destroy it xe so much to jump because 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.089
 there is fire east and you touch a lot 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.129
 the noses but good if it goes jumping 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.889
 it's not very difficult to dodge either 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.569
 Well, as you can see, this would be the movement 

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:50.639
 jump around here and go around 

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:52.499
 turn the zombie around in this way 

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:54.089
 As you can see in the video I want to go 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.859
 noble and the back door to avoid 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.870
 it is possible to come thomis from behind 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.839
 but you can open any problem and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.789
 It works the same and good as you know what 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.500
 that this strategy would be lacking 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.060
 a thunder to eliminate them all from 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 hit but good 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.140
 maybe effective so what happens is that 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.720
 so many more fundos to download them with a 25 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.360
 no matter how much better it is and so 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.310
 this is the strategy that individual give 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.570
 back is with the zombies in this 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.619
 corner can also be done in the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.630
 part of the other side the part where it is 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.340
 Titan's ladder to get to 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.530
 practice that would be the other side too 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.630
 good for the turns in two players 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.729
 goal would recommend a one here and another 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.700
 there and I do not think there were many 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.549
 problems to endure enough since 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.709
 as you see in this game is correct and is 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.869
 a tremendous rage because you run into 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:46.439
 them and you say oh my god to give the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.700
 come back here and as you can see, it 's very hard to try 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.069
 and jumping so that you do not touch the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.799
 Noses the fire since it is very very bad 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.209
 but we are touching our noses a lot 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.030
 good as you see this was just a video 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:04.190
 explanatory I hope you liked it 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.190
 shoot spin around 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.620
 I
