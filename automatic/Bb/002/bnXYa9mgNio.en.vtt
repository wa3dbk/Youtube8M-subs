00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
screws to the case oh and here's a

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.370 
screws to the case oh and here's a
little<00:00:12.210> tip<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.809> can<00:00:12.929> have<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.080> bunch<00:00:13.290> of

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
little tip you can have a bunch of

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.470 
little tip you can have a bunch of
screws<00:00:13.679> left<00:00:13.920> over<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.700> use<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> magnet

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
screws left over so I just use a magnet

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.910 
screws left over so I just use a magnet
to<00:00:15.509> scoop<00:00:15.900> them<00:00:16.020> all<00:00:16.170> up<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.500> hold<00:00:16.710> them<00:00:16.830> in

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
to scoop them all up and hold them in

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.470 
to scoop them all up and hold them in
place<00:00:16.949> now<00:00:17.550> once<00:00:17.730> you've<00:00:17.880> got<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.150> open

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
place now once you've got that open

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.580 
place now once you've got that open
you're<00:00:18.840> going<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.020> look<00:00:19.109> for<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> small

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
you're going to look for the small

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.290 
you're going to look for the small
circuit<00:00:20.010> board<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.430> remove<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.060> two<00:00:21.270> screws

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
circuit board and remove the two screws

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.660 
circuit board and remove the two screws
so<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.350> access<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> other<00:00:23.039> side<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.460> it

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
so we can access the other side of it

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.609 
so we can access the other side of it
we're<00:00:24.269> going<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> be<00:00:24.539> using<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.869> LED<00:00:25.380> that

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
we're going to be using the LED that

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.830 
we're going to be using the LED that
goes<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.160> scroll<00:00:26.550> lock<00:00:26.880> key<00:00:27.240> because

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
goes to the scroll lock key because

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.019 
goes to the scroll lock key because
that's<00:00:28.230> pretty<00:00:28.529> much<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.830> useless<00:00:29.160> key<00:00:29.550> now<00:00:29.820> if

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
that's pretty much a useless key now if

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.250 
that's pretty much a useless key now if
you<00:00:30.150> don't<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.449> one<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.689> could<00:00:30.990> also<00:00:31.109> use

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
you don't have one you could also use

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.170 
you don't have one you could also use
your<00:00:31.800> num<00:00:32.040> lock<00:00:32.250> key<00:00:32.309> we're<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.120> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
your num lock key we're going to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.360 
your num lock key we're going to
desolder<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.899> LED<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.620> goes<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.010> scroll

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
desolder the LED that goes to the scroll

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.060 
desolder the LED that goes to the scroll
lock<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.910> remove<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.570> LED<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.290> hang<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.920> to

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
lock and remove the LED and hang on to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.590 
lock and remove the LED and hang on to
it<00:00:38.190> put<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.550> your<00:00:38.670> parts<00:00:38.940> bin<00:00:39.120> because<00:00:39.329> it's

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it put it in your parts bin because it's

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.959 
it put it in your parts bin because it's
a<00:00:39.660> perfectly<00:00:40.079> good<00:00:40.200> LED<00:00:40.920> now<00:00:41.579> you're<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:41.910> to
