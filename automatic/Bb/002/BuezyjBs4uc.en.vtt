00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:13.320
 you think you are untouchable I am 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.320
 here to destroy an illusion 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.980
 that's an announcement after 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.690
 ubisoft in recent months many 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.520
 Scenes from the open world mechanics of 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.260
 Hot stocks showed free roaming 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.210
 This developer's usage is called 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.830
 there was finally in the context of e3 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.960
 to see a story missions again 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.240
 In it, hacker apps become one 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.829
 certain t-bone contacted the turn 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.630
 apparently has information about alcon 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.370
 sister, in turn, apparently became 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070
 from an unknown person or 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 Organization is kidnapped and we look 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.070
 First of all, just like at all 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.880
 to roll where with this mysterious 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.880
 Stieber and arrives 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.950
 that is not so easy 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.960
 because currently is a large-scale 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.370
 Search for the rehden must in this 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.350
 so watch out for the funky black flitzer 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.160
 that his head is not straight 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.930
 blue light worth or the likewise 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.340
 requested helicopters ins 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.640
 headlight light plus concerns 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.440
 does he do that anyway then that happens 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.870
 helicopter radio your location directly 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.310
 to the central through and pulled 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.670
 then pretty silly from the 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.650
 Laundry 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.840
 if just with full throttle in a tunnel 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.490
 crumbles that buys the smartphone 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 hacker though a bit of time though 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.430
 At some point he has to come out again 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.479
 out of this tunnel and there the cops 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.340
 meanwhile the car and that 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.140
 license plate now know a whole 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.790
 stupid idea when he's on the way 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.890
 For example, it would turn off somewhere 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.360
 behind the gate there in the front left he 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.890
 With his cell phone you just drive up 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.450
 lets and then closed again 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.450
 solved problems for the time being 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.100
 the emphasis is on for now 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.200
 because such a large-scale search 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.909
 a pretty stubborn affair 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.290
 has barely got through the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.299
 Backdoor access to a nearby 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.530
 Located cafÃ© invite provides flickers 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.710
 even his photo through the tv 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.710
 news 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.179
 this guy you think mini moment 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.860
 times the face so I know takes 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.390
 just in a short mobile phone before the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.860
 Civil courage citizen the police 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.560
 alarmed the whole nice escape 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.660
 ruined 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.430
 just after these strains then 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.080
 finally in teams apartment complex 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.000
 hacked doors are finally something for 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.440
 Stone Age people are waiting for that too 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.420
 next problem because after a short 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.920
 but at least halfway revealing 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.840
 chat with his latent brain 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.880
 silly technician are already the 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.110
 bad guys in the door and end had 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.849
 Help bonn out of the mud 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.519
 It is still quite simple in this scene 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.140
 just that technology dingsbums over there 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.519
 bring to the quake and the farmers in the 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.200
 right moment signal that the 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.580
 bad guys just busy 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.530
 are the mysterious beeping too 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.540
 examine a bit more complicated 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.489
 the whole thing will be just when in 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.959
 A camera is chasing his buddy 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.769
 the reinforcement that has since arrived 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.390
 to pilot over 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.250
 he can, for example, the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.080
 alarm system of a car trigger or 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.610
 such company signs with the mobile phone after 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.810
 drive up around timon one 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.810
 to provide coverage 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.519
 Alternatively, of course, he can also do it himself 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.989
 so palpable become this opponent 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.720
 with a just mentioned car alarm 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.580
 distract yourself log out on the camera 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.030
 and then him on a very old-fashioned 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.840
 way, the train finally provides the 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.640
 curve scratched 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.260
 then also needs to eden we see from the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.790
 whole mess comes out now 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.849
 have in the cops again visor 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.140
 take off would be an option a second 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.549
 Possibility consists in per 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.349
 keystroke the support of a 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.390
 to request human mitspieler 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.430
 this example is like the 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.560
 clarity hot dogs straight on the ipad 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.760
 plays and for our next next 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.510
 this curious police helicopter 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.510
 hectare 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.890
 and his crew carts 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.290
 then pretty rude with 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.520
 Traffic planners braked in one 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.140
 certain frame is with these 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.670
 optional pop elements also one 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.830
 communication between the players 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.540
 what possible claire just on her ipad 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.140
 tip appears for the very same game 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.209
 a billboard idea but if there in the 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.670
 online reality then actually wants 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.450
 then it stands or maybe something like that 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.340
 the free at times left undecided 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.200
 In terms of multiplayer mode, it works 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.450
 you only cooperative but also as 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.310
 duel in this example is just from 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.989
 hacked another player and must 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.730
 first find out where this hacker 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.230
 at all, because he sees for him 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.230
 like a stink-normal civilian 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.050
 By the way, that's pretty helpful 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.250
 the ubiquitous surveillance cameras 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.890
 is the damned hacker then 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.370
 creates a very classic 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.370
 Chase on the program 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.389
 Of course we can do the same 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.250
 hang in other players 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.840
 they do not notice that at first 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.220
 because the whole thing becomes critical 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.860
 when we actually download it 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.509
 the beginning is the one started 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.280
 he keeps other players the same 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.319
 Note as we are in front of him and makes himself 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.699
 looking for and is the download 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.199
 progress in the upper left 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.180
 screen corner at 100 percent 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.840
 So we should be better 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.240
 do not let that be unmasked with the 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.130
 unmask is baroque as a thing of 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.660
 the example of this difficult 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.610
 Girl traders also sing a song 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.610
 could have fun in jail buddy 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.439
 b
