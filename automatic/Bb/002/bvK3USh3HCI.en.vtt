00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.400
 If you want to sustain open growth, 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.500
 the kind we have been involved in for the past 200 years or more, 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.000
 then you need to have continuous innovation. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Innovation has to be done in time to prevent collapse. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.300
 Otherwise, you will collapse. 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.500
 And then there is another problem. Here he is: 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.800
 Remember when I said: the more you grow, 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.000
 the faster life is. Therefore, climbing on one of these curves, 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.300
 the first curve, life is getting faster. 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.200
 And then you need to make that breakthrough change. 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.700
 Unfortunately, the time between these innovations, 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.700
 this cycle of innovations has to get shorter and shorter. 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.400
 So it's not just your life that is getting faster, 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.000
 but you have to make innovations faster and faster. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.300
 So these points, from here I can not point there, 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.700
 but these points between the innovations, what they mean, 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.000
 are getting closer and closer. In a slightly different way, 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.200
 an innovative change that has taken time to 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 thousand years to be developed, 20 thousand years ago, 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.600
 or 100 years to be developed, so 100 years ago, 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.700
 now only takes, perhaps, 20 years to be developed. 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.200
 Now. 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.700
 So, 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.900
 what we perceive is that, through our social interactions 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.600
 and this extraordinary phenomenon we invented called cities, 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.000
 It brings us together to create ideas. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.200
 and to have that continuous positive return between us, 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.800
 while a collective, effectively generated the following: 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.400
 has made the clock we run faster and faster 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.700
 in a systematic, measurable and continuous manner. 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.400
 And the question is: can we keep track of this watch? 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.000
 Therefore, in a slightly different way, as a metaphor, 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.800
 It's like you're living in a mill. 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.400
 and this mill was going faster and faster. 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.800
 So you have to run faster and faster. 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.300
 And then, at a certain moment, you, in fact, have to jump 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.600
 from that mill to another, which is going even faster. 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.900
 And then you have to accelerate on it 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.500
 and jump again. And you have to keep doing this. 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.300
 And that's pretty much the world we invented. 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.000
 The question is, can we continue to do this?
