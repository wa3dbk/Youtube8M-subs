00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.280
 copper tone so orange lipstick 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.559

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.140
 It was to start the game, but I'm going

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.120

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.549
 eyebrow with that pearl shadow so 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.860
 Our policy, Daniks, I'm going to put

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.310
 just below the eyebrow 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.409
 If you do not like it, just use more. 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.630
 dark pay with spin cuddly sky already gives 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.450
 a spy so more human 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.540
 I'll paste this durex into the makeup 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.939
 Be very tight, very quiet and voice. 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.100
 the game that had been placed before with 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.960
 the very cute brush for shade does not 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.950
 stay marked because 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.229
 creamy 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.960
 now I put on top and will surround half 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.610
 hard better human symptom 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.430
 I'll get this brown shadow that has a 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.009
 very warm tone half my tone of tile 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.220
 so I'll apply it to my car with 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.020
 and bristles brush and soon in 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.210
 then I'll see with the smoking brush 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.530
 to spread this shadow and do that 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.530
 what a gradient we like 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.800
 and was repeating this process until you find 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.050
 It's good until I like the color 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.200
 repeat more or less four times this 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.450
 process now apply the black shadow on the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.690
 moving eyelid of an opaque black shadow 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.490
 but you can use the device too 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.320
 always remembering to leave it very close 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.480
 of the tape with this potential well 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.120
 I was little, I was fading the shadow 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.880
 she starts mixing with 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.800
 brown for a very soft thing 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.650
 means the black supermarket and a 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.990
 rolls up there is an exercise 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.000
 Patience goes that we send humans 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.000
 I smoke thinking you think it's cool 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.910
 now I'm going to get that brown shadow that is 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.160
 a little clearer to give the 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.470
 final gradient alliance that arrives at 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.000

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.680
 Hot, it's still pretty cool. 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.660
 now had tape to not get this 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.970
 thing very marked I picked cotton 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.430
 and I was rubbing there until a 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.180
 bit made a simple outline with 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.800
