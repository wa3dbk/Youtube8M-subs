00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300 

so<00:00:00.989> i'm<00:00:01.170> going<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.380> show<00:00:01.620> you<00:00:01.650> real<00:00:02.010> quick<00:00:02.040> what

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
so i'm going to show you real quick what

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.849 
so i'm going to show you real quick what
I've<00:00:02.610> been<00:00:02.700> working<00:00:02.970> on<00:00:03.360> with<00:00:03.659> raspberry<00:00:04.650> pi

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
I've been working on with raspberry pi

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.000 
I've been working on with raspberry pi
and<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.520> are<00:00:05.759> play<00:00:06.029> software<00:00:06.540> if<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.770> come

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
and the are play software if you come

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.629 
and the are play software if you come
over<00:00:08.160> here<00:00:08.309> you<00:00:08.610> will<00:00:09.150> see<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.410> have<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
over here you will see that I have the

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.150 
over here you will see that I have the
Raspberry<00:00:12.090> Pi<00:00:12.590> plugged<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.280> just<00:00:14.910> hdmi<00:00:15.690> and

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
Raspberry Pi plugged in to just hdmi and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.370 
Raspberry Pi plugged in to just hdmi and
ethernet<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.520> power<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.779> power<00:00:18.990> cable

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
ethernet and power the power cable

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.580 
ethernet and power the power cable
actually<00:00:19.710> goes<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.490> TV<00:00:20.720> so<00:00:21.720> you're<00:00:22.470> not

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
actually goes to the TV so you're not

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.189 
actually goes to the TV so you're not
wasting<00:00:22.830> power<00:00:23.220> when<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.519> TV's<00:00:23.910> not<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.210> so

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
wasting power when the TV's not on so

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.310 
wasting power when the TV's not on so
I'll<00:00:25.289> go<00:00:25.439> ahead<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.619> turn<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.070> TV<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:28.429> and

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
I'll go ahead and turn the TV on and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.010 
I'll go ahead and turn the TV on and
because<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.560> way<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.910> TV<00:00:33.239> cycles<00:00:33.750> power

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
because of the way the TV cycles power

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.799 
because of the way the TV cycles power
as<00:00:34.350> its<00:00:34.559> booting<00:00:34.860> up<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.610> takes<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.210> few<00:00:36.570> extra

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
as its booting up it takes a few extra

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.220 
as its booting up it takes a few extra
seconds<00:00:37.410> for<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.829> actually<00:00:38.719> power<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
seconds for it to actually power on the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.670 
seconds for it to actually power on the
pie

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.140 

you<00:00:48.680> can<00:00:48.860> see<00:00:49.070> it's<00:00:49.220> already<00:00:49.400> showing<00:00:50.680> my

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
you can see it's already showing my

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.979 
you can see it's already showing my
cable<00:00:53.150> box<00:00:53.329> here<00:00:54.100> and<00:00:55.100> now<00:00:55.700> it's<00:00:55.940> powering<00:00:56.780> on

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
cable box here and now it's powering on

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:18.830 
cable box here and now it's powering on
the<00:00:57.110> Phi

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.700 

so<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> pie<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.770> probably<00:01:20.719> just<00:01:21.719> about<00:01:21.840> booted

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
so the pie is probably just about booted

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.490 
so the pie is probably just about booted
up<00:01:22.859> now<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> go<00:01:24.929> ahead<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.229> my

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
up now so I'm going to go ahead on my

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.349 
up now so I'm going to go ahead on my
iPad<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.399> go<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.329> the<00:01:27.719> YouTube<00:01:28.079> app<00:01:28.469> and<00:01:29.359> to

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
iPad and go to the YouTube app and to

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:35.749 
iPad and go to the YouTube app and to
pick<00:01:30.569> a<00:01:30.600> video<00:01:34.100> I'm<00:01:35.100> actually<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.700> to

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
pick a video I'm actually going to

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.690 
pick a video I'm actually going to
choose<00:01:36.500> 1080p<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:39.679> guy<00:01:40.679> a<00:01:40.709> little<00:01:40.950> airplay<00:01:41.429> icon

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
choose 1080p a guy a little airplay icon

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.179 
choose 1080p a guy a little airplay icon
here<00:01:42.740> send<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:43.950> Raspberry<00:01:44.429> Pi<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.890> shows

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
here send to the Raspberry Pi it shows

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.120 
here send to the Raspberry Pi it shows
the<00:01:47.429> airplay<00:01:47.819> thingy<00:01:50.659> and<00:01:52.130> automatically

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the airplay thingy and automatically

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.520 
the airplay thingy and automatically
switches<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.819> input

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
switches to that input

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:20.780 
switches to that input
plays<00:01:56.430> back<00:01:56.790> flawlessly<00:01:57.780> 1080p<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.640> has

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
plays back flawlessly 1080p and it has

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.370 
plays back flawlessly 1080p and it has
switched<00:02:21.060> back<00:02:21.950> that's<00:02:22.950> pretty<00:02:23.190> much<00:02:23.310> it
