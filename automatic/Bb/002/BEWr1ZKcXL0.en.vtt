a<00:00:48.920> great<00:00:49.100> measure<00:00:49.550> of<00:00:49.760> how<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:49.910> frame<00:00:50.329> and

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
a great measure of how the frame and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.030 
a great measure of how the frame and
suspension<00:00:50.960> are<00:00:51.500> likely<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.219> work<00:00:52.370> together

its<00:00:55.040> forged<00:00:55.460> assumption<00:00:55.969> that<00:00:56.000> anyone<00:00:56.390> who

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
its forged assumption that anyone who

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.500 
its forged assumption that anyone who
buys<00:00:56.780> a<00:00:56.809> truck<00:00:57.550> might<00:00:58.550> actually<00:00:58.760> like<00:00:59.120> to<00:00:59.269> use

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
it like one and to that end that could

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.819 
it like one and to that end that could
easily<00:01:02.030> include<00:01:02.510> recreation<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:03.470> if<00:01:03.710> your

easily include recreation and if your

easily include recreation and if your
recreation<00:01:04.399> is<00:01:04.519> off-roading<00:01:05.030> we<00:01:05.600> decided<00:01:06.050> to

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
recreation is off-roading we decided to

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
set up a scenario for you that quite

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.240 
set up a scenario for you that quite
frankly<00:01:08.149> is<00:01:08.479> easy<00:01:08.899> to<00:01:09.140> have<00:01:09.290> happen<00:01:09.320> see

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
frankly is easy to have happen see

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.760 
frankly is easy to have happen see

mother nature plays hardball to that end

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.770 
mother nature plays hardball to that end
we<00:01:12.890> took<00:01:13.040> all<00:01:13.310> three<00:01:13.520> of<00:01:13.700> these<00:01:13.789> trucks<00:01:14.119> drove

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
we took all three of these trucks drove

now<00:01:22.190> you're<00:01:22.340> seeing<00:01:22.520> yourself<00:01:22.940> okay<00:01:23.360> I

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
now you're seeing yourself okay I

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.840 
now you're seeing yourself okay I
understand<00:01:24.110> that<00:01:24.170> that<00:01:24.410> could<00:01:24.590> happen<00:01:24.850> makes

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
understand that that could happen makes

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.609 
understand that that could happen makes
a<00:01:25.940> great<00:01:26.210> comparison<00:01:26.600> on<00:01:26.929> frame<00:01:27.170> stiffness

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
a great comparison on frame stiffness

a great comparison on frame stiffness
you<00:01:27.800> paid<00:01:28.220> for<00:01:28.460> frame<00:01:28.729> let's<00:01:29.210> see<00:01:29.360> if<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.509> got

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
you paid for frame let's see if you got

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.440 
you paid for frame let's see if you got
some<00:01:30.020> we<00:01:30.890> add<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.100> green<00:01:31.490> tape<00:01:31.729> to<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.060> tailgate

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
some we add a green tape to the tailgate

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.090 
some we add a green tape to the tailgate
here<00:01:32.569> of<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.780> Toyota<00:01:33.080> Tundra<00:01:33.319> I'd<00:01:33.860> like<00:01:34.009> you

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
here of the Toyota Tundra I'd like you

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.680 
here of the Toyota Tundra I'd like you
to<00:01:34.190> compare<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:34.670> line<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.179> the<00:01:35.270> green<00:01:35.479> tape

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
to compare that line to the green tape

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.050 
to compare that line to the green tape
that<00:01:35.840> we<00:01:35.929> compared<00:01:36.289> on<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.800> cab<00:01:37.039> do<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.819> see

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
that we compared on the cab do you see

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.300 
that we compared on the cab do you see
the<00:01:38.210> distortion<00:01:38.539> I'm<00:01:38.899> talking<00:01:39.289> about<00:01:39.350> where's

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
the distortion I'm talking about where's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.460 
the distortion I'm talking about where's
the<00:01:40.490> beef<00:01:40.729> notice<00:01:41.600> that<00:01:41.690> the<00:01:41.840> tailgate<00:01:42.259> line

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
the beef notice that the tailgate line

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.950 
the beef notice that the tailgate line
is<00:01:42.710> not<00:01:43.069> parallel<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.909> that<00:01:43.940> of<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.390> cab<00:01:44.659> line

is not parallel to that of the cab line
what<00:01:45.560> you're<00:01:45.709> literally<00:01:46.160> seeing<00:01:46.459> is<00:01:46.729> the

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
what you're literally seeing is the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.749 
what you're literally seeing is the
frame<00:01:47.479> bending<00:01:47.840> or<00:01:48.229> twisting<00:01:48.800> it's<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.429> direct

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
frame bending or twisting it's a direct

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.479 
frame bending or twisting it's a direct
reflection<00:01:50.330> of<00:01:50.390> lack<00:01:50.929> of<00:01:51.140> frame<00:01:51.649> strength<00:01:52.220> and

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:52.489 
reflection of lack of frame strength and

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:54.999 
reflection of lack of frame strength and
bear<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:53.090> mind<00:01:53.300> this<00:01:53.750> is<00:01:53.959> only<00:01:54.050> on<00:01:54.289> a<00:01:54.319> 10<00:01:54.649> degree

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
bear in mind this is only on a 10 degree

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.010 
bear in mind this is only on a 10 degree
angle<00:01:55.060> they<00:01:56.060> actually<00:01:56.390> have<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.599> courage<00:01:56.899> to

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
angle they actually have the courage to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.139 
angle they actually have the courage to
call<00:01:57.200> their<00:01:57.410> frame<00:01:57.649> Tritech<00:01:58.520> they<00:01:58.970> ought<00:01:59.119> to

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
gonna see not only the wheels in the air

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.380 
gonna see not only the wheels in the air
more<00:03:47.620> you're<00:03:48.040> gonna<00:03:48.099> see<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.489> Box<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:49.060> cargo

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
more you're gonna see the Box the cargo

more you're gonna see the Box the cargo
box<00:03:49.510> itself<00:03:49.959> bending<00:03:50.829> more<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:52.720> can<00:03:52.840> see<00:03:52.959> the

box itself bending more you can see the

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.289 
box itself bending more you can see the
trucks<00:03:53.290> moving<00:03:53.530> around<00:03:53.680> quite<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:53.920> bit

obviously<00:03:55.299> this<00:03:55.450> is<00:03:55.629> not<00:03:55.660> an<00:03:55.989> easy<00:03:56.140> life<00:03:56.410> right

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
obviously this is not an easy life right

very<00:03:59.590> hard<00:04:00.359> and<00:04:01.359> you<00:04:01.480> could<00:04:01.660> see<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.019> the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
very hard and you could see the the

very hard and you could see the the
frame<00:04:02.590> twists<00:04:02.889> just<00:04:03.010> by<00:04:03.280> watching<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.700> bumper

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
frame twists just by watching the bumper

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.789 
frame twists just by watching the bumper
again<00:04:05.799> we'll<00:04:05.920> go<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.069> the<00:04:06.190> side<00:04:07.410> lots<00:04:08.410> of<00:04:08.560> wheel

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
again we'll go to the side lots of wheel

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.460 
again we'll go to the side lots of wheel
action<00:04:09.299> disregard<00:04:10.299> to<00:04:10.359> the<00:04:10.450> gas<00:04:10.599> door<00:04:10.900> I<00:04:11.139> guess

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
action disregard to the gas door I guess

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.780 
action disregard to the gas door I guess
that's<00:04:11.680> an<00:04:11.769> automatic<00:04:11.889> on<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.400> Chevy

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.740 
world you know the highway speeds are
much<00:05:35.740> higher<00:05:36.190> than<00:05:36.430> that<00:05:36.490> so<00:05:36.880> we<00:05:37.360> need<00:05:37.510> to<00:05:37.600> know

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
much higher than that so we need to know

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.440 
much higher than that so we need to know
now<00:05:38.020> is<00:05:38.320> a<00:05:38.440> truck<00:05:38.920> really<00:05:39.370> built<00:05:39.640> tough<00:05:39.940> you
