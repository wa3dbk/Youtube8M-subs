three-quarter<00:00:44.190> inches<00:00:44.489> let<00:00:45.450> me<00:00:45.510> try<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> get<00:00:45.899> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
three-quarter inches let me try to get a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.810 
three-quarter inches let me try to get a
good<00:00:46.079> reflection<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.340> show<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.640> what

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
good reflection on this to show you what

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.510 
good reflection on this to show you what
I<00:00:47.850> mean<00:00:48.469> the<00:00:49.469> cutting<00:00:49.829> edge<00:00:49.920> stops<00:00:50.250> right

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
I mean the cutting edge stops right

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.220 
I mean the cutting edge stops right
there<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:51.000> how<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> reflective

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
there see how do you have a reflective

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.439 
there see how do you have a reflective
line<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.489> over<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.090> that's

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
line and then it's not over here that's

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.479 
line and then it's not over here that's
because<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.020> not<00:00:55.140> sharpened<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:56.160> end

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
because this is not sharpened this end

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.040 
because this is not sharpened this end
piece<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.809> from<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.350> my<00:00:59.129> fingernail<00:01:00.050> down

and<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:01.949> see<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.250> kind<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.520> changes

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and as you can see it kind of changes

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.719 
and as you can see it kind of changes
angles<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.780> comes<00:01:04.439> up<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.710> little<00:01:04.920> bit<00:01:05.010> that

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729
