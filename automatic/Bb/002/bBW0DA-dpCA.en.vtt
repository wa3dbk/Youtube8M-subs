00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.270
 hello to all the labels of the 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.160
 welcome is the oblivion of the great 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.230
 gate line in the sculpture I'm going to 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.360
 show a great trick for all 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.920
 people who like to play races and 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.930
 is that when we go to start 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.750
 any race we can always 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.640
 always always perform a turbo start 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.440
 well then to start simply 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.450
 I want to explain what a start shift is 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.190
 for people who know and is that 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.140
 when the countdown begins for 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.240
 start the race let's say yes 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.789
 we accelerate at a certain exact moment 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.489
 We can start with greater speed 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.260
 see as if suddenly we were with 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.359
 turbo then let 's say that you 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.280
 we call turbo start here it has to be given 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.659
 mind that I am like this to him and 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.460
 simply what we are going to do is 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.469
 start and here at this moment we see 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.870
 how the vehicle accelerates the screen 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.120
 it gets a strange color and then a 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.670
 vehicle sound as if it were neutral 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.800
 or if it were a turbo then this is what 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.449
 that we call turbo start for what 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.609
 serves us simply do not segovia mind 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.409
 to be able to start faster than 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.269
 other competitors so it gives us a 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.640
 little bit of advantage and also when performing 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.060
 these same turbos we can unlock 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.460
 some kind let's say that of paint 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.979
 to paint our vehicles but they are 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.899
 special colors or colors let's say that 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.970
 they are not so common and we can 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.680
 unblock when doing this 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.149
 start had then now if you're going to 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.149
 apply what they have to do to 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.070
 can we say that making its beginnings 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.020
 turbo and the same thing that we have to do 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.520
 it's quite simple then what 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.380
 They have to do to be able to get 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.240
 this turbo start every time shut up 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.700
 to play a race is to press the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.829
 Brake button before it's over 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.750
 the time the count this to start the 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.640
 career then the only thing that has to 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.340
 to do is before it reaches a no 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.860
 leave the electrician button pressed 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.720
 playing in book 61 is drowning us 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.640
 playstation3 then all take out the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.409
 time the vehicle obviously a 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.670
 depressed pipeline duct and what is going to 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.649
 happen is that the vehicle was going to 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.240
 back up and although you do not have 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.490
 than let it go back too much but 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.890
 very little and they will quickly release 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.110
 the braking button and they are going to press the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.119
 accelerate button then it's a change 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.039
 pretty easy to controls took a bit 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.630
 of practice but really tenth and a 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.130
 simple then here I am going to 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.170
 show in slow motion the case that 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.850
 has not yet been very clear and what 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.540
 The only thing they have to do is start the 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.329
 career 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.099
 pressing the braking button does not matter 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.840
 at what point the important thing is to do it 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.180
 before it reaches the acute number 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.099
 when we arrived then number one 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.260
 will go back a bit as it happens 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.299
 count here to go back very little there 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.640
 it's just in the change quickly 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.829
 release the button with those that slow down the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.739
 vehicle and quickly pressing the 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.790
 speed up doing this every time 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.680
 it will work 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.209
 Obviously when they have a little more 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.280
 of practice then the vehicle to 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.620
 going back less was going to be a let's say 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.970
 first mover myself at the moment that 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.799
 back the bei but then it is 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.540
 only a matter of practice so that 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.639
 can master this method but how do you 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.590
 I say the truth is very very simple 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.060
 is that it is not difficult and they get 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.939
 every time they try the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.099
 I really do not know if that is how the 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.780
 soon rockstar product 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.430
 I have no idea but the truth is 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.290
 that doing so is pretty simple 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.480
 and as I said, not all the 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.470
 people know how to do it this way 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.540
 then this is all I wanted them 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.430
 show I hope you liked the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.650
 video if it was like that he left his life again 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.299
 favorites comment how they thought 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.729
 this method to be able to get these 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.030
 turbo starts and obviously subscribe 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.890
 to the channel if not yet 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.630
 then I hope you can perform 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.130
 all these starts turbo all the 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.840
 times you want obviously 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.160
 gain a little advantage in the races 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.160
 and see you until next time 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.050
 and look
