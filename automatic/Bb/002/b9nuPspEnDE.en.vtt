a<00:00:22.800> more<00:00:23.220> impressive<00:00:23.699> fountain<00:00:24.240> since<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.600> was

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
a more impressive fountain since it was

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.359 
a more impressive fountain since it was
so<00:00:24.869> wide<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.320> begin<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.800> figured<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.220> could

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
so wide to begin with I figured I could

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.060 
so wide to begin with I figured I could
make<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> little<00:00:26.730> taller<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.769> you've<00:00:28.769> seen

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
make it a little taller and you've seen

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.740 
make it a little taller and you've seen
pretty<00:00:29.609> much<00:00:30.199> that<00:00:31.309> the<00:00:32.309> staterooms<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.149> like

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
pretty much that the staterooms and like

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.180 
pretty much that the staterooms and like
the<00:00:33.870> last<00:00:34.050> video<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.680> I'm<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.950> show<00:00:35.100> you

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.130 
the last video so I'm going to show you
the<00:00:35.340> changes<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.790> made<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:37.050> keep<00:00:38.210> so<00:00:39.210> first

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the changes I made to the keep so first

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.619 
the changes I made to the keep so first
of<00:00:40.320> all<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.800> throne<00:00:41.610> room<00:00:41.640> area<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> little

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
of all the throne room area is a little

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.260 
of all the throne room area is a little
bit<00:00:42.899> more<00:00:43.050> narrow<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.700> was<00:00:44.820> done<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.239> i

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
bit more narrow and that was done so i

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.209 
bit more narrow and that was done so i
could<00:00:45.480> make<00:00:45.660> an<00:00:46.050> expansion<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.980> over

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
could make an expansion for that over

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.940 
could make an expansion for that over

the floor in the corners and then I use

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.999 
the floor in the corners and then I use
redstone<00:01:42.479> torches<00:01:42.990> for<00:01:43.470> everything<00:01:43.799> else

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
like that and then I also put in this

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.490 
like that and then I also put in this
staircase<00:02:06.710> in<00:02:07.910> this<00:02:08.910> space<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.289> is

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
staircase in this space that it's in is

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.619 
staircase in this space that it's in is
like<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> big<00:02:10.979> bump<00:02:11.819> out<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.270> outside<00:02:12.540> of

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
like a big bump out on the outside of

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.190

the<00:02:12.690> castle

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the castle

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.660 
the castle
wasn't<00:02:13.379> really<00:02:13.530> sure<00:02:13.590> what<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:14.010> put<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.430> so

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
wasn't really sure what to put in it so

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.830 
wasn't really sure what to put in it so
this<00:02:14.790> kind<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.090> works<00:02:15.239> out<00:02:15.450> having<00:02:15.780> a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
this kind of works out having a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.320 
this kind of works out having a
staircase<00:02:16.140> here<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.670> leads<00:02:17.819> up<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.060> this

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
staircase here but it leads up to this

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.140 
staircase here but it leads up to this
upper<00:02:18.690> like<00:02:19.230> balcony<00:02:19.709> walk<00:02:20.610> around<00:02:20.790> area<00:02:21.209> and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
lets you kind of look down over the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.100 
lets you kind of look down over the
whole<00:02:25.950> ballroom<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.209> like<00:02:27.569> every<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:27.989> the

to<00:05:48.419> existence<00:05:48.930> but<00:05:49.199> i<00:05:49.550> figured<00:05:50.550> me<00:05:50.699> out<00:05:50.729> what

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
to existence but i figured me out what

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.370 
to existence but i figured me out what
the<00:05:51.060> heck<00:05:51.210> is<00:05:51.240> minecraft<00:05:51.810> it's<00:05:52.050> not<00:05:52.169> really

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
the heck is minecraft it's not really

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.080 
the heck is minecraft it's not really
real<00:05:52.530> anyway<00:05:52.830> so<00:05:53.009> even<00:05:53.370> if<00:05:53.490> it<00:05:53.610> shouldn't<00:05:53.970> be

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
real anyway so even if it shouldn't be

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.899 
real anyway so even if it shouldn't be
here<00:05:54.330> around<00:05:54.449> this<00:05:54.720> time<00:05:55.020> frame<00:05:55.580> I'm<00:05:56.580> putting

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909 
here around this time frame I'm putting

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:59.240 
here around this time frame I'm putting
one<00:05:57.030> in<00:05:57.060> so<00:05:57.449> this<00:05:58.199> is<00:05:58.349> kind<00:05:58.590> of<00:05:58.650> like<00:05:58.800> my<00:05:59.009> best

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
one in so this is kind of like my best

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.240 
one in so this is kind of like my best
gasset<00:05:59.729> how<00:06:00.030> to<00:06:00.120> make<00:06:00.330> one<00:06:00.570> in<00:06:00.930> Minecraft<00:06:01.500> and

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
gasset how to make one in Minecraft and

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.490 
gasset how to make one in Minecraft and
then<00:06:02.880> I<00:06:02.909> added<00:06:03.120> some<00:06:03.270> benches<00:06:03.780> around<00:06:03.990> and

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
then I added some benches around and

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.390 
then I added some benches around and
some<00:06:04.680> plants<00:06:05.099> and<00:06:05.310> things<00:06:05.659> it<00:06:06.659> may<00:06:06.810> have<00:06:06.900> more

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400

decoration type stuff and maybe
something<00:06:10.139> to<00:06:10.289> represent<00:06:10.710> like<00:06:11.220> key<00:06:11.729> sticks

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
something to represent like key sticks

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.560 
something to represent like key sticks
then<00:06:12.930> I<00:06:13.020> tried<00:06:13.289> to<00:06:13.500> make<00:06:13.710> a<00:06:13.979> grand<00:06:14.789> piano<00:06:15.030> and

then I tried to make a grand piano and
this<00:06:16.289> is<00:06:16.470> the<00:06:16.590> best<00:06:16.770> I<00:06:16.919> could<00:06:16.979> come<00:06:17.130> up<00:06:17.280> with<00:06:17.610> it

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
this is the best I could come up with it

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.800 
this is the best I could come up with it
kind<00:06:19.650> of<00:06:19.740> works<00:06:19.919> I<00:06:20.130> guess<00:06:20.340> I<00:06:20.639> don't<00:06:20.970> know<00:06:21.090> me

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
kind of works I guess I don't know me

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.480 
kind of works I guess I don't know me
know<00:06:21.870> what<00:06:21.990> you<00:06:22.080> think<00:06:23.090> then<00:06:24.090> you<00:06:24.780> head<00:06:25.050> up

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
know what you think then you head up

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.200 
know what you think then you head up

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
little enchanting place there some spots

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.389 
little enchanting place there some spots
over<00:06:41.689> here<00:06:41.839> to<00:06:41.959> sit<00:06:42.139> down<00:06:42.319> and<00:06:42.679> read<00:06:43.009> books<00:06:43.189> or

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:49.699 
viewing observation area which then

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:51.489 
viewing observation area which then
leads<00:06:50.089> up<00:06:50.330> to<00:06:50.360> the<00:06:50.719> little<00:06:50.959> towers<00:06:51.289> on<00:06:51.469> the
