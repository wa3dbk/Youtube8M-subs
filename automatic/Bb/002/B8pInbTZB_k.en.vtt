00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
balance of the anti-roll bars to produce

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.190 
balance of the anti-roll bars to produce
understeer<00:01:32.610> under<00:01:32.880> power<00:01:33.060> reduce<00:01:34.020> the

understeer under power reduce the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.780 
understeer under power reduce the
wastegate<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.340> lower<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
wastegate if you can and lower the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.649

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.210 

some<00:01:41.659> changes<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.409> driving<00:01:42.770> style<00:01:42.920> are

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
some changes to the driving style are

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.760 
some changes to the driving style are
also<00:01:43.369> necessary<00:01:44.149> to<00:01:44.210> be<00:01:44.420> quick<00:01:44.689> but<00:01:45.439> first

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
also necessary to be quick but first

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.460 
also necessary to be quick but first
let's<00:01:46.040> clear<00:01:46.250> up<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.460> common<00:01:46.759> misconception

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
let's clear up a common misconception

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.780 
let's clear up a common misconception
drifting<00:01:48.470> around<00:01:48.560> corners<00:01:49.189> is<00:01:49.340> just<00:01:49.610> as

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
drifting around corners is just as

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.490 
drifting around corners is just as
counterproductive<00:01:50.270> when<00:01:50.720> racing<00:01:51.110> in<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.290> wet

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
counterproductive when racing in the wet

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.039 
counterproductive when racing in the wet
as<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.070> in<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.310> dry<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:53.149> may<00:01:53.360> look<00:01:53.600> cool

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
as it is in the dry it may look cool

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.779 
as it is in the dry it may look cool
but<00:01:54.350> you'll<00:01:54.470> lose<00:01:54.649> time<00:01:54.979> in<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.280> chances<00:01:55.729> of

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
but you'll lose time in the chances of

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.330 
but you'll lose time in the chances of
losing<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.240> car<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:56.659> much<00:01:56.810> greater<00:01:57.340> now

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
losing the car and much greater now

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.859 
losing the car and much greater now
that's<00:01:58.580> out<00:01:58.789> of<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.939> way<00:01:58.970> let's<00:01:59.570> talk<00:01:59.720> about

that's out of the way let's talk about

that's out of the way let's talk about

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
the exception to the rule

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.520 
the exception to the rule
cars<00:02:01.880> are<00:02:02.030> fastest<00:02:02.479> when<00:02:02.659> operating<00:02:03.200> within<00:02:03.350> a

cars are fastest when operating within a
slip<00:02:03.770> angle<00:02:04.189> which<00:02:04.580> changes<00:02:05.000> depending<00:02:05.060> on

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
slip angle which changes depending on

the stiffness of the car this is usually

the stiffness of the car this is usually

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
tiny for purpose-built race cars but it

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.130 
tiny for purpose-built race cars but it
increases<00:02:10.250> slightly<00:02:10.640> when<00:02:10.940> in<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.180> rain<00:02:11.360> with
