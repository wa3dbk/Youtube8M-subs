what<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.420> there's<00:00:18.690> an<00:00:18.779> easy<00:00:18.930> way<00:00:19.140> to

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
what it is is it there's an easy way to

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.820 
what it is is it there's an easy way to
check<00:00:19.500> your<00:00:19.890> codes<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.119> your<00:00:21.510> computer<00:00:22.020> if

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
check your codes and your computer if

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.250 
check your codes and your computer if
you<00:00:22.890> happen<00:00:23.580> if<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> highway<00:00:24.449> that

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
you happen if you have a highway that

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.290 
you happen if you have a highway that
has<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> computer<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.430> computer<00:00:26.760> controlled

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
has a computer is computer controlled

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.290 
has a computer is computer controlled
which<00:00:27.539> mostly<00:00:28.519> pretty<00:00:29.519> much<00:00:29.670> all<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> newer

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
which mostly pretty much all the newer

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.180 
which mostly pretty much all the newer
ones<00:00:30.630> out<00:00:32.540> there's<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> way<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:34.020> checking<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
ones out there's a way of checking the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.950 
ones out there's a way of checking the
computer<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:36.000> if<00:00:36.030> there's<00:00:36.239> any<00:00:36.360> codes<00:00:36.690> in

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
computer to see if there's any codes in

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.200 
computer to see if there's any codes in
it<00:00:37.110> any<00:00:37.440> current<00:00:37.800> codes<00:00:38.070> or<00:00:38.340> any<00:00:38.489> stored<00:00:38.850> codes

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
it any current codes or any stored codes

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.479 
it any current codes or any stored codes
and<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.890> pretty<00:00:41.129> simple<00:00:42.410> what<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.440> do<00:00:43.710> is

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
and it's pretty simple what you do is

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:53.270 
and it's pretty simple what you do is
you<00:00:45.329> put<00:00:46.289> your<00:00:46.320> one<00:00:46.590> switch<00:00:47.719> on<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:52.129> you<00:00:53.129> go

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
you put your one switch on on you go

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.049 
you put your one switch on on you go
over<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:54.440> you<00:00:55.440> reset<00:00:55.829> button<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.550> put<00:00:56.969> your

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
over to you reset button just put your

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.180 
over to you reset button just put your
automaton<00:00:58.579> then<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.640> push<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:02.100> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
automaton then you push that on and you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.670 
automaton then you push that on and you
hold<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.480> takes<00:01:03.960> another<00:01:04.080> hand<00:01:04.470> for

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
hold it all right takes another hand for

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.859 
hold it all right takes another hand for
me<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.189> hold<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> camera<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.780> I'm

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
me to do this and hold the camera so I'm

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.280 
me to do this and hold the camera so I'm
gonna<00:01:08.000> flip<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.180> switch<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:11.640> ignition

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
gonna flip this switch all the ignition

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.730 
gonna flip this switch all the ignition
it's<00:01:13.290> only<00:01:13.470> turned<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.640> Nishant<00:01:15.740> and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
it's only turned to with Nishant and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.460 
it's only turned to with Nishant and
what<00:01:17.100> you'll<00:01:17.250> see<00:01:17.490> now<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> odometer<00:01:19.110> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
what you'll see now is on the odometer I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.880 
what you'll see now is on the odometer I
can<00:01:19.590> look<00:01:19.710> over<00:01:20.689> you'll<00:01:21.689> see<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> odometer

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
can look over you'll see on the odometer

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.450 
can look over you'll see on the odometer
it's<00:01:23.070> gonna<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.729> bank<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.180> readings

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
it's gonna be like a bank of readings

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.230 
it's gonna be like a bank of readings
and<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.580> goes<00:01:26.729> from<00:01:26.939> 1<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.180> 10<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:29.000> if<00:01:30.000> there's

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
and it goes from 1 to 10 and if there's

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.890 
and it goes from 1 to 10 and if there's
any<00:01:30.540> problem<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.320> your<00:01:31.829> bike<00:01:32.659> one<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.780> these

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
any problem in your bike one of these

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.090 
any problem in your bike one of these
banks<00:01:34.290> will<00:01:34.470> pick<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.680> up<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:37.229> you'll<00:01:37.920> see

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
when I push the reset button each time

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.109 
when I push the reset button each time
the<00:01:42.210> bank<00:01:42.479> changes<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.259> walk<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.770> 2<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.340> 3<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.880> 4
