00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
Microsoft Project formats are printouts

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.519 
Microsoft Project formats are printouts
here<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.640> have<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.330> project<00:00:06.720> with<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.140> number<00:00:07.440> of

pages<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.200> Gantt<00:00:37.469> chart<00:00:37.590> printout<00:00:38.129> is

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
pages of a Gantt chart printout is

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.580 
pages of a Gantt chart printout is
really<00:00:38.520> not<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:38.969> useful<00:00:39.180> at<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.600> so

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
really not going to be useful at all so

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650 
really not going to be useful at all so
what<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:40.890> want<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.579> want<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.910> change

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
what we want to do is we want to change

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.979 
what we want to do is we want to change
the<00:00:42.870> scale<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.860> fits<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.340> one<00:00:44.399> page

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
the scale this so it fits on one page

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.900 
the scale this so it fits on one page
now<00:00:45.989> what<00:00:46.649> some<00:00:46.829> people<00:00:46.980> will<00:00:47.280> try<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.550> do<00:00:47.789> is

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
now what some people will try to do is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.260 
now what some people will try to do is
they<00:00:48.059> will<00:00:48.239> know<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.770> under<00:00:50.399> page<00:00:50.730> setup

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
they will know that under page setup

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.020 
they will know that under page setup
they<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:51.960> change<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:53.030> Microsoft

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
they can change it so that Microsoft

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.630 
they can change it so that Microsoft
will<00:00:54.270> actually<00:00:54.770> squish<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.039> down<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.460> one

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
will actually squish this down to one

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.580 
will actually squish this down to one
page<00:00:56.940> before<00:00:57.660> sending<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> printer

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
page before sending it to the printer

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.410 
page before sending it to the printer
let's<00:00:59.039> look<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.399> see<00:00:59.460> what<00:00:59.579> happens<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.300> we

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
let's look and see what happens if we

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.630 
let's look and see what happens if we
try<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.859> we're<00:01:01.949> going<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> fit<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.460> one

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
try that so we're going to fit it to one

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.690 
try that so we're going to fit it to one
page<00:01:02.850> wide<00:01:03.120> by<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:03.570> page<00:01:03.840> tall<00:01:04.549> well<00:01:05.549> what

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
page wide by one page tall well what

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.060 
page wide by one page tall well what
happens<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.810> actually<00:01:06.869> uses<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.830> same

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
happens is it actually uses the same

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.450 
happens is it actually uses the same
scale<00:01:08.640> looking<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.570> things<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.110> daily<00:01:11.010> basis

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
scale looking at things on a daily basis

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.429 
scale looking at things on a daily basis
in<00:01:11.580> our<00:01:11.670> Gantt<00:01:11.909> chart<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.689> squishes<00:01:13.110> it

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
in our Gantt chart but just squishes it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.160 
in our Gantt chart but just squishes it
down<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.460> totally<00:01:14.670> unreadable<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:16.020> this

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
down so it's totally unreadable so this

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.399 
down so it's totally unreadable so this
is<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.890> way<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.310> want<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.700> this

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
is not the way that we want to do this

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.960 
is not the way that we want to do this
go<00:01:19.409> back<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.070> I'm<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> reset<00:01:20.729> this

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
go back here and I'm going to reset this

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.920 
go back here and I'm going to reset this
to<00:01:22.759> reverse<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.060> change<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.630> really

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
to reverse that change so what we really

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.890 
to reverse that change so what we really
want<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.890> really<00:01:28.920> want<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.750> go<00:01:30.750> into

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
want to do is we really want to go into

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.990 
want to do is we really want to go into
Microsoft<00:01:31.470> Project<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.070> change<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.670> scale

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
Microsoft Project and change the scale

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.090 
Microsoft Project and change the scale
of<00:01:33.030> our<00:01:33.270> Gantt<00:01:33.570> chart<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.740> actually

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
of our Gantt chart so we can actually

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.120 
of our Gantt chart so we can actually
get<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.400> down<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.090> two<00:01:36.119> pages<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.130> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
get this down to one or two pages so to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.710 
get this down to one or two pages so to
do<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.150> go<00:01:39.360> over<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.659> to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
do that I'm going to go over here to

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.700 
do that I'm going to go over here to
view<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:41.000> under<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> View<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:43.110> choose<00:01:43.409> the

chart<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.640> now<00:01:56.640> another<00:01:56.909> way<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.719> do

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
chart in now another way that you can do

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.959 
chart in now another way that you can do
this<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.500> actually<00:01:58.979> use<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.490> zoom<00:01:59.759> in

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
this is you can actually use the zoom in

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.740 
this is you can actually use the zoom in
and<00:02:00.180> zoom<00:02:00.210> out<00:02:00.540> functions<00:02:00.899> here<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:02.329> also<00:02:03.329> like

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and zoom out functions here I also like

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.749 
and zoom out functions here I also like
to<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> little<00:02:05.009> scroll<00:02:05.310> wheel<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.729> my

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
to I have a little scroll wheel on my

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.089 
to I have a little scroll wheel on my
mouse<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.689> just<00:02:06.810> simply<00:02:07.200> hold<00:02:07.740> down<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
mouse so I can just simply hold down the

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.110 
mouse so I can just simply hold down the
shift<00:02:08.369> key<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.599> notice<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.289> can

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
shift key and you notice that I can

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.009 
shift key and you notice that I can
scroll<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.359> or<00:02:13.989> zoom<00:02:14.499> in<00:02:14.680> rather<00:02:15.180> by<00:02:16.180> using<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
scroll in or zoom in rather by using the

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.190 
scroll in or zoom in rather by using the
scroll<00:02:17.859> wheel<00:02:17.889> on<00:02:18.340> my<00:02:18.430> mouse<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:19.269> tend<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.019> like

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
scroll wheel on my mouse I tend to like

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.920 
scroll wheel on my mouse I tend to like
to<00:02:20.230> use<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.969> a<00:02:22.060> quick<00:02:22.359> and<00:02:22.540> easy<00:02:22.629> way

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
to use that it is a quick and easy way

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.739 
to use that it is a quick and easy way
for<00:02:22.989> me<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.319> change<00:02:23.560> my<00:02:24.269> view<00:02:25.269> but<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.629> can

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:25.749 
for me to change my view but you can

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.179 
for me to change my view but you can
certainly<00:02:25.930> come<00:02:26.290> up<00:02:26.439> here<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.829> change<00:02:27.549> it

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
certainly come up here and change it

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.550 
certainly come up here and change it
through<00:02:30.189> the<00:02:30.400> time<00:02:30.879> scale<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.480> let's<00:02:32.200> look<00:02:32.379> at

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
through the time scale so let's look at

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.259 
through the time scale so let's look at
what<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:33.010> looks<00:02:33.280> like<00:02:33.459> when<00:02:33.700> we<00:02:33.730> actually<00:02:33.819> go

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
what it looks like when we actually go

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.959 
what it looks like when we actually go
to<00:02:34.329> print<00:02:34.599> this<00:02:34.750> now<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.620> in<00:02:38.769> this<00:02:38.919> case<00:02:39.219> I<00:02:39.519> now

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:39.969 
to print this now so in this case I now

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.750 
to print this now so in this case I now
have<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.239> time<00:02:40.569> scale<00:02:41.019> that<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:42.129> going<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.489> fit

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
have a time scale that is going to fit

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.080 
have a time scale that is going to fit
on<00:02:43.030> one<00:02:43.870> page<00:02:44.439> and<00:02:44.919> it's<00:02:45.549> going<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.819> be<00:02:45.909> one

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
on one page and it's going to be one

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.610 
on one page and it's going to be one
page<00:02:46.359> it's<00:02:46.629> actually<00:02:46.959> going<00:02:47.049> to<00:02:47.109> be<00:02:47.260> viewable

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
page it's actually going to be viewable

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.039 
page it's actually going to be viewable
I<00:02:47.859> can<00:02:48.040> actually<00:02:48.219> read<00:02:48.669> what<00:02:48.939> this<00:02:49.419> time<00:02:49.689> scale

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
I can actually read what this time scale

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.580 
I can actually read what this time scale
is<00:02:50.319> and<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:51.219> can<00:02:51.430> read<00:02:51.609> what<00:02:51.790> my<00:02:51.969> tasks<00:02:52.449> are<00:02:52.599> okay

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
is and I can read what my tasks are okay

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.550 
is and I can read what my tasks are okay
so<00:02:54.129> that's<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.519> way<00:02:54.639> that<00:02:54.790> we<00:02:54.939> want<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.560> format

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
so that's the way that we want to format

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.390 
so that's the way that we want to format
our<00:02:57.280> projects<00:02:58.120> when<00:02:58.269> we<00:02:58.359> go<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.569> print<00:02:58.840> out<00:02:59.400> and

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
our projects when we go to print out and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.879 
our projects when we go to print out and
we<00:03:00.639> want<00:03:00.849> to<00:03:00.969> print<00:03:01.180> out<00:03:01.389> a<00:03:01.629> fairly<00:03:02.620> large

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
we want to print out a fairly large

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.860 
we want to print out a fairly large
project<00:03:03.639> but<00:03:03.969> we<00:03:04.090> want<00:03:04.269> it<00:03:04.329> to<00:03:04.480> be<00:03:04.599> in<00:03:04.780> a

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
project but we want it to be in a

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.839 
project but we want it to be in a
concise<00:03:05.260> printout<00:03:05.859> where<00:03:06.340> everybody<00:03:06.669> can

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
concise printout where everybody can

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.849 
concise printout where everybody can
read<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.269> we're<00:03:07.569> simply<00:03:07.930> going<00:03:08.109> to<00:03:08.199> go<00:03:08.469> to<00:03:08.530> view

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
read it we're simply going to go to view

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.840 
read it we're simply going to go to view
and<00:03:09.099> we're<00:03:09.489> going<00:03:09.609> to<00:03:09.669> alter<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.180> time<00:03:10.419> scale
