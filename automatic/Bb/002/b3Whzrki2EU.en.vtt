00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
measure the width of the wheel again you

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.729 
measure the width of the wheel again you
will<00:00:53.370> not<00:00:53.550> want<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.969> measure<00:00:54.379> do<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.530> measure

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
will not want to measure do not measure

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.590 
will not want to measure do not measure
overall<00:00:56.219> because<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.820> will<00:00:56.910> show<00:00:56.940> seven<00:00:57.480> which

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
overall because it will show seven which

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.750 
overall because it will show seven which
is<00:00:57.629> incorrect<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.800> will<00:00:58.920> measure<00:00:59.100> bead<00:00:59.520> seat

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
is incorrect you will measure bead seat

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.130 
is incorrect you will measure bead seat
to<00:00:59.820> bead<00:01:00.000> seat<00:01:00.149> again<00:01:00.770> which<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.100> six<00:01:02.760> inches

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
to bead seat again which is six inches

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.030 
to bead seat again which is six inches
and<00:01:04.460> then<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.360> bolt<00:01:06.659> pattern<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.890> are

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and then on the bolt pattern there are

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.039 
and then on the bolt pattern there are
six<00:01:08.340> lugs<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.180> when<00:01:09.330> there's<00:01:09.510> an<00:01:09.630> even<00:01:09.960> amount

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
six lugs so when there's an even amount

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.140 
six lugs so when there's an even amount
of<00:01:10.260> lugs<00:01:10.500> you'll<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.490> measure<00:01:11.760> from<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
of lugs you'll just measure from the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.240 
of lugs you'll just measure from the
center<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.630> lug<00:01:12.840> directly<00:01:13.560> across<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
center of one lug directly across to the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.270 
center of one lug directly across to the
center<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> other<00:01:14.850> lug<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:16.170> case<00:01:16.439> if

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
center of the other lug in this case if

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.480 
center of the other lug in this case if
we<00:01:17.400> put<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> ruler<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.450> would<00:01:18.630> measure

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
we put a ruler on it it would measure

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.490 
we put a ruler on it it would measure
five<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> half<00:01:20.850> inches<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.930> six<00:01:22.200> logs

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
five and a half inches so it's six logs

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.700 
five and a half inches so it's six logs
on<00:01:22.860> five<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> half<00:01:23.400> inches<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:25.409> next

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
on five and a half inches the next

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.859 
on five and a half inches the next
measurement<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.759> would<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.090> do<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
measurement you would want to do is the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.230 
measurement you would want to do is the
pilot<00:01:28.680> diameter<00:01:28.890> which<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.729> where<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.030> hub

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
pilot diameter which is where the hub

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.380 
pilot diameter which is where the hub
from<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> trailer<00:01:30.869> would<00:01:31.049> stick<00:01:31.320> through<00:01:31.590> in

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
from the trailer would stick through in

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.020 
from the trailer would stick through in
this<00:01:33.390> case<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:35.520> would<00:01:35.670> measure<00:01:36.590> four<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.310> 1/8

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
this case it would measure four and 1/8

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.460 
this case it would measure four and 1/8
inches<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.390> reason<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.960> critical

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
inches and the reason that is critical

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.139 
inches and the reason that is critical
because<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.799> some<00:01:44.040> trailers<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.549> would<00:01:44.939> use

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
because on some trailers that would use

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.899 
because on some trailers that would use
a<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:46.110> would<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> hub<00:01:46.799> with<00:01:47.340> lug<00:01:47.579> holes

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
a that would have a hub with lug holes

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.840 
a that would have a hub with lug holes
that<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> lug<00:01:48.840> bolt<00:01:49.170> would<00:01:49.380> screw<00:01:49.680> into<00:01:49.860> you

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
that a lug bolt would screw into you

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.490 
that a lug bolt would screw into you
would<00:01:50.970> need<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.479> hub<00:01:51.840> centric<00:01:52.200> wheel

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
would need to have a hub centric wheel

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
would need to have a hub centric wheel
in<00:01:52.680> other<00:01:52.799> words<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.250> pilot<00:01:54.090> diameter<00:01:54.270> we

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
in other words this pilot diameter we

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.020 
in other words this pilot diameter we
have<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.899> be<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.170> same<00:01:55.439> size<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.670> hub<00:01:56.850> on

the trailer so when you slide it on
there<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.490> can<00:01:59.640> turn<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.000> line<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.420> holes<00:02:00.600> up

put the lug bolts in on most other
trailers<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:03.840> would<00:02:03.960> use<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> lug<00:02:04.500> centric

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
trailers they would use a lug centric

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.630 
trailers they would use a lug centric
wheel<00:02:05.270> which<00:02:06.270> means<00:02:06.570> it'll<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.500> wheel<00:02:08.190> studs

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
wheel which means it'll have wheel studs

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.089 
wheel which means it'll have wheel studs
coming<00:02:08.879> out<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.360> hub<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:10.560> set<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.950> wheel

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
coming out of the hub you set the wheel

next<00:02:22.080> measurement<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:23.030> want<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.599> the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
next measurement I want to do is the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.040 
next measurement I want to do is the
back<00:02:25.620> spacing<00:02:25.980> now<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.000> back<00:02:27.269> spacing<00:02:27.629> would

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
back spacing now the back spacing would

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.420 
back spacing now the back spacing would
be<00:02:28.170> measuring<00:02:28.470> from<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.830> back<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.280> wheel

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
be measuring from the back of the wheel

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.790 
be measuring from the back of the wheel
to<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.000> mounting<00:02:30.390> surface<00:02:30.599> that<00:02:31.230> goes<00:02:31.410> on<00:02:31.620> to

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
to the mounting surface that goes on to

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.150 
to the mounting surface that goes on to
the<00:02:31.890> hub<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:33.090> easiest<00:02:33.360> way<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.630> do<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.440> if

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
the hub the easiest way to do that is if

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160 
the hub the easiest way to do that is if
you<00:02:35.280> lay<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.670> straight<00:02:36.209> edge<00:02:36.360> across<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.989> wheel

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
you lay a straight edge across the wheel

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.910 
you lay a straight edge across the wheel
and<00:02:37.500> then<00:02:38.220> just<00:02:38.250> measure<00:02:38.670> down<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:40.530> top<00:02:40.739> of

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
and then just measure down to the top of

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.070 
and then just measure down to the top of
that<00:02:41.010> mounting<00:02:41.340> surface<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.660> case<00:02:42.870> it's

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
that mounting surface in this case it's

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.800 
that mounting surface in this case it's
about<00:02:43.230> three<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:43.769> 3/4<00:02:44.459> inches<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.660> is

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
about three and 3/4 inches so that is

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.589 
about three and 3/4 inches so that is
the<00:02:45.930> back<00:02:46.140> spacing<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:49.940> was<00:02:50.940> going<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.360> want

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
the back spacing I was going to I want

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.400 
the back spacing I was going to I want
to<00:02:51.690> also<00:02:51.900> show<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.200> how<00:02:52.349> to<00:02:52.470> measure<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:53.220> wheel

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
to also show you how to measure a wheel

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.710 
to also show you how to measure a wheel
that<00:02:55.410> would<00:02:55.620> be<00:02:55.799> an<00:02:55.920> odd<00:02:56.190> amount<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.150> lugs<00:02:57.450> like

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
that would be an odd amount of lugs like

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.890 
that would be an odd amount of lugs like
in<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:58.079> case<00:02:58.319> five<00:02:58.739> lugs<00:02:59.480> the<00:03:00.480> way<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.690> would

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
in this case five lugs the way you would

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.809 
in this case five lugs the way you would
measure<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.099> would<00:03:02.190> measure<00:03:02.370> from<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
measure it is you would measure from the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.990 
measure it is you would measure from the
center<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.269> this<00:03:04.079> one<00:03:04.319> wheel<00:03:04.530> all<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.819> way<00:03:05.940> to

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
center of this one wheel all the way to

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.960 
center of this one wheel all the way to
the<00:03:06.299> edge<00:03:06.599> of<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.319> wheel<00:03:07.530> or<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.860> hole<00:03:08.250> across

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
the edge of the wheel or the hole across

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.420 
the edge of the wheel or the hole across
from<00:03:09.239> it<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:10.200> in<00:03:10.319> this<00:03:10.440> case<00:03:10.739> if<00:03:11.099> you<00:03:11.220> measure

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
from it so in this case if you measure

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.180 
from it so in this case if you measure
from<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.790> center<00:03:12.079> all<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.440> way<00:03:13.590> across<00:03:13.829> to

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
from the center all the way across to

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.220 
from the center all the way across to
the<00:03:14.280> edge<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.790> wheel<00:03:14.940> it's<00:03:15.750> four<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.170> a

the edge of the wheel it's four and a
half<00:03:16.290> inches<00:03:16.769> so<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:17.609> bolt<00:03:17.910> pattern<00:03:18.269> would

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
half inches so this bolt pattern would

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.250 
half inches so this bolt pattern would
be<00:03:18.480> five<00:03:18.780> on<00:03:19.079> four<00:03:19.319> and<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.500> half<00:03:20.959> another<00:03:21.959> thing

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
be five on four and a half another thing

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.280 
be five on four and a half another thing
to<00:03:22.940> that's<00:03:23.940> critical<00:03:24.569> on<00:03:24.660> trailer<00:03:25.049> wheels

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
to that's critical on trailer wheels

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.069 
to that's critical on trailer wheels
most<00:03:25.950> trailer<00:03:26.430> wheels<00:03:26.700> will<00:03:27.389> have<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.569> zero

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079

mounting<00:03:58.410> surface<00:03:58.829> back<00:03:59.069> here<00:03:59.660> would<00:04:00.660> move<00:04:00.930> to

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
mounting surface back here would move to

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.190 
mounting surface back here would move to
the<00:04:01.349> inside<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.459> vehicle<00:04:03.019> makes<00:04:04.019> the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
the inside of the vehicle makes the

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.390 
the inside of the vehicle makes the
wheel<00:04:04.349> tire<00:04:04.680> come<00:04:04.859> out<00:04:04.980> that<00:04:05.160> would<00:04:05.250> be<00:04:05.310> a

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
wheel tire come out that would be a

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.089 
wheel tire come out that would be a
negative<00:04:05.849> offset<00:04:06.470> it's<00:04:07.470> very<00:04:07.680> hard<00:04:08.010> to

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
negative offset it's very hard to

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.490 
negative offset it's very hard to
measure<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.609> offset<00:04:08.970> because<00:04:09.359> they<00:04:10.169> when

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
measure the offset because they when

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.780 
measure the offset because they when
they<00:04:10.650> do<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:10.919> at<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.190> factory<00:04:11.549> they<00:04:11.639> use

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
they do that at the factory they use

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.849 
they do that at the factory they use
precise<00:04:12.540> measurement<00:04:13.079> tools<00:04:13.319> that<00:04:13.650> be<00:04:13.769> able

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
precise measurement tools that be able

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.650 
precise measurement tools that be able
to<00:04:14.040> do<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.849> can't<00:04:15.090> really<00:04:15.269> do<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.480> on

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
to do that you can't really do that on

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.210 
to do that you can't really do that on
your<00:04:15.930> own<00:04:16.079> but<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:16.799> will<00:04:16.919> give<00:04:17.039> you<00:04:17.099> an<00:04:17.190> idea

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
your own but that will give you an idea

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.070 
your own but that will give you an idea
as<00:04:17.459> most<00:04:17.729> trailer<00:04:18.120> wheels<00:04:18.329> are<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.539> zero<00:04:18.810> offset

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
as most trailer wheels are a zero offset

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.190 
as most trailer wheels are a zero offset
and<00:04:21.080> each<00:04:22.040> wheel<00:04:22.460> will<00:04:22.760> also<00:04:23.030> have<00:04:23.180> a<00:04:23.210> load

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
and each wheel will also have a load

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.340 
and each wheel will also have a load
carrying<00:04:24.560> capacity<00:04:24.710> most<00:04:25.520> of<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:25.790> time

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
carrying capacity most of the time

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.450 
carrying capacity most of the time
sometimes<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:27.530> might<00:04:27.650> be<00:04:27.710> stamped<00:04:28.250> on<00:04:28.340> the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
sometimes it might be stamped on the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.550 
sometimes it might be stamped on the
back<00:04:28.610> of<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.880> wheel<00:04:29.060> on<00:04:29.390> a<00:04:29.450> lot<00:04:30.110> of<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.290> steel

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
back of the wheel on a lot of the steel

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.130 
back of the wheel on a lot of the steel
wheels<00:04:30.860> there's<00:04:31.160> a<00:04:31.220> tag<00:04:31.580> on<00:04:31.760> here<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.210> it

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
wheels there's a tag on here and it

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.170 
wheels there's a tag on here and it
would<00:04:33.320> say<00:04:33.620> it<00:04:34.280> gives<00:04:34.460> you<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.700> size<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.120> the

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
would say it gives you the size of the

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.240 
would say it gives you the size of the
wheel<00:04:35.300> sixteen<00:04:35.780> by<00:04:35.960> six<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:36.560> then<00:04:37.070> that

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
wheel sixteen by six and then that

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.960 
wheel sixteen by six and then that
number<00:04:37.430> sees<00:04:38.290> 3050<00:04:39.290> pounds<00:04:39.860> that<00:04:40.490> means<00:04:40.520> this

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
number sees 3050 pounds that means this

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.500 
number sees 3050 pounds that means this
wheel<00:04:41.300> is<00:04:41.930> tested<00:04:42.380> at<00:04:42.470> 3050<00:04:43.400> pounds<00:04:43.760> at<00:04:43.850> 90<00:04:44.300> psi

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
wheel is tested at 3050 pounds at 90 psi

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.330 
wheel is tested at 3050 pounds at 90 psi
so<00:04:45.470> you<00:04:45.500> just<00:04:45.680> want<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.860> make<00:04:46.010> sure<00:04:46.160> whatever

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
so you just want to make sure whatever

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.400 
so you just want to make sure whatever
tire<00:04:46.760> you<00:04:46.880> put<00:04:47.060> on<00:04:47.180> there<00:04:47.390> does<00:04:47.990> not<00:04:48.200> go<00:04:48.380> over

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
tire you put on there does not go over

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.670 
tire you put on there does not go over
that<00:04:48.680> capacity<00:04:49.400> on<00:04:50.300> this<00:04:50.480> 14-inch<00:04:51.110> wheel<00:04:51.380> if

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
that capacity on this 14-inch wheel if

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.460 
that capacity on this 14-inch wheel if
we<00:04:51.890> look<00:04:52.040> at<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.280> tag<00:04:52.660> it<00:04:53.660> would<00:04:53.780> say<00:04:53.990> fourteen

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
we look at the tag it would say fourteen

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.490 
we look at the tag it would say fourteen
by<00:04:54.590> five<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:54.950> a<00:04:55.040> half<00:04:55.270> 1,800<00:04:56.270> seventy<00:04:57.050> pounds

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
by five and a half 1,800 seventy pounds

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.160 
by five and a half 1,800 seventy pounds
and<00:04:57.680> that<00:04:57.830> is<00:04:57.890> at<00:04:58.130> 50<00:04:58.580> psi<00:04:58.760> so<00:04:59.750> same<00:04:59.960> way<00:05:00.110> you

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
and that is at 50 psi so same way you

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.570 
and that is at 50 psi so same way you
don't<00:05:00.260> want<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.500> put<00:05:00.620> a<00:05:00.650> tire<00:05:00.890> on<00:05:00.920> a<00:05:01.070> wheel<00:05:01.310> that

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
don't want to put a tire on a wheel that

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:09.730 
don't want to put a tire on a wheel that
would<00:05:02.030> be<00:05:02.150> over<00:05:02.600> those<00:05:02.780> capacities<00:05:08.290> and<00:05:09.290> that

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
would be over those capacities and that

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.380 
would be over those capacities and that
will<00:05:09.860> do<00:05:09.980> it<00:05:10.100> for<00:05:10.570> measuring<00:05:11.570> a<00:05:11.690> trailer<00:05:12.200> wheel
