00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.209
 google browser and uta taken with brothers 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.030
 you need to access them only 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.650
 if they register entertainment programs 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.970

 enjoy life this community so 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.330
 Next, let's consider the start -up 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.870
 repeats ie interface 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.640
 windows 7 since it glows when 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.500
 pressed 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.230
 let's see there are programs here 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.850
 which you have first which 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.640
 built probably more os 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:12.510
 Well, important such as browser music 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.680
 gallery camera and so on here in 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.320
 there is still a menu 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.250
 setup reboot shut down so 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.750
 further explorer list of applications 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.820
 installation desktop and images 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.750
 start sidebar application list 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.540
 let's take well here there is another list 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.870
 of these applications 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:39.480
 a little bit but that's not the point 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.890
 that she does all the work and so on 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.799
 there is still a bottom 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.140
 see the taskbar and to which we see 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.900
 in running applications from me 5 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.799
 approved applications that are and 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.799
 displayed in this panel in the right 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:59.100
 bottom corner there is a volume but she 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:02.910
 for some reason this does not work minus it 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.010
 laughter well there is an indicator 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.710
 percent how much you have left here 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.730
 charging 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:14.180
 in stone that everything is right here and the network 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:18.650
 4004 I will have to be solved and watch hours 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:22.510
 pretty too pretty and all 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.430
 perhaps this will all end but 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:30.560
 one more feature wanted to talk about 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:33.740
 gadgets if you click and hold already 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.370
 keep your finger on which one in the gadget 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.060
 you are connected to a specific menu for 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.010
 o'clock 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.250
 this is a menu here you can choose 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:47.450
 different types of clocks from petals for example 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.970

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.980
 lunar calendar and alternation that's what 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:57.250
 we can see that alternation now 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.330
 Chinese garbage kind of jumped out 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:04.280
