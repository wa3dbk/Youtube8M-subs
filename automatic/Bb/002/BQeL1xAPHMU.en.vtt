00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
fourth so that you have four equal

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.170 
fourth so that you have four equal
pieces<00:00:22.410> now<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.519> you're<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.850> want<00:00:24.029> to

pieces now what you're going to want to
do<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:25.070> put<00:00:26.070> those<00:00:26.189> strands<00:00:26.640> right<00:00:26.939> between

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
do is put those strands right between

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.970 
do is put those strands right between
your<00:00:27.510> fingers<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.050> you've<00:00:28.170> got<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.560> two<00:00:28.590> three

and four
gather<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.820> strands<00:00:33.329> between<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> index<00:00:34.350> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590

between your ring finger and your pinky

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
between your ring finger and your pinky
so<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:40.579> to<00:00:41.809> put<00:00:42.809> those<00:00:42.960> between<00:00:43.350> their<00:00:43.559> first

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
so one to put those between their first

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.770 
so one to put those between their first
two<00:00:44.129> fingers<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.850> opposite<00:00:45.270> hand<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
then flip so now I have the strands all

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.389 
then flip so now I have the strands all
between<00:00:52.050> these<00:00:52.289> fingers<00:00:52.500> now<00:00:53.129> you're<00:00:53.280> going

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
between these fingers now you're going

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.040 
between these fingers now you're going
to<00:00:53.460> gather<00:00:53.670> from<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.120> same<00:00:54.300> fingers<00:00:54.719> between

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
to gather from the same fingers between

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.139 
to gather from the same fingers between
the<00:00:55.140> index<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> ring<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.760> first

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the index and the ring in your first

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.810 
the index and the ring in your first
section<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.770> ring<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> pinky<00:00:59.520> in

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
section and the ring and the pinky in

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.630 
section and the ring and the pinky in
the<00:00:59.940> second<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:02.300> flip<00:01:03.920> keep<00:01:04.920> doing<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.400> gather

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the second and flip keep doing it gather

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.940 
the second and flip keep doing it gather
from<00:01:05.909> those<00:01:06.119> same<00:01:06.510> areas<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> hand<00:01:07.710> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
from those same areas on the hand and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.840 
from those same areas on the hand and
flip<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:12.860> flip<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.189> you're<00:01:14.340> always<00:01:14.520> when

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
flip and flip so you're always when

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.190 
flip and flip so you're always when
you're<00:01:14.939> flipping<00:01:15.150> you're<00:01:15.420> always<00:01:15.600> placing

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
you're flipping you're always placing

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.660 
you're flipping you're always placing
those<00:01:16.320> last<00:01:16.500> two<00:01:16.740> strands<00:01:17.040> between<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> last

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
those last two strands between the last

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.200 
those last two strands between the last
two<00:01:17.820> sections<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.600> hand<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> gather<00:01:20.820> from

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
two sections of the hand so gather from

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.149 
two sections of the hand so gather from
the<00:01:21.420> second<00:01:21.840> section<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> fourth<00:01:22.799> section

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the second section in the fourth section

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.830 
the second section in the fourth section
and<00:01:23.970> flip<00:01:25.610> second<00:01:26.610> section<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.540> fourth

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and flip second section and the fourth

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.310 
and flip second section and the fourth
section<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.650> flip<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.509> then<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.780> continue

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
section and flip and then just continue

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.990 
section and flip and then just continue
down<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.680> braid<00:01:31.920> doing<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> same<00:01:32.700> thing<00:01:35.000> this

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
down the braid doing the same thing this

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.109 
down the braid doing the same thing this
is<00:01:36.180> called<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.479> quad<00:01:36.810> braid

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.630 

and<00:01:40.240> as<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.200> can<00:01:41.320> see<00:01:41.380> it's<00:01:41.770> making<00:01:42.159> kind<00:01:42.399> of<00:01:42.520> a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
and as you can see it's making kind of a

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.609 
and as you can see it's making kind of a
rope<00:01:42.880> effect<00:01:43.329> in<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:44.770> hair<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:47.350> there<00:01:47.530> you

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
rope effect in the hair so there you

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.279 
rope effect in the hair so there you
have<00:01:47.649> it<00:01:47.860> that's<00:01:48.549> a<00:01:48.729> quad<00:01:48.939> braid<00:01:49.240> that's<00:01:50.020> what

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
have it that's a quad braid that's what

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.340 
have it that's a quad braid that's what
it<00:01:50.380> looks<00:01:50.530> like<00:01:50.649> from<00:01:50.890> all<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.220> angles
