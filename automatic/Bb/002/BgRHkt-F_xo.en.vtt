00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.519 

at<00:00:02.220> this<00:00:02.429> point<00:00:02.700> we've<00:00:02.970> put<00:00:03.240> in<00:00:03.360> our<00:00:03.659> key

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
at this point we've put in our key

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.849 
at this point we've put in our key
running<00:00:04.950> play<00:00:05.190> our<00:00:05.629> go<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.690> passing<00:00:07.350> play<00:00:07.529> and

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
running play our go to passing play and

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.020 
running play our go to passing play and
now<00:00:07.950> we<00:00:08.010> want<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.220> add<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.550> couple<00:00:08.580> more

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
now we want to add in a couple more

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.640 
now we want to add in a couple more
little<00:00:09.330> options<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.139> give<00:00:10.260> our<00:00:10.349> opponents

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
little options to give our opponents

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.220 
little options to give our opponents
something<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.250> think<00:00:11.400> about<00:00:11.719> and<00:00:12.719> kind<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.139> the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
something to think about and kind of the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.799 
something to think about and kind of the
best<00:00:13.469> option<00:00:14.009> for<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.570> Epistle

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
best option for that is in the Epistle

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.420 
best option for that is in the Epistle
spread<00:00:16.199> formation<00:00:16.740> it's<00:00:16.859> called<00:00:17.010> halfback

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
spread formation it's called halfback

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.790 
spread formation it's called halfback
slip<00:00:17.730> screen<00:00:18.230> and<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:19.320> we'll<00:00:19.410> call<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.619> against

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
slip screen and so we'll call it against

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.279 
slip screen and so we'll call it against
some<00:00:19.920> random<00:00:20.279> defenses<00:00:20.850> now<00:00:21.600> obviously<00:00:21.930> at

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
some random defenses now obviously at

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.509 
some random defenses now obviously at
this<00:00:22.380> point<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:23.039> should<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.310> established

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
this point we should have established

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.630 
this point we should have established
both<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.000> run<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> play-action<00:00:24.869> pass

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
both the run and the play-action pass

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.220 
both the run and the play-action pass
you<00:00:26.640> can<00:00:26.789> also<00:00:26.939> kind<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.510> throw<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> screen

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
you can also kind of throw in the screen

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.310 
you can also kind of throw in the screen
once<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.529> establish<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.929> run<00:00:30.929> play<00:00:31.170> without

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
once you establish the run play without

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170 
once you establish the run play without
establishing<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.070> pass<00:00:32.219> play<00:00:32.520> because<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
establishing the pass play because the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.200 
establishing the pass play because the
screens<00:00:33.510> are<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.899> good<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.230> year<00:00:35.210> this

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
screens are just so good this year this

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.869 
screens are just so good this year this
is<00:00:36.329> something<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.600> mentioned<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.350> e-book

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
is something I mentioned in the e-book

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.590 
is something I mentioned in the e-book
but<00:00:38.879> i<00:00:38.910> figure<00:00:39.090> i'll<00:00:39.180> share<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.450> because

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
but i figure i'll share it because

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.770 
but i figure i'll share it because
people<00:00:39.960> eventually<00:00:40.170> figured<00:00:40.559> out<00:00:40.649> anyway<00:00:41.780> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
people eventually figured out anyway the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.690 
people eventually figured out anyway the
timing<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.260> different<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.860> screen<00:00:44.129> passes<00:00:44.340> on

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
timing is different for screen passes on

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.369 
timing is different for screen passes on
the<00:00:44.910> PlayStation<00:00:45.329> 4<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.510> Xbox<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:46.110> than<00:00:46.289> it

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one than it

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.190 
the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one than it
is<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.219> current<00:00:47.520> generation<00:00:47.610> systems<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
is on the current generation systems the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.779 
is on the current generation systems the
password<00:00:49.410> gets<00:00:49.800> there<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> half<00:00:50.370> second

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
password gets there just a half second

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.479 
password gets there just a half second
faster<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.140> you're<00:00:52.320> still<00:00:53.070> kind<00:00:53.370> of

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
faster and so if you're still kind of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.889 
faster and so if you're still kind of
ps3<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.690> xbox360<00:00:55.590> mode<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:57.329> that's<00:00:57.690> kind<00:00:57.870> of

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
ps3 and xbox360 mode and that's kind of

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.170 
ps3 and xbox360 mode and that's kind of
ingrained<00:00:58.320> into<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.879> will<00:01:00.030> take

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
ingrained into what you do it will take

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.400 
ingrained into what you do it will take
a<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:00.420> bit<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.660> getting<00:01:00.809> used<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.260> throw

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
a little bit of getting used to to throw

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.650 
a little bit of getting used to to throw
a<00:01:01.440> ball<00:01:01.590> about<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.829> half<00:01:02.070> seconds<00:01:02.550> sooner<00:01:02.730> than

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
a ball about a half seconds sooner than

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.410 
a ball about a half seconds sooner than
what<00:01:03.840> you're<00:01:03.960> used<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:05.090> doesn't<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.330> do

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
what you're used to doesn't like to do

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.660 
what you're used to doesn't like to do
with<00:01:06.540> screen<00:01:06.780> passes<00:01:07.250> this<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
with screen passes this is more of a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.240 
with screen passes this is more of a
high<00:01:08.850> level<00:01:09.270> type<00:01:09.479> thing<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.860> lot<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.130> people

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
high level type thing is a lot of people

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
high level type thing is a lot of people
higher<00:01:11.820> levels<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.330> diagnose<00:01:12.810> screen<00:01:13.110> passes

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
higher levels can diagnose screen passes

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.700 
higher levels can diagnose screen passes
based<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> routes<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.820> receivers<00:01:15.330> run

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
based on the routes of the receivers run

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.649 
based on the routes of the receivers run
so<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.250> mix<00:01:17.820> up<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.540> route

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
so I just like to mix up there the route

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.480 
so I just like to mix up there the route
to<00:01:18.810> my<00:01:18.869> receivers<00:01:19.259> are<00:01:19.350> going<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.530> run<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:19.890> so

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
to my receivers are going to run just so

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.270 
to my receivers are going to run just so
it<00:01:20.580> doesn't<00:01:20.640> look<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.450> screen<00:01:21.750> pass

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
it doesn't look like it's a screen pass

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.450 
it doesn't look like it's a screen pass
so<00:01:23.280> something<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:25.310> it's<00:01:26.310> probably

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
so something like this it's probably

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.190 
so something like this it's probably
something<00:01:26.729> I'd<00:01:26.909> run<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.750> my<00:01:27.900> opponent

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
something I'd run just so I my opponent

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.760 
something I'd run just so I my opponent
doesn't<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.610> if<00:01:29.610> he<00:01:30.329> happens<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.680> know

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
doesn't know if he happens to you know

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.260 
doesn't know if he happens to you know
watch<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.250> video<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:32.820> he<00:01:32.880> happens<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.210> be

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
watch this video or if he happens to be

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.910 
watch this video or if he happens to be
an<00:01:33.360> expert<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> pistol<00:01:34.110> spread<00:01:34.350> formation

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
an expert on the pistol spread formation

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.620 
an expert on the pistol spread formation
this<00:01:35.579> Lee<00:01:35.729> doesn't<00:01:35.909> know<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.420> that's

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
this Lee doesn't know that that that's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.819 
this Lee doesn't know that that that's
what<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> screen<00:01:37.140> pass<00:01:37.320> looks<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.799> owe

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
what the screen pass looks like I owe

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.830 
what the screen pass looks like I owe
this<00:01:37.950> formation<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.210> we're<00:01:39.570> kind<00:01:39.750> of

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
this formation and so we're kind of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.310 
this formation and so we're kind of
giving<00:01:40.229> us<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.650> one<00:01:40.979> extra<00:01:41.280> little<00:01:41.460> advantage

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
giving us one one extra little advantage

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.719 
giving us one one extra little advantage
so<00:01:43.320> our<00:01:43.380> opponent<00:01:43.710> doesn't<00:01:44.310> know<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.610> we're

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so our opponent doesn't know it we're

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.240 
so our opponent doesn't know it we're
running<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.970> screen<00:01:45.149> pass<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.570> last<00:01:45.840> second<00:01:46.250> I

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
running a screen pass to a last second I

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.399 
running a screen pass to a last second I
use<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> X<00:01:48.240> receiver<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> drag<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
use the X receiver on a drag here as a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.950 
use the X receiver on a drag here as a
bailout<00:01:49.670> if<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:51.149> whatever<00:01:51.450> reason<00:01:51.840> our

bailout if if whatever reason our

bailout if if whatever reason our
running<00:01:52.470> back<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.799> covered<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.310> won't<00:01:53.579> be

cover<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.219> outside<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.790> maybe<00:01:59.969> putting<00:02:00.090> your

cover it outside of maybe putting your

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.690 
cover it outside of maybe putting your

controlling<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> maybe<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> safety<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
controlling that a maybe like a safety a

controlling that a maybe like a safety a
linebacker<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.490> stop<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.909> screen<00:02:06.770> not<00:02:07.770> much

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
linebacker to stop the screen not much

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.680 
linebacker to stop the screen not much
else<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.220> say<00:02:08.310> about<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.759> I'll<00:02:09.030> run<00:02:09.479> up<00:02:09.569> through

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
else to say about it I'll run up through

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.530 
else to say about it I'll run up through
a<00:02:09.720> couple<00:02:09.869> times<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.289> it's<00:02:10.410> very<00:02:10.649> effective

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
a couple times so it's very effective

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.460 
a couple times so it's very effective
even<00:02:12.540> more<00:02:12.870> effective

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
even more effective

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.620 
even more effective
maybe<00:02:13.770> it's<00:02:13.920> been<00:02:14.040> current<00:02:14.400> generations<00:02:20.630> only

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
maybe it's been current generations only

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.150 
maybe it's been current generations only
a<00:02:21.660> 5-yard<00:02:22.170> gain<00:02:22.230> there<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:22.710> in<00:02:22.830> German<00:02:23.070> we're

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
a 5-yard gain there but in German we're

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.640 
a 5-yard gain there but in German we're
gonna<00:02:23.280> get<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.430> lot<00:02:23.520> more<00:02:23.580> than<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.560> again<00:02:25.560> you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
gonna get a lot more than that again you

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.780 
gonna get a lot more than that again you
can<00:02:25.680> put<00:02:25.860> your<00:02:25.920> receivers<00:02:26.250> on<00:02:26.370> whatever<00:02:26.520> you

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
can put your receivers on whatever you

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.750 
can put your receivers on whatever you
feel<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.120> putting<00:02:27.900> them<00:02:27.990> on<00:02:31.700> remember<00:02:32.700> to

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
feel like putting them on remember to

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.860 
feel like putting them on remember to
get<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.910> ball<00:02:33.090> out<00:02:33.150> sooner<00:02:33.570> than<00:02:33.690> you're<00:02:33.840> used

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
get the ball out sooner than you're used

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.510 
get the ball out sooner than you're used
to<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:34.800> can<00:02:34.920> see<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.100> blocking

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
to and you can see the blocking

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.490 
to and you can see the blocking
downfield<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.970> very<00:02:36.180> good<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:37.140> end<00:02:37.260> up<00:02:37.350> with<00:02:37.470> a

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
downfield is very good we end up with a

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.280 
downfield is very good we end up with a
touchdown<00:02:37.740> run<00:02:38.100> one<00:02:38.280> final<00:02:38.670> time<00:02:38.850> here<00:02:39.290> again

touchdown run one final time here again
just<00:02:40.530> kind<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.800> mess<00:02:40.980> with<00:02:41.010> some<00:02:41.280> hot<00:02:41.460> routes

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
just kind of mess with some hot routes

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.600 
just kind of mess with some hot routes
you<00:02:43.830> know<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.100> don't<00:02:44.220> have<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.370> do<00:02:44.430> anything
