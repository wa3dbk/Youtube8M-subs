00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello girls we find ourselves 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.960
 today for a new video 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.099
 so today we are going to talk about hairstyle 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.080
 so I'm going to give you a tip that 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.300
 I use for my hair so his 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.639
 trust in actually attaching the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.160
 hair in a bun like this without 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.670
 elastic that is to say that I will use 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.699
 an elastic pad no bar is no 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.710
 little passes and just my hair that 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.510
 people are driving in a way with a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.910
 another wick is actually this match but 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.009
 frankly it holds very well and me that 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.870
 is really going to save my life because I 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.969
 long hair and sometimes when he 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.620
 hot when I'm concentrated but 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.890
 I need my task and hair 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.420
 and sometimes I do not have rubber bands or 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.360
 so I tie my hair and the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.070
 chief the elastic yb and and I'm farting a 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.570
 day I discovered this technique and 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.570
 I would like to share it with you 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.550
 if you too have mid hair 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.180
 long blond then we can use 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.449
 this trick on curly hair in 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.250
 tulle and curly finally all the stuff 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.550
 like that I think it works very 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.610
 well 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.430
 I have my hair list naturally 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.659
 so it works very well for him too 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.060
 are some small wicks like you 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.619
 see there that leave a little but good 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.100
 it's not disturbing and I swear to you that 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.900
 that you're too good I admit doing that it's 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.930
 see it go down a little bit but it holds 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.150
 so his wife tish 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.820
 we are a bit destroyed but at least 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.370
 this chain must then for that it 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.130
 you just need your hands and your hair 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.830
 because it may happen brushes 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.660
 and again without the brushes and that you have 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.800
 very well so I'll show you I 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.320
 leave you with following the video 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.550
 who will explain to you first of all 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.530
 detached but at home so I 'll go 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.500
 show that there is no elastic band 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.140
 red and and h 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.610
 and here and there is nothing at all 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.490
 normal hair 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.740
 Here it was no ps reacts 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.610
 the article and I did not even use it 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.460
 so that's it for this trick to 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.229
 this trick you just need to the web 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.119
 with the hair behind like that during 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.310
 way is actually going to have you 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.810
 separate your hair into two parts 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.090
 that is, you take your hair 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.810
 like that from the top of the ears up 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.330
 behind so you do like this 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.700
 then you take your hair there up 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.320
 behind and wanted to split in two 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.299
 parts like this yeah I do not know if 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.400
 you like it but I felt 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.209
 really of those above and we're going 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.410
 then there is actually stopped by stopping 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.320
 not be very straight 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.620
 well we do not care you take a wick 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.130
 there in the middle and in fact it will be the wick 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.950
 the longest of all your hair in 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.799
 done and that's it 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.269
 and you put it in your mouth or 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.420
 then you keep it going 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.549
 now to you then you let go of your 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.170
 hair you pick up as if you 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.140
 always keep there but if you do not have the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.950
 let go and finally you're going to take 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.570
 all your choices 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.670
 I take it back to the room and take 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:10.680
 all to the hair and you will do them 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:13.030
 come up in words like this 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.760
 that's where you have all your 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:21.100
 hair and in fact you're just going to them 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.780
 words wiggle like this if I come back 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.360
 on the side it's pascal in auto screen 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.070
 for good wears me like those so it's 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.430
 until the end it's like that and in fact 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.730
 you're just going to turn around your 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.480
 head like that always having the 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.390
 hair redone if you like it there 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.980
 that's where you went 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.390
 was turning in what direction 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.820
 I turned in the opposite direction of 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.590
 clockwise so towards the 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.230
 right is actually the little wick that 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.300
 I have here I go the tour in the other 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.070
 meaning that I'm going to mount it 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.290
 up there and I'm going touring to the 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:06.810
 left like this and they serve together 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:10.260
 we turn and kill a bit for ceret and 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.330
 Here just let go and you want it 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.459
 that's what makes you a little bun down 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.109
 after you sometimes it's a little tight 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.890
 people - I have too much then this 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.210
 schirrhein little sulked tight like this 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.169
 down a few locks you 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:31.919
 like it be beautiful and that's it you know 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.919
 a simple bun without elastic 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.950
 So that's all that but in fact 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.290
 you recapitulate you take all your 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.480
 hair wanted to split in half you 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.700
 take a lock behind the longest 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.740
 that you keep with you go back 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.840
 your hair all in euros where the 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.300
 twisted like that you have to 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.400
 go out on their own in a way and 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.750
 their little wick lot that you 'll have 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.030
 keep in your mouth you 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.400

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.700
 to say that cabbages and will be like that and 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.740
 there but it will be like that and you shoot 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.290
