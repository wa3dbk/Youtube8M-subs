00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.500 
then I like to put the tray on I think
it's<00:04:52.090> this<00:04:52.300> way<00:04:52.540> yeah<00:04:54.030> look<00:04:55.030> at<00:04:55.150> it<00:04:55.180> doesn't

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
it's this way yeah look at it doesn't

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.490 
it's this way yeah look at it doesn't
really<00:04:55.750> matter<00:04:56.050> which<00:04:56.770> way<00:04:57.010> it<00:04:57.040> goes<00:04:57.160> on<00:04:57.490> well

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
really matter which way it goes on well

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.659 
really matter which way it goes on well
for<00:05:01.080> carrying<00:05:02.080> purpose<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.620> purposes<00:05:03.400> I<00:05:03.520> guess

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
for carrying purpose I purposes I guess

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.360 
for carrying purpose I purposes I guess
it's<00:05:03.880> better<00:05:04.090> to<00:05:04.330> go<00:05:04.450> on<00:05:04.480> backwards<00:05:05.340> so<00:05:06.340> that

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
it's better to go on backwards so that

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.840 
it's better to go on backwards so that
way<00:05:07.200> you<00:05:08.200> can<00:05:08.500> pick<00:05:09.460> it<00:05:09.580> up<00:05:09.730> and<00:05:11.550> take<00:05:12.550> it<00:05:12.610> with

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
way you can pick it up and take it with

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.070 
way you can pick it up and take it with
you<00:05:13.169> see<00:05:14.169> just<00:05:14.560> like<00:05:14.710> that<00:05:14.950> so<00:05:15.700> and<00:05:16.180> you<00:05:16.960> know

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
you see just like that so and you know

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.030 
you see just like that so and you know
so<00:05:17.320> if<00:05:17.440> you<00:05:17.590> have<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.800> smaller<00:05:18.310> car<00:05:19.110> it<00:05:20.110> will<00:05:20.290> fit

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
so if you have a smaller car it will fit

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.570 
so if you have a smaller car it will fit
