00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
which is has a good enzyme in there

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.600 
which is has a good enzyme in there
called<00:00:51.239> bromelain<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:52.140> bromelain<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.520> is

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
called bromelain and bromelain really is

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.119 
called bromelain and bromelain really is
what<00:00:53.879> helps<00:00:54.149> break<00:00:54.719> down<00:00:54.750> some<00:00:55.379> proteins<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
what helps break down some proteins and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
what helps break down some proteins and
and<00:00:56.370> works<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.300> anti-inflammatory<00:00:57.840> inside

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
and works as anti-inflammatory inside

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
also be pro-inflammatory so to reduce

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.789 
also be pro-inflammatory so to reduce
inflammation<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:27.330> want<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.689> eat<00:01:27.840> foods<00:01:28.560> like

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.559 
entire lower back and wrap the strap
around<00:02:31.510> my<00:02:32.140> abdomen<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.970> it's<00:02:33.970> pretty<00:02:34.390> much

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
around my abdomen and it's pretty much

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.170 
around my abdomen and it's pretty much
locked<00:02:34.989> in<00:02:35.230> place<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.069> so<00:02:36.280> cool<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.790> I

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
locked in place and it is so cool and I

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.780 
locked in place and it is so cool and I
walk<00:02:37.420> around<00:02:37.629> anywhere<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:39.190> just<00:02:39.580> stays

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
walk around anywhere and it just stays

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.479 
walk around anywhere and it just stays
in<00:02:39.970> place<00:02:40.209> so<00:02:40.780> it's<00:02:41.650> really<00:02:41.980> really<00:02:42.190> helped

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
in place so it's really really helped

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.160 
in place so it's really really helped
and<00:02:42.640> actually<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.090> ice<00:02:43.239> pack<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.780> probably

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
and actually the ice pack is probably

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.620 
and actually the ice pack is probably
the<00:02:44.290> best<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.709> I<00:02:44.739> BAC<00:02:45.040> ever<00:02:45.280> found<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:46.299> stays

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
the best that I BAC ever found it stays

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.680 
the best that I BAC ever found it stays
cold<00:02:46.959> for<00:02:47.200> about<00:02:47.709> four<00:02:48.010> or<00:02:48.040> five<00:02:48.310> hours<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.060> I

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
cold for about four or five hours and I

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.180 
cold for about four or five hours and I
usually<00:02:49.840> keep<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.319> ice<00:02:50.440> pack<00:02:50.709> when<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:50.980> get

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
usually keep the ice pack when I get

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.160 
usually keep the ice pack when I get
home<00:02:51.370> at<00:02:51.519> night<00:02:51.549> I<00:02:51.730> keep<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.180> on<00:02:52.299> there<00:02:52.540> for

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
home at night I keep it on there for

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.930 
home at night I keep it on there for
probably<00:02:53.319> that<00:02:53.650> long<00:02:53.860> until<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.340> go<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.519> bed<00:02:54.640> at

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
probably that long until I go to bed at

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.050 
probably that long until I go to bed at
night<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.890> definitely<00:02:57.400> done<00:02:57.549> a<00:02:57.579> world

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
night and it's definitely done a world

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.539

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
seen one before and I just was stumbling

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.720 
seen one before and I just was stumbling
into<00:03:18.609> Meijer<00:03:19.269> one<00:03:19.540> day<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:21.250> looked<00:03:21.489> and

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
into Meijer one day and just looked and

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.910 
into Meijer one day and just looked and
