00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
powdered sugar either two tablespoons of

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.520 
powdered sugar either two tablespoons of
vinegar<00:00:50.579> I'm<00:00:51.510> using<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:53.449> cane<00:00:54.449> vinegar<00:00:54.530> but

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
vinegar I'm using the cane vinegar but

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.369 
vinegar I'm using the cane vinegar but
rice<00:00:55.800> vinegar<00:00:55.980> will<00:00:56.309> work<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:56.820> well<00:00:56.850> I

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
rice vinegar will work just as well I

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.040 
rice vinegar will work just as well I
have<00:00:58.379> half<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.829> teaspoon<00:00:59.370> of<00:01:00.050> granulated

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
have half a teaspoon of granulated

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.039 
have half a teaspoon of granulated
garlic<00:01:01.940> I've<00:01:02.940> tried<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.359> fresh<00:01:03.629> garlic

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
garlic I've tried it with fresh garlic

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.320 
garlic I've tried it with fresh garlic
and<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.710> actually<00:01:04.799> think<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.700> granulated

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and I actually think the granulated

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.609 
and I actually think the granulated
garlic<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> little<00:01:07.049> better<00:01:07.200> because<00:01:07.380> it's

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
garlic is a little better because it's

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.429 
garlic is a little better because it's
not<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:08.119> garlic<00:01:09.119> forward<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.930> guess<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.290> could

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
not as garlic forward I guess you could

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.980 
not as garlic forward I guess you could
say<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:11.400> as<00:01:11.520> strong<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:12.600> gives<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> that

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
say it's not as strong it gives you that

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.160 
say it's not as strong it gives you that
garlic<00:01:13.350> flavor<00:01:13.380> without<00:01:13.890> being<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.189> strong<00:01:14.460> I

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170
