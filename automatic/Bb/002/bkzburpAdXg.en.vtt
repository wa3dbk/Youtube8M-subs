00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.070 

there<00:00:02.970> are<00:00:03.060> two<00:00:03.240> different<00:00:03.629> ways<00:00:03.780> in<00:00:04.049> which

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
there are two different ways in which

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.590 
there are two different ways in which
you<00:00:04.230> can<00:00:04.529> meet<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.799> light<00:00:05.220> one<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.270> called<00:00:06.509> a

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
you can meet a light one is called a

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.720 
you can meet a light one is called a
reflective<00:00:07.319> meter<00:00:07.589> reading<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.220> that's<00:00:08.519> what

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
reflective meter reading and that's what

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.700 
reflective meter reading and that's what
your<00:00:08.880> camera<00:00:09.360> does<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.809> measures<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.380> light

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
your camera does it measures the light

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.770 
your camera does it measures the light
that's<00:00:10.980> reflected<00:00:11.160> off<00:00:11.790> whatever<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.630> is

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
that's reflected off whatever it is

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.230 
that's reflected off whatever it is
you're<00:00:12.990> pointing<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.500> camera<00:00:13.679> at<00:00:14.089> the<00:00:15.089> other

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
you're pointing the camera at the other

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.330 
you're pointing the camera at the other
is<00:00:15.389> called<00:00:15.540> an<00:00:15.690> incident<00:00:16.350> meter<00:00:16.619> reading<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
is called an incident meter reading and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.130 
is called an incident meter reading and
that<00:00:17.850> measures<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.359> light<00:00:18.539> that's<00:00:18.720> falling

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
that measures the light that's falling

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.380 
that measures the light that's falling
onto<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.800> subject<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.850> light<00:00:21.029> that's<00:00:21.210> all

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
onto the subject the light that's all

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.529 
onto the subject the light that's all
around<00:00:21.660> us<00:00:21.900> out<00:00:22.230> here<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.710> atmosphere

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
around us out here in the atmosphere

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.550 
around us out here in the atmosphere
let's<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.810> we'll<00:00:24.990> think<00:00:25.140> about<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
let's that we'll think about the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.650 
let's that we'll think about the
reflective<00:00:26.070> meter<00:00:26.279> reading<00:00:26.640> first<00:00:26.939> there's

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
reflective meter reading first there's

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.810 
reflective meter reading first there's
one<00:00:27.840> obvious<00:00:27.960> drawback<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.609> that

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
one obvious drawback and that is that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.400 
one obvious drawback and that is that
different<00:00:30.210> things<00:00:30.449> reflect<00:00:30.689> light<00:00:31.140> in

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
different things reflect light in

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.470 
different things reflect light in
different<00:00:32.040> ways<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.610> different<00:00:32.640> amounts

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
different ways and in different amounts

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.150 
different ways and in different amounts
just<00:00:34.200> imagine<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.710> were<00:00:34.800> at<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> wedding

of that's going to reflect very much
light<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.409> all<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.040> let's<00:01:09.000> put<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> into

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
light at all is it let's put it into

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.100 
light at all is it let's put it into
practice<00:01:09.960> here<00:01:10.260> meet<00:01:10.740> my<00:01:10.860> bride<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.159> groom

now<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:15.470> pseudo<00:01:16.470> bride<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.920> groom<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.189> should

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
now then pseudo bride and groom I should

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.300 
now then pseudo bride and groom I should
say<00:01:17.960> if<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.110> was<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.380> set<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> take<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
say if I was going to set up and take a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.179 
say if I was going to set up and take a
shot<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.090> bride<00:01:21.500> when<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> do<00:01:22.650> I'm<00:01:23.070> not

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
shot of the bride when I do I'm not

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.590 
shot of the bride when I do I'm not
going<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.400> compose<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.970> very<00:01:24.210> well<00:01:24.450> because

the camera so the camera is now pointing
at<00:01:30.180> our<00:01:30.360> bride<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.579> light

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
at our bride if you can see the light

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.640 
at our bride if you can see the light
meter<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.210> saying<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:34.079> massively

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
meter is saying it's massively

end<00:01:36.740> bring<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.829> back<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.790> what<00:01:38.939> I've<00:01:39.030> got<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
end bring it back up so what I've got to

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.929 
end bring it back up so what I've got to
do<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:40.110> underexpose<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.070> bit<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.579> need<00:01:41.790> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
do is to underexpose a bit so I need to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.260 
do is to underexpose a bit so I need to
bring<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.180> shutter<00:01:42.630> speed<00:01:42.960> up<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.439> need<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
bring that shutter speed up I need to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.300 
bring that shutter speed up I need to
speed<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> shutter<00:01:45.780> speed<00:01:45.990> until<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.130> get

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
speed up the shutter speed until we get

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.859 
speed up the shutter speed until we get
the<00:01:47.460> correct<00:01:47.700> exposure<00:01:47.880> which<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.659> very

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the correct exposure which is very

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.480 
the correct exposure which is very
nearly<00:01:49.170> there<00:01:49.439> here<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.070> go<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> eight

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
nearly there here we go and eight

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.539 
nearly there here we go and eight
hundredths<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.000> second<00:01:51.299> at<00:01:51.420> f/8<00:01:52.340> I've<00:01:53.340> got

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
hundredths of a second at f/8 I've got

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.789 
hundredths of a second at f/8 I've got
the<00:01:53.640> autofocus<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.450> can't<00:01:54.689> focus<00:01:54.930> hang<00:01:55.680> on

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the autofocus on so can't focus hang on

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.880 
the autofocus on so can't focus hang on
here<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.159> go<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.049> take<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> picture<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.770> our

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
here we go and I take a picture of our

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.010 
here we go and I take a picture of our
bride<00:01:59.310> now<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> don't<00:02:00.299> know<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.509> can<00:02:00.689> see<00:02:00.899> in

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
bride now I don't know if you can see in

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.780 
bride now I don't know if you can see in
the<00:02:01.110> back<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.439> camera<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:02.430> that's<00:02:02.579> not

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the back of the camera but that's not

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.340 
the back of the camera but that's not
very<00:02:02.820> white<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:04.409> quite<00:02:04.619> great

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
very white is it is really quite great

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.960 
very white is it is really quite great
next

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
next

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.520 
next
I'm<00:02:08.600> going<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.840> bring<00:02:08.960> up<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.110> light<00:02:09.290> meter

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
I'm going to bring up the light meter

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.830 
I'm going to bring up the light meter
again<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.460> time<00:02:10.790> let's<00:02:11.300> have<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.510> look<00:02:11.720> at

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
again this time let's have a look at

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.110 
again this time let's have a look at
what<00:02:11.960> happens<00:02:12.410> when<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.590> move<00:02:12.950> between<00:02:13.700> our

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
what happens when I move between our

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.370 
what happens when I move between our
bride<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.420> our<00:02:14.750> groom

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
bride and our groom

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.250 
bride and our groom
so<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.950> exposures<00:02:16.490> about<00:02:16.910> right<00:02:17.150> for<00:02:18.110> our

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
so the exposures about right for our

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.040 
so the exposures about right for our
bride<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.970> lights<00:02:20.150> changed<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.690> little<00:02:20.900> bit

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
bride the lights changed a little bit

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.560 
bride the lights changed a little bit
there<00:02:21.200> we<00:02:21.230> go<00:02:21.730> there<00:02:22.730> come<00:02:22.880> with<00:02:22.940> me<00:02:23.150> as<00:02:23.360> we

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
there we go there come with me as we

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.870 
there we go there come with me as we
point<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.020> camera<00:02:24.200> at<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.250> groom<00:02:25.460> who's<00:02:25.700> so

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
point the camera at the groom who's so

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.760 
point the camera at the groom who's so
drunk<00:02:26.030> he<00:02:26.330> nearly<00:02:26.510> fell<00:02:26.720> over<00:02:26.780> there<00:02:27.560> we<00:02:27.620> go

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
drunk he nearly fell over there we go

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.270 
drunk he nearly fell over there we go
look<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:29.090> light<00:02:29.240> meter<00:02:29.510> has<00:02:29.810> now<00:02:30.080> gone<00:02:31.010> to

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
look the light meter has now gone to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.510 
look the light meter has now gone to
massively<00:02:32.030> underexposed<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.140> yet<00:02:33.680> it's<00:02:34.340> the

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
massively underexposed and yet it's the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.060 
massively underexposed and yet it's the
correct<00:02:34.820> exposure<00:02:35.270> for<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.020> bride<00:02:36.260> how

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
correct exposure for the bride how

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.180 
correct exposure for the bride how
peculiar<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:39.500> same<00:02:39.740> amount<00:02:40.070> of

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
peculiar is that the same amount of

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.880 
peculiar is that the same amount of
light<00:02:40.459> is<00:02:40.790> falling<00:02:41.120> onto<00:02:41.390> both<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.930> them<00:02:42.140> it's

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
light is falling onto both of them it's

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.980 
light is falling onto both of them it's
because<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.730> white<00:02:44.000> bride<00:02:44.420> with<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.720> white

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
because the white bride with a white

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.199 
because the white bride with a white
dress<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.530> white<00:02:45.770> wall<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.520> reflecting

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
dress and the white wall is reflecting

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.210 
dress and the white wall is reflecting
masses<00:02:47.660> more<00:02:47.870> light<00:02:48.110> than<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.680> black<00:02:48.890> groom

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
masses more light than the black groom

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.940 
masses more light than the black groom
in<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.430> dark<00:02:49.730> suit<00:02:49.970> against<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.570> bushes<00:02:51.020> so

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
in the dark suit against the bushes so

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.020 
in the dark suit against the bushes so
what<00:02:52.100> would<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.250> do<00:02:52.400> about<00:02:52.520> that<00:02:52.700> well<00:02:52.940> if

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
what would you do about that well if

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.070 
what would you do about that well if
you're<00:02:53.120> going<00:02:53.240> to<00:02:53.300> actually<00:02:53.420> photograph<00:02:53.720> that

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
you're going to actually photograph that

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.110 
you're going to actually photograph that
in<00:02:54.170> real<00:02:54.350> life<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:55.100> wouldn't<00:02:55.640> really<00:02:55.850> matter

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
in real life it wouldn't really matter

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.760 
in real life it wouldn't really matter
because<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:56.870> long<00:02:57.020> as<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.290> picture<00:02:57.650> is

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
because so long as the picture is

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.100 
because so long as the picture is
half-and-half<00:02:58.250> those<00:02:59.120> two<00:02:59.390> things<00:02:59.660> will<00:02:59.870> mix

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
half-and-half those two things will mix

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.050 
half-and-half those two things will mix
together<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.860> become<00:03:01.370> what's<00:03:01.580> called<00:03:01.670> mid

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
together and become what's called mid

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.270 
together and become what's called mid
gray<00:03:02.330> that's<00:03:02.630> a<00:03:02.750> gray<00:03:03.260> tone<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:03.860> exactly

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
gray that's a gray tone it's exactly

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.550 
gray that's a gray tone it's exactly
halfway<00:03:04.610> between<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.480> two<00:03:05.690> so<00:03:06.200> if<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.380> was

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
halfway between the two so if I was

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.830 
halfway between the two so if I was
actually<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.950> take<00:03:07.130> that<00:03:07.400> picture<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.570> just

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
actually to take that picture and I just

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.160 
actually to take that picture and I just
set<00:03:09.020> up<00:03:09.050> there<00:03:09.440> where<00:03:10.250> are<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:10.490> there<00:03:10.790> we<00:03:10.880> go<00:03:11.170> as

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
set up there where are we there we go as

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.370 
set up there where are we there we go as
you<00:03:12.380> can<00:03:12.620> see<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:14.209> whites<00:03:14.420> white<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.989> the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
you can see the whites white and the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.740 
you can see the whites white and the
blacks<00:03:15.620> black<00:03:15.950> all<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:16.610> did<00:03:16.910> was<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.300> set<00:03:17.510> up<00:03:17.540> the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
blacks black all I did was to set up the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.759 
blacks black all I did was to set up the
light<00:03:17.930> meter<00:03:18.170> had<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.350> do<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.530> through<00:03:18.680> the

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
light meter had to do it through the

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.410 
light meter had to do it through the
viewfinder<00:03:18.950> because<00:03:19.640> I<00:03:19.790> couldn't<00:03:20.060> line<00:03:20.239> up
