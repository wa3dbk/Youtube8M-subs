ERNIE: Hey!

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.390
So this is where I left
my lunch box.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.465
I was wondering where
I left my lunch box.

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:08.432
Hope my lunch is still in it.

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:09.620
[HUMMING]

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.600
ERNIE: Oh.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.990
Let's see.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.702
Here's one half of my chicken
salad sandwich.

00:00:15.702 --> 00:00:16.980
Gee.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.700
But where's the other half?

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.880
It's gone!

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.586
Gee!

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:26.570
Who could figure out what
happened to the other half of

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.236
my chicken salad sandwich?

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:30.640
I know who could
figure it out.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.580
A detective!

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.700

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.010

detective music.

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:42.340
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: Egad!

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.130
The hunt's afoot!

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.985
Show me the clues.

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:45.880
ERNIE: Who are you?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.795
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: Sherlock
Hemlock, the

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:49.840
world's greatest detective.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.420
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: My senses are
keen, my mind is acute.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.890
Wherever I'm needed, I go.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.555
Whenever--

00:00:58.555 --> 00:01:00.440
what were we talking about?

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.860
ERNIE: My lunch box here.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.350
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK:
The lunch box!

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.480
Aha.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.010
What about the lunch box?

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.175
ERNIE: The sandwich.

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:08.540
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK:
Chicken salad.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.352
Delicious.

00:01:09.352 --> 00:01:11.020
ERNIE: How do you know
it's delicious?

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.400
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: I mean,
it looks delicious.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.090
Chicken salad's my favorite.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.945
Now, what was it you
wanted to know?

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:21.180
ERNIE: What happened to
the other half of my

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.410
chicken salad sandwich?

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.480
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: Wait!

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.420
Don't tell me.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.310
Let me deduce it
from the clues.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.070
ERNIE: OK.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.340
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: I'll bet that
you want to know what

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.585
happened to the other half
of your sandwich.

00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:32.665
Am I right?

00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:34.060
ERNIE: Why, yes.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.260
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: Um hum!

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.550
Let me look at the lunch box.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.590
ERNIE: OK.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.432
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: Aha!

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:41.030
ERNIE: What?

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.980
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: What's that?

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.850
ERNIE: Let me see.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.916
Why, it's a bread crust.

00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:48.120
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: Egad!

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.245
Whoever ate your sandwich
doesn't like bread crust.

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:54.886
You know, many people think
bread crust is yucky.

00:01:54.886 --> 00:01:55.870
Yucky!

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.730
ERNIE: They do?

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.710
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: Let's
not think about it.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.200
Look!

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.180
Another clue.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.450
ERNIE: Ah!

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.730
Look at this.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.260
It's a button from a coat.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.070
Gee.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.699
But how did that get
in my lunch box?

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.420
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: Whoever
ate the sandwich must

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.410
have dropped it.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.142
ERNIE: Hmm.

00:02:13.142 --> 00:02:14.720
I never thought of that.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.840
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: In short, the
man who ate half of your

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.830
sandwich likes chicken salad,
doesn't like bread crust, and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.400
wears a coat with buttons
that match this one.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.730
Find that man and
you've found--

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.070
ERNIE: Excuse me, Mr. Hemlock,
but you like chicken salad

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.130
sandwiches, you don't like
bread crust, and

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.054
this is your button!

[ORGAN MUSIC]

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.740
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: Egad!

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.850
That's it!

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.280
I remember!

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.300
I ate the other half
of your sandwich.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.960
How clever of me to
figure it out.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.160
ERNIE: Why, gosh, Mr. Hemlock.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.830
Thanks a lot.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.210
If you hadn't found all those
clues, I never would have

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.260
known what happened to that
half of my sandwich.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.140
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: That's true.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.020
ERNIE: Boy, that's great.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.460
How can I ever reward you?

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.650
SHERLOCK HEMLOCK: How
about with the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.000
other half of the sandwich?
