00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879 
the shower doors officers were getting

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.580 
the shower doors officers were getting
ready<00:00:13.969> to<00:00:14.120> demo<00:00:14.389> off<00:00:14.570> this<00:00:14.750> bathroom<00:00:15.289> because

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
ready to demo off this bathroom because

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.870 
ready to demo off this bathroom because
it<00:00:15.740> wasn't<00:00:16.070> installed<00:00:16.250> properly<00:00:16.670> and<00:00:18.730> you<00:00:19.730> can

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
it wasn't installed properly and you can

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.920 
it wasn't installed properly and you can
see<00:00:20.090> right<00:00:20.390> here<00:00:22.119> how<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:23.180> tile<00:00:23.630> is<00:00:23.750> just

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
see right here how the tile is just

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.670 
see right here how the tile is just
falling<00:00:24.169> off<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:27.079> main<00:00:27.259> reason<00:00:27.649> is

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
falling off and the main reason is

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.229 
falling off and the main reason is
because<00:00:27.770> the<00:00:28.130> tile<00:00:28.369> is<00:00:28.550> installed<00:00:28.610> directly

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.239 
because the tile is installed directly

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.240 
because the tile is installed directly
over<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:29.840> drywall<00:00:30.439> with<00:00:30.770> no<00:00:30.890> waterproofing

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
over the drywall with no waterproofing

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.630 
over the drywall with no waterproofing
behind<00:00:31.939> it<00:00:32.119> and<00:00:32.480> over<00:00:32.750> time<00:00:33.130> the<00:00:34.130> tiles<00:00:34.489> gonna

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
behind it and over time the tiles gonna

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.610 
behind it and over time the tiles gonna
crack<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.570> grout<00:00:35.780> joints<00:00:36.140> are<00:00:36.200> in<00:00:36.290> a<00:00:36.320> crash

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
crack the grout joints are in a crash

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.090 
crack the grout joints are in a crash
and<00:00:36.950> then<00:00:38.379> they're<00:00:39.379> gonna<00:00:39.500> get<00:00:39.589> water<00:00:39.829> behind

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
and then they're gonna get water behind

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.740 
and then they're gonna get water behind
there<00:00:40.339> it's<00:00:40.519> kind<00:00:40.730> of<00:00:40.789> rotted<00:00:41.059> out<00:00:41.149> and<00:00:41.660> so

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
there it's kind of rotted out and so

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.630 
there it's kind of rotted out and so
that's<00:00:41.929> why<00:00:42.109> we<00:00:42.320> have<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.589> redo<00:00:42.890> this<00:00:43.100> tiled

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
that's why we have to redo this tiled

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.569 
that's why we have to redo this tiled
shower<00:00:43.850> that<00:00:44.420> was<00:00:44.539> just<00:00:44.899> installed<00:00:45.289> over<00:00:46.280> less

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
shower that was just installed over less

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.020

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
than a year and a half ago so we'll go

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.340

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
that was that created just because the

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.670 
that was that created just because the
shower<00:01:34.700> wasn't<00:01:35.180> properly<00:01:35.540> waterproof<00:01:36.410> when

got all the moisture out of it and we

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.910 
got all the moisture out of it and we
went<00:02:18.160> back<00:02:18.250> with<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> waterproofed<00:02:19.920> subfloor

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920

it's not treated but it's got a coating
on<00:02:24.280> top<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.760> just<00:02:24.790> adds<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.180> layer<00:02:25.330> of

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
on top that just adds a layer of

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.229 
on top that just adds a layer of
waterproofing<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.470> then<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.760> went<00:02:27.880> ahead<00:02:28.000> and

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
waterproofing and then we went ahead and

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.449 
waterproofing and then we went ahead and
put<00:02:28.360> all<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.660> cement<00:02:29.230> board<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.739> perma<00:02:29.950> base<00:02:30.220> on

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
put all the cement board a perma base on

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.920 
put all the cement board a perma base on
the<00:02:30.580> walls<00:02:30.790> where<00:02:31.030> all<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.330> tile<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.690> going<00:02:31.870> to

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
the walls where all the tile is going to

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.620 
the walls where all the tile is going to
go<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.069> will<00:02:33.160> add<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.489> up<00:02:33.670> no<00:02:33.970> layer<00:02:34.239> of

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
go and that will add it up no layer of

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.930 
go and that will add it up no layer of
waterproofing<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:36.220> then<00:02:36.370> finally<00:02:36.760> we're

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
waterproofing and then finally we're

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.180 
waterproofing and then finally we're
going<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.090> use<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.300> system<00:02:37.870> made<00:02:38.530> by<00:02:38.560> Schluter

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
going to use a system made by Schluter

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.890 
going to use a system made by Schluter
that's<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.910> coating<00:02:40.239> you<00:02:40.360> know<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.630> Kirti

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
that's a coating you know the Kirti

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.020 
that's a coating you know the Kirti
system<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.730> what<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.519> kit<00:02:45.760> that

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
system and what that is it's a kit that

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.680 
system and what that is it's a kit that
includes<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.870> star<00:02:47.650> foam<00:02:47.920> base<00:02:48.569> depending<00:02:49.569> on

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
includes a star foam base depending on

00:02:49.690 --> 00:03:08.100 
includes a star foam base depending on
the<00:02:49.750> size<00:03:05.069> it's<00:03:06.069> also<00:03:06.310> tapered<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.420> drain

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
the size it's also tapered to the drain

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.600 
the size it's also tapered to the drain
for<00:03:08.410> water<00:03:08.620> drains<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.850> then<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:11.070> includes<00:03:12.070> a

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:21.150 
for water drains and then it includes a
curve<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.840> will<00:03:14.019> fit<00:03:14.230> in<00:03:14.410> here<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:20.859> keep<00:03:21.040> the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
curve that will fit in here to keep the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.039 
curve that will fit in here to keep the
water<00:03:21.340> inside<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.970> shower<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:22.840> whole

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
water inside the shower so this whole

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.569 
water inside the shower so this whole
system<00:03:23.320> along<00:03:23.920> with<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:26.040> waterproof<00:03:27.040> membrane

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
system along with a waterproof membrane

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.370 
system along with a waterproof membrane
that<00:03:28.030> goes<00:03:28.180> on<00:03:28.359> the<00:03:28.480> walls<00:03:28.690> which<00:03:29.019> will<00:03:29.200> show

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
that goes on the walls which will show

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.069 
that goes on the walls which will show
later<00:03:30.239> completely<00:03:31.239> envelops<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.810> whole

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
later completely envelops the whole

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.949 
later completely envelops the whole
shower<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.680> keeps<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:33.040> waterproof<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.900> we

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
shower it keeps it waterproof so we

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.650 
shower it keeps it waterproof so we
finally<00:03:35.290> got<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.709> 30<00:03:36.070> system<00:03:36.970> completely

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
finally got the 30 system completely

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.470 
finally got the 30 system completely
installed<00:03:38.109> and<00:03:38.470> as<00:03:38.769> you<00:03:38.950> can<00:03:39.070> see<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:40.209> shadow

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
installed and as you can see the shadow

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.289 
installed and as you can see the shadow
are<00:03:40.690> now<00:03:40.959> completely<00:03:41.799> waterproofed<00:03:42.489> with

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
are now completely waterproofed with

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.560 
are now completely waterproofed with
this<00:03:43.989> membrane<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:45.370> so<00:03:45.400> there<00:03:46.180> should<00:03:46.359> not<00:03:46.510> be

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
this membrane and so there should not be

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.340 
this membrane and so there should not be
any<00:03:46.840> leaks<00:03:47.200> whatsoever<00:03:48.690> from<00:03:49.690> water<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.019> may

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
any leaks whatsoever from water that may

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.590 
any leaks whatsoever from water that may
gaym<00:03:50.590> behind<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.040> tower<00:03:51.310> girl<00:03:51.730> anything<00:03:52.450> that

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
gaym behind the tower girl anything that

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.860 
gaym behind the tower girl anything that
does<00:03:52.810> get<00:03:53.049> in<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.440> will<00:03:53.560> filter<00:03:53.799> down<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:55.690> get

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
does get in and will filter down and get

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.380 
does get in and will filter down and get
into<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.230> drain<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:57.579> way<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.970> drain<00:03:58.209> is

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
into the drain the way the drain is

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.150 
into the drain the way the drain is
designed<00:03:58.720> any<00:03:58.959> water<00:03:59.230> that<00:03:59.350> gets<00:03:59.500> underneath

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
designed any water that gets underneath

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.069 
designed any water that gets underneath
it<00:04:00.340> can<00:04:00.489> still<00:04:00.700> filter<00:04:01.000> into<00:04:01.359> the<00:04:01.480> drain<00:04:01.810> so

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
it can still filter into the drain so

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.309 
it can still filter into the drain so
this<00:04:02.230> whole<00:04:02.440> shower<00:04:03.280> is<00:04:03.549> now<00:04:03.670> completely

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
this whole shower is now completely

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.130 
this whole shower is now completely
waterproof<00:04:05.319> and<00:04:06.810> shouldn't<00:04:07.810> have<00:04:07.900> any

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
waterproof and shouldn't have any

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.509 
waterproof and shouldn't have any
problems<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:09.010> this<00:04:09.430> is<00:04:09.609> how<00:04:09.760> every<00:04:10.209> shower

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
problems and this is how every shower

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.420 
problems and this is how every shower
system<00:04:12.519> should<00:04:12.729> be

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
system should be

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.479 
system should be
any<00:04:14.430> water<00:04:14.670> damage<00:04:15.030> like<00:04:15.360> we<00:04:15.510> saw<00:04:15.720> before<00:04:16.489> so

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
any water damage like we saw before so

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.890 
any water damage like we saw before so
we've<00:04:17.640> got<00:04:17.760> all<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.030> tiles<00:04:18.270> put<00:04:18.540> all<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:18.870> the

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
we've got all the tiles put all in the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.780 
we've got all the tiles put all in the
shower<00:04:19.260> we<00:04:19.920> went<00:04:20.100> ahead<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.340> routed

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
shower we went ahead and routed

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.210 
shower we went ahead and routed
everything<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:22.500> only<00:04:22.590> thing<00:04:22.800> we<00:04:22.920> have<00:04:23.040> left

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
everything the only thing we have left

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.690 
everything the only thing we have left
to<00:04:23.340> do<00:04:23.520> now<00:04:23.550> is<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.540> copy<00:04:24.840> all<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.170> corners<00:04:25.700> and

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
to do now is to copy all the corners and

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.300 
to do now is to copy all the corners and
this<00:04:26.880> is<00:04:27.030> probably<00:04:27.300> one<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.310> biggest

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
this is probably one of the biggest

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.280 
this is probably one of the biggest
mistakes<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.240> see<00:04:30.270> do<00:04:30.660> your<00:04:30.810> shelters

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
mistakes that I see do your shelters

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.960 
mistakes that I see do your shelters
make<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.280> they<00:04:32.790> want<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.830> grab

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
make and that is they want to grab

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.210 
make and that is they want to grab
everything<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:37.350> problem<00:04:37.740> with<00:04:37.890> that<00:04:37.920> is

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
everything and the problem with that is

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.260 
everything and the problem with that is
anytime<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.700> have<00:04:39.950> perpendicular<00:04:40.950> walls<00:04:41.850> or

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
anytime you have perpendicular walls or

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.690 
anytime you have perpendicular walls or
perpendicular<00:04:42.570> materials<00:04:43.500> they'll<00:04:44.490> move

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
perpendicular materials they'll move

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.150 
perpendicular materials they'll move
separate<00:04:45.150> of<00:04:45.210> each<00:04:45.360> other<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.990> so<00:04:46.710> if<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:46.950> put

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
separate of each other and so if you put

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.010 
separate of each other and so if you put
grout<00:04:47.400> on<00:04:47.610> these<00:04:47.730> corners<00:04:48.060> eventually<00:04:48.930> they

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
grout on these corners eventually they

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.260 
grout on these corners eventually they
will<00:04:49.230> crack<00:04:49.560> because<00:04:50.100> once<00:04:50.280> grout<00:04:50.550> dried<00:04:50.850> it's

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
will crack because once grout dried it's

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.900 
will crack because once grout dried it's
almost<00:04:51.510> like<00:04:51.780> concrete<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.890> so<00:04:53.400> what<00:04:53.610> we<00:04:53.760> do

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
almost like concrete and so what we do

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.680 
almost like concrete and so what we do
when<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.360> recommend<00:04:54.930> is<00:04:55.200> using<00:04:55.530> a<00:04:56.360> sanded

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
when I recommend is using a sanded

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.310 
when I recommend is using a sanded
that<00:04:58.350> is<00:04:58.620> color<00:04:59.160> matched<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.760> the<00:05:00.270> ground<00:05:00.540> any

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
that is color matched to the ground any

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.740 
that is color matched to the ground any
place<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:01.590> sounds<00:05:02.100> the<00:05:02.250> grout<00:05:02.490> also<00:05:03.330> sells

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
place that sounds the grout also sells

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.590 
place that sounds the grout also sells
the<00:05:03.900> copy<00:05:04.280> so<00:05:05.280> any<00:05:05.520> order<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:05.940> perpendicular

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
the copy so any order the perpendicular

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.800 
the copy so any order the perpendicular
wall<00:05:06.810> we<00:05:07.140> will<00:05:07.290> copy<00:05:07.560> all<00:05:07.800> that<00:05:08.570> even<00:05:09.570> around

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
wall we will copy all that even around

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.880 
wall we will copy all that even around
the<00:05:10.910> curb<00:05:11.910> here<00:05:12.180> all<00:05:12.960> this<00:05:13.320> will<00:05:13.500> be<00:05:13.620> copped

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
the curb here all this will be copped

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.150 
the curb here all this will be copped
all<00:05:14.730> down<00:05:15.060> around<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.750> pinion<00:05:16.160> everywhere

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
all down around the pinion everywhere

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.340 
all down around the pinion everywhere
there's<00:05:17.430> two<00:05:17.610> corners<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:18.210> mean<00:05:18.450> and<00:05:19.230> then

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
there's two corners that mean and then

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.120 
there's two corners that mean and then
also<00:05:19.530> we<00:05:19.980> will<00:05:20.130> talk<00:05:20.730> along<00:05:21.480> the<00:05:21.560> drywall<00:05:22.560> and

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
also we will talk along the drywall and

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.060 
also we will talk along the drywall and
the<00:05:24.090> tile<00:05:24.330> here<00:05:24.770> because<00:05:25.770> that's<00:05:25.920> two

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
the tile here because that's two

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.290 
the tile here because that's two
different<00:05:26.190> materials<00:05:26.820> that<00:05:26.910> are<00:05:27.000> reading

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
different materials that are reading

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.510 
different materials that are reading
each<00:05:27.330> other<00:05:27.650> okay<00:05:28.650> so<00:05:28.710> that's<00:05:29.070> probably<00:05:29.400> the

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
each other okay so that's probably the

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.420 
each other okay so that's probably the
most<00:05:29.640> common<00:05:30.090> problem<00:05:30.650> mistake<00:05:31.650> that<00:05:31.890> do<00:05:32.280> your

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
most common problem mistake that do your

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.030 
most common problem mistake that do your
shoppers<00:05:32.790> make<00:05:33.030> is<00:05:33.500> grabbing<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:34.530> corners

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
shoppers make is grabbing the corners

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.250 
shoppers make is grabbing the corners
when<00:05:35.190> they<00:05:35.250> need<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.460> be<00:05:35.550> using<00:05:35.850> a<00:05:36.120> and<00:05:36.480> so

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
when they need to be using a and so

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.900 
when they need to be using a and so
tomorrow<00:05:37.590> we'll<00:05:37.920> come<00:05:38.100> back<00:05:38.280> after<00:05:38.670> this<00:05:38.760> is
