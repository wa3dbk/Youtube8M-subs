large group photo so what I'm going to

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.919 
large group photo so what I'm going to
do<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.980> I've<00:00:10.980> got<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.490> bunch<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.420> people<00:00:12.750> here

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
do is I've got a bunch of people here

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.539 
do is I've got a bunch of people here
and<00:00:13.139> I've<00:00:13.349> got<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.559> pretty<00:00:13.769> wide<00:00:13.950> angle<00:00:14.370> zoom

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
and I've got a pretty wide angle zoom

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.730 
and I've got a pretty wide angle zoom
lens<00:00:14.610> now<00:00:15.059> I'm<00:00:15.630> going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.960> put<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> chrome

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
lens now I'm going to put the chrome

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.380 
lens now I'm going to put the chrome
dome<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.100> what<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> chrome<00:00:17.609> dome<00:00:17.850> does<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.270> it

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
dome on what the chrome dome does is it

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.870 
dome on what the chrome dome does is it
basically<00:00:18.510> takes<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.289> light<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.949> raises<00:00:20.850> it

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
basically takes the light and raises it

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.679 
basically takes the light and raises it
above<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.260> see<00:00:22.470> kind<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.769> like<00:00:23.689> versus

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
above so you can see kind of like versus

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.750 
above so you can see kind of like versus
if<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.930> were<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.199> shoot<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.560> straight<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:26.070> if<00:00:26.640> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
if I were to shoot it straight on if I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.140 
if I were to shoot it straight on if I
were<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.000> shoot<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.300> straight<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:28.130> it<00:00:29.150> comes

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
were to shoot it straight on it comes

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.640 
were to shoot it straight on it comes
right<00:00:30.330> at<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> subject<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.230> very<00:00:31.439> very

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
right at the subject in a very very

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.260 
right at the subject in a very very
harsh<00:00:31.920> manner<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.579> what<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> chrome<00:00:33.030> dome

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
harsh manner so what the chrome dome

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.479 
harsh manner so what the chrome dome
does<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.170> actually<00:00:34.320> takes<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.040> light<00:00:35.250> and

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
does is it actually takes the light and

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.900 
does is it actually takes the light and
brings<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> up<00:00:36.270> way<00:00:36.540> above<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.440> flash<00:00:37.980> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
brings it up way above the flash and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.610 
brings it up way above the flash and
then<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.540> will<00:00:39.660> give<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> very<00:00:40.079> soft<00:00:40.320> lighting

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
then it will give a very soft lighting

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
then it will give a very soft lighting
now<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.309> reason<00:00:41.640> why<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.879> also<00:00:42.000> important

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
now the reason why it's also important

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.389 
now the reason why it's also important
is<00:00:42.629> because<00:00:42.930> I've<00:00:43.379> got<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> really<00:00:43.800> wide<00:00:44.010> angle

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
is because I've got a really wide angle

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.840 
is because I've got a really wide angle
lens<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.760> typically<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.329> happens<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.840> these

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
lens and typically what happens on these

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.310 
lens and typically what happens on these
flashes<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.030> they<00:00:48.149> only<00:00:48.300> zoom<00:00:48.600> out<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.930> 28

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
flashes that they only zoom out to 28

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.979 
flashes that they only zoom out to 28
millimeters<00:00:49.980> with<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.879> chrome<00:00:51.300> dome<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.840> get

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
millimeters with the chrome dome you get

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
millimeters with the chrome dome you get
the<00:00:52.110> same<00:00:52.399> functionality<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.760> light<00:00:53.910> sphere

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the same functionality of a light sphere

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.850 
the same functionality of a light sphere
as<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.719> see<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> light<00:00:55.199> pen<00:00:55.410> goes<00:00:55.680> all

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
as you can see the light pen goes all

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.439 
as you can see the light pen goes all
the<00:00:55.890> way<00:00:55.980> around<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.340> room<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.300> light

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
the way around the room and then light

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.360 
the way around the room and then light
goes<00:00:57.629> through<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> top<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.190> also

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
goes through the top so that we can also

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.740 
goes through the top so that we can also
light<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> top<00:01:00.030> now<00:01:00.239> there's<00:01:00.449> not<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> lot

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
light the top now there's not a lot

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
light the top now there's not a lot
going<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> ceilings

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
going on here because of the ceilings

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.149 
going on here because of the ceilings
which<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.030> fine<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.379> still<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.949> some

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
which is fine but we still have some

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.530 
which is fine but we still have some
white<00:01:05.309> beams<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.790> things<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.420> give

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
white beams and things like that to give

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.899 
white beams and things like that to give
it<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:06.869> light<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.710> background<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.369> what

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
it more light in the background so what

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.250 
it more light in the background so what
I'm<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.540> I'm<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:10.020> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
I'm going to do is I'm going to do a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.039 
I'm going to do is I'm going to do a
shot<00:01:10.470> direct<00:01:11.189> flash<00:01:11.400> forward<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.420> show<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.659> on

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
shot direct flash forward to show you on

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.630 
shot direct flash forward to show you on
what<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:13.979> would<00:01:14.100> typically<00:01:14.369> look<00:01:14.460> like

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
what it would typically look like

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.300 
what it would typically look like
without<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.600> chrome<00:01:16.200> dome<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.560> then<00:01:17.040> I'll<00:01:17.189> do

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
without the chrome dome and then I'll do

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.679 
without the chrome dome and then I'll do
one<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> light<00:01:17.820> sphere<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> chrome

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
one with a light sphere and the chrome

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.520 
one with a light sphere and the chrome
dome<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.140> show<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> difference

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.420 

okay<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:24.590> here's<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.040> first<00:01:25.250> one

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
okay so here's the first one

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.999 
okay so here's the first one
perfect

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:44.359 

so<00:01:35.009> now<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:36.320> go<00:01:40.369> what<00:01:41.960> okay<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.070> what<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.189> see

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
so now we go what okay so what you see

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.630 
so now we go what okay so what you see
here<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:44.909> top<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.979> direct<00:01:46.979> flash<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
here on the top is the direct flash and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.700 
here on the top is the direct flash and
you'll<00:01:48.060> notice<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.539> it's<00:01:48.720> very<00:01:48.990> very<00:01:49.200> hot<00:01:49.500> in

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
you'll notice that it's very very hot in

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.419 
you'll notice that it's very very hot in
the<00:01:49.740> center<00:01:50.069> um<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.159> little

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
the center um and that it is a little

sphere with a chrome dome and actually

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.380 
sphere with a chrome dome and actually
you<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.319> in<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.590> mirror<00:02:07.920> up<00:02:08.910> here<00:02:09.269> and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
you can see in the mirror up here and

you can see in the mirror up here and
down<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.539> how<00:02:09.899> much<00:02:09.989> larger<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.530> light

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
down here how much larger the light

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.390 
down here how much larger the light
source<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.569> so<00:02:12.650> part<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.680> my<00:02:13.769> coughing<00:02:14.099> so<00:02:14.250> with

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
source is so part of my coughing so with

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.640 
source is so part of my coughing so with
this<00:02:14.519> larger<00:02:14.880> light<00:02:15.060> source<00:02:15.360> what<00:02:16.200> it's<00:02:16.349> doing

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
this larger light source what it's doing

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.620 
this larger light source what it's doing
is<00:02:16.769> it's<00:02:16.950> giving<00:02:17.250> me<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.579> more<00:02:17.880> round<00:02:18.269> of<00:02:18.569> a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
is it's giving me a more round of a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.839 
is it's giving me a more round of a
light<00:02:18.840> now<00:02:19.079> on<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.980> top<00:02:20.190> here<00:02:20.430> you'll<00:02:20.579> see

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
light now on the top here you'll see

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.900 
light now on the top here you'll see
that<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.599> lens<00:02:21.900> was<00:02:22.140> probably<00:02:22.620> about<00:02:23.069> that's

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
that this lens was probably about that's

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.100 
that this lens was probably about that's
pretty<00:02:24.120> wide<00:02:24.299> angle<00:02:24.630> judging<00:02:24.959> by<00:02:25.049> the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
pretty wide angle judging by the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.380 
pretty wide angle judging by the
distortion<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.709> think<00:02:25.890> was<00:02:26.040> equivalent<00:02:26.760> 24

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
distortion I think was equivalent 24

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.589 
distortion I think was equivalent 24
millimeters<00:02:27.959> down<00:02:28.590> here<00:02:29.160> same<00:02:29.610> thing<00:02:29.940> but<00:02:30.450> on

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
millimeters down here same thing but on

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.830 
millimeters down here same thing but on
the<00:02:30.840> Canon<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.739> current<00:02:32.040> 580<00:02:32.430> x2<00:02:33.299> which<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.660> use

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
the Canon the current 580 x2 which I use

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.410 
the Canon the current 580 x2 which I use
there<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:35.220> zoom<00:02:35.400> only<00:02:35.639> goes<00:02:35.790> out<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.060> 28

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
there the zoom only goes out to 28

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.509 
there the zoom only goes out to 28
millimeters<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.170> notice<00:02:37.859> the<00:02:38.010> people<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:38.400> the

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
millimeters so notice the people on the

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.400 
millimeters so notice the people on the
side<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.180> overall<00:02:39.480> illumination<00:02:40.260> and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
side and the overall illumination and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.530 
side and the overall illumination and
that's<00:02:40.590> what<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:40.859> get<00:02:41.010> with<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.489> lights<00:02:42.359> are

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
that's what you get with the lights are

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.390 
that's what you get with the lights are
collapsible<00:02:42.959> with<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.530> chrome<00:02:43.859> dome<00:02:44.130> which

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
collapsible with the chrome dome which

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.449 
collapsible with the chrome dome which
elevates<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.150> lights<00:02:45.530> above<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.799> flash<00:02:47.100> and

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
elevates the lights above the flash and

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.050 
elevates the lights above the flash and
then<00:02:48.049> spreads<00:02:49.049> it<00:02:49.200> out<00:02:49.319> across<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:50.010> room<00:02:50.190> so

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
then spreads it out across the room so

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.870 
then spreads it out across the room so
you<00:02:51.209> don't<00:02:51.450> get<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.900> sharp<00:02:52.430> bright<00:02:53.430> spot<00:02:53.730> in

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
you don't get that sharp bright spot in

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.250 
you don't get that sharp bright spot in
the<00:02:53.970> center

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.319
