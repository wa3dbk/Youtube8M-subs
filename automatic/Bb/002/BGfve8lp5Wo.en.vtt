that was interesting this was sent to me
by<00:00:33.950> somebody<00:00:34.370> down<00:00:34.550> in<00:00:34.790> Australia<00:00:35.450> and<00:00:35.900> you

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
know they have branches they call

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.370 
know they have branches they call
stations<00:00:38.300> there<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:38.840> they<00:00:38.960> have<00:00:39.080> a<00:00:39.110> lot<00:00:39.350> of

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
stations there and they have a lot of

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.260 
stations there and they have a lot of
these<00:00:39.530> water<00:00:39.860> tanks<00:00:40.280> on<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:40.610> station's

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
these water tanks on the station's

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.240 
these water tanks on the station's
somebody<00:00:42.230> had<00:00:42.350> decided<00:00:42.680> that<00:00:42.980> they<00:00:43.130> would

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
somebody had decided that they would

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.560 
somebody had decided that they would
just<00:00:43.460> use<00:00:43.610> some<00:00:43.640> of<00:00:43.880> those<00:00:43.970> tanks<00:00:44.390> because

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
just use some of those tanks because

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.000 
just use some of those tanks because
they<00:00:44.690> were<00:00:44.750> cheap<00:00:44.990> to<00:00:45.140> build<00:00:45.290> easy<00:00:45.650> to<00:00:45.860> build

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
they were cheap to build easy to build

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.070 
they were cheap to build easy to build
and<00:00:46.190> they<00:00:46.640> just<00:00:46.820> wrapped<00:00:47.150> coils<00:00:47.630> of<00:00:47.780> clear

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
and they just wrapped coils of clear

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.260 
and they just wrapped coils of clear
tubing<00:00:48.380> around<00:00:48.680> well<00:00:49.340> same<00:00:49.730> thing<00:00:49.910> as<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.090> bio

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
tubing around well same thing as the bio

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.810 
tubing around well same thing as the bio

acres<00:01:00.140> with<00:01:00.680> these<00:01:00.860> units<00:01:01.600> that's<00:01:02.600> quite<00:01:02.870> a

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
acres with these units that's quite a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.760 
acres with these units that's quite a
project<00:01:04.630> now<00:01:05.630> some<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.170> things<00:01:06.409> that<00:01:06.500> do

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
project now some of the things that do

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.010 
project now some of the things that do
work<00:01:07.040> are<00:01:07.460> like<00:01:07.939> these<00:01:08.150> tanks<00:01:08.570> this<00:01:08.659> isn't

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
work are like these tanks this isn't

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.440 
work are like these tanks this isn't
comforting<00:01:09.439> yes<00:01:09.649> why<00:01:10.549> can't<00:01:10.789> it<00:01:10.850> just<00:01:10.909> run

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.700 

curvature<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.960> size<00:01:15.170> they<00:01:15.470> were<00:01:15.560> only

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
curvature and the size they were only

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.340 
curvature and the size they were only
used<00:01:15.979> tubes<00:01:16.970> about<00:01:17.270> this<00:01:17.479> big<00:01:17.690> around<00:01:17.720> the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
used tubes about this big around the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.109 
used tubes about this big around the
curvature<00:01:18.770> they<00:01:18.950> had<00:01:19.100> one<00:01:19.280> more<00:01:19.430> call<00:01:19.610> doing

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
curvature they had one more call doing

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.609 
curvature they had one more call doing
that<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.510> getting<00:01:20.960> clean<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.320> well<00:01:21.470> they

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
that and getting clean and well they

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.469 
that and getting clean and well they
were<00:01:21.680> not<00:01:21.890> using<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.460> polycarbonate<00:01:23.180> tube

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
were not using a polycarbonate tube

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.300 
were not using a polycarbonate tube
because<00:01:24.140> they<00:01:24.259> needed<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.619> flexibility<00:01:25.280> to

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
because they needed the flexibility to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.399 
because they needed the flexibility to
wind<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.820> so<00:01:26.360> therefore<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.930> algae<00:01:27.259> was

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
wind it so therefore the algae was

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.930 
wind it so therefore the algae was
actually<00:01:27.799> going<00:01:28.009> into<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.430> pores<00:01:28.729> of<00:01:28.820> the

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
actually going into the pores of the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.660 
actually going into the pores of the
tube<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.930> it<00:01:30.380> just

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.220 

they<00:01:33.670> tried<00:01:33.910> a<00:01:33.940> couple<00:01:34.180> things<00:01:34.510> to<00:01:34.690> try<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:34.930> it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
they tried a couple things to try to it

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.360 
they tried a couple things to try to it
they<00:01:35.920> even<00:01:35.980> tried<00:01:36.310> Clorox<00:01:37.800> Paula<00:01:38.800> carbon<00:01:39.220> to

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
they even tried Clorox Paula carbon to

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.810 
they even tried Clorox Paula carbon to
the<00:01:39.400> could<00:01:39.790> use<00:01:40.000> glass<00:01:40.330> tubes<00:01:41.430> superb<00:01:42.430> it's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
the could use glass tubes superb it's

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.560 
the could use glass tubes superb it's
out<00:01:43.000> in<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:43.150> open<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.970> mean<00:01:45.970> I<00:01:46.060> don't<00:01:46.240> know<00:01:46.360> what

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
out in the open I mean I don't know what

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.350 
out in the open I mean I don't know what
else<00:01:46.720> they<00:01:46.900> try<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.500> just<00:01:47.800> got<00:01:48.010> this<00:01:48.360> consent

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
else they try I just got this consent

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.250 
else they try I just got this consent
but<00:01:50.320> that's<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:50.560> good<00:01:50.650> question<00:01:51.870> open<00:01:52.870> tanks

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
but that's a good question open tanks

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.380 
but that's a good question open tanks
this<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:53.650> in<00:01:53.800> California<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:55.210> can

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
this is in California and you can

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.820 
this is in California and you can
actually<00:01:55.540> see<00:01:55.750> where<00:01:56.080> they're<00:01:56.260> bubbling<00:01:56.470> this

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
actually see where they're bubbling this

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.640 
actually see where they're bubbling this
on<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:57.100> co2<00:01:57.370> through<00:01:57.850> this<00:01:58.260> this<00:01:59.260> is<00:01:59.470> really

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
on the co2 through this this is really

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.530 
on the co2 through this this is really
ready<00:02:00.040> for<00:02:00.280> harvesting<00:02:00.760> it's<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:01.030> pretty<00:02:01.240> thick

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
ready for harvesting it's a pretty thick

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.740 
ready for harvesting it's a pretty thick
coating<00:02:02.230> on<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.650> top<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.070> tank<00:02:03.480> and<00:02:04.480> you

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
coating on the top of the tank and you

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.360 
coating on the top of the tank and you
need<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:05.050> see<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.350> California<00:02:05.860> coastline<00:02:06.160> in

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
need to see the California coastline in

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.970 
need to see the California coastline in
the<00:02:06.460> background<00:02:06.960> hibbett<00:02:07.960> bonds<00:02:08.230> pivot<00:02:08.740> ponce

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:08.980 
the background hibbett bonds pivot ponce

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.530 
the background hibbett bonds pivot ponce
was<00:02:09.190> one<00:02:09.520> of<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.700> first<00:02:09.940> ways<00:02:10.149> that<00:02:10.420> people

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
was one of the first ways that people

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.020 
was one of the first ways that people
were<00:02:10.780> growing<00:02:11.140> algae<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.710> if<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.760> looks

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
were growing algae and if this looks

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.590 
were growing algae and if this looks
suspiciously<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:13.870> waste<00:02:14.500> treatment<00:02:14.740> plants

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
suspiciously like waste treatment plants

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.030 
suspiciously like waste treatment plants
the<00:02:16.600> guys<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.840> developed<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.590> stuff<00:02:17.830> came

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
the guys that developed this stuff came

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.130 
the guys that developed this stuff came
out<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.400> waste<00:02:18.580> treatment<00:02:18.760> plant

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
out of the waste treatment plant

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.790 
out of the waste treatment plant
industry<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.950> yeah<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.460> was<00:02:21.840> then<00:02:22.840> you've<00:02:23.590> got

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
industry so yeah it was then you've got

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.190 
industry so yeah it was then you've got
open<00:02:24.190> ponds<00:02:24.460> now<00:02:24.940> these<00:02:25.270> are<00:02:25.690> also<00:02:25.870> in

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
open ponds now these are also in

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.230 
open ponds now these are also in
California<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:26.980> their<00:02:27.130> down<00:02:27.310> with<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:27.610> think

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
California of their down with I think

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.600 
California of their down with I think
area<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:28.750> California<00:02:29.380> but<00:02:29.980> what<00:02:30.130> they<00:02:30.280> do<00:02:30.340> with

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
area of California but what they do with

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.220 
area of California but what they do with
this<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:31.030> they<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:31.360> leave<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.660> sit<00:02:31.870> out<00:02:31.900> there

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
this is they just leave it sit out there

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.930 
this is they just leave it sit out there
and<00:02:32.350> grow<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:33.100> is<00:02:33.250> one<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.550> red<00:02:33.730> algae

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
and grow this is one of the red algae

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.910 
and grow this is one of the red algae
that's<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:34.930> red<00:02:35.170> color<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.590> pictures

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
that's that is a red color the pictures

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.250 
that's that is a red color the pictures
now<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.520> what<00:02:37.240> they<00:02:37.390> would<00:02:37.540> do<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:37.810> after<00:02:37.990> they

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
now and what they would do is after they

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.680 
now and what they would do is after they
get<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.530> pretty<00:02:38.830> good<00:02:38.920> bloom<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.850> top<00:02:40.060> then

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
get a pretty good bloom on the top then

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.120 
get a pretty good bloom on the top then
what<00:02:40.930> they<00:02:41.080> did<00:02:41.260> was<00:02:41.410> they<00:02:41.470> just<00:02:41.590> moved<00:02:41.980> it

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
what they did was they just moved it

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.370 
what they did was they just moved it
into<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:44.700> right<00:02:45.700> I'm<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:46.030> here<00:02:46.360> are<00:02:46.900> small

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
into the right I'm in here are small

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.160 
into the right I'm in here are small
pond<00:02:48.100> areas<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.670> are<00:02:48.790> close<00:02:49.000> in<00:02:49.030> they<00:02:49.960> would

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
pond areas that are close in they would

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.130 
pond areas that are close in they would
move<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.590> algae<00:02:51.300> blatant<00:02:52.300> water<00:02:52.570> into<00:02:52.960> that

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
move the algae blatant water into that

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.660 
move the algae blatant water into that
and<00:02:53.380> then<00:02:53.500> they<00:02:53.560> will<00:02:53.680> let<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:53.890> evaporate<00:02:54.190> and

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
and then they will let it evaporate and

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.530 
and then they will let it evaporate and
everyone<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.390> spray<00:02:55.600> go<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.980> again

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
everyone and spray go but again

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.110 
everyone and spray go but again
labor-intensive<00:02:58.540> badger<00:02:59.230> process<00:02:59.920> slow<00:03:00.700> and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
labor-intensive badger process slow and

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.480 
labor-intensive badger process slow and
the<00:03:01.600> productivity<00:03:02.230> per<00:03:02.410> acre<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.890> not<00:03:03.220> there

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
the productivity per acre is not there

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.540 
the productivity per acre is not there
not<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.210> commercially<00:03:04.720> viable<00:03:04.750> thing<00:03:05.400> next<00:03:06.400> we

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
not a commercially viable thing next we

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.700 
not a commercially viable thing next we
go<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.730> things<00:03:07.510> like<00:03:07.690> when<00:03:07.900> people<00:03:08.200> always<00:03:08.560> add

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
go to things like when people always add

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.770 
go to things like when people always add
why<00:03:09.010> can't<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.370> use<00:03:09.400> artificial<00:03:09.910> light<00:03:10.270> you

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
why can't you use artificial light you

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.100 
why can't you use artificial light you
can<00:03:11.370> this<00:03:12.370> picture<00:03:12.850> is<00:03:12.880> of<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.390> laboratory<00:03:13.630> in

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
can this picture is of a laboratory in

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.170 
can this picture is of a laboratory in
Czechoslovakia<00:03:15.040> where<00:03:15.340> they're<00:03:15.700> using

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
Czechoslovakia where they're using

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.050 
Czechoslovakia where they're using
pulsating<00:03:16.840> light<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.160> not<00:03:18.370> outside<00:03:18.670> at

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
pulsating light and it is not outside at

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.510 
pulsating light and it is not outside at
all<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.780> does<00:03:20.110> it<00:03:20.140> grow<00:03:20.500> yeah<00:03:20.860> they're<00:03:21.250> pretty

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
all and does it grow yeah they're pretty

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.970 
all and does it grow yeah they're pretty
good<00:03:21.760> results<00:03:21.880> with<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.930> only<00:03:23.140> problem<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.710> is

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
good results with the only problem is is

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.440 
good results with the only problem is is
that<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.280> can't<00:03:24.550> you<00:03:24.820> couldn't<00:03:25.150> pin<00:03:25.330> them

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
that you can't you couldn't pin them

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.140 
that you can't you couldn't pin them
down<00:03:25.570> at<00:03:25.780> this<00:03:25.960> point<00:03:26.250> on<00:03:27.250> what<00:03:27.790> was<00:03:27.970> the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
down at this point on what was the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.530 
down at this point on what was the
actual<00:03:28.330> cost<00:03:28.930> per<00:03:29.590> gallon<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.250> produce<00:03:30.460> so<00:03:31.360> is

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
actual cost per gallon to produce so is

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.510 
actual cost per gallon to produce so is
it<00:03:31.570> commercially<00:03:32.140> viable<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:32.710> get<00:03:33.160> back<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.490> my

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
it commercially viable I get back to my

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.550 
it commercially viable I get back to my
statement<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.120> made<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.630> can<00:03:34.990> you<00:03:35.110> grow<00:03:35.350> out

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
statement I made to you can you grow out

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.780 
statement I made to you can you grow out
you<00:03:35.770> in<00:03:35.860> any<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.220> ways<00:03:36.370> you've<00:03:36.580> heard

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
you in any of the ways you've heard

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.600 
you in any of the ways you've heard
about<00:03:36.910> yeah<00:03:37.390> is<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:38.200> commercially<00:03:38.830> viable<00:03:38.860> and

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
about yeah is a commercially viable and

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.780 
about yeah is a commercially viable and
I<00:03:39.760> will<00:03:39.970> see<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.180> picture<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.720> numbers<00:03:41.050> on

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
I will see a picture of the numbers on

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.520 
I will see a picture of the numbers on
then<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.970> open<00:03:43.240> rates<00:03:43.450> way<00:03:43.630> pawns<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:44.350> is<00:03:44.470> a

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
then the open rates way pawns this is a

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.980 
then the open rates way pawns this is a
concept<00:03:44.920> drawing<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.460> the

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
concept drawing of the

but the equivalent have bracelet on in
the<00:04:22.830> air<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.220> they've<00:04:23.370> covered<00:04:23.610> over<00:04:24.060> so<00:04:24.180> it's

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
the air and they've covered over so it's

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.560 
the air and they've covered over so it's
closed<00:04:24.600> is<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.830> fact<00:04:26.040> that<00:04:26.190> my<00:04:26.880> systems<00:04:27.420> are

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
closed is the fact that my systems are

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.120 
closed is the fact that my systems are
small<00:04:27.900> out<00:04:28.080> there<00:04:28.380> two<00:04:28.530> foot<00:04:28.740> by<00:04:28.770> two<00:04:28.980> foot
