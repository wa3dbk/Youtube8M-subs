00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 when you say protein to someone who 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.770
 does bodybuilding the first thing 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.700
 that comes to mind is the word 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.900
 protein muscles equals muscles when you 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.679
 say the word protein to someone who 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.210
 is not in the middle 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.700
 the first thing that make him to 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.230
 the spirit is the word protein products 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.300
 case the product dangerous to health 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.350
 in this video I will try to you 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.449
 express as simply as possible 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.250
 since these are the proteins the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.900
 different types that exists what is the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.269
 role of an organism and quantity 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.949
 budget needed hoping that it 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.390
 will help you better understand where 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.390
 maybe finally something new 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.970
 the protein is probably the 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.010
 most important macronutrients for 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.900
 the body and that's not because you 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.670
 need to designed mu but 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.960
 simply because proteins are 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.600
 restricted from a lot of things in the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.430
 body like for example the digestion of the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.900
 oxygen transport the transport of 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.480
 molecules in december the banks 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.590
 work from to the immune system 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.420
 so if you do not eat enough of 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.009
 proteins not only you do not have 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.470
 builds muscle but you risk 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.190
 to have small health problems 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.680
 now when you eat 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.030
 proteins that are big molecules 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.680
 your body take these proteins and the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.330
 cut into small pieces to have 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.880
 small molecules and these molecules 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.800
 is called amino acids 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.759
 there are two types of finishing the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.360
 so-called essential systems 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.190
 it is intended nonessential bessac 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.500
 you have in supplement form for 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.660
 part of these mines is essential that the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.190
 difference between the two acids 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.420
 essential amines on amino sites 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.680
 which must be brought by 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.060
 supply 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.670
 because your body is not able to 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.560
 make unlike the last no 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.720
 essential that the body is said to be very 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.220
 easily what you need to know here 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.690
 is that when we still need these 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.430
 the latter is essential and that 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.210
 not because you did not wear them 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.150
 your diet 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.590
 even if he misses an amino acid so much 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.400
 we'll go get them where he 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.049
 can find it 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.020
 that is where there is a lot of 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.030
 proteins to degrade in museums and 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.159
 for someone who has designed muscle 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.720
 it's not the top and unfortunately 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.970
 the corner is not able to store 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.259
 the amino acid as a reserve in 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.729
 hard case 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.980
 it is therefore important to provide a stand 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.760
 is regular but be careful this does not 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.200
 does not mean that it is absolutely necessary 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.880
 eat products and both 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.450
 hours because otherwise your body will degrade 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.280
 your muscles 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.739
 no the short it is much more 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.769
 smart that that there are two types 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.570
 of proteins the complete proteins and 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.060
 incomplete 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.110
 what is the difference between both 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.570
 imagine that a protein is your keyboard 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.820
 of computer on this keyboard you have 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.950
 several keys and some buttons this 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.600
 are amino acids when all 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.579
 keys and buttons you have a keyboard that 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.640
 is working properly a protein 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.049
 complete ci asked t touch this 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.950
 amine know that you have a protein 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.459
 incomplete 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.570
 it works but you can not do everything 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.489
 how to know if the protein that you 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.070
 consumed and complete or incomplete 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.750
 it's very simple when the protein 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.860
 come from an animal source 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.100
 the protein what hold all the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.000
 amino acids is so complete that at the 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.720
 protein come from a source 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.350
 vegetable 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.940
 so it's incomplete unless it's 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.010
 soy is the only vegetable protein 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.030
 complete 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.950
 careful if you not eat product 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.390
 animal and soy does not mean 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.959
 that you consume proteins forever 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.540
 complete 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.080
 no if you eat several proteins 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.940
 vegetable 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.220
 each complete protein not to 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.510
 practice that this friend is different and 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.740
 in the end I'll find you with a 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.880
 complete protein 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.200
 that's why it's important 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.040
 to have multiple sources of protein 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.480
 in the plate 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.480
 especially if you do not eat meat 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.530
 how many grams of protein do you have 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.270
 need 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.590
 daily know that it's very 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.060
 rare for an individual who eat more 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.670
 or less balanced I did not eat 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.319
 enough protein for the individual who 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.730
 practice a physical activity 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.260
 the goal was designed and a little bit of 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.290
 muscle they need to me I came 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.550
 1.2 to twice his body weight except 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.800
 if he is overweight or obese 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.600
 on the other hand if you have an obese support 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.220
 it's the same as an ass but she's 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.090
 take your current weight you have to take 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.790
 your ideal point 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.560
 for example a but 80 I'm 100 kg 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.260
 my goal is to help cents to 81 kg 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.870
 I do the same calculation with the weight 80 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.280
 kg attention me I can protein 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.350
 does not mean to build more than 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.570
 music if today you eat that 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.010
 five years farm protein and you pass 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.049
 at 120 g of protein 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.510
 probably yes are you that surprised 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.980
 mu but by cons if you already saw 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.310
 enough protein ie after 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.740
 1.2 to 8.2 to 2 grams per kilogram and you 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.940
 passes at three times his body weight 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.010
 you 're not good on more muscles 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.900
 biological values ​​of proteins 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.600
 in the foods here is the list 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.120
 as you see the best with a 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.620
 score of 100 students and those who are 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.370
 placed at the top of the list are 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.260
 protein on the animal that means a 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.370
 protein with high biological value and 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.320
 a rhyme ah small values 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.760
 biological 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.410
 when a protein coach was born this friend 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.660
 is essential in similar proportion 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.680
 to that of the needs of the body we say that 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.840
 it is a high value protein 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.580
 biological because one or more young 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.090
 dismissed are present but weak 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.220
 quantities 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.410
 the protein is considered nothing a 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.370
 small biological value 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.590
 but beware that does not mean that 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.620
 it's a good or bad protein the 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.830
 cross a score of 100 whey isola 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:16.060
 a score of 59 the tree is concentrated at 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:18.640
 a score of 5-4 the breakage and 117 and the 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.410
 soybean so 14 so the first ones with a 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.270
 high biological value are going to be better 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.700
 absorb and your beauty every 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.600
 italians whose body needs 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.550
 attention that does not mean that the wii 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.200
 is better than the viol or you go 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.910
 concert more shows with life than 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.440
 the meat no it just wants 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.090
 to say that where she is going to be better 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.130
 absorbed use more easily 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.180
 it's really wii you never need 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.710
 trust who writes on 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.610
 packing 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.580
 some points that are important to 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.099
 keep in mind the protein do not consult 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.289
 no muscles she does not create and 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.550
 rebuilds museums and it's not 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.840
 at all the same 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.030
 because otherwise I can sit down very well 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.130
 in front of orgy me I have protein and 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.440
 build we know very well that it 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.240
 will not be able to say that your body does not 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.220
 can 10 June that 30 g of protein by 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.140
 meal and that everything else is going to be thrown 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.350
 with the garbage is totally stupid 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.700
 it is necessary to regularly provide 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.350
 protein for the body and a good 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.990
 idea especially for someone who practices 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.390
 bodybuilding but the quantity is more 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.650
 important as the frequency for example 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.540
 it will be much better for the person 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.760
 to eat it's a gram of protein the 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.590
 morning and then 500 g protein in the evening 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.380
 that two months I said g of protein 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.580
 six times in the day 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.290
 you do not need to consume 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.610
 wave right after your science under 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.350
 pretext that you need to continue to 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.370
 quick assignment you think I 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.440
 have you learned your science you will have 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.970
 have found ten minutes you get 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.950
 this theme in the blood 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.630
 no it does not work like that when you 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.190
 wood from where is the biggest part of 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.920
 the latter will be president of that after 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.560
 d 1h30 it starts after one hour 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.200
 and the pit this terminal will be after 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.480
 1h30 so if you physiological 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.340
 you have to fight before science to 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.620
 that the allies will be present at the window 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.020

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.040

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.960

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.030

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.380

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.050
 grams of protein a day without 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.340
 problem unless you 're already a problem 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.940
 to the kidneys and in these cases it must be done 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.230

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.540
