00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.750
 so I want to demonstrate the pump 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.320
 which has redone and is already working more 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.340
 input and how to say works reliably 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.210
 qualitatively and 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.210
 and so on so I want to demonstrate 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.850
 so the shaft from which you need to remove one 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.340
 millimeter 12 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.550
 but 1 and 2 is the best option to 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.700
 here it could come in 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:37.710
 and here it is also like this for us 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:40.379
 need to do this short sleeve 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.629
 it must be redone which is worth it 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.180
 here here we remove 2 millimeters 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.420
 because this is gum thickness 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.969
 she won't let us in there 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.829
 so we do it like this 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:02.250
 vtulochka from here such a tube 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:06.060
 we cut it off with a lathe 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.840
 remove just enough to get this 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.630
 entered in here like this so size is not 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:19.310
 I know I can not say well, that's how it is 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:22.670
 It looks so well that we put it in 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.670
 like this 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.670
 so here we have collected so here it will be at 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:41.140
 stand here like this and like this 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:46.270
 and works this way this part is worth 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.290
 it more often works like this repair kit with 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.430
 pump 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:55.210
 bc ordinary irrigation and he works there 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.610
 quite long but now i will put 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:03.700
 bearings on the shaft and assemble and show how 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:06.210
 it all works on the computer so well sho here 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.580
 we all put together better we did 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:14.680
 put the sleeve in all put the bearings 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.050
 collected everything is so small nuance 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.410
 it is necessary to measure this part of the stalker 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.959
 right here to measure it all 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.090
 it worked so that it was not clamped 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.920
 just played so on spring shock when 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.100
 she will become 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.550
 here is his job that's how it should be 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.739
 work so on the impeller that's all 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.700
 she snapped everyone here is not necessary, and therefore 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.920
 that it will all work nothing 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.239
 will miss anything so much 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:03:00.160
 we put everything in its place 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:03:03.670
 set the impeller so everything became 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:09.820
 in its place check here all works 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:12.910
 everything is fine so here's a prince 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.610
 best hole is for a small circle 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.010
 when is the thermostat just when 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.850
 we remove the thermostat a certain part 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.710
 water in a small circle returns and how 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:29.210
 wouldn't go to the radiator 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:32.630
 We are going to win 2 clamps and a piece 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:35.240
 hoses and just like taking off and 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:40.700
 installation becomes much easier and 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.800
 soon as it makes sense to anyone not 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.750
 there is a thermostat from it generally take it 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.770
 here and on the head 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:52.520
 where it is necessary to close it also on 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.670
 itâ€™s not like everything inside 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.510
 so I suppose I see everything there was very 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:03.980
 good and great 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:06.260
 I will try to make the process on the dough 50 of 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.020
 sky pump on sm daring engines and 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.740
 then also throw youtube if 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.230
 I will be interested in someone in the comments 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.390
 leave a phone number want to allow 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.390
 and tell all thanks
