00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
resurfaced laser which is the newest of

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.460 
resurfaced laser which is the newest of
its<00:00:13.080> kind<00:00:13.349> it's<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.040> 15<00:00:14.460> 65<00:00:15.030> nanometer<00:00:15.690> erbium

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
its kind it's a 15 65 nanometer erbium

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.250 
its kind it's a 15 65 nanometer erbium
doped<00:00:16.699> laser<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:18.180> essentially<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.810> approved

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
doped laser that essentially is approved

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.410

for the treatment of fine lines and

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.810 
for the treatment of fine lines and
wrinkles<00:00:21.660> because<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:22.830> age<00:00:23.130> we're<00:00:23.519> noticing

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
wrinkles because with age we're noticing

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.519 
wrinkles because with age we're noticing
about<00:00:24.060> six<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.570> ten<00:00:24.600> percent<00:00:24.900> decrease<00:00:25.500> in

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
about six to ten percent decrease in

the mountain living in Southern

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.369 
the mountain living in Southern
California<00:00:41.120> you<00:00:42.120> start<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.960> signs<00:00:43.200> of

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
California you start to see the signs of

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.560 
California you start to see the signs of
aging<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.250> we've<00:00:44.460> done<00:00:44.670> IVF<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.300> her<00:00:45.450> in

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
aging and so we've done IVF on her in

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.690 
aging and so we've done IVF on her in
the<00:00:45.660> past<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.530> unfortunately<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> lot<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the past but unfortunately a lot of the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.670 
the past but unfortunately a lot of the
brown<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.149> red<00:00:48.300> come<00:00:48.600> back<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:49.469> you're<00:00:49.649> not

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
brown the red come back if you're not

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.410 
brown the red come back if you're not
consistent<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.760> especially<00:00:50.940> because

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
consistent with it especially because

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
consistent with it especially because
you're<00:00:51.660> getting<00:00:51.750> about<00:00:52.020> 50%<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.710> your<00:00:52.800> UVA<00:00:53.129> in

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you're getting about 50% of your UVA in

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.850 
you're getting about 50% of your UVA in
the<00:00:53.460> shade<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:54.750> our<00:00:54.899> patient<00:00:55.410> she

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the shade and so with our patient she

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.500 
the shade and so with our patient she
wants<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.250> improve<00:00:56.610> more<00:00:57.120> than<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
wants to improve more than just the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.790 
wants to improve more than just the
brown<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> red<00:00:58.109> she<00:00:58.289> wants<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> also

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
brown in the red she wants to also

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.619 
brown in the red she wants to also
improve<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.309> texture<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.879> tone<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.180> her<00:01:00.270> skin

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
improve the texture and tone of her skin

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.479 
improve the texture and tone of her skin
and<00:01:01.109> she<00:01:01.260> wants<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> start<00:01:01.800> addressing<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and she wants to start addressing a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.100 
and she wants to start addressing a
little<00:01:02.760> bit<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.090> crepeiness<00:01:03.690> under<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
little bit of that crepeiness under the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.380 
little bit of that crepeiness under the
eye<00:01:04.140> without<00:01:05.070> necessarily<00:01:05.549> doing<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.030> downtime

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
eye without necessarily doing a downtime

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.359 
eye without necessarily doing a downtime
procedure<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> fractionated<00:01:07.650> co2<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
procedure like the fractionated co2 and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.340 
procedure like the fractionated co2 and
so<00:01:08.909> with<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.210> technology<00:01:09.600> were<00:01:09.990> able<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
so with this technology were able to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.380 
so with this technology were able to
offer<00:01:10.560> her<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:10.950> was<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.820> basically<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
offer her that was just basically a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.910 
offer her that was just basically a
two-day<00:01:12.960> downtime<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> sense<00:01:13.860> that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
two-day downtime in the sense that

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
two-day downtime in the sense that
you're<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.340> little<00:01:14.549> red<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.760> swollen<00:01:15.090> but

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
you're just a little red and swollen but

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.450 
you're just a little red and swollen but
really<00:01:16.080> no<00:01:16.229> downtime<00:01:16.500> she'll<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.100> resume

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
really no downtime she'll just resume

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.890 
really no downtime she'll just resume
going<00:01:17.670> back<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.000> work<00:01:18.150> immediately<00:01:18.390> after

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
going back to work immediately after

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.469 
going back to work immediately after
this<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.430> doing<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> treatment

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
this so here we are doing the treatment

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.330 
this so here we are doing the treatment
you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:21.900> how<00:01:22.049> quick<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.320> easy<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.770> is

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
you can see how quick and easy it is

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.530 
you can see how quick and easy it is
essentially<00:01:24.340> it's<00:01:24.460> gonna<00:01:24.580> take<00:01:24.820> me<00:01:24.970> about<00:01:25.000> 15

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
essentially it's gonna take me about 15

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.690 
essentially it's gonna take me about 15
minutes<00:01:25.570> to<00:01:25.900> do<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.050> roll<00:01:26.320> face<00:01:26.590> you<00:01:27.190> can<00:01:27.430> see

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
minutes to do a roll face you can see

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.230 
minutes to do a roll face you can see
the<00:01:27.850> area<00:01:28.150> it's<00:01:28.440> mildly<00:01:29.440> pink<00:01:29.860> mildly<00:01:30.670> swollen

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
the area it's mildly pink mildly swollen

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.540 
the area it's mildly pink mildly swollen
but<00:01:31.720> really<00:01:32.140> no<00:01:32.320> downtime<00:01:32.590> no<00:01:32.890> bleeding<00:01:33.400> no

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
but really no downtime no bleeding no

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.430 
but really no downtime no bleeding no
holes<00:01:33.970> so<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.570> concludes<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.080> treatment

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
holes so that concludes the treatment

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.630 
holes so that concludes the treatment
with<00:01:35.620> the<00:01:35.650> luminous

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
