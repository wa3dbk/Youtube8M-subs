00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
iPad into better video cameras in a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.779 
iPad into better video cameras in a
moment<00:00:19.289> I'll<00:00:19.470> take<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> look<00:00:19.980> at<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> road<00:00:20.369> grip

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
moment I'll take a look at the road grip

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.090 
moment I'll take a look at the road grip
and<00:00:21.029> grip<00:00:21.359> plus<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:22.289> first<00:00:22.590> let's<00:00:22.859> look<00:00:22.980> at

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
and grip plus but first let's look at

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.519 
and grip plus but first let's look at
this<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.580> podcaster<00:00:24.510> from<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> podcaster

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
this the podcaster from the podcaster

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.189 
this the podcaster from the podcaster
company<00:00:25.980> now<00:00:26.939> as<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.180> can<00:00:27.330> see<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.810> metal

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
company now as you can see it's a metal

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.560 
company now as you can see it's a metal
frame<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> flat<00:00:29.130> plastic<00:00:29.789> insert<00:00:30.240> which

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
frame with a flat plastic insert which

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.720 
frame with a flat plastic insert which
has<00:00:30.779> four<00:00:31.140> raised<00:00:31.560> lips<00:00:31.920> around<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.399> edges

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
has four raised lips around the edges

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.700 
has four raised lips around the edges
and<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> metal<00:00:33.870> edges<00:00:34.170> there<00:00:34.440> are<00:00:34.530> loads

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
and on the metal edges there are loads

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.580 
and on the metal edges there are loads
of<00:00:34.920> screw<00:00:35.340> threads<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.630> what's<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.260> point<00:00:37.410> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
of screw threads so what's the point of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.459 
of screw threads so what's the point of
this<00:00:37.770> well<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.879> take<00:00:39.059> an<00:00:39.210> iPad<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.930> push<00:00:40.320> it

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
this well you take an iPad and push it

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.740 
this well you take an iPad and push it
firmly<00:00:40.829> into<00:00:41.280> place<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> middle<00:00:42.180> making

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
firmly into place in the middle making

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.900 
firmly into place in the middle making
sure<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> iPads<00:00:43.739> video<00:00:44.160> camera<00:00:44.700> can

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
sure that the iPads video camera can

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.729 
sure that the iPads video camera can
peak<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> hole<00:00:45.899> that's<00:00:46.200> been<00:00:46.260> left<00:00:46.559> in

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
peak out of the hole that's been left in

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.420 
peak out of the hole that's been left in
the<00:00:46.829> plastic<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.840> have<00:00:49.200> an<00:00:49.410> iPad<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the plastic so now you have an iPad in a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.819 
the plastic so now you have an iPad in a
frame<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.090> these<00:00:51.539> holes<00:00:51.899> suddenly<00:00:52.530> become

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
frame and these holes suddenly become

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.130 
frame and these holes suddenly become
useful<00:00:53.100> because<00:00:53.910> they're<00:00:54.090> all<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.600> standard

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
useful because they're all in a standard

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.610 
useful because they're all in a standard
video<00:00:55.410> centric<00:00:56.010> size<00:00:56.430> 3/8<00:00:57.360> 16<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.469> quarter

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
video centric size 3/8 16 and a quarter

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.360 
video centric size 3/8 16 and a quarter
20<00:00:59.359> the<00:01:00.359> sizes<00:01:00.870> aren't<00:01:01.140> Universal<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.039> video

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
20 the sizes aren't Universal in video

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.210 
20 the sizes aren't Universal in video
accessories<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> idea<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.439> by<00:01:04.739> having<00:01:05.129> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
accessories so the idea is by having a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.460 
accessories so the idea is by having a
frame<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:05.760> those<00:01:05.970> sides<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.510> holes<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.320> can

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
frame with those sides of holes you can

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.410 
frame with those sides of holes you can
now<00:01:07.680> attach<00:01:07.830> video<00:01:08.460> accessories<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> your

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
now attach video accessories to your

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.870 
now attach video accessories to your
iPad<00:01:09.869> such<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.619> an<00:01:10.740> LED<00:01:11.220> light<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
iPad such as an LED light or a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
iPad such as an LED light or a
microphone<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.720> therefore<00:01:13.439> make<00:01:13.650> better

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
microphone and therefore make better

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.999 
microphone and therefore make better
quality<00:01:14.460> videos<00:01:14.990> you<00:01:15.990> may<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.320> wondering<00:01:16.830> why

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
quality videos you may be wondering why

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.249 
quality videos you may be wondering why
anyone<00:01:17.400> would<00:01:17.670> go<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> effort<00:01:18.659> instead<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
anyone would go to the effort instead of

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.109 
anyone would go to the effort instead of
actually<00:01:19.590> buying<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.009> proper<00:01:20.369> video<00:01:20.520> camera

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
actually buying a proper video camera

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.630 
actually buying a proper video camera
and<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.750> would<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> good<00:01:22.409> point<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:23.310> lots

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and you would have a good point but lots

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.670 
and you would have a good point but lots
of<00:01:23.820> people<00:01:23.880> such<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.600> journalists<00:01:25.380> carry

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
of people such as journalists carry

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.950 
of people such as journalists carry
iPads<00:01:26.250> by<00:01:26.490> default<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.360> are<00:01:27.450> often<00:01:27.720> asked

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
iPads by default and are often asked

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
iPads by default and are often asked
these<00:01:28.140> days<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.680> shoot<00:01:28.950> some<00:01:29.250> video<00:01:29.549> when

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
these days to shoot some video when

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.149 
these days to shoot some video when
they're<00:01:30.030> at<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> story<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.439> makes<00:01:31.619> sense<00:01:31.770> for

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
they're at a story so it makes sense for

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.280 
they're at a story so it makes sense for
them<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> use<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> iPad<00:01:33.210> rather<00:01:33.750> than<00:01:33.930> carry

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
them to use the iPad rather than carry

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.039

the tablet and the camcorder or DSLR and
it<00:01:37.770> makes<00:01:37.979> sense<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.549> able<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.909> add<00:01:39.060> some

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it makes sense to be able to add some

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.929 
it makes sense to be able to add some
accessories<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:40.290> put<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> iPad<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.460> stand

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
accept a standard tripod plate so you

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.469 
accept a standard tripod plate so you
can<00:01:46.920> put<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.490> film<00:01:47.820> yourself<00:01:48.210> or<00:01:48.450> just

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
that the video accessories you're most

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.039 
that the video accessories you're most
likely<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.250> add<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.939> lights<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.540> shotgun

one aspect of the podcaster we do like

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.420 
one aspect of the podcaster we do like
is<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.630> lens<00:02:32.960> caster<00:02:33.590> it's<00:02:33.800> an<00:02:33.950> optional

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
is this the lens caster it's an optional

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.850 
is this the lens caster it's an optional
extra<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:35.630> can<00:02:35.780> see<00:02:35.990> it's<00:02:36.170> another<00:02:36.290> metal

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
extra you can see it's another metal

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.890 
extra you can see it's another metal
frame<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:37.430> screws<00:02:37.850> over<00:02:38.210> the<00:02:38.300> corner<00:02:38.690> here

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
frame that screws over the corner here

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.380 
frame that screws over the corner here
and<00:02:39.020> then<00:02:39.500> provides<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.070> 72<00:02:40.850> millimeter

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
and then provides a 72 millimeter

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.390 
and then provides a 72 millimeter
threaded<00:02:41.930> hole<00:02:42.110> over<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.500> aperture<00:02:43.010> where

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
threaded hole over the aperture where

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.880 
threaded hole over the aperture where
the<00:02:43.520> ipad's<00:02:43.970> lens<00:02:44.300> peeps<00:02:44.690> through<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.710> means

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
the ipad's lens peeps through that means

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.550 
the ipad's lens peeps through that means
you<00:02:46.070> can<00:02:46.280> screw<00:02:46.610> in<00:02:46.790> filters<00:02:47.360> lens<00:02:47.930> adapters

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
you can screw in filters lens adapters

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.210 
you can screw in filters lens adapters
and<00:02:48.709> so<00:02:48.950> on

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
and so on

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.250 
and so on
to<00:02:49.310> change<00:02:49.550> your<00:02:49.790> shot<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.810> gives<00:02:51.110> you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
to change your shot and that gives you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.590 
to change your shot and that gives you
more<00:02:51.620> flexibility<00:02:52.400> than<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.820> standard<00:02:53.360> lens

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
more flexibility than the standard lens

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.400 
more flexibility than the standard lens
on<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.930> iPad<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.209> podcaster<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.050> a<00:02:57.080> nice

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
on the iPad so the podcaster is a nice

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.650 
on the iPad so the podcaster is a nice
idea<00:02:57.920> jacking<00:02:58.520> up<00:02:58.610> your<00:02:58.790> iPad<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.390> make<00:02:59.540> it

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
idea jacking up your iPad to make it

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.960 
idea jacking up your iPad to make it
more<00:02:59.840> video<00:03:00.140> friendly<00:03:00.709> but<00:03:01.280> I'm<00:03:01.370> not<00:03:01.490> entirely

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
more video friendly but I'm not entirely

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.820 
more video friendly but I'm not entirely
sure<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.540> delivers<00:03:02.930> as<00:03:03.050> much<00:03:03.260> as<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.590> could

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
sure it delivers as much as it could

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.400 
sure it delivers as much as it could
having<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.850> tripod<00:03:05.300> mount<00:03:05.600> is<00:03:05.750> great<00:03:06.170> and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
having a tripod mount is great and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.500 
having a tripod mount is great and
having<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:06.950> cold<00:03:07.220> shoe<00:03:07.459> adapter<00:03:07.490> on<00:03:08.090> top<00:03:08.360> is

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
having the cold shoe adapter on top is

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.720 
having the cold shoe adapter on top is
useful<00:03:08.990> but<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.650> needs<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:09.950> come<00:03:10.010> with<00:03:10.310> more<00:03:10.550> of

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
useful but it needs to come with more of

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.520 
useful but it needs to come with more of
those<00:03:10.880> by<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.720> time<00:03:12.080> you've<00:03:12.260> popped

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
those by the time you've popped

those by the time you've popped
accessories<00:03:13.280> on<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.640> wonder<00:03:14.300> whether<00:03:14.450> you

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
accessories on I wonder whether you

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.449 
accessories on I wonder whether you
might<00:03:14.780> as<00:03:14.990> well<00:03:15.020> have<00:03:15.350> bought<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.800> proper<00:03:16.250> video

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
might as well have bought a proper video

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.979 
might as well have bought a proper video
kit<00:03:17.709> so<00:03:18.709> that's<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.430> podcaster<00:03:20.269> now<00:03:20.720> let's

the grip and there is a fisheye lens as
well

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
well

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.589 
well
now<00:05:50.530> do<00:05:50.950> watch<00:05:51.160> out<00:05:51.430> these<00:05:51.820> lenses<00:05:52.360> are<00:05:52.570> very

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
now do watch out these lenses are very

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:56.070 
now do watch out these lenses are very
very<00:05:53.289> small<00:05:53.680> and<00:05:53.950> very<00:05:53.979> very<00:05:54.760> easy<00:05:55.030> to<00:05:55.300> drop<00:05:55.720> on

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
very small and very very easy to drop on

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.080 
very small and very very easy to drop on
you're<00:05:56.289> screwing<00:05:56.710> them<00:05:56.830> in<00:05:56.979> not<00:05:57.610> only<00:05:57.639> does

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
you're screwing them in not only does

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.219 
you're screwing them in not only does
this<00:05:58.210> mean<00:05:58.419> you're<00:05:58.599> likely<00:05:58.750> to<00:05:58.990> get<00:05:59.080> them

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
this mean you're likely to get them

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.560 
this mean you're likely to get them
covered<00:05:59.620> in<00:05:59.710> muck<00:06:00.010> as<00:06:00.220> you<00:06:00.460> drop<00:06:00.669> them<00:06:00.910> but<00:06:01.479> you

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
covered in muck as you drop them but you

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.310 
covered in muck as you drop them but you
could<00:06:01.810> also<00:06:02.050> easily<00:06:02.500> lose<00:06:03.400> them<00:06:03.700> and<00:06:04.320> also

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
could also easily lose them and also

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.409 
could also easily lose them and also
whilst<00:06:05.979> it's<00:06:06.190> possible<00:06:06.639> that<00:06:06.700> I'm<00:06:06.910> just<00:06:07.180> very

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
whilst it's possible that I'm just very

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.870 
whilst it's possible that I'm just very
clumsy<00:06:08.050> I<00:06:08.200> apparently<00:06:08.830> managed<00:06:09.280> to<00:06:09.490> cross

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
clumsy I apparently managed to cross

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.180 
clumsy I apparently managed to cross
thread<00:06:10.389> the<00:06:10.690> macro<00:06:11.139> lens<00:06:11.410> while<00:06:11.680> screwing<00:06:11.979> it

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
thread the macro lens while screwing it

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.550 
thread the macro lens while screwing it
in<00:06:12.340> so<00:06:12.789> that<00:06:12.940> now<00:06:13.180> it<00:06:13.360> almost<00:06:13.780> refuses<00:06:14.410> to

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
in so that now it almost refuses to

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.710 
in so that now it almost refuses to
unscrew<00:06:15.190> without<00:06:15.520> quite<00:06:15.789> a<00:06:15.849> lot<00:06:16.060> of<00:06:16.210> jiggling

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
unscrew without quite a lot of jiggling

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.830 
unscrew without quite a lot of jiggling
about<00:06:16.840> so<00:06:17.289> do<00:06:17.590> take<00:06:17.830> care<00:06:18.360> it's<00:06:19.360> best<00:06:19.660> to

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
about so do take care it's best to

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.750 
about so do take care it's best to
demonstrate<00:06:20.410> the<00:06:20.530> lens<00:06:20.710> effects<00:06:21.190> in<00:06:21.280> pictures

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
demonstrate the lens effects in pictures

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.330 
demonstrate the lens effects in pictures
so<00:06:22.240> here's<00:06:22.599> a<00:06:22.690> standard<00:06:23.169> iPhone<00:06:23.470> shot<00:06:24.010> without

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
so here's a standard iPhone shot without

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.600 
so here's a standard iPhone shot without
any<00:06:24.639> lens<00:06:25.500> and<00:06:26.500> this<00:06:26.770> is<00:06:26.950> what<00:06:27.099> it<00:06:27.190> looks<00:06:27.400> like

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
any lens and this is what it looks like

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.879 
any lens and this is what it looks like
with<00:06:28.060> the<00:06:28.150> two<00:06:28.360> times<00:06:28.630> zoom<00:06:29.020> you<00:06:29.320> can<00:06:29.380> notice<00:06:29.800> a

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
with the two times zoom you can notice a

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.710 
with the two times zoom you can notice a
bit<00:06:30.039> of<00:06:30.130> vignette<00:06:30.669> in<00:06:30.849> the<00:06:31.060> corners<00:06:31.450> of<00:06:31.479> that

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
bit of vignette in the corners of that

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.100 
bit of vignette in the corners of that
image<00:06:32.880> there's<00:06:33.880> also<00:06:34.060> a<00:06:34.240> fair<00:06:34.720> amount<00:06:34.870> of

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
image there's also a fair amount of

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.900 
image there's also a fair amount of
distortion<00:06:35.530> on<00:06:35.889> the<00:06:35.919> two<00:06:36.160> times<00:06:36.430> as<00:06:36.669> you<00:06:36.880> can

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
distortion on the two times as you can

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.850 
distortion on the two times as you can
see<00:06:37.210> from<00:06:37.360> this<00:06:37.570> image<00:06:37.810> of<00:06:38.080> a<00:06:38.200> window<00:06:38.560> frame

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
see from this image of a window frame

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.520 
see from this image of a window frame
yes<00:06:39.550> those<00:06:39.969> lines<00:06:40.270> are<00:06:40.479> actually<00:06:40.659> straight<00:06:41.320> in

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
yes those lines are actually straight in

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.900 
yes those lines are actually straight in
real<00:06:41.890> life<00:06:42.810> the

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
real life the

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.590 
real life the
is<00:06:44.090> the<00:06:44.270> fisheye<00:06:44.630> which<00:06:44.870> is<00:06:45.020> quite<00:06:45.290> dramatic

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:46.600 
is the fisheye which is quite dramatic

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.360 
is the fisheye which is quite dramatic
as<00:06:47.600> for<00:06:47.900> the<00:06:47.990> macro<00:06:48.260> I<00:06:48.500> wasn't<00:06:48.980> quite<00:06:49.130> sure<00:06:49.190> if

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
as for the macro I wasn't quite sure if

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.550 
as for the macro I wasn't quite sure if
I<00:06:49.610> was<00:06:49.700> using<00:06:49.970> this<00:06:50.210> properly<00:06:50.660> as<00:06:51.080> the<00:06:51.230> iPhone

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
I was using this properly as the iPhone

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.650 
I was using this properly as the iPhone
had<00:06:51.770> great<00:06:52.070> difficulty<00:06:52.730> focusing<00:06:52.970> at<00:06:53.390> short

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
had great difficulty focusing at short

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.020 
had great difficulty focusing at short
distances<00:06:54.290> but<00:06:54.980> here's<00:06:55.460> the<00:06:55.640> shot<00:06:55.820> without

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
distances but here's the shot without

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.160 
distances but here's the shot without
any<00:06:56.450> lens<00:06:56.900> on<00:06:57.140> it<00:06:58.480> then<00:06:59.480> here's<00:06:59.840> the<00:06:59.990> first

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.170 
any lens on it then here's the first

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.570 
any lens on it then here's the first
macro<00:07:00.590> lens<00:07:01.060> and<00:07:03.220> here's<00:07:04.220> the<00:07:04.370> wide-angle

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
macro lens and here's the wide-angle

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.220 
macro lens and here's the wide-angle
screwed<00:07:05.480> into<00:07:05.660> the<00:07:05.900> first<00:07:06.110> macro

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.230 
screwed into the first macro

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.950 
screwed into the first macro
so<00:07:09.040> in<00:07:09.310> conclusion<00:07:09.520> the<00:07:10.150> grip<00:07:10.360> is<00:07:10.510> cleverly

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
so in conclusion the grip is cleverly

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.170 
so in conclusion the grip is cleverly
thought<00:07:11.260> out<00:07:11.500> it<00:07:11.770> does<00:07:12.010> enable<00:07:12.310> you<00:07:12.490> to<00:07:12.580> fasten

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180 
thought out it does enable you to fasten

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.090 
thought out it does enable you to fasten
your<00:07:13.270> iPhone<00:07:13.720> in<00:07:13.870> various<00:07:14.470> ways<00:07:14.710> where<00:07:15.010> you

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
your iPhone in various ways where you

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.340 
your iPhone in various ways where you
simply<00:07:15.490> can't<00:07:15.880> with<00:07:16.180> the<00:07:16.300> phone<00:07:16.510> as<00:07:16.750> standard

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:17.350 
simply can't with the phone as standard

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.980 
simply can't with the phone as standard
so<00:07:18.070> like<00:07:18.310> the<00:07:18.430> podcaster<00:07:19.120> the<00:07:19.150> grip<00:07:19.480> may<00:07:19.720> be<00:07:19.780> of

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
so like the podcaster the grip may be of

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.950 
so like the podcaster the grip may be of
interest<00:07:20.080> to<00:07:20.500> DSLR<00:07:21.370> users<00:07:21.670> audio<00:07:22.450> and<00:07:22.690> video

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
interest to DSLR users audio and video

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.640 
interest to DSLR users audio and video
journalists<00:07:23.740> and<00:07:23.890> phone<00:07:24.510> filmmakers<00:07:25.650> but

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:26.650 
journalists and phone filmmakers but

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.890 
journalists and phone filmmakers but
whilst<00:07:26.890> the<00:07:27.100> grip<00:07:27.400> plus<00:07:27.670> lens<00:07:28.180> attachments

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:28.900 
whilst the grip plus lens attachments

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.960 
whilst the grip plus lens attachments
are<00:07:29.020> interesting<00:07:29.740> they're<00:07:30.130> probably<00:07:30.760> only

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:30.970 
are interesting they're probably only

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.660 
are interesting they're probably only
for<00:07:31.300> certain<00:07:31.720> specialized<00:07:32.560> looks<00:07:32.980> especially

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:33.670 
for certain specialized looks especially

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.210 
for certain specialized looks especially
perhaps<00:07:34.270> given<00:07:34.630> the<00:07:34.720> distortion<00:07:35.290> seen<00:07:35.650> in<00:07:35.860> the

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:36.220 
perhaps given the distortion seen in the

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.170 
perhaps given the distortion seen in the
two<00:07:36.400> times<00:07:36.700> zoom<00:07:37.060> and<00:07:38.160> like<00:07:39.160> the<00:07:39.400> podcaster

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:40.180 
two times zoom and like the podcaster

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.850 
two times zoom and like the podcaster
before<00:07:40.510> it<00:07:40.630> I'd<00:07:40.840> really<00:07:41.380> like<00:07:41.530> to<00:07:41.680> see<00:07:41.830> even

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:41.860 
before it I'd really like to see even

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.490
