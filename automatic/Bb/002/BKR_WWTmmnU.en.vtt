goes in like this and then cannon build

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.820 
goes in like this and then cannon build
goes<00:03:54.410> on<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.739> end<00:03:54.890> of<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.459> cannon<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.830> this

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.530 

next<00:04:10.489> we'll<00:04:10.730> build<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.500> launching<00:04:12.500> platform

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
next we'll build the launching platform

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.390 
next we'll build the launching platform
I've<00:04:14.540> already<00:04:14.900> put<00:04:15.110> some<00:04:15.380> stickers<00:04:15.769> on<00:04:16.130> here

and this black piece right here will go
right<00:04:19.579> on<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:19.940> end<00:04:20.120> then<00:04:20.840> we'll<00:04:21.229> put<00:04:21.440> this

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
right on the end then we'll put this

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.520 
right on the end then we'll put this
wheel<00:04:21.890> on<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:23.240> this<00:04:23.450> orange<00:04:23.810> piece<00:04:24.080> will<00:04:24.320> go

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
wheel on and this orange piece will go

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.680 
wheel on and this orange piece will go
on<00:04:24.830> this<00:04:25.130> side<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:28.340> on<00:04:28.550> here<00:04:28.910> we'll<00:04:29.210> put<00:04:29.479> a

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
on this side and on here we'll put a

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.770 
on this side and on here we'll put a
small<00:04:30.229> wheel<00:04:30.970> let's<00:04:31.970> make<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.330> hoop<00:04:32.510> that

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
small wheel let's make the hoop that

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:54.940 
small wheel let's make the hoop that
cannon<00:04:33.140> bill<00:04:33.350> is<00:04:33.530> going<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.919> fly<00:04:34.280> through

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.420 

and<00:04:55.190> there's<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.270> hoop<00:04:56.680> this<00:04:57.680> hoop<00:04:57.980> is<00:04:58.190> going

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
and there's the hoop this hoop is going

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.050 
and there's the hoop this hoop is going
to<00:04:58.490> go<00:04:58.640> right<00:04:58.940> on<00:04:59.300> this<00:04:59.840> ring<00:05:00.440> here<00:05:03.760> now<00:05:04.760> it's

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
to go right on this ring here now it's

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.970 
to go right on this ring here now it's
just<00:05:05.150> time<00:05:05.540> to<00:05:05.750> put<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.080> finishing<00:05:06.290> touches

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
just time to put the finishing touches

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:15.570 
just time to put the finishing touches
on<00:05:09.670> this<00:05:10.670> hook<00:05:11.000> and<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:12.740> couple<00:05:12.980> pieces<00:05:13.280> here

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.820 

and<00:05:16.580> then<00:05:16.760> we<00:05:16.970> just<00:05:17.180> need<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.450> add<00:05:17.830> these

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830
