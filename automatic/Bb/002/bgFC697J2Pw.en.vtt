00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
like this is one of the most simple

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.540 
like this is one of the most simple
drawings<00:00:29.099> ever<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:30.199> it's<00:00:31.199> like<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.740> like<00:00:32.070> two

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
drawings ever so it's like in like two

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.150 
drawings ever so it's like in like two
easy<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:33.300> three<00:00:33.570> easy<00:00:33.750> steps<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.680> step<00:00:34.920> one

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
easy like three easy steps so step one

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.549 
easy like three easy steps so step one
draw<00:00:36.120> like<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.660> rectangle<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:38.309> hold<00:00:39.120> on

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
draw like a rectangle with hold on

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:47.350 
draw like a rectangle with hold on
testing<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.680> grab<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> bit<00:00:41.550> sharpie<00:00:45.140> so<00:00:46.140> draw<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
testing it grab a bit sharpie so draw a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.170 
testing it grab a bit sharpie so draw a
rectangle<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:51.649> curved<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.850> side

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
rectangle with like curved like the side

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.189 
rectangle with like curved like the side
so<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.989> makes<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> circle

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
so that makes in and you can do a circle

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.360 
so that makes in and you can do a circle
to<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.690> then<00:01:00.690> step<00:01:01.350> two<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> want<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.219> go

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
to and then step two is you want to go

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.149 
to and then step two is you want to go
and<00:01:02.640> wanna<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:05.270> like<00:01:06.320> go<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.530> from<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> bar

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
and wanna like like go out from the bar

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.399 
and wanna like like go out from the bar
and<00:01:08.700> draw<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.119> little<00:01:09.150> waves<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.170> come

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
and draw as little waves and then come

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.539 
and draw as little waves and then come
back<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:11.900> if<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.049> doesn't<00:01:13.350> even<00:01:13.500> open<00:01:13.680> links<00:01:14.369> I

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
ruffles which are just lines then the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.950 
ruffles which are just lines then the
last<00:01:34.890> thing<00:01:35.040> there's<00:01:35.280> no<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.579> Java<00:01:35.880> pain<00:01:41.960> to

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
last thing there's no like Java pain to

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.639 
last thing there's no like Java pain to
the<00:01:43.079> eyes<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.320> face<00:01:47.180> you<00:01:48.180> don't<00:01:48.689> adorbs

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
circle and stead for the base then

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.090 
circle and stead for the base then
pretty<00:01:59.880> much<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.270> same<00:02:00.570> thing<00:02:03.740> that's<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.920> a
