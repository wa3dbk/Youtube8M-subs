the church ass is built is that it's
mainly<00:00:49.309> three<00:00:50.309> sections<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.960> middle

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
mainly three sections to it the middle

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.569 
mainly three sections to it the middle
section<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:52.649> which<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:55.280> you<00:00:56.280> know<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
section here which is the you know the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.680 
section here which is the you know the
basic<00:00:57.770> basic<00:00:58.770> area<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.280> whether<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.940> have

you know you have that and the flying

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.969 
you know you have that and the flying
wheels<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.409> have<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.860> gears<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:39.390> connect<00:01:39.689> a

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
wheels I have the gears to connect a

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.899 
wheels I have the gears to connect a
blind<00:01:40.979> driver<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.579> know<00:01:41.700> one<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> things

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
blind driver with know one of the things

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.270 
blind driver with know one of the things
it's<00:01:44.909> only<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:45.540> necessary<00:01:46.020> connect<00:01:46.590> of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
it's only really necessary connect of

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.359 
it's only really necessary connect of
the<00:01:47.570> pair<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.659> wheels<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.229> wheels<00:01:49.369> won't

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the pair of wheels the wheels won't

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.130 
the pair of wheels the wheels won't
cause<00:01:50.640> any<00:01:50.670> problems<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> piston<00:01:51.930> rods

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
cause any problems with the piston rods

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.499 
cause any problems with the piston rods
so<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.490> leave<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.970> there<00:01:54.210> without

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
so you can just leave that there without

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.359 
so you can just leave that there without
having<00:01:55.049> em<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> know<00:01:55.439> without<00:01:55.770> trouble

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
having em you know without trouble

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.450 
having em you know without trouble
troubles<00:01:56.990> or<00:01:57.990> anything<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.369> get

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
troubles or anything so you can just get

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.080 
troubles or anything so you can just get
into<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.880> actual<00:02:00.270> build<00:02:00.479> process<00:02:00.869> quicker

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
into the actual build process quicker

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.469 
into the actual build process quicker
now<00:02:03.229> then<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.350> have<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.560> front<00:02:04.799> buoy

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
now then we have the front buoy

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.850 
now then we have the front buoy

all done that so gracefully here you can
see<00:02:25.670> how<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.790> looks<00:02:26.849> like<00:02:27.620> from<00:02:28.620> one<00:02:28.769> on

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
see how this looks like from one on

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.589 
see how this looks like from one on
their<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.129> like<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.580> said<00:02:29.819> only<00:02:30.030> Technic

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
their this like I said only Technic

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.949 
their this like I said only Technic
bricks<00:02:30.870> used<00:02:31.280> here<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.519> if<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.569> don't<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:33.900> a

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
bricks used here so if you don't have a

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.030 
bricks used here so if you don't have a
lot<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.470> technique

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
lot of technique

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.380 
lot of technique
if<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.400> I'm<00:02:35.550> sure<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:36.060> come<00:02:36.090> up<00:02:36.300> with

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
if the I'm sure you can come up with

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.570 
if the I'm sure you can come up with
other<00:02:36.810> other<00:02:37.290> ways<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.800> do<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.099> mean<00:02:38.220> for

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
other other ways to do it I mean for

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.100 
other other ways to do it I mean for
this<00:02:38.670> particular<00:02:39.300> thing<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:39.870> with

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
this particular thing that you can with

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.100 
this particular thing that you can with
could<00:02:40.410> without<00:02:40.590> problem<00:02:41.010> use<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:42.110> Technic

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
could without problem use the Technic

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.390 
could without problem use the Technic
bricks<00:02:44.099> with<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.239> holes<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.599> them<00:02:45.750> there

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
bricks with the holes in them there

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.920 
bricks with the holes in them there
without<00:02:47.400> any<00:02:47.849> problem<00:02:48.239> whatsoever

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
without any problem whatsoever

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.630 
without any problem whatsoever
and<00:02:49.170> then<00:02:49.319> you<00:02:49.410> have<00:02:49.530> their<00:02:49.709> like<00:02:49.950> big<00:02:50.310> active

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
and then you have their like big active

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.569 
and then you have their like big active
the<00:02:50.730> axe<00:02:50.880> low<00:02:51.120> down<00:02:51.330> here<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:52.319> connects<00:02:52.829> into

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
the axe low down here that connects into

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.850 
the axe low down here that connects into
one<00:02:53.849> of<00:02:54.000> one<00:02:54.390> into<00:02:55.260> our<00:02:56.569> two<00:02:57.569> by<00:02:57.810> two<00:02:57.870> modified

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
one of one into our two by two modified

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.440 
one of one into our two by two modified
plate<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.459> know<00:02:59.519> with<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.730> whole<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.329> one

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
plate you know with the whole the one

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.600 
plate you know with the whole the one
with<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.660> hole<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:00.840> side<00:03:01.200> there<00:03:01.410> which<00:03:02.220> it

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
with the hole on side there which it

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.770 
with the hole on side there which it
which<00:03:03.090> sits<00:03:03.390> right<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:05.790> top<00:03:06.030> here<00:03:07.610> yeah

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
which sits right on the top here yeah

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.479 
which sits right on the top here yeah
yeah<00:03:09.780> sure<00:03:10.170> see<00:03:10.739> there<00:03:11.010> how<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.610> sits<00:03:11.910> just

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
yeah sure see there how that sits just

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.150 
yeah sure see there how that sits just
on<00:03:14.489> top<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.790> these<00:03:14.959> in<00:03:15.959> high<00:03:16.230> that's<00:03:16.829> usually

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
on top of these in high that's usually

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.400 
on top of these in high that's usually
where<00:03:17.310> ten<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.790> because<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.780> will<00:03:18.989> use<00:03:19.019> this

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
where ten to because I will use this

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.080 
where ten to because I will use this
plate<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:20.100> connect<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.489> Bugis<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.760> think<00:03:21.000> it's

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
plate to connect the Bugis I think it's

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.229 
plate to connect the Bugis I think it's
the<00:03:21.150> easiest<00:03:21.180> way

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
the easiest way

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.960 
the easiest way
try<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.299> get<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.600> slowed<00:03:25.440> down<00:03:25.650> as<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.340> can<00:03:26.549> and

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
try to get it slowed down as you can and

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.190 
try to get it slowed down as you can and
this<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.269> probably<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.690> know<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.019> lows

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
this is probably you know this is lows

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.860 
this is probably you know this is lows
you<00:03:28.380> can<00:03:28.470> get<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:29.030> if<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.180> know<00:03:30.269> as<00:03:30.450> long<00:03:30.810> as

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
you can get it if you know as long as

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.120 
you can get it if you know as long as
you<00:03:30.930> don't<00:03:31.019> put<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.530> know<00:03:31.560> in<00:03:31.680> front<00:03:31.950> of

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
you don't put it you know in front of

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.330 
you don't put it you know in front of
the<00:03:32.280> yak<00:03:32.489> solar<00:03:32.760> which<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.239> do<00:03:33.299> not<00:03:33.450> recommend

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
the yak solar which I do not recommend

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.280 
the yak solar which I do not recommend
but<00:03:35.340> that's<00:03:35.910> how<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.090> do<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.780> then<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.079> have

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
but that's how I do that and then I have

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.140 
but that's how I do that and then I have
like<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.799> said<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:38.100> big<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.639> long<00:03:38.760> axle

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
like I said the big and long axle

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.660 
like I said the big and long axle
connected<00:03:42.150> now<00:03:43.049> these<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:44.160> might<00:03:44.370> come<00:03:44.549> to

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
connected now these this might come to

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.009 
connected now these this might come to
you<00:03:44.760> this<00:03:44.940> isn't<00:03:45.180> really<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.600> ultimate

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
you this isn't really the ultimate

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.890 
you this isn't really the ultimate
solution<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:47.310> have<00:03:47.459> one<00:03:47.760> like<00:03:48.090> really<00:03:48.569> long

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
solution to have one like really long

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.129 
solution to have one like really long
bar<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:50.310> connect<00:03:50.579> it<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:50.910> think<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.359> would<00:03:51.690> better

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
bar to connect it I think I would better

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.670 
bar to connect it I think I would better
off<00:03:52.350> if<00:03:52.530> what<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:52.769> have<00:03:52.950> two<00:03:53.160> separate<00:03:53.579> ones<00:03:54.680> one

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
off if what I have two separate ones one

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.410 
off if what I have two separate ones one
that's<00:03:56.220> going<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.549> just<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.000> Boogie<00:03:57.209> and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
that's going to just to the Boogie and

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.410 
that's going to just to the Boogie and
one<00:03:57.569> that's<00:03:57.660> gonna<00:03:57.870> separate<00:03:58.440> let<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.829> this<00:03:59.099> I

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
one that's gonna separate let you this I

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.120 
one that's gonna separate let you this I
don't<00:04:00.420> really<00:04:00.599> think<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:01.079> magnet<00:04:01.500> should

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
don't really think the magnet should

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.740 
don't really think the magnet should
really<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.700> know<00:04:02.790> in<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.180> magnet<00:04:03.480> doesn't

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
really you know in the magnet doesn't

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.420 
really you know in the magnet doesn't
really<00:04:03.870> need<00:04:04.130> anymore

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
really need anymore

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.199 
really need anymore
it<00:04:06.120> could<00:04:06.359> be<00:04:06.450> mounted<00:04:06.599> onto<00:04:06.959> our<00:04:07.760> bar<00:04:08.760> let's

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
it could be mounted onto our bar let's

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.550 
it could be mounted onto our bar let's
talk<00:04:09.630> in<00:04:09.870> here<00:04:10.049> you<00:04:10.139> know<00:04:10.260> that<00:04:10.290> doesn't

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
talk in here you know that doesn't

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.569 
talk in here you know that doesn't
swivel<00:04:11.040> around<00:04:11.130> cuz<00:04:11.669> it's<00:04:11.819> kind<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.739> and<00:04:13.739> it<00:04:14.130> it

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
swivel around cuz it's kind of and it it

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.159 
swivel around cuz it's kind of and it it
kind<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:14.940> need<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.239> though<00:04:15.359> if<00:04:15.630> you<00:04:15.780> put<00:04:15.989> it<00:04:16.079> on

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
kind of need it though if you put it on

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.009 
kind of need it though if you put it on
such<00:04:16.349> a<00:04:16.380> long<00:04:16.799> bar<00:04:17.130> because<00:04:17.789> in<00:04:17.940> corners<00:04:18.780> it

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
such a long bar because in corners it

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.810 
such a long bar because in corners it
can<00:04:19.260> get<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.590> know<00:04:19.709> so<00:04:19.889> it<00:04:19.979> doesn't<00:04:20.010> get<00:04:20.370> if<00:04:20.669> it

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
can get you know so it doesn't get if it

to<00:05:03.490> connect<00:05:03.729> it<00:05:03.820> to<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:08.760> tender<00:05:09.760> that's<00:05:10.360> it

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
to connect it to the tender that's it

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
to connect it to the tender that's it
the<00:05:11.169> tender<00:05:12.570> some<00:05:13.570> people<00:05:13.810> won't<00:05:13.930> don't<00:05:14.350> like

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
the tender some people won't don't like

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.469 
the tender some people won't don't like
to<00:05:14.710> use<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.100> some<00:05:15.550> people<00:05:15.820> don't<00:05:16.030> use<00:05:16.180> the

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
to use the some people don't use the

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.420 
to use the some people don't use the
magnetic<00:05:17.139> Zander<00:05:17.620> some<00:05:17.830> people<00:05:18.070> just<00:05:18.220> like

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
magnetic Zander some people just like

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.490 
magnetic Zander some people just like
and<00:05:18.700> I<00:05:18.760> connected<00:05:19.270> with<00:05:19.300> one<00:05:19.630> of<00:05:19.750> these<00:05:19.870> bars

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
and I connected with one of these bars

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.159 
and I connected with one of these bars
I<00:05:20.669> personally<00:05:24.210> magnets<00:05:25.210> I<00:05:25.570> think<00:05:25.900> it's<00:05:26.020> much

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
I personally magnets I think it's much

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.440 
I personally magnets I think it's much
easier<00:05:26.680> I<00:05:26.710> think<00:05:26.950> just<00:05:27.220> it<00:05:27.639> just<00:05:27.910> saves<00:05:28.330> time

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
easier I think just it just saves time

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.260 
easier I think just it just saves time
and<00:05:29.229> thought<00:05:29.740> everything<00:05:30.520> so<00:05:30.729> I<00:05:30.760> just<00:05:30.940> and

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
and thought everything so I just and

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.180 
and thought everything so I just and
just<00:05:31.570> looks<00:05:31.780> equally<00:05:32.200> good<00:05:32.410> so<00:05:32.710> I<00:05:32.889> don't<00:05:33.010> see

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
just looks equally good so I don't see

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.180 
just looks equally good so I don't see
why<00:05:33.340> not<00:05:33.400> use<00:05:33.729> it<00:05:33.960> as<00:05:34.960> you<00:05:35.080> can<00:05:35.200> see<00:05:35.380> this<00:05:35.979> whole

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
why not use it as you can see this whole

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.510 
why not use it as you can see this whole
thing<00:05:36.220> is<00:05:36.550> attached<00:05:36.910> by<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.240> same<00:05:37.600> things<00:05:37.990> the

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
thing is attached by the same things the

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.740 
thing is attached by the same things the
two<00:05:39.520> by<00:05:39.729> to<00:05:39.910> modify<00:05:40.630> plate<00:05:40.930> two<00:05:41.560> of<00:05:41.650> them<00:05:42.750> you

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
two by to modify plate two of them you

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.600 
two by to modify plate two of them you
might<00:05:43.960> this<00:05:44.350> might<00:05:44.800> just<00:05:45.100> doesn't<00:05:45.490> really

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
might this might just doesn't really

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.430 
might this might just doesn't really
look<00:05:45.760> that<00:05:45.970> sturdy<00:05:46.270> you<00:05:46.390> know<00:05:46.479> only<00:05:46.660> one<00:05:46.990> stud

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
look that sturdy you know only one stud

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.370 
look that sturdy you know only one stud
on<00:05:47.979> it<00:05:48.160> there<00:05:48.310> but<00:05:48.550> this<00:05:49.180> little<00:05:49.419> pot<00:05:49.750> you<00:05:50.169> see

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
on it there but this little pot you see

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.580 
on it there but this little pot you see
there<00:05:50.590> little<00:05:50.800> stutter<00:05:51.330> goes<00:05:52.330> right<00:05:53.080> onto

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
there little stutter goes right onto

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:00.450 
there little stutter goes right onto
here<00:05:54.340> on<00:05:54.700> to<00:05:54.940> the<00:05:55.620> rest<00:05:56.620> of<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:56.830> train<00:05:59.460> but

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
here on to the rest of the train but

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.010 
here on to the rest of the train but
just<00:06:00.669> make<00:06:00.820> sure<00:06:00.970> this<00:06:01.210> can<00:06:01.389> spool<00:06:01.660> around

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
just make sure this can spool around

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.740 
just make sure this can spool around
very<00:06:02.560> well<00:06:05.550> think<00:06:06.550> that's<00:06:06.850> about<00:06:07.090> it<00:06:07.270> and<00:06:07.510> you

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
very well think that's about it and you

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.240 
very well think that's about it and you
can't<00:06:08.050> actually<00:06:08.229> push<00:06:08.590> this<00:06:08.770> come<00:06:09.010> to<00:06:09.160> the

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
can't actually push this come to the

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.800 
can't actually push this come to the
limitary<00:06:09.580> that<00:06:09.880> you<00:06:10.000> wanted<00:06:10.300> you<00:06:10.510> know<00:06:10.539> how

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
limitary that you wanted you know how

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.020 
limitary that you wanted you know how
much<00:06:11.020> to<00:06:11.169> have<00:06:11.320> to<00:06:11.410> bend<00:06:11.620> because<00:06:11.880> well<00:06:12.880> it's

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
much to have to bend because well it's

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.590 
much to have to bend because well it's
plastic<00:06:13.570> so<00:06:13.750> even<00:06:14.139> if<00:06:14.350> they<00:06:14.590> do<00:06:14.650> get<00:06:15.100> you<00:06:15.370> know

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
plastic so even if they do get you know

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.500 
plastic so even if they do get you know
such<00:06:16.600> a<00:06:16.810> touch<00:06:17.800> coming<00:06:18.760> to<00:06:18.850> contact<00:06:19.240> like<00:06:19.360> that

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
such a touch coming to contact like that

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.690 
such a touch coming to contact like that
it<00:06:19.660> won't<00:06:19.870> affect<00:06:19.990> it<00:06:20.320> at<00:06:20.440> all<00:06:20.620> so<00:06:21.430> you<00:06:21.490> can

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
it won't affect it at all so you can

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.060 
it won't affect it at all so you can
push<00:06:22.210> that<00:06:22.389> pretty<00:06:22.690> far<00:06:22.960> if<00:06:23.289> you<00:06:23.620> would<00:06:23.889> have

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
push that pretty far if you would have

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.140 
push that pretty far if you would have
to<00:06:25.860> but<00:06:26.860> that's<00:06:27.100> about<00:06:27.340> it<00:06:27.580> that's<00:06:27.729> pretty

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
to but that's about it that's pretty

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.000 
to but that's about it that's pretty
much<00:06:28.330> how<00:06:28.570> it<00:06:28.600> looks<00:06:28.840> like<00:06:29.080> everything<00:06:29.830> how

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
much how it looks like everything how

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.000 
much how it looks like everything how
I've<00:06:30.160> done<00:06:30.370> it<00:06:30.580> how<00:06:30.970> the<00:06:31.650> how<00:06:32.650> everything

otherwise attached by these two here if

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.720 
otherwise attached by these two here if
you<00:06:38.650> see<00:06:38.860> here<00:06:39.270> I<00:06:40.270> have<00:06:41.039> tried<00:06:42.039> to

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.550 

do<00:06:45.730> one<00:06:46.180> second<00:06:46.720> middle<00:06:46.900> section<00:06:47.320> here<00:06:47.350> wood

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
do one second middle section here wood

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.590 
do one second middle section here wood
plates<00:06:48.390> to<00:06:49.390> come<00:06:50.370> to<00:06:51.370> make<00:06:51.550> a<00:06:51.580> good<00:06:52.270> place<00:06:52.570> to

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
plates to come to make a good place to

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.990 
plates to come to make a good place to
connect<00:06:53.110> everything<00:06:53.490> you<00:06:54.490> know<00:06:54.610> to<00:06:54.700> have<00:06:54.850> one

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
connect everything you know to have one

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.960 
connect everything you know to have one
base<00:06:55.210> because<00:06:55.720> the<00:06:56.040> the<00:06:57.040> frontier<00:06:57.760> is

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
base because the the frontier is

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.590 
base because the the frontier is
completely<00:06:58.900> you<00:06:59.110> know<00:06:59.170> it's<00:06:59.350> not<00:06:59.590> built<00:06:59.980> and

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
completely you know it's not built and

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.060 
completely you know it's not built and
this<00:07:01.600> back<00:07:01.990> pot<00:07:02.290> is<00:07:02.530> built<00:07:03.340> up<00:07:03.580> lie<00:07:03.730> down<00:07:04.000> so

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
this back pot is built up lie down so

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.170 
this back pot is built up lie down so
the<00:07:06.070> middle<00:07:06.310> that<00:07:06.430> I'll<00:07:06.580> try<00:07:06.760> to<00:07:06.820> keep<00:07:07.000> at

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
the middle that I'll try to keep at

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.780 
the middle that I'll try to keep at
least<00:07:07.210> one<00:07:07.600> pot<00:07:07.900> we<00:07:08.740> can<00:07:08.770> like<00:07:09.310> attach

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:09.790 
least one pot we can like attach

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.550

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.590 
everything that was just to those were
really<00:07:15.250> the<00:07:15.400> most<00:07:15.580> technical<00:07:16.090> place<00:07:16.300> to<00:07:16.450> pass

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600 
really the most technical place to pass

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.620 
really the most technical place to pass
on<00:07:17.640> looks<00:07:18.640> like<00:07:18.790> it<00:07:18.910> worked<00:07:19.120> out<00:07:19.240> either<00:07:19.420> way

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:19.630
