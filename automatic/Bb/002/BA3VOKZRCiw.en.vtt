there<00:01:45.500> wasn't<00:01:45.740> really<00:01:45.800> think<00:01:46.070> super<00:01:46.460> gory<00:01:46.730> in

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
there wasn't really think super gory in

this there was it the story wasn't that
interesting<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.800> didn't<00:01:48.950> really<00:01:49.040> add<00:01:49.250> that

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
interesting it didn't really add that

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.910 
interesting it didn't really add that
much<00:01:49.790> depth<00:01:50.120> to<00:01:50.240> anything<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:50.960> imagine<00:01:51.770> it's<00:01:51.890> a

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
much depth to anything I imagine it's a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.950 
much depth to anything I imagine it's a
decent<00:01:52.280> companion<00:01:52.850> piece<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.480> original

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
decent companion piece to the original

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.470 
decent companion piece to the original
movie<00:01:54.320> but<00:01:54.830> other<00:01:55.340> than<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:55.970> really<00:01:56.000> can't

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
movie but other than that I really can't

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.850 
movie but other than that I really can't
recommend<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:57.080> on<00:01:57.260> itself<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:57.710> it's<00:01:57.830> a

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
recommend this on itself so it's a

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.080 
recommend this on itself so it's a
little<00:01:58.070> disappointing<00:01:58.220> when<00:01:58.580> starting<00:01:58.970> off

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
little disappointing when starting off

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.450 
little disappointing when starting off
but<00:01:59.870> everything<00:02:00.380> picks<00:02:00.620> up<00:02:00.800> for<00:02:00.980> Hugh<00:02:01.130> on<00:02:01.280> in

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
but everything picks up for Hugh on in

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.630 
but everything picks up for Hugh on in
the<00:02:02.120> second<00:02:02.540> story<00:02:02.720> called<00:02:03.050> abuser<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.520> the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
the second story called abuser and the

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.660 
the second story called abuser and the
abuse<00:02:05.060> is<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.810> really<00:02:06.620> short<00:02:06.830> story<00:02:07.010> actually

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
abuse is a really short story actually

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.400 
abuse is a really short story actually
it's<00:02:08.179> about<00:02:08.269> 15<00:02:08.780> pages<00:02:09.019> of<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:09.349> remember

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
it's about 15 pages of I remember

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.710 
it's about 15 pages of I remember
correctly<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.099> while<00:02:11.060> it's<00:02:11.239> really<00:02:11.510> short

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
correctly and while it's really short

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.240 
correctly and while it's really short
and<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.050> story<00:02:12.319> does<00:02:12.680> seem<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:12.950> be<00:02:13.010> fairly

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
and the story does seem to be fairly

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.360 
and the story does seem to be fairly
inconsequential<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:14.690> had<00:02:14.870> really<00:02:15.370> fantastic

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
inconsequential it had really fantastic

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
looking art that kind of reminds me of a

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.400 
looking art that kind of reminds me of a
mix<00:02:18.830> between<00:02:18.920> Scott<00:02:19.489> Pilgrim<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.120> 40<00:02:20.840> style

comic strips it's really interesting and

the<00:03:15.420> obvious<00:03:15.800> interpretation<00:03:16.800> seems<00:03:17.730> kind<00:03:18.000> of

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
the obvious interpretation seems kind of

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.600 
the obvious interpretation seems kind of
odd<00:03:18.360> but<00:03:19.110> regardless<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.130> story<00:03:20.370> had<00:03:20.490> some

really really fantastic art and a very

a pretty decently interesting
interesting<00:03:28.260> story<00:03:28.680> especially<00:03:28.980> so<00:03:29.670> because

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
interesting story especially so because

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.270 
interesting story especially so because
there's<00:03:30.480> snow<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.530> sounds<00:03:31.890> really

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
there's snow and that sounds really

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.130 
there's snow and that sounds really
ridiculous<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.940> say<00:03:33.150> but<00:03:33.330> not<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.870> lot<00:03:34.110> of

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
ridiculous to say but not a lot of

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.180 
ridiculous to say but not a lot of
horror<00:03:34.530> stories<00:03:35.150> really<00:03:36.150> have<00:03:36.990> actual<00:03:37.770> snow

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
horror stories really have actual snow

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.070 
horror stories really have actual snow
most<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.850> them<00:03:38.940> are<00:03:39.030> set<00:03:39.240> during<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.690> spring

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
most of them are set during the spring

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.310 
most of them are set during the spring
or<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.290> summer<00:03:40.380> even<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.160> fall<00:03:41.540> but<00:03:42.540> there's

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
or the summer even the fall but there's

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.590 
or the summer even the fall but there's
really<00:03:43.590> too<00:03:44.340> few<00:03:44.700> nowadays<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.330> I<00:03:45.390> think

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
all of this in its totality like I said

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.680 
all of this in its totality like I said
is<00:05:24.970> a<00:05:25.000> very<00:05:25.120> short<00:05:25.630> read<00:05:25.900> when<00:05:26.800> dialogue<00:05:27.190> does

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
is a very short read when dialogue does

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.320 
is a very short read when dialogue does
mmm<00:05:28.690> kind<00:05:29.230> of<00:05:29.350> wave<00:05:29.500> from<00:05:29.710> story<00:05:30.010> to<00:05:30.040> story

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
mmm kind of wave from story to story

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.300 
mmm kind of wave from story to story
it's<00:05:31.330> generally<00:05:31.930> not<00:05:32.080> bad<00:05:32.350> though<00:05:32.620> abuser<00:05:33.100> and

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
it's generally not bad though abuser and

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.280 
it's generally not bad though abuser and
the<00:05:33.370> abuse<00:05:34.030> does<00:05:34.270> have<00:05:34.450> the<00:05:34.570> worst<00:05:34.750> dialogue

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
the abuse does have the worst dialogue

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.380 
the abuse does have the worst dialogue
and<00:05:35.560> none<00:05:36.100> of<00:05:36.130> it<00:05:36.310> is<00:05:36.400> Shakespeare<00:05:36.970> don't<00:05:37.240> get

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
and none of it is Shakespeare don't get

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.360 
and none of it is Shakespeare don't get
me<00:05:37.510> wrong<00:05:37.540> but<00:05:38.320> it<00:05:38.410> certainly<00:05:38.590> all<00:05:38.890> serves<00:05:39.160> its

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
me wrong but it certainly all serves its

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.800 
me wrong but it certainly all serves its
purpose<00:05:39.670> and<00:05:39.790> serves<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.180> tone<00:05:40.390> of<00:05:40.420> each<00:05:40.660> of

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
purpose and serves the tone of each of

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.750 
purpose and serves the tone of each of
the<00:05:40.870> separate<00:05:41.170> stories<00:05:41.560> overall<00:05:42.430> like<00:05:42.550> I<00:05:42.610> said
