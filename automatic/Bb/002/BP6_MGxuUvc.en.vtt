00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.379
 the mangroves are forests composed of mangrove trees 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:11.379
 between areas as entities include estuaries and coastal areas 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.959
 our state is the one with the most coverage of these 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:20.410
 with 282 thousand 857 hectares also covering the municipalities of CalkinÃ­ 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.589
 hecelchakan 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.659
 it is an ecosystem of norm and biological diversity with high productivity 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.330
 finding a large number of bird species 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.350
 Of fishes 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.319
 the tasios 

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:35.630
 mollusks and so on 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.630
 they are also a set of tropical and subtropical habitas 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.399
 It is formed by trees very tolerant to salt 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.410
 that will occupy the intertidal zone 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.060
 near the mouth of fresh water 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.350
 and the coasts 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.350
 Aunt tropical 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.480
 in sand 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.600
 day by day severe contamination was observed 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.030
 product of man's activities 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.960
 which 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.450
 add water substances foreign to its composition 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 modifying the quality of this 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.010
 the water is contaminated 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.500
 used for human consumption 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.710
 like to feed crops and stop drinking the animals 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.440
 which in turn 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.280
 they will become food for humans 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.950
 and other living beings 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.260
 making a food chain 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.670
 in such a way that yes 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.270
 the sources used are contaminated 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.630
 the crops will also be contaminated 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.170
 animals 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.300
 the humans 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.300
 and the fish that are part of the medium 4 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.310
 this pollution acquired importance due to the increase in 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.540
 population of the increase of pollutants 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.470
 that man himself has created 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.590
 pathogenic microorganisms that cause joke typhoid fever 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.980
 for you and your 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.330
 hepatitis 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.860
 feel wounds 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.050
 synthetic detergent and fertilizers rich in phosphates 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.469
 pesticides or organic like the DDT 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.939
 to the tri 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.939
 inorganic chemicals such as nitrates 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:20.779
 districts 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:21.730
 hard 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.799
 arsenic 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.719
 selenium 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.099
 among others 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.339
 oil and its derivatives like tar 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:30.549
 oils 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.289
 fuels 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:35.349
 are some examples in two pollutants 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.249
 that man 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:37.649
 has created today 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:41.079
 cause so much damage to this ecosystem 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.159
 the vector 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.429
 It is a mechanism 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.149
 usually an organism 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:49.689
 that transmits an infectious agent puig remaining in the affected individuals to 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.139
 others who still do not carry these people 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.209
 for example 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.849
 an example is the anopheles mosquito 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.719
 it acts as the vector of malaria 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.669
 this mosquito has 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.669
 a period of growth and reaching adulthood 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:07.489
 it is capable 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.339
 d 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.039
 transmit these people 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:12.639
 this reader malaria 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.599
 grows in the mangrove 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.089
 when it is polluting 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:18.509
 and many species inhabit die 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.759
 these species are the ones 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.349
 prey on these mosquitoes 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.379
 and for this the proliferation became numerous 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.619
 since its natural preparations 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.659
 and even in a very small number or flat is no longer 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.549
 for this reason 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.569
 we must create awareness about environmental sanitation 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.569
 mangrove pollution can become a focus of diseases 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:43.069
 cozar ando well transfers of 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.559
 diseases such as malaria 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.359
 malaria and 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.559
 that's why it's very important 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:53.559
 very important to take care of this ecosystem 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.159
 let's take the example of 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.279
 Dengue is transmitted by the bite of the infected mosquito genus is 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.529
 being the main 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:07.179
 It is a disease typical of tropical and subtropical climates that attacks 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.219
 children 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.259
 World Health Organization 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:15.779
 reports that millions of cases are recorded annually, of which a 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.779
 important percentage requires hospitalization 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.340
 in Mexico 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.560
 in 1995 there were two thousand 395 cases 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.039
 138 of them hemorrhagic dengue 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.710
 having run 11 deaths the newspaper to ciu of the disease 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.240
 is 5 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.449
 to eight days 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.080
 classic dengue presents high fever 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.590
 stefania back pain chills 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.259
 the malaise is general 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.400
 that's why he reiterated 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.360
 Mangrove care 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.590
 since it is a focus of infections when it is not 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.699
 two natural predators of these mosquitoes 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.460
 that's why you have to 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.990
 Dengue proliferates
