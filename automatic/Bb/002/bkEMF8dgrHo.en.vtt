alone ground sure example thought that
works<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.930> a<00:01:02.019> sense<00:01:02.290> this<00:01:02.680> is<00:01:02.739> not<00:01:03.010> a<00:01:03.040> kind<00:01:03.280> of

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
works in a sense this is not a kind of

works in a sense this is not a kind of
works<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:08.650> can<00:01:08.799> see<00:01:08.979> there<00:01:09.220> it's<00:01:09.909> pretty<00:01:10.180> good

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
works we can see there it's pretty good

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.920 
works we can see there it's pretty good
like<00:01:10.540> even<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.930> decently<00:01:11.380> low<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:13.420> know<00:01:13.600> with

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
like even a decently low you know with

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.890 
like even a decently low you know with
these<00:01:14.080> low<00:01:15.060> he's<00:01:16.060> kind<00:01:16.299> of<00:01:16.330> talking<00:01:16.570> to<00:01:16.780> me

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
these low he's kind of talking to me

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.990 
these low he's kind of talking to me
obviously<00:01:17.530> they're<00:01:17.680> very<00:01:18.009> expensive<00:01:18.430> so<00:01:18.970> you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
obviously they're very expensive so you

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.990 
obviously they're very expensive so you
don't<00:01:19.270> you<00:01:19.330> don't<00:01:19.450> even<00:01:19.689> get<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:19.869> pay<00:01:20.110> for<00:01:21.000> this

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
don't you don't even get to pay for this

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.570 
don't you don't even get to pay for this

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.800 
just have tied that silver doctor under
there<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.860> actually<00:02:47.730> we<00:02:48.090> found<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.600> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
there and actually we found that the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.330 
there and actually we found that the
farm<00:02:49.079> didn't<00:02:49.350> want<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.560> go<00:02:49.680> through<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.160> pipe

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
farm didn't want to go through the pipe

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.970 
farm didn't want to go through the pipe
on<00:02:50.519> phone<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:50.940> we<00:02:51.030> took<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.239> computer<00:02:51.660> fan<00:02:51.989> put

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
on phone so we took a computer fan put

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.220 
on phone so we took a computer fan put
it<00:02:53.070> in<00:02:53.190> here<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.820> just<00:02:54.570> had<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.780> hooked<00:02:54.870> up<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.110> a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
it in here I just had it hooked up to a

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.870 
it in here I just had it hooked up to a
drill<00:02:55.530> battery<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.340> can<00:02:56.519> hook<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.730> up<00:02:56.820> to

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
drill battery but you can hook it up to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.680 
drill battery but you can hook it up to
a<00:02:57.030> 9-volt<00:02:57.420> battery<00:02:57.870> or<00:02:58.140> whatever<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:59.190> want

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
a 9-volt battery or whatever you want

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.170 
a 9-volt battery or whatever you want
we<00:03:00.690> just<00:03:00.870> screw<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.140> in<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> box<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:02.310> also

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
we just screw that in the box and also

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.740 
we just screw that in the box and also
liner<00:03:03.720> box<00:03:04.230> with<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.680> plastic<00:03:05.670> coating

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
liner box with the plastic coating

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.040 
liner box with the plastic coating
but<00:03:07.050> if<00:03:07.800> when<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.310> ice<00:03:08.460> melts<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.180> doesn't<00:03:09.510> get

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
but if when the ice melts it doesn't get

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.880 
but if when the ice melts it doesn't get
the<00:03:10.230> actual<00:03:11.130> bit<00:03:11.670> all<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.180> we<00:03:13.170> seal<00:03:13.440> this<00:03:13.650> off

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
the actual bit all that we seal this off

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.500 
the actual bit all that we seal this off
over<00:03:14.130> here<00:03:14.400> some<00:03:19.520> you<00:03:20.520> just<00:03:20.760> put<00:03:21.180> these<00:03:21.270> little

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
over here some you just put these little

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.970 
over here some you just put these little
chunks<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.840> when<00:03:21.930> I'm<00:03:22.050> here<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.380> get<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.620> up<00:03:22.740> I'm

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
chunks of when I'm here to get it up I'm

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:36.740 
chunks of when I'm here to get it up I'm
home<00:03:23.540> seven<00:03:24.540> bars<00:03:25.220> into<00:03:26.220> there<00:03:35.600> all<00:03:36.600> right

home seven bars into there all right
this<00:03:37.020> is<00:03:37.170> what<00:03:37.350> your<00:03:37.440> box<00:03:37.620> will<00:03:37.860> look<00:03:37.980> like

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
this is what your box will look like

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.530 
this is what your box will look like
more<00:03:39.480> or<00:03:39.630> less<00:03:39.660> when<00:03:40.530> it's<00:03:40.650> finished<00:03:41.540> I'll

more or less when it's finished I'll

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.500 
more or less when it's finished I'll
show<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:42.810> got<00:03:42.930> an<00:03:42.989> example<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.590> what<00:03:43.739> it<00:03:43.830> does

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
show you got an example of what it does

as<00:04:02.390> you<00:04:03.050> can<00:04:03.140> see<00:04:03.320> it<00:04:03.680> stays<00:04:03.920> pretty<00:04:04.130> well<00:04:04.400> for

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
as you can see it stays pretty well for

as you can see it stays pretty well for
the<00:04:04.700> most<00:04:04.850> part<00:04:05.050> obviously<00:04:06.050> all<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.440> tweener

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
the most part obviously all the tweener

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.300 
the most part obviously all the tweener
rising<00:04:07.540> another<00:04:08.540> kind<00:04:09.200> of<00:04:09.290> crack<00:04:09.530> example<00:04:10.070> is

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
rising another kind of crack example is

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.050 
rising another kind of crack example is
already<00:04:11.470> pretty<00:04:12.470> hot<00:04:13.130> outside<00:04:13.400> where<00:04:13.790> we<00:04:13.820> are

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
already pretty hot outside where we are

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.640 
already pretty hot outside where we are
right<00:04:14.210> now<00:04:14.480> it's<00:04:14.870> probably<00:04:15.230> around<00:04:15.290> 90

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
right now it's probably around 90

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.630 
right now it's probably around 90
degrees<00:04:15.980> right<00:04:16.100> now

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640

so<00:04:17.120> fact<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:18.110> it<00:04:18.230> arises<00:04:18.650> that<00:04:19.040> shouldn't

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
so fact that it arises that shouldn't

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.530 
so fact that it arises that shouldn't
concern<00:04:19.700> you<00:04:19.880> so<00:04:20.060> much

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
concern you so much

concern you so much
in<00:04:21.200> fact<00:04:21.440> we've<00:04:21.620> got<00:04:21.769> a<00:04:21.890> lot<00:04:22.040> of<00:04:22.160> ice<00:04:22.280> in<00:04:22.310> the

in fact we've got a lot of ice in the
fog<00:04:22.730> machine<00:04:23.090> right<00:04:23.300> now<00:04:24.490> as<00:04:25.490> you<00:04:25.610> can<00:04:25.730> see<00:04:25.910> it

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
fog machine right now as you can see it

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.940 
fog machine right now as you can see it
is<00:04:26.810> a<00:04:26.840> pretty<00:04:26.960> good<00:04:27.110> job<00:04:27.320> for<00:04:27.620> most<00:04:27.740> we're
