00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:51.780
 On Sundays we were three brothers 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.030
 old and be each and every one had the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.030

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.110
 asking 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.720
 almost two days in a list 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.710
 Hold on a little dad

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.260
 little finalist is very a spinning chicken 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.950
 400 plus a tip from the list we 're going 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.950
 to prepare nothing 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.010
 it's a different way to spice 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.989
 that they also did before it is to put 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.610
 a little butter that gives a lot of flavor 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.250
 but instead of putting it a lot so that it does not 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:41.069
 burn between the skin and receive 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:45.069
 talking about the soft butter 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.890
 and we're going to see a bit of everything always 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.660
 we say in crime are in 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.760
 it's okay 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.090
 and ground it stings a bit but but in my 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.090
 marriage 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.909

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.640

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.330
 fries 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.160

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.210

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.210

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.230
