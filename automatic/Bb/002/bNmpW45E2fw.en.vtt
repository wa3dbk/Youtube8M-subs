hello<00:00:01.199> YouTube<00:00:01.829> Marauders<00:00:02.340> here<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:02.909> this<00:00:03.240> is

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hello YouTube Marauders here and this is

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.410 
hello YouTube Marauders here and this is
the<00:00:03.629> Intel<00:00:04.020> compute<00:00:04.470> stick<00:00:04.670> so<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:06.120> is

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
the Intel compute stick so this is

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.870 
the Intel compute stick so this is
basically<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:07.020> small<00:00:07.350> little<00:00:08.010> HDMI<00:00:08.820> dongle

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
basically a small little HDMI dongle

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.039 
basically a small little HDMI dongle
size<00:00:09.690> PC<00:00:10.440> running<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:11.099> at<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:12.110> 375f<00:00:13.139> chip<00:00:14.070> so

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
size PC running the at on 375f chip so

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.540 
size PC running the at on 375f chip so
performance<00:00:16.049> wise<00:00:16.289> it's<00:00:17.130> gonna<00:00:17.340> behave

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
performance wise it's gonna behave

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.040 
performance wise it's gonna behave
exactly<00:00:17.869> more<00:00:18.869> or<00:00:18.960> less<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.560> same<00:00:19.830> as<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
exactly more or less the same as the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.390 
exactly more or less the same as the
tablets<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.199> I've<00:00:22.320> been<00:00:22.529> reviewing<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.279> my

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
tablets that I've been reviewing on my

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.340 
tablets that I've been reviewing on my
channel<00:00:23.789> also<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.090> can<00:00:24.480> if<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.019> need<00:00:25.289> a

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
channel also you can if you need a

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.320 
channel also you can if you need a
profile<00:00:25.859> if<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.400> need<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.730> know<00:00:26.820> how<00:00:27.090> well

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
profile if you need to know how well

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.120 
profile if you need to know how well
this<00:00:27.539> thing<00:00:27.599> actually<00:00:27.869> works<00:00:28.109> as<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> computer

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
this thing actually works as a computer

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.080 
this thing actually works as a computer
you<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.269> go<00:00:30.480> check<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:31.109> those<00:00:31.500> videos<00:00:32.090> but

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
you can go check out those videos but

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.700 
you can go check out those videos but
basically<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.930> should<00:00:34.079> be<00:00:34.230> slightly<00:00:34.380> better

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
basically this should be slightly better

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.100 
basically this should be slightly better
since<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.460> has<00:00:35.730> two<00:00:36.000> gigs<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.360> RAM<00:00:36.600> compared

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
since this has two gigs of RAM compared

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.619 
since this has two gigs of RAM compared
to<00:00:37.170> one<00:00:37.350> gig<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.680> ram<00:00:37.820> which<00:00:38.820> most<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
to one gig of ram which most of the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.260 
to one gig of ram which most of the
tablets<00:00:39.989> i<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.260> revealed<00:00:40.649> had<00:00:41.100> revealed<00:00:41.730> has

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
tablets i have revealed had revealed has

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.930 
tablets i have revealed had revealed has
now<00:00:43.260> what<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.620> would<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.370> would<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
now what I would like to I would like to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.459 
now what I would like to I would like to
just<00:00:45.120> give<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.450> little<00:00:45.719> tip<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.320> you

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
just give you a little tip here if you

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.160 
just give you a little tip here if you
considering<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.520> buying<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.360> Intel<00:00:48.809> compute

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
considering of buying the Intel compute

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.470 
considering of buying the Intel compute
stick<00:00:49.280> now<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> thing<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> Intel

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
stick now the thing is that the Intel

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.020 
stick now the thing is that the Intel
compute<00:00:51.809> stick<00:00:51.840> only<00:00:52.289> has<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:53.280> USB<00:00:53.750> pot<00:00:54.750> and

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
compute stick only has one USB pot and

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.110 
compute stick only has one USB pot and
so<00:00:57.030> why<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.600> important<00:00:58.520> now<00:00:59.520> because<00:01:00.030> he

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
so why is that important now because he

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.380 
so why is that important now because he
only<00:01:00.239> has<00:01:00.390> one<00:01:00.420> USB<00:01:00.989> port<00:01:01.730> doing<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.940> when<00:01:03.239> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
only has one USB port doing it when you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.000 
only has one USB port doing it when you
when<00:01:03.719> you're<00:01:03.870> setting<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.229> windows<00:01:04.680> when<00:01:04.890> you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
when you're setting up windows when you

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.840 
when you're setting up windows when you
do<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> first<00:01:05.610> boot<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.810> ask<00:01:07.020> yourself

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
do a first boot you have to ask yourself

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.859 
do a first boot you have to ask yourself
do<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.909> plug<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.140> USB<00:01:10.170> mouse<00:01:11.180> or<00:01:12.180> USB<00:01:13.049> keyboard

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
do I plug in a USB mouse or USB keyboard

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.420 
do I plug in a USB mouse or USB keyboard
because<00:01:15.869> since<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.470> only<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:17.040> port

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
because since you only have one port

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.929 
because since you only have one port
here

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
here

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.600 
here
you<00:01:18.600> could<00:01:18.869> always<00:01:19.140> plug<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.920> hub<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.580> I

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
you could always plug in a hub but I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.840 
you could always plug in a hub but I
guess<00:01:21.000> not<00:01:21.420> many<00:01:21.720> people<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.850> I'm

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
guess not many people have that and I'm

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.850 
guess not many people have that and I'm
basically<00:01:24.299> telling<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.840> you're<00:01:25.650> either

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
when installing Windows you could just

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.289 
when installing Windows you could just
plug<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> keyboard<00:01:52.799> or<00:01:53.250> knee<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.060> can

complicated<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.200> possible

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
complicated but it is possible

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.490 
complicated but it is possible
it<00:02:12.320> so<00:02:12.890> it's<00:02:13.850> I'm<00:02:14.390> just<00:02:14.840> telling<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.230> that's
