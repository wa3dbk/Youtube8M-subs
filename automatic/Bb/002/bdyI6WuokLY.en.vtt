00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.529
 the head of matter 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.250
 Only the one who made my head today was 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.250
 the portela 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.279
 the old man 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.440

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:02.059
 wonderful patient you are carrying 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.509
 this weight of portela is one of the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.180
 favorite to champion this year you feel 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.700
 This weight on your back favoritism is 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.340
 something that does not exist has to be 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:19.300
 resolved here, it is logical to 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:23.289
 portel guerrilla tool is 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.979
 difficult but it's a fight a celtic fight 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.979
 Portela came to fight. 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.770
 that 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.010
 these passistas these passistas that here 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.650
 are in this way the portrait of much 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.230
 I work a lot of energy and I cry a lot. 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.660
 very much love much shout much shout 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.150
 they seek to give love a lot of crying 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.670
 union of the two of us because so the portela 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.250
 It is a school that gives us all the support is 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.770
 All strength to the next door to school, right? 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.840
 Let's give a framework to help 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.850
 these children who do not know how to learn 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.700
 who knows how to improve 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.860
 so it's an unexplained thing and 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.040
 You can have a notion more or less if 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.380
 It was a good rehearsal with this falling rain. 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.660
 It's the rain, it comes to clean it. 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.310
 It really is very good, huh? 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.650

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.040

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.350

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.890

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.260

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.150
 waiting and how much richer they are 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.150
