00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
to do for this to work very easy to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.549 
to do for this to work very easy to
figure<00:00:52.440> out<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:53.370> also<00:00:53.489> has<00:00:53.820> these<00:00:54.000> four<00:00:54.559> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
figure out it also has these four and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.650 
figure out it also has these four and
the<00:00:55.649> bottom<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:55.980> see<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.190> circles<00:00:56.539> those<00:00:57.539> are

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the bottom you see the circles those are

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.930 
the bottom you see the circles those are
the<00:00:57.690> extenders<00:00:58.320> that's<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.699> when<00:00:59.850> you

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the extenders that's so that when you

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.180 
the extenders that's so that when you
place<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.690> floor<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.649> bottom<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
place this on your floor the bottom of

place this on your floor the bottom of
the<00:01:02.250> board<00:01:02.539> doesn't<00:01:03.539> touch<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.049> floor<00:01:04.320> now<00:01:04.830> if

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the board doesn't touch the floor now if

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.730 
the board doesn't touch the floor now if
you<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> thick<00:01:05.670> carpet<00:01:06.330> they<00:01:07.080> do<00:01:07.140> come

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you have a thick carpet they do come

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.130 
you have a thick carpet they do come
with<00:01:08.430> four<00:01:08.700> extra<00:01:08.880> extenders<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.750> raise<00:01:09.930> up

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
with four extra extenders to raise up

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
with four extra extenders to raise up
even<00:01:10.380> higher<00:01:10.590> because<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.189> bottom<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
even higher because the bottom of the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.149 
even higher because the bottom of the
board<00:01:12.119> can't<00:01:12.450> touch<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.930> floor<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.680> order<00:01:14.010> for
