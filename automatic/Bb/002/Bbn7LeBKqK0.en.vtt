00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
people the ones who really have a very

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.850 
people the ones who really have a very
hard<00:01:29.220> time<00:01:29.400> managing<00:01:29.760> basic<00:01:30.390> things<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.200> they

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
hard time managing basic things so they

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.280 
hard time managing basic things so they
were<00:01:31.920> left<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.670> their<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.840> those<00:01:34.110> back

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
pushed away from society and so it's

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.450 
pushed away from society and so it's
that<00:01:39.290> what<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.320> was<00:01:40.500> really<00:01:40.680> interested<00:01:40.830> in<00:01:41.220> is

that what I was really interested in is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.910 
that what I was really interested in is
that<00:01:41.670> sort<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.909> double-layer<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:43.020> both<00:01:43.680> those

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that sort of double-layer of both those

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.240 
that sort of double-layer of both those
very<00:01:44.280> capable<00:01:44.729> as<00:01:44.909> well<00:01:45.090> as<00:01:45.210> those<00:01:45.420> who<00:01:46.250> were

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250

very capable as well as those who were
extremely<00:01:47.970> disabled<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.659> how<00:01:48.810> did<00:01:48.930> they<00:01:49.020> all

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
extremely disabled and how did they all

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.810

time ago and as you say the conditions
then<00:03:21.260> were<00:03:21.590> in<00:03:21.620> many<00:03:22.160> cases<00:03:22.670> horrendous<00:03:23.180> some

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
then were in many cases horrendous some

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.900 
then were in many cases horrendous some
of<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:24.080> patients<00:03:24.560> at<00:03:24.739> frontal<00:03:25.220> actually

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
of the patients at frontal actually

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.300 
of the patients at frontal actually
worked<00:03:26.270> in<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.690> lab<00:03:26.900> as<00:03:27.200> assistants<00:03:27.770> which

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
worked in the lab as assistants which

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.050 
worked in the lab as assistants which
sounds<00:03:28.580> good

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
sounds good

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.600 
sounds good
but<00:03:29.450> then<00:03:29.600> they<00:03:29.780> were<00:03:29.900> also<00:03:30.459> experimented<00:03:31.459> on

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
but then they were also experimented on

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.060 
but then they were also experimented on
as<00:03:32.180> we<00:03:32.360> see<00:03:32.600> in<00:03:32.840> this<00:03:33.140> question<00:03:33.680> number<00:03:33.950> of
