00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.480
 Hello everyone 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:15.080
 I am Sato of Lotto National College of Technology 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:20.710
 Today I would like to verify if the Lot 6 forecasting tool is correctly forecasting 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:24.010
 The verification software is well-known as Japan 's best verification tool 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.340
 Use the Lotto Dragon 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.780
 this time 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.580
 The function of the forecast software is 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.810
 It seems to go combination search 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:40.010
 We use winning security more than 3rd grade 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.360
 If this function creates forecasts through 15 pieces 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.130
 Normal 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:50.140
 There are 5005 ways, but by using this function 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:55.110
 We can narrow down to 315 ways 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.110
 We validate based on data of 610 times 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.980
 After 15 in love numbers 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.089

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:08.320

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.540
 If you do so, you can choose the winning number destination 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.380
 The winning number is 2 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.230

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.050

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.390
