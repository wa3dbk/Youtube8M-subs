00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the reason I bring up this topic is a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.820 
the reason I bring up this topic is a
top<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.119> growing<00:01:09.570> global<00:01:10.110> influence<00:01:10.619> in

top of growing global influence in
gaming<00:01:11.929> maybe<00:01:12.929> since<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.380> two<00:01:13.530> thousands<00:01:14.009> I'd

00:01:14.089 --> 00:01:14.099

argue<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.940> gaming<00:01:15.360> development<00:01:15.780> has<00:01:15.899> moved

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
argue the gaming development has moved

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.249 
argue the gaming development has moved
more<00:01:16.380> westwards<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.220> even<00:01:17.550> to<00:01:17.700> Europe<00:01:18.259> before

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
more westwards and even to Europe before

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.249 
more westwards and even to Europe before
it<00:01:19.619> used<00:01:19.679> to<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:19.920> very<00:01:19.950> central<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.729> Japan
