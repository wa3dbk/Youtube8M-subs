00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.600
 gordonov and my channel pavel lyakh 2000 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.410
 and now i want to show you my 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.009
 the next review on 5 minifigures from 10 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.070
 Lego series of minifigures in the last issue 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.890
 I also showed 5 minifigures out of 10 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.500
 series and I showed there the same liner and 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.590
 packaging but in this series I will not 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.789
 spend time on it if you haven't watched 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.669
 the first issue look monk and now 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.100
 we will immediately start with minifigures since i 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.170
 already said i won't show the liner 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.530
 packaging not a lamin of polls for the background pack 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.320
 and so we let's start the first 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.550
 minifigure is such a girl and I do not know 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:54.260
 drops call 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:58.109
 In general, with a book book 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:03.840
 opens and here you can even put 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:10.080
 flat detail so it means she has 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:14.360
 baby that's it and actually the bar prints 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.869
 on the body on the legs one-sided face 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.420
 hairstyle behind plinths and no 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:27.240
 noteworthy prints and feet 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.409
 from the side and so well, and many think except ria 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.150
 I thought so where to put the book but 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:38.070
 Of course, also came up with so between the hands 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.689
 and then on them she will not fall 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.689
 that is, it sits firmly enough 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.299
 whoever has such a problem can 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.220
 use my way so 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.040
 the next minifigure is very cool 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.040
 which I really liked it 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.040
 paintball player 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:02.730
 so look at his face seems to me 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.170
 It does not seem to know exactly but do not tell me 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.009
 seems like a face 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:13.080
 someone criminal if you are a city ​​go 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:19.440
 gambling here we have a spot of orange so 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:22.130
 and here we have a lot of spots on our legs 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.010
 on the body 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.880
 green and also on the helmet 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:34.470
 their light green gold on such 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:39.870
 helmet with this recency 3 2 out of two parts 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:46.700
 the helmet itself which can be attached here 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:52.380
 so his hand and here is such a detail glasses 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:57.989
 for eye protection and cool detail this is 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:00.660
 us and the insignificant what is called 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:05.810
 officially if you know write to 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:11.060
 comments in general weapons from which 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:14.910
 balls shoots well then there is open 2 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.280
 so the next minifigure is like me 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.390
 I realized I did not know for certain Barbarian w 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.260
 Some of the 6 series I have a barbarian 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.459
 this is probably 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:32.580
 barbarian us any german i dont 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:35.100
 Sure can even Roman though hardly 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.750
 Well, I generally do not know exactly if you 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.609
 know and also write in comments 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:44.760
 so he has such a whole 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:47.540
 such prints on the body on the feet 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.870
 side too 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:04:03.510
 there is no such hairstyle behind and no face 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:07.079
 so angry and the same as the Roman 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:19.440
 and from series 6 someone else had such 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:23.610
 lance end with a rubber schas 3rd well 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:27.030
 Here and she is gilded in 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:31.410
 In principle, they are many elements 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.949
 hope tore of the same color and so 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.449
 the following figure is a gorgon medusa 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:39.539
 very cool minifigure which me 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.199
 I really liked here such here 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:48.810
 hair 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:51.930
 snakes as you see rubber also in her 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.210
 there are two faces which is remarkable here 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.210
 I have 10 mini figures from 10 series and 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.360
 only 1 and 1 minifigures have two faces 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.539
 so angry at 5 souls and calm but 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.520
 I angrily like more here in 6 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.710
 series 7 there on to almost like u 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.759
 each minifigure 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.990
 there were two on the face and so here is such an attack 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.520
 and body prints 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.650
 on the legs but it is not the legs it is generally stupid 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.669
 such a tail they are very long I don't know 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.300
 how will I bet 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.400
 and since all very plump from my 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.560
 there could be another minifigure then 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.240
 I have everything alongside, that is 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.539
 there will be a lot of space to occupy her 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.919
 tail but I don’t know how I’ll put it 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:44.099
 and here on the tail on this such glint 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:45.900
 and so the next figurine well I don't know 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:50.139
 how exactly do you call a trooper 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:55.110
 any of some 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:06:00.960
 and here he has such a print from Asia 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.960
 the same almost exclusively still have 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.349
 other new shade of color is present 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:12.930
 red and white 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:16.180
 Well, in general, again, my cross 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.599
 I liked the story about his hairstyle 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.870
 what the hell she is not rubber but still 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:25.919
 cool here is such a very realistic 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.840
 rich as a wig, it seems to be 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:36.370
 foot plinths no weapons 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:38.830
 a musket you rhyme so here forge a musket so 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.500
 Well, I think that's all for it 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.050
