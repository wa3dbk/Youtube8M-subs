second<00:01:24.479> player<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.869> play<00:01:25.110> with<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> had<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
second player to play with so I had to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.010 
second player to play with so I had to
just<00:01:26.280> rely<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> luck<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> cpu<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> play

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
just rely on the luck of the cpu to play

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.690 
just rely on the luck of the cpu to play
along<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.439> me<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.829> basically<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.579> what

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
along with me so basically this is what

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.370 
along with me so basically this is what
you<00:01:29.880> need<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.299> use<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> mushroom<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.259> get

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you need to do use the mushroom to get

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.020 
you need to do use the mushroom to get
big<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:31.680> rosalina<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.400> then<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.759> Yoshi

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
big as rosalina and then have Yoshi

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.420 
big as rosalina and then have Yoshi
consume<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.990> then<00:01:34.290> fall<00:01:34.979> off<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.280> edge

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
consume you and then fall off the edge

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.550 
consume you and then fall off the edge
of<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.670> stage<00:01:35.880> while<00:01:36.210> still<00:01:36.600> inside<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.409> egg

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
of the stage while still inside the egg

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.240 
of the stage while still inside the egg
and<00:01:37.860> guy

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.710 

when<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.369> respawn<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.970> will<00:01:44.090> be<00:01:44.210> normal<00:01:44.540> size

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
when you respawn you will be normal size

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.330 
when you respawn you will be normal size
but<00:01:44.750> LUMO<00:01:45.259> will<00:01:45.409> be<00:01:45.530> enlarged<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.220> the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
but LUMO will be enlarged to the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.240 
but LUMO will be enlarged to the
previous<00:01:46.880> giant<00:01:47.390> size<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:48.470> oversized<00:01:48.950> luma

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
previous giant size the oversized luma

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.130 
previous giant size the oversized luma
and<00:01:49.399> small<00:01:49.759> by<00:01:49.880> comparison<00:01:49.930> Rosaleen<00:01:50.930> has<00:01:51.110> a

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
and small by comparison Rosaleen has a

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.529 
and small by comparison Rosaleen has a
pretty<00:01:51.560> odd<00:01:51.829> combination<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:52.789> look<00:01:52.970> at<00:01:53.149> NEMA

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
pretty odd combination to look at NEMA

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.630 
pretty odd combination to look at NEMA
will<00:01:53.689> stay<00:01:53.869> big<00:01:54.200> like<00:01:54.409> this<00:01:54.619> until<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:55.130> die<00:01:55.399> or

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
will stay big like this until you die or

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.700 
will stay big like this until you die or
accidentally<00:01:56.360> derp<00:01:56.570> up<00:01:56.780> like<00:01:56.990> I<00:01:57.110> did<00:01:57.170> here<00:01:57.590> and

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
accidentally derp up like I did here and

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.350 
accidentally derp up like I did here and
take<00:01:57.890> another<00:01:58.100> mushroom<00:01:58.580> because<00:01:58.759> then<00:01:59.119> you

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
take another mushroom because then you

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.820 
take another mushroom because then you
will<00:01:59.479> both<00:01:59.630> become<00:01:59.960> big<00:02:00.200> together<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.740> then

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
will both become big together and then

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.820 
will both become big together and then
small<00:02:01.159> together<00:02:01.520> as<00:02:01.759> usual<00:02:02.420> this<00:02:03.350> one<00:02:03.590> messed

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
small together as usual this one messed

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.440 
small together as usual this one messed
me<00:02:03.979> up<00:02:04.009> pretty<00:02:04.130> bad<00:02:04.670> because<00:02:04.939> it<00:02:05.210> actually

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
me up pretty bad because it actually

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.960 
me up pretty bad because it actually
made<00:02:06.020> me<00:02:06.200> lose<00:02:06.409> a<00:02:06.439> game<00:02:06.799> feed<00:02:07.369> these<00:02:07.610> woods

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
made me lose a game feed these woods

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.559 
made me lose a game feed these woods

off by choosing a sword fighting me and

off by choosing a sword fighting me and
the<00:02:13.610> 3d<00:02:14.180> Land<00:02:14.510> stink<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.260> area<00:02:15.620> where<00:02:15.799> you

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
the 3d Land stink the area where you

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.800 
the 3d Land stink the area where you
first<00:02:16.220> begin<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:17.000> where<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.360> glitch<00:02:17.540> takes

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
first begin is where the glitch takes

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.420 
first begin is where the glitch takes
place<00:02:18.080> spots<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.860> prevent<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.400> from

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
place spots you prevent it from

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.400 
place spots you prevent it from
triggering<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.390> because<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.080> stage

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
triggering it because the stage

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.100 
triggering it because the stage
generates<00:02:22.069> platforms<00:02:22.880> where<00:02:23.299> you<00:02:23.480> start<00:02:23.870> if

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
generates platforms where you start if

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.809 
generates platforms where you start if
you<00:02:24.260> try<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.500> jump<00:02:24.769> up<00:02:24.890> like<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.160> do<00:02:25.220> here<00:02:25.549> to<00:02:25.730> do

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
you try to jump up like I do here to do

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.640 
you try to jump up like I do here to do
the<00:02:25.940> glitch<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.420> platform<00:02:27.019> will<00:02:27.140> prevents

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
the glitch the platform will prevents

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.589 
the glitch the platform will prevents
you<00:02:27.769> from<00:02:27.799> naturally<00:02:28.400> falling<00:02:28.819> down<00:02:29.030> which<00:02:29.420> is

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
you from naturally falling down which is

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.660 
you from naturally falling down which is
required<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.470> do<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.709> glitch<00:02:30.890> since<00:02:31.519> the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
required to do the glitch since the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.610 
required to do the glitch since the
level<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.090> loop<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.599> same<00:02:32.840> areas<00:02:33.260> again

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
level is a loop of the same areas again

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.140 
level is a loop of the same areas again
and<00:02:33.769> again<00:02:34.040> you'll<00:02:34.220> eventually<00:02:34.489> make<00:02:34.970> your

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
and again you'll eventually make your

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.390 
and again you'll eventually make your
way<00:02:35.299> back<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:36.140> where<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.470> started<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:37.160> those

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
way back to where you started and those

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.250 
way back to where you started and those
platforms<00:02:37.760> will<00:02:38.180> be<00:02:38.299> out<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.750> way<00:02:38.900> once

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
platforms will be out of the way once

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.839 
platforms will be out of the way once
back<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.620> initial<00:02:39.980> area<00:02:40.340> if<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.549> step

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
back in the initial area if you step

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.520 
back in the initial area if you step
into<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.150> lower<00:02:41.330> level<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.780> ground<00:02:42.019> walk

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
into the lower level of the ground walk

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.589 
into the lower level of the ground walk
into<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.860> right<00:02:43.040> corner<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.519> jump<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.120> then

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
into the right corner and jump and then

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.630 
into the right corner and jump and then
use<00:02:45.019> your<00:02:45.230> special<00:02:45.560> in<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.010> air<00:02:46.040> the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
use your special in the air the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.910 
use your special in the air the
whirlwind<00:02:47.090> one<00:02:47.329> when<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.079> come<00:02:48.440> back<00:02:48.650> down

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
whirlwind one when you come back down

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.190 
whirlwind one when you come back down
you<00:02:48.980> will<00:02:49.310> clip<00:02:49.640> through<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.030> stage<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.540> die

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
you will clip through the stage and die

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.250 
you will clip through the stage and die
come<00:02:52.160> on<00:02:52.190> ridiculous<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.480> yeah<00:02:53.780> after<00:02:54.049> this

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
come on ridiculous and yeah after this

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.110 
come on ridiculous and yeah after this
happened<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:54.739> tried<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.160> few<00:02:55.190> more<00:02:55.489> times<00:02:55.549> and

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
happened I tried it a few more times and

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.410 
happened I tried it a few more times and
it<00:02:56.410> consistently<00:02:57.410> kills<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.670> I<00:02:58.910> think<00:02:59.000> most

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
it consistently kills you I think most

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.699 
it consistently kills you I think most
people<00:02:59.690> don't<00:02:59.810> notice<00:03:00.109> this<00:03:00.200> one<00:03:00.410> because

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
people don't notice this one because

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.770 
people don't notice this one because
everything<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.400> fine<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.880> first<00:03:02.030> time<00:03:02.269> around

fastest way to get this move or any
custom<00:05:21.229> move<00:05:21.380> really<00:05:21.680> is<00:05:21.950> by<00:05:22.130> going<00:05:22.280> into

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
custom move really is by going into
