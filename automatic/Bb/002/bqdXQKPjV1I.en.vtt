00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.299 
about to you yeah so they are Kim to me
is<00:00:30.119> about<00:00:30.410> fundamentally<00:00:31.410> flipping

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
is about fundamentally flipping

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.240 
is about fundamentally flipping
education<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.149> about<00:00:33.540> putting<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.620> learner

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
education it's about putting the learner

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.330 
education it's about putting the learner
at<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.090> heart<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.630> entire<00:00:37.340> learning

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
at the heart of the entire learning

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.880 
at the heart of the entire learning
process<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:40.079> what<00:00:40.260> we're<00:00:40.410> doing<00:00:40.440> is

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
process and so what we're doing is

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.049 
process and so what we're doing is
creating<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.700> platform<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.870> brings<00:00:43.379> together

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
creating a platform that brings together

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.310 
creating a platform that brings together
some<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> best<00:00:45.480> experts<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> world

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
some of the best experts in the world

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.970 
some of the best experts in the world
and<00:00:47.360> enables<00:00:48.360> them<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.719> create<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.590> community

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and enables them to create a community

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.260 
and enables them to create a community
with<00:00:50.940> learner's<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.590> are<00:00:52.710> like-minded

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
with learner's of that are like-minded

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.970 
with learner's of that are like-minded
yeah<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> great

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
yeah and so we think this is a great

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.779 
yeah and so we think this is a great
approach<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:57.239> building<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.520> beginning<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
approach to building the beginning of a

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.170 
approach to building the beginning of a
lifelong<00:01:00.180> learning<00:01:01.010> process<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.219> we're

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
lifelong learning process and we're

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.640 
lifelong learning process and we're
getting<00:01:03.329> started<00:01:03.660> specifically<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
getting started specifically like in the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.960 
getting started specifically like in the
photography<00:01:05.280> discipline<00:01:05.640> correct<00:01:05.850> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
photography discipline correct that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.280 
photography discipline correct that
happened<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.630> what<00:01:06.810> we're<00:01:06.930> super

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
happened to be like what we're super

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.890 
happened to be like what we're super
passionate<00:01:07.500> about<00:01:07.920> 4am<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.030> we're<00:01:09.570> we're

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
passionate about 4am and so we're we're

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
passionate about 4am and so we're we're
starting<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> bunch<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.740> amazing<00:01:11.520> master

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
starting with a bunch of amazing master

starting with a bunch of amazing master
photographers<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.250> what<00:01:14.250> happens<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:15.380> the

meeting all the time so like what is

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.390 
meeting all the time so like what is
your<00:01:35.790> vision<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.840> how<00:01:37.020> how<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.799> how

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
your vision of this how how can we how

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.520 
your vision of this how how can we how
can<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:39.299> kind<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.689> reinvent<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.409> way

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
can we really kind of reinvent the way

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.020 
can we really kind of reinvent the way
that's<00:01:40.710> absolutely<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.640> think<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.880> think

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
that's absolutely so I think I think

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.280 
that's absolutely so I think I think
you're<00:01:42.119> hitting<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.810> one<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> ways

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
you're hitting on it so one of the ways

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.210 
you're hitting on it so one of the ways
we<00:01:43.649> shorthand<00:01:44.430> talk<00:01:44.939> about<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:46.009> be<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
we shorthand talk about this is be the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
we shorthand talk about this is be the
eharmony<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:48.000> matching<00:01:48.450> experts<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
eharmony of matching experts and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.469 
eharmony of matching experts and
learners<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.850> when<00:01:50.850> we<00:01:50.939> think<00:01:51.090> about<00:01:51.210> our

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
learners and when we think about our

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.060 
learners and when we think about our
business<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:52.200> use<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.619> master<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
business we use the master and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.069 
business we use the master and
apprentice<00:01:53.130> because<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:54.030> has<00:01:54.420> its<00:01:54.600> roots<00:01:54.869> in

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
apprentice because that has its roots in

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.010 
apprentice because that has its roots in
the<00:01:55.200> arts<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.640> artists<00:01:57.180> from<00:01:57.540> ancient

the arts and with artists from ancient

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.310 
the arts and with artists from ancient
times<00:01:58.409> right<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.540> at<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> heart<00:02:00.930> of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
times right and so but at the heart of

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.010 
times right and so but at the heart of
this<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.860> idea<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.280> coaching<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.020> this

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020

this is this idea of coaching and this
is<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> insight<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:06.240> coaches

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
is the insight of it so with coaches

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:10.490 
is the insight of it so with coaches
coaches<00:02:08.129> do<00:02:08.429> three<00:02:08.849> super<00:02:09.390> important<00:02:09.840> things

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
coaches do three super important things

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.640 
coaches do three super important things
number<00:02:11.280> one<00:02:11.490> we<00:02:11.970> all<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.420> blind<00:02:12.870> spots<00:02:12.990> these

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
number one we all have blind spots these

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.830 
number one we all have blind spots these
are<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> these<00:02:14.160> are<00:02:14.790> by<00:02:15.120> definition<00:02:15.180> things

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
are the these are by definition things

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.920 
are the these are by definition things
we<00:02:16.050> don't<00:02:16.230> know<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:17.160> are<00:02:17.250> holding<00:02:17.430> us<00:02:17.670> back

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
we don't know that are holding us back

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.420 
we don't know that are holding us back
these<00:02:18.930> are<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.170> obstacles<00:02:19.590> keeping<00:02:20.190> us<00:02:20.310> from

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
these are the obstacles keeping us from

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.150 
these are the obstacles keeping us from
leveling<00:02:20.850> up<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.900> number<00:02:22.170> one<00:02:22.350> coaches<00:02:22.860> help

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
leveling up so number one coaches help

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.310 
leveling up so number one coaches help
us<00:02:23.400> identify<00:02:23.640> those<00:02:24.180> blind<00:02:24.510> spots<00:02:24.600> okay

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
us identify those blind spots okay

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.640 
us identify those blind spots okay
number<00:02:26.220> two<00:02:26.870> coaches<00:02:27.870> then<00:02:28.080> create

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
number two coaches then create

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.990 
number two coaches then create
challenges<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:30.600> help<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.020> develop<00:02:31.320> skills<00:02:32.000> to

challenges to help you develop skills to

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000 
challenges to help you develop skills to
overcome<00:02:33.030> those<00:02:33.810> obstacles<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.620> number

overcome those obstacles and number

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.970 
overcome those obstacles and number
three<00:02:35.390> it's<00:02:36.390> about<00:02:36.570> inspiration<00:02:37.350> and

three it's about inspiration and

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.720 
three it's about inspiration and
encouragement<00:02:38.600> coaches<00:02:39.600> model<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.410> behavior

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
encouragement coaches model the behavior

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.420 
encouragement coaches model the behavior
that<00:02:41.870> they<00:02:42.870> need<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.470> have<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.950> order<00:02:44.070> for

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
that they need you to have in order for

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.130 
that they need you to have in order for

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
you to overcome these obstacles right so

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.720 
you to overcome these obstacles right so
we<00:02:49.140> really<00:02:49.320> we<00:02:49.860> feel<00:02:50.070> like<00:02:50.190> we<00:02:50.340> understand<00:02:50.640> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
we really we feel like we understand the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.000 
we really we feel like we understand the
motivations<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.390> learners<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.050> coaches<00:02:52.560> and

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
motivations of learners and coaches and

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.260 
motivations of learners and coaches and
I<00:02:53.040> think<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.280> big<00:02:53.430> problem<00:02:53.580> in<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.910> world<00:02:54.090> is

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
I think the big problem in the world is

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.090 
I think the big problem in the world is
there's<00:02:54.450> never<00:02:54.630> been<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.840> good<00:02:55.050> way<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.200> bring

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
there's never been a good way to bring

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.949 
there's never been a good way to bring
them<00:02:56.250> together<00:02:56.370> right<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.330> been<00:02:57.540> very

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
them together right it's been very

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.360 
them together right it's been very
inefficient<00:02:58.560> system<00:02:58.709> for<00:02:59.040> these<00:02:59.160> people

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
inefficient system for these people

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.220 
inefficient system for these people
correct<00:02:59.580> meet<00:02:59.760> each<00:03:00.000> other<00:03:00.239> right<00:03:00.840> now<00:03:00.870> like

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
correct meet each other right now like

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.080 
correct meet each other right now like
we<00:03:01.350> happen<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.650> be<00:03:01.709> here<00:03:01.980> with<00:03:02.160> Fred<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.459> we're

we're having a workshop this is actually

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.810 
we're having a workshop this is actually
a<00:03:09.780> very<00:03:09.870> inefficient<00:03:10.530> way<00:03:10.709> right<00:03:11.280> for<00:03:11.520> like

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
a very inefficient way right for like

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.790 
a very inefficient way right for like
coaches<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.540> learners<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.050> get<00:03:13.200> together<00:03:13.320> so

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
coaches and learners to get together so

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.140 
coaches and learners to get together so
right<00:03:13.980> we<00:03:14.190> think<00:03:14.370> we<00:03:14.459> have<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.580> better<00:03:14.730> system

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
right we think we have a better system

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.880 
right we think we have a better system
and<00:03:15.390> yep<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.930> talk<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.110> little<00:03:16.290> bit<00:03:16.440> about<00:03:16.680> the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
and yep to talk a little bit about the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.250 
and yep to talk a little bit about the
way<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.070> master<00:03:17.850> goes<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.269> actually<00:03:18.690> hand

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
way a master goes in actually hand

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.650 
way a master goes in actually hand

and<00:04:04.290> so<00:04:04.829> forth<00:04:05.100> but<00:04:05.489> what's<00:04:06.060> really<00:04:06.269> powerful

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
and so forth but what's really powerful

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.750 
and so forth but what's really powerful
is<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:08.220> every<00:04:09.180> master<00:04:09.739> has<00:04:10.739> their<00:04:11.730> own

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
is that every master has their own

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.870 
is that every master has their own
culture<00:04:12.420> their<00:04:12.630> own<00:04:12.810> way<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:13.850> setting<00:04:14.850> the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
culture their own way of setting the

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.310 
culture their own way of setting the
environment<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.720> conditions<00:04:16.229> for

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
environment and the conditions for

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.199 
environment and the conditions for
learning<00:04:16.590> right<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.370> so<00:04:17.669> what<00:04:17.790> we're<00:04:17.880> able<00:04:18.060> to

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
learning right and so what we're able to

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:18.860 
learning right and so what we're able to
do<00:04:18.390> is

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
do is

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.830 
do is
of<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.500> Masters<00:04:19.979> these<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.940> search<00:04:21.150> tool<00:04:21.449> for

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
of the Masters these the search tool for

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.000 
of the Masters these the search tool for
them<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.109> handpick<00:04:24.080> 11<00:04:25.080> apprentice<00:04:25.560> one

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
them to handpick 11 apprentice one

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.580 
them to handpick 11 apprentice one
learner<00:04:26.250> at<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.520> time<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.150> by<00:04:27.630> doing<00:04:27.810> so<00:04:27.900> create

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
learner at a time and by doing so create

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.120 
learner at a time and by doing so create
this<00:04:28.860> perfect<00:04:29.190> pool<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.620> of<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.800> community

this perfect pool of of a community

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.159 
this perfect pool of of a community
right<00:04:32.699> literally<00:04:33.030> like<00:04:33.360> adding<00:04:33.780> building

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
right literally like adding building

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.870 
right literally like adding building
block<00:04:34.350> by<00:04:34.530> building<00:04:34.889> block<00:04:35.100> I've<00:04:35.520> seen<00:04:35.820> people

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
block by building block I've seen people

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.840 
block by building block I've seen people
like<00:04:36.210> Karen<00:04:36.479> Hutton<00:04:37.310> specifically<00:04:38.310> target

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
like Karen Hutton specifically target

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.140 
like Karen Hutton specifically target
certain<00:04:39.660> skills<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.590> balance<00:04:41.130> out<00:04:41.610> the

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
certain skills to balance out the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.050 
certain skills to balance out the
mixture<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:43.139> talents<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.010> backgrounds<00:04:44.880> and

mixture of talents and backgrounds and

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.900 
mixture of talents and backgrounds and
perspectives<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:46.530> get<00:04:46.710> a<00:04:46.740> very<00:04:47.100> dynamic<00:04:47.400> and

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
perspectives to get a very dynamic and

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.659 
perspectives to get a very dynamic and
rich<00:04:48.270> community<00:04:48.840> within<00:04:49.139> her<00:04:49.530> cohort<00:04:50.070> we

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
rich community within her cohort we

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.900 
rich community within her cohort we
think<00:04:50.880> this<00:04:50.970> is<00:04:51.150> an<00:04:51.270> extremely<00:04:51.870> powerful

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
think this is an extremely powerful

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.120 
think this is an extremely powerful
method<00:04:53.910> to<00:04:54.360> bring<00:04:54.570> together<00:04:55.070> apprentices<00:04:56.070> and

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
method to bring together apprentices and

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.310 
method to bring together apprentices and
masters<00:04:56.610> learners<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.180> experts<00:04:57.840> coaches

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
masters learners and experts coaches

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.900 
masters learners and experts coaches
yeah<00:04:58.770> we've<00:04:59.039> been<00:04:59.070> we've<00:04:59.520> been<00:04:59.550> seeing<00:04:59.789> all

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
this stuff we're still very early beta

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.219 
this stuff we're still very early beta
we're<00:05:01.710> testing<00:05:02.070> all<00:05:02.190> this<00:05:02.310> kind<00:05:02.520> of<00:05:02.550> stuff<00:05:02.610> and

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
we're testing all this kind of stuff and

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.960 
we're testing all this kind of stuff and
we<00:05:04.229> expect<00:05:04.889> certain<00:05:05.160> organic<00:05:05.490> things<00:05:05.820> to

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
we expect certain organic things to

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.490 
we expect certain organic things to
happen<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:06.419> they're<00:05:06.510> actually<00:05:06.660> happening

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
like this so these people that Karen

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.210 
like this so these people that Karen
Hutton<00:05:09.600> hand-picked<00:05:10.139> they<00:05:10.680> come<00:05:10.889> in<00:05:11.039> with<00:05:11.190> a

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
Hutton hand-picked they come in with a

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.210 
Hutton hand-picked they come in with a
certain<00:05:11.550> culture<00:05:11.910> already<00:05:12.510> right<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.350> so<00:05:13.830> a

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
certain culture already right and so a

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.610 
certain culture already right and so a
lot<00:05:14.699> of<00:05:14.760> the<00:05:14.970> learning<00:05:15.180> inside<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:16.229> u.s.<00:05:16.440> tree

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
lot of the learning inside the u.s. tree

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.680 
lot of the learning inside the u.s. tree
cohort<00:05:16.979> happens<00:05:17.400> amongst<00:05:17.820> apprentices<00:05:18.479> and

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
cohort happens amongst apprentices and

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.469 
cohort happens amongst apprentices and
so<00:05:19.350> that<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:19.889> the<00:05:20.400> master<00:05:20.760> is<00:05:20.789> there<00:05:21.060> all<00:05:21.389> the

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
so that the the master is there all the

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:22.580 
so that the the master is there all the
time<00:05:21.510> you'd<00:05:21.840> like<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.050> say<00:05:22.169> they're<00:05:22.289> not<00:05:22.410> like
