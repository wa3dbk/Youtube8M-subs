00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.150 
offensive seriously well well why do you
think<00:04:10.610> that<00:04:10.780> well<00:04:11.780> now<00:04:12.110> that<00:04:12.320> a<00:04:12.440> squad<00:04:12.740> is<00:04:12.920> here

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
think that well now that a squad is here

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.830 
think that well now that a squad is here
I<00:04:13.190> was<00:04:13.400> thinking<00:04:13.700> they<00:04:13.910> could<00:04:13.970> launch<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.600> solo

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
I was thinking they could launch a solo

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.110 
I was thinking they could launch a solo
attack<00:04:15.410> on<00:04:15.710> the<00:04:15.920> base<00:04:16.070> sir<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:16.640> we<00:04:16.790> would<00:04:16.910> stay

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
attack on the base sir and we would stay

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.039 
attack on the base sir and we would stay
it's<00:04:17.950> possible<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:19.519> could<00:04:20.030> work<00:04:20.269> but<00:04:20.900> the

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
it's possible it could work but the

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.540 
it's possible it could work but the
danger<00:04:21.410> is<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.680> enemy<00:04:21.920> launches<00:04:22.280> an<00:04:22.400> all-out

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
danger is the enemy launches an all-out

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.880 
danger is the enemy launches an all-out
attack<00:04:23.030> on<00:04:23.210> us<00:04:23.480> and<00:04:23.840> we<00:04:23.990> can't<00:04:24.200> defend<00:04:24.470> them<00:04:24.680> I

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
attack on us and we can't defend them I

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.610 
attack on us and we can't defend them I
think<00:04:25.370> it'll<00:04:25.490> work<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:26.030> I'm<00:04:27.020> willing<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.410> do

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
think it'll work and I'm willing to do

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.010 
think it'll work and I'm willing to do
it<00:04:27.800> as<00:04:27.920> is<00:04:28.220> my<00:04:28.370> squad<00:04:28.610> well<00:04:29.150> then<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.690> guess<00:04:29.840> it's

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
it as is my squad well then I guess it's

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.760 
it as is my squad well then I guess it's
worth<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.260> shot

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
worth a shot
