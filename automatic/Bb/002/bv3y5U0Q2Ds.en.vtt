hair a little bit I've gone darker and

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.650 
hair a little bit I've gone darker and
I've<00:00:15.660> also<00:00:15.839> got<00:00:15.990> new<00:00:16.410> extensions<00:00:16.980> put<00:00:17.220> in

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
I've also got new extensions put in

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.450 
I've also got new extensions put in
before<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.900> was<00:00:19.020> using<00:00:19.320> just<00:00:19.680> really<00:00:19.980> long<00:00:20.189> clip

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
before I was using just really long clip

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.980 
before I was using just really long clip
in<00:00:20.580> extensions<00:00:21.060> but<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.570> were<00:00:21.720> kind<00:00:21.930> of

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
in extensions but I were kind of

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.810 
in extensions but I were kind of
damaging<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.619> they<00:00:22.710> were<00:00:22.800> also<00:00:22.980> fake<00:00:23.400> hair<00:00:23.640> so

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
damaging and they were also fake hair so

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.759 
damaging and they were also fake hair so
it<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:24.000> really<00:00:24.180> difficult<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.660> style<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.740> I

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
it was really difficult to style but I

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.050 
it was really difficult to style but I
went<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> more<00:00:26.400> natural<00:00:26.580> look<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:26.970> this

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
went for the more natural look at this

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.550 
went for the more natural look at this
time<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.480> they're<00:00:27.599> actually<00:00:27.750> permanent<00:00:28.439> as

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
time and they're actually permanent as

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.220 
time and they're actually permanent as
well<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:28.980> they<00:00:29.130> added<00:00:29.519> into<00:00:29.849> my<00:00:29.970> hair<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.420> just

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
well so they added into my hair I just

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.749 
well so they added into my hair I just
really<00:00:31.439> wanted<00:00:31.710> some<00:00:31.949> thickness<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.700> volume

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
really wanted some thickness and volume

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.850 
really wanted some thickness and volume
because<00:00:33.390> my<00:00:33.600> hair<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:33.899> its<00:00:34.020> own<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.380> quite<00:00:34.590> thin

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
because my hair on its own is quite thin

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.799 
because my hair on its own is quite thin
and<00:00:35.190> flat<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:36.090> overall<00:00:36.360> I'm<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:36.600> happy

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
and flat but overall I'm really happy

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.600 
and flat but overall I'm really happy
with<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.920> thought<00:00:38.190> would<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> great

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
because it doesn't contain ingredients

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.390 
because it doesn't contain ingredients
which<00:01:03.840> are<00:01:03.960> damaging<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.619> my<00:01:04.739> extensions<00:01:05.189> and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:28.530 
it also has UVA and UVB filters which is
perfect<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> summertime

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.090 

so<00:01:29.540> now<00:01:29.630> on<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.170> actual<00:01:30.530> review<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:30.980> the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
so now on to the actual review of the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.460 
so now on to the actual review of the
straightener<00:01:31.430> itself<00:01:31.760> you<00:01:32.120> buy<00:01:32.330> it<00:01:32.390> in<00:01:32.720> a<00:01:33.050> set

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
straightener itself you buy it in a set

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.990 
straightener itself you buy it in a set
which<00:01:33.710> costs<00:01:34.070> two<00:01:34.190> hundred<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.580> eighty<00:01:34.760> nine

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
which costs two hundred and eighty nine

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.370 
which costs two hundred and eighty nine
dollars<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:35.540> it<00:01:35.900> comes<00:01:36.080> with<00:01:36.260> the

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
dollars so it comes with the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.770 
dollars so it comes with the
straightener<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:36.890> a<00:01:37.280> large<00:01:37.700> barrel<00:01:38.150> brush<00:01:38.480> I

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
straightener and a large barrel brush I

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.270 
straightener and a large barrel brush I
don't<00:01:39.200> use<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.560> barrel<00:01:39.740> brush<00:01:39.920> because<00:01:40.250> I

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
don't use the barrel brush because I

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.100 
don't use the barrel brush because I
have<00:01:40.490> one<00:01:40.700> specifically<00:01:41.270> for<00:01:41.570> my<00:01:41.660> extensions

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
have one specifically for my extensions

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.430 
have one specifically for my extensions
but<00:01:42.650> it's<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:42.860> good<00:01:43.070> decent<00:01:43.640> size<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.540> the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
but it's a good decent size and the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.290 
but it's a good decent size and the
straightener<00:01:45.860> itself<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.790> reason<00:01:47.000> it's<00:01:47.120> the

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
straightener itself the reason it's the

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.870 
the National Breast Cancer Foundation
onto<00:02:09.619> reviewing<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.220> straightener<00:02:10.550> itself

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
onto reviewing the straightener itself

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.729 
onto reviewing the straightener itself
as<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.180> saw<00:02:11.480> on<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.690> demo<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:12.200> think<00:02:12.380> it<00:02:12.530> does<00:02:12.709> a

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
as you saw on the demo I think it does a

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.190 
as you saw on the demo I think it does a
pretty<00:02:13.100> good<00:02:13.190> job<00:02:13.370> with<00:02:14.330> my<00:02:14.450> extensions<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:15.050> I

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
pretty good job with my extensions in I

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.900 
pretty good job with my extensions in I
have<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.470> lot<00:02:15.709> of<00:02:15.739> hair<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.220> it's<00:02:16.370> very<00:02:16.580> thick

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
have a lot of hair and it's very thick

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.570 
have a lot of hair and it's very thick
so<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.660> do<00:02:17.840> still<00:02:18.410> have<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.560> couple<00:02:18.830> waves<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.489> my

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
so I do still have a couple waves to my

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.120 
so I do still have a couple waves to my
hair<00:02:20.200> but<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.230> still<00:02:21.590> think<00:02:21.800> it<00:02:21.890> does<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.070> pretty

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
hair but I still think it does a pretty

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.160 
hair but I still think it does a pretty
good<00:02:22.280> job<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.790> did<00:02:23.209> struggle<00:02:23.480> with<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:23.930> half

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
good job I did struggle with this half

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.080 
good job I did struggle with this half
because<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.590> was<00:02:24.860> actually<00:02:25.250> practicing<00:02:25.489> and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
because I was actually practicing and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.240 
because I was actually practicing and
curling<00:02:26.690> my<00:02:26.810> hair<00:02:26.840> before<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.470> started<00:02:27.860> the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
curling my hair before I started the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.710 
curling my hair before I started the
demo<00:02:28.459> I<00:02:28.549> was<00:02:28.730> just<00:02:28.880> probably<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.330> stupid<00:02:29.660> idea

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
demo I was just probably a stupid idea

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.539 
demo I was just probably a stupid idea
because<00:02:30.019> I<00:02:30.200> couldn't<00:02:30.590> get<00:02:30.769> out<00:02:30.950> all<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.310> kinks

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
because I couldn't get out all the kinks

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.210 
because I couldn't get out all the kinks
but<00:02:32.299> I<00:02:32.690> would<00:02:33.080> give<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.560> seven<00:02:33.980> out<00:02:34.100> of<00:02:34.130> ten

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
but I would give it a seven out of ten

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.920 
but I would give it a seven out of ten
for<00:02:34.519> straightening<00:02:34.970> I've<00:02:35.239> never<00:02:35.690> actually

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
for straightening I've never actually

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.860 
for straightening I've never actually
tried<00:02:36.230> any<00:02:36.530> other<00:02:36.760> GHD<00:02:37.760> or<00:02:38.060> expensive<00:02:38.540> branded

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
tried any other GHD or expensive branded

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.660 
tried any other GHD or expensive branded
hairstylist<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.739> can't<00:02:40.010> really<00:02:40.190> compare<00:02:40.610> it

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
hairstylist so I can't really compare it

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.550 
hairstylist so I can't really compare it
but<00:02:41.120> overall<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:41.959> was<00:02:42.140> pleased<00:02:42.410> with<00:02:42.500> the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
but overall I was pleased with the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.020 
but overall I was pleased with the
results<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.250> design<00:02:43.519> is<00:02:43.670> really<00:02:43.790> nice

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
results so the design is really nice

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.550
