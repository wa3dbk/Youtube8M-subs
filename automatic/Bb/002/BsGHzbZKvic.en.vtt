00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
them and I noticed in one of the

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.409 
them and I noticed in one of the
semesters<00:00:21.050> a<00:00:21.339> fairly<00:00:22.339> large<00:00:22.820> group<00:00:23.150> maybe

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419

they had that sort of bored look on
their<00:00:29.539> face<00:00:29.839> that's<00:00:30.380> when<00:00:30.619> professor<00:00:31.099> Jay

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
their face that's when professor Jay

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.370 
their face that's when professor Jay
Newell<00:00:31.730> knew<00:00:32.090> he<00:00:32.419> had<00:00:32.630> to<00:00:32.810> make<00:00:32.960> some<00:00:33.170> changes

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
a decent amount of English skills but

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.300 
a decent amount of English skills but
maybe<00:00:56.870> not<00:00:57.110> as<00:00:57.290> much<00:00:57.320> preparation<00:00:57.770> as<00:00:58.160> they

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
maybe not as much preparation as they

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.220 
maybe not as much preparation as they
would<00:00:58.460> need<00:00:58.670> to<00:00:59.210> get<00:00:59.540> through<00:00:59.960> a<00:00:59.990> whole

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
would need to get through a whole

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.319 
would need to get through a whole
lecture<00:01:00.710> or<00:01:01.130> certainly<00:01:01.460> get<00:01:01.640> through<00:01:01.940> a

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
lecture or certainly get through a

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.109 
lecture or certainly get through a
conversation<00:01:03.369> so<00:01:04.369> what<00:01:04.519> we're<00:01:04.670> really<00:01:04.699> doing

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
conversation so what we're really doing

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.570 
conversation so what we're really doing
here<00:01:05.570> is<00:01:05.780> creating<00:01:06.590> an<00:01:06.680> environment<00:01:06.980> where

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
here is creating an environment where

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.210 
here is creating an environment where
people<00:01:07.670> feel<00:01:08.480> safe<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:09.200> be<00:01:09.409> talking<00:01:09.920> in

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
people feel safe to be talking in

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.270 
people feel safe to be talking in

whatever language bringing their ideas
into<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.940> classroom<00:01:14.540> so<00:01:15.020> we<00:01:15.170> started

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
into the classroom so we started

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.680 
into the classroom so we started
brainstorming<00:01:15.760> let's<00:01:16.760> put<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.150> slides<00:01:17.390> into

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
brainstorming let's put the slides into

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.140 
brainstorming let's put the slides into
multiple<00:01:18.170> languages<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:19.010> with<00:01:19.280> some<00:01:19.550> help<00:01:19.580> we

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150

thought<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.090> stuff<00:02:17.360> worked<00:02:17.690> very<00:02:17.930> well

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
thought that this stuff worked very well

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.559 
thought that this stuff worked very well
for<00:02:18.170> them<00:02:18.530> too<00:02:18.770> because<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.400> modeled<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:20.090> way<00:02:20.270> of

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
for them too because it modeled a way of

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.570 
for them too because it modeled a way of
dealing<00:02:20.840> with<00:02:21.230> advertising<00:02:22.220> and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
dealing with advertising and

they<00:02:25.970> saw<00:02:26.270> that<00:02:26.750> they<00:02:27.260> could<00:02:27.500> handle<00:02:27.980> looking

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
they saw that they could handle looking

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.600 
they saw that they could handle looking
at<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:28.970> language<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.450> they<00:02:29.780> didn't<00:02:30.080> speak

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
at a language that they didn't speak

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.370 
at a language that they didn't speak
understand<00:02:31.610> how<00:02:31.880> was<00:02:32.180> being<00:02:32.480> used<00:02:32.720> we<00:02:33.110> didn't

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
understand how was being used we didn't

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.470
