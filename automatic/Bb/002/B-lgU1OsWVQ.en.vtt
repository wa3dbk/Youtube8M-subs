00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:25.320
 Grooving is one of the important machining methods 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:29.820
 Improvement of machining efficiency Period is always required to reduce machining costs 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:37.610
 So Down but Roy adopted the 8 corner Sion Eater 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.610
 We propose action cutting groove processing and reduction of processing cost by tetra cut 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.239
 me 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:50.370
 Petra Cut has such a unique insert shape 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:53.730
 Economical grooving tool that enables use of corner degree 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.420
 This Ether and its own pocket shape 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:03.530
 Petra cut clamp No. resistance is very high 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:09.500
 Enables stable machining at higher conditions than conventional grooving tools 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:17.650
 This pocket has become a shape to protect the tide corner and drinking Come d further 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:23.620
 Because of this it is very economical to be able to use all four corners after d 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:26.260
 Selfish main type insert can be attached to either left or right folder 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:32.440
 It also contributes to the reduction of items 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:38.400
 In addition , even with a small war criminal, it is possible to operate the clamp screw from the back of the holder degree 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.400
 It is possible exchange of the insert remains placed on the tool rest of the tool 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:53.130
 The fedora cut has a groove width of 0.5 mm 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:59.399
 Corresponds to 3.18 mm and can process groove depth up to 6.4 mm 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:01.490
 Also bought as it is also set with the Moon Ether, so it is effective in reducing the needles of the instructors 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.740
 To do 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:10.340
 Petra Wins The Eater has a 3D breaker designed in Western style 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:18.610
 In this Therefore, a wide variety of workpiece 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:18.610
 We show stable chip processing performance by cut-off crossfeed processing in Mizoi 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:31.500
 In this way Tecla cut Grooving sheep meat of selfish teeth outside 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:33.030
 A wide range from r-type which is suitable for buying a refreshing angle and is suitable for the moon and copying processing 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:40.349
 Align items 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.110
 Stable grooving from That's waves cast iron in all the work material such as stainless steel or titanium alloy 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.800
 In 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.800
