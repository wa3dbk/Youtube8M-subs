94 there was like a 70s American strap

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.670 
94 there was like a 70s American strap
and<00:02:23.270> they<00:02:23.780> were<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:24.050> cased<00:02:24.320> up<00:02:24.500> in<00:02:24.620> the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
and they were just cased up in the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.930 
and they were just cased up in the
garage<00:02:24.830> because<00:02:25.190> he<00:02:25.280> stopped<00:02:25.520> playing<00:02:25.730> at

so I picked that up instead and I

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.230 
so I picked that up instead and I
plugged<00:02:30.290> up<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.710> plugged<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.430> through<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.760> GP

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
plugged up I plugged that through a GP

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.080

McCoy<00:02:53.030> speaker<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.740> was<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.220> worst

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
McCoy speaker so it was this the worst

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.820 
McCoy speaker so it was this the worst
sounding<00:02:56.270> thing<00:02:56.510> but<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.500> didn't<00:02:57.740> matter

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
sounding thing but it didn't matter

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.110 
sounding thing but it didn't matter
because<00:02:57.980> at<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.220> time<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.459> was<00:02:58.700> just<00:02:58.850> playing

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
because at the time I was just playing

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.850 
because at the time I was just playing
you<00:02:59.420> know<00:02:59.540> leg<00:02:59.840> was<00:03:00.020> ruined<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:00.590> I'm<00:03:00.680> now

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
you know leg was ruined so I'm now

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.449 
you know leg was ruined so I'm now
learning<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:01.520> started<00:03:02.120> on<00:03:02.209> Metallica<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.709> they

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
learning I started on Metallica and they

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.949 
learning I started on Metallica and they
got<00:03:04.640> going<00:03:04.880> with<00:03:05.000> that<00:03:05.150> but<00:03:05.330> I<00:03:05.390> think<00:03:05.660> if<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.870> had

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
got going with that but I think if I had

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.199 
got going with that but I think if I had
the<00:03:06.050> started<00:03:06.350> drums<00:03:06.650> first<00:03:06.980> all<00:03:07.459> had<00:03:07.880> my<00:03:08.030> dad

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
the started drums first all had my dad

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.580 
the started drums first all had my dad
telling<00:03:08.480> me<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.720> listen<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.080> different<00:03:09.200> bits

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
telling me to listen to different bits

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.500 
telling me to listen to different bits
of<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.770> instrumentation<00:03:10.340> as<00:03:10.820> a<00:03:10.850> child<00:03:11.180> I

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
of the instrumentation as a child I

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.510 
of the instrumentation as a child I
probably<00:03:12.260> wouldn't<00:03:12.709> have<00:03:12.770> caught<00:03:13.130> on<00:03:13.310> so

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
probably wouldn't have caught on so

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.430 
probably wouldn't have caught on so
quick<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.180> very<00:03:14.390> quick<00:03:14.660> learning<00:03:14.930> process

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
quick it's a very quick learning process

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.010 
quick it's a very quick learning process
with<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.770> guitar<00:03:16.040> kind<00:03:16.790> of<00:03:16.910> caught<00:03:17.300> on<00:03:17.330> and

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
with the guitar kind of caught on and

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.630 
with the guitar kind of caught on and
after<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.380> few<00:03:18.590> months<00:03:18.770> I've<00:03:19.130> kind<00:03:19.400> of<00:03:19.430> got<00:03:19.610> a

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
after a few months I've kind of got a

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.060 
after a few months I've kind of got a
few<00:03:19.850> Metallica<00:03:20.300> songs<00:03:21.080> down<00:03:21.320> not<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.709> solos

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
few Metallica songs down not the solos

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.710 
few Metallica songs down not the solos
at<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.310> point<00:03:22.550> but<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.270> built<00:03:23.450> up<00:03:23.510> and

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
at that point but and it built up and

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.580 
at that point but and it built up and
built<00:03:23.750> up<00:03:23.900> over<00:03:24.020> time<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:27.110> mean<00:03:27.170> I

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
built up over time and but I mean I

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.260 
built up over time and but I mean I
think<00:03:27.830> by<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.280> way<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.489> learned<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:28.910> think<00:03:29.150> is

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
think by the way I learned I think is

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.330 
think by the way I learned I think is
probably

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
probably

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.760 
probably
the<00:03:30.730> best<00:03:30.940> way<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.150> go<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:32.140> don't<00:03:32.350> have<00:03:32.530> table
