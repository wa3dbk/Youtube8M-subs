so<00:00:11.280> every<00:00:11.820> now<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.059> then<00:00:12.769> the<00:00:13.769> Norseman<00:00:14.280> which

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
so every now and then the Norseman which

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.640 
so every now and then the Norseman which
is<00:00:14.789> normally<00:00:15.209> incredibly<00:00:15.839> buttery<00:00:16.259> smooth

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
is normally incredibly buttery smooth

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.109 
is normally incredibly buttery smooth
will<00:00:17.490> do<00:00:17.610> this<00:00:22.130> I'm<00:00:23.130> sure<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.820> hear<00:00:23.939> that

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
will do this I'm sure you can hear that

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.429 
will do this I'm sure you can hear that
sound<00:00:25.910> I'm<00:00:26.910> still<00:00:27.150> not<00:00:27.269> exactly<00:00:27.420> sure<00:00:27.869> why<00:00:28.380> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
sound I'm still not exactly sure why it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.919 
sound I'm still not exactly sure why it
does<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:29.880> know<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.179> one<00:00:30.599> little

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
does that but I do know that one little

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.080 
does that but I do know that one little
drop<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.199> lubrication<00:00:32.160> fixes<00:00:32.730> it

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
drop of lubrication fixes it

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.770 
drop of lubrication fixes it
for<00:00:33.839> a<00:00:33.870> long<00:00:34.290> time<00:00:34.320> weeks<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:34.980> months<00:00:35.250> even<00:00:35.780> but

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
for a long time weeks or months even but

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.910 
for a long time weeks or months even but
it<00:00:36.870> does<00:00:36.989> seem<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.260> happen<00:00:37.410> every<00:00:37.680> now<00:00:37.800> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
it does seem to happen every now and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.860 
it does seem to happen every now and
then<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.250> can't<00:00:39.000> remember<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.360> knife<00:00:39.570> doing

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
then I can't remember this knife doing

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.710 
then I can't remember this knife doing
it<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.229> at<00:00:40.440> least<00:00:40.470> a<00:00:40.949> few<00:00:40.979> weeks<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.670> may<00:00:42.510> use<00:00:42.690> it

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
it for at least a few weeks I may use it

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.039 
it for at least a few weeks I may use it
and<00:00:42.989> carry<00:00:43.229> it<00:00:43.379> every<00:00:43.710> single<00:00:43.920> day<00:00:44.159> but<00:00:45.019> yeah<00:00:46.019> I

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:46.049 
and carry it every single day but yeah I

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:48.530 
and carry it every single day but yeah I
like<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.680> think<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.250> track<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.479> the

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
like to think that the track and the

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.850 
like to think that the track and the
hold<00:00:48.690> detent<00:00:49.049> ball<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.350> everything<00:00:49.559> just

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
hold detent ball and everything just

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.740 
hold detent ball and everything just
gets<00:00:50.040> dried<00:00:50.339> out<00:00:50.519> this<00:00:51.000> even<00:00:51.269> has<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> ceramic

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
gets dried out this even has a ceramic

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.079 
gets dried out this even has a ceramic
detent<00:00:52.290> ball<00:00:52.350> which<00:00:52.680> now<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:53.610> knives<00:00:53.820> do

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
detent ball which now all my knives do

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.160 
detent ball which now all my knives do
but<00:00:54.330> it<00:00:54.750> still<00:00:54.989> doesn't<00:00:55.170> ever<00:00:55.409> know<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.650> then

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
but it still doesn't ever know and then

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.350 
but it still doesn't ever know and then
quick<00:00:58.170> little<00:00:58.470> drop<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.339> use<00:00:59.549> a<00:00:59.580> tough<00:01:00.119> glide

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
quick little drop of I use a tough glide

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.979 
quick little drop of I use a tough glide
and<00:01:00.900> it'll<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.650> good<00:01:02.519> as<00:01:02.549> new<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.720> right<00:01:03.869> now

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and it'll be good as new so right now

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.570 
and it'll be good as new so right now
it's<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.260> bad<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:05.159> won't<00:01:05.339> even<00:01:05.610> flip<00:01:05.939> open<00:01:07.580> of

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
it's so bad it won't even flip open of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.950 
it's so bad it won't even flip open of
course<00:01:08.790> every<00:01:09.000> time<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.240> happens<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.630> make<00:01:09.810> it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
course every time it happens I make it

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.109 
course every time it happens I make it
worse<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.470> purpose<00:01:10.920> by<00:01:11.159> pinching<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.820> lock

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
worse on purpose by pinching the lock

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.770 
worse on purpose by pinching the lock
bar<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:13.049> scraping<00:01:13.829> it<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.450> just<00:01:15.450> letting<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
bar and scraping it in just letting the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.740 
bar and scraping it in just letting the
two<00:01:15.960> surfaces<00:01:16.500> grind<00:01:16.859> and<00:01:17.130> wear<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> together

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
two surfaces grind and wear it together

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.330 
two surfaces grind and wear it together
so<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> perfect<00:01:19.619> arc<00:01:19.859> to<00:01:20.130> slide

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
so that they have a perfect arc to slide

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.310 
so that they have a perfect arc to slide
on<00:01:20.520> each<00:01:20.670> other<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.719> then<00:01:22.049> once<00:01:22.200> you

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
on each other and then once you

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.810 
on each other and then once you
lubricate<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.039> maybe<00:01:23.189> clean<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.579> up<00:01:23.700> if

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
lubricate it and maybe clean it up if

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.349 
lubricate it and maybe clean it up if
you<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.299> q-tip<00:01:25.020> or<00:01:25.170> whatever<00:01:26.179> then<00:01:27.179> it's

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
you have to q-tip or whatever then it's

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.899 
you have to q-tip or whatever then it's
even<00:01:27.539> smoother<00:01:27.990> than<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.259> was<00:01:28.380> before<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.039> it's

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
even smoother than it was before so it's

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.649 
even smoother than it was before so it's
a<00:01:29.969> good<00:01:30.119> thing<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.240> stuff<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.600> I

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
a good thing so this is the stuff that I

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.370 
a good thing so this is the stuff that I
use<00:01:33.869> tough<00:01:34.409> glide<00:01:34.679> from<00:01:34.950> Sentry<00:01:35.399> solutions

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
use tough glide from Sentry solutions

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.300

Norseman because it's really really good
stuff<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.170> dry<00:01:55.439> lubrication<00:01:55.920> which<00:01:56.850> means

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
stuff it's a dry lubrication which means

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.120 
stuff it's a dry lubrication which means
the<00:01:57.389> liquid<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.929> actually<00:01:58.289> just<00:01:58.439> mineral<00:01:58.770> oil

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the liquid is actually just mineral oil

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.109 
the liquid is actually just mineral oil
and<00:01:59.369> it<00:02:00.210> evaporates<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.109> then<00:02:02.039> there's<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
and it evaporates and then there's you

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.330 
and it evaporates and then there's you
know<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.420> kind<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.740> know<00:02:04.859> graphite

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
know like kind of you know graphite

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.999 
know like kind of you know graphite
powder<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:06.450> not<00:02:06.630> graphite<00:02:07.170> per<00:02:07.469> se<00:02:07.679> but<00:02:07.740> it's

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
powder it's not graphite per se but it's

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.740 
powder it's not graphite per se but it's
something<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.569> dry

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
something like that so it's a dry

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.150 
something like that so it's a dry
lubrication<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.410> once<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.649> mineral<00:02:10.979> oil

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
lubrication so once the mineral oil

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.090 
lubrication so once the mineral oil
disappears<00:02:11.819> it's<00:02:12.780> left<00:02:13.110> with<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:13.800> you

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
disappears it's left with this like you

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.090 
disappears it's left with this like you
know<00:02:14.880> coating<00:02:15.600> it's<00:02:16.470> also<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.830> rust

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
know coating it's also the rust

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.050 
know coating it's also the rust
inhibitor

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
inhibitor

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.090 
inhibitor
so<00:02:18.660> what<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.840> do<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.260> open<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.560> blade<00:02:19.710> halfway

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
so what I do is I open the blade halfway

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.190 
so what I do is I open the blade halfway
up<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:21.000> if<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.210> look<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.600> this<00:02:21.840> crack<00:02:22.170> right

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
up and if you look in this crack right

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.070 
up and if you look in this crack right
here<00:02:22.730> you'll<00:02:23.730> see<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:24.000> scratched<00:02:24.420> arc<00:02:24.810> pattern

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
here you'll see a scratched arc pattern

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.920 
here you'll see a scratched arc pattern
it<00:02:25.590> goes<00:02:25.860> like<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.390> because<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.540> detent

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
it goes like this because the detent

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.120 
it goes like this because the detent
ball<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.980> right<00:02:29.280> about<00:02:29.550> under<00:02:29.970> here<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:31.130> it's

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
ball is right about under here and it's

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.180 
ball is right about under here and it's
scratching<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.640> pattern<00:02:32.970> onto<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.330> blade<00:02:34.190> and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
scratching a pattern onto the blade and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.240 
scratching a pattern onto the blade and
that's<00:02:35.670> where<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.000> want<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.180> put<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> lube
