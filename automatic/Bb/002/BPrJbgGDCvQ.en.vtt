00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
annoying I guess would be the best way

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.350 
annoying I guess would be the best way
to<00:01:04.080> really<00:01:04.409> put<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:05.000> there's<00:01:06.000> not<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.240> much

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
certain joints ate maybe change like the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.109 
certain joints ate maybe change like the
hips<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.020> example<00:01:10.470> shoulders<00:01:11.100> would<00:01:11.970> be

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
hips for example shoulders would be

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.429 
hips for example shoulders would be
better<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.570> maybe<00:01:12.990> use<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.409> a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
better if they just maybe use like a

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.050 
better if they just maybe use like a
regular<00:01:13.680> ball<00:01:14.130> joint<00:01:14.400> rather<00:01:14.640> than<00:01:14.880> these

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
he's got real tech joints there

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.330 
he's got real tech joints there
this<00:01:54.780> particular<00:01:55.439> piece<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.009> made<00:01:56.219> of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
this particular piece here is made of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.370 
this particular piece here is made of
like<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> softer<00:01:57.030> material<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.110> doesn't

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
like a softer material so it doesn't

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.580 
like a softer material so it doesn't
really<00:01:58.469> impede<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> articulation<00:01:59.729> got<00:02:00.719> real

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
really impede the articulation got real

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.469 
really impede the articulation got real
low<00:02:01.680> tech<00:02:01.920> joint<00:02:02.189> he<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:02.909> kind<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.149> see<00:02:03.299> right

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
low tech joint he can kind of see right

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.310 
low tech joint he can kind of see right
there<00:02:04.549> it<00:02:05.549> works<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.570> could<00:02:06.960> work<00:02:07.110> better

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
there it works so so could work better

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.499 
there it works so so could work better
but<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.580> know<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.759> kind<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:08.940> broken<00:02:09.119> up<00:02:09.360> into

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
but you know it's kind of broken up into

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.980 
but you know it's kind of broken up into
sections<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.050> think<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.319> help<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.619> move<00:02:10.830> but

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
sections I think to help the move but

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.960 
sections I think to help the move but
it<00:02:12.320> could<00:02:12.560> probably<00:02:12.800> do<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> little<00:02:13.400> better<00:02:13.550> job

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
it could probably do a little better job

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.660 
it could probably do a little better job
of<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:14.710> actually<00:02:15.710> think<00:02:16.100> there's<00:02:16.340> another

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
of that I actually think there's another

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.790 
of that I actually think there's another
Revoltech<00:02:17.270> joint<00:02:17.570> up<00:02:17.750> inside<00:02:18.080> here<00:02:18.350> but<00:02:18.500> again

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
Revoltech joint up inside here but again

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.580 
Revoltech joint up inside here but again
has<00:02:19.070> very<00:02:19.550> low<00:02:19.700> range<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.150> motion<00:02:20.450> eyes<00:02:21.200> got

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
has very low range of motion eyes got

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.480 
has very low range of motion eyes got
another<00:02:21.800> one<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.190> neck<00:02:25.360> shoulders<00:02:27.490> again

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
another one in the neck shoulders again

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.980 
another one in the neck shoulders again
this<00:02:28.610> is<00:02:28.790> made<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.030> look<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.210> softer<00:02:29.600> material

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
this is made to look a softer material

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.110 
this is made to look a softer material
here<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.410> kind<00:02:30.710> of<00:02:30.740> moves<00:02:30.950> with<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.430> actual

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
here so it kind of moves with the actual

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.930 
here so it kind of moves with the actual
joint<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:32.990> doesn't<00:02:33.230> really<00:02:33.320> hinder<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.710> I

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
joint so it doesn't really hinder it I

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.220 
joint so it doesn't really hinder it I
can<00:02:34.940> seize<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.180> another<00:02:35.570> real<00:02:35.750> affect<00:02:36.020> joint

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
can seize that another real affect joint

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.560 
can seize that another real affect joint
in<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.440> elbows<00:02:36.710> and<00:02:37.040> then<00:02:37.880> little<00:02:38.150> tiny<00:02:38.330> ones

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
in the elbows and then little tiny ones

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.310 
in the elbows and then little tiny ones
in<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.840> wrist

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
in the wrist

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.260 
in the wrist
whichever<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.430> know<00:02:40.520> not<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> bad<00:02:40.910> range<00:02:41.120> of

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
whichever you know not a bad range of

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.740 
whichever you know not a bad range of
motion<00:02:41.570> consider<00:02:43.000> actual<00:02:44.000> sculpt<00:02:44.300> wise<00:02:44.510> is

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
motion consider actual sculpt wise is

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.830 
motion consider actual sculpt wise is
quite<00:02:45.440> well<00:02:45.620> done<00:02:45.800> he's<00:02:46.520> got<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.700> lot<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.600> lot

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
quite well done he's got a lot of a lot

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.810 
quite well done he's got a lot of a lot
of<00:02:47.960> detail<00:02:48.320> really<00:02:50.980> an<00:02:51.980> actual<00:02:52.280> musculature

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
of detail really an actual musculature

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.030 
of detail really an actual musculature
and<00:02:53.150> everything<00:02:53.420> yeah<00:02:53.510> there's<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.720> lot<00:02:53.870> of

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
and everything yeah there's a lot of

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.990 
and everything yeah there's a lot of
added<00:02:55.040> detail

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
added detail

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.720 
added detail
nice<00:02:56.480> work<00:02:56.690> done<00:02:56.900> on<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.080> head<00:03:00.520> for<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.580> most

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
nice work done on the head for the most

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.280 
nice work done on the head for the most
part<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.090> paint's<00:03:02.390> nice<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:02.810> clean<00:03:02.990> there<00:03:03.020> is

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
part the paint's nice and clean there is

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.520 
part the paint's nice and clean there is
a<00:03:03.320> little<00:03:03.650> bit<00:03:03.800> of<00:03:04.210> slop<00:03:05.210> from<00:03:05.540> you<00:03:06.320> know<00:03:06.440> you

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
a little bit of slop from you know you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.720 
a little bit of slop from you know you
can<00:03:06.650> see<00:03:06.800> a<00:03:06.830> little<00:03:07.010> bit<00:03:07.160> of<00:03:07.220> black<00:03:07.460> right

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
can see a little bit of black right

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.210 
can see a little bit of black right
there<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:08.810> know<00:03:08.870> some<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.320> works<00:03:09.500> fine<00:03:09.830> and

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
there you know some of it works fine and

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.670 
there you know some of it works fine and
you<00:03:10.310> know<00:03:10.400> you<00:03:10.460> can<00:03:10.640> just<00:03:10.850> kind<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.120> consider

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
you know you can just kind of consider

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.500 
you know you can just kind of consider
you<00:03:12.680> know<00:03:12.800> almost<00:03:13.460> like<00:03:13.610> working<00:03:13.910> kind<00:03:14.420> of

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
you know almost like working kind of

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.300 
you know almost like working kind of
with<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.960> sculpt<00:03:15.230> but<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.620> know<00:03:15.710> other<00:03:16.010> parts

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
with the sculpt but you know other parts

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.890 
with the sculpt but you know other parts
you<00:03:16.550> know<00:03:16.670> paint<00:03:16.970> see<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.120> bit<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:17.690> black

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
you know paint see a bit of a black

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.990 
you know paint see a bit of a black
smudge<00:03:18.230> there<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.680> little<00:03:19.520> smudge<00:03:19.760> on<00:03:19.940> the

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
smudge there a little smudge on the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.170 
smudge there a little smudge on the
actual<00:03:20.360> circle<00:03:21.350> part<00:03:21.530> on<00:03:21.620> this<00:03:21.740> gesture<00:03:22.190> so

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
actual circle part on this gesture so

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.270 
actual circle part on this gesture so
you<00:03:23.240> know<00:03:23.450> not<00:03:23.660> great<00:03:23.870> but<00:03:24.140> not<00:03:24.200> awful<00:03:24.830> I<00:03:25.010> would

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
you know not great but not awful I would

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.560 
you know not great but not awful I would
say<00:03:25.460> you<00:03:25.520> know<00:03:25.700> I've<00:03:25.820> just<00:03:25.940> actually<00:03:26.120> seen

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
say you know I've just actually seen

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.320 
say you know I've just actually seen
some<00:03:27.080> of<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.290> other<00:03:27.530> reviews<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.550> saw<00:03:28.790> for<00:03:29.060> more

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
some of the other reviews I saw for more

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.120 
some of the other reviews I saw for more
different<00:03:29.750> pictures<00:03:30.020> I've<00:03:30.170> seen<00:03:30.380> actual<00:03:30.530> like

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
different pictures I've seen actual like

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.370 
different pictures I've seen actual like
more<00:03:31.370> damage<00:03:32.270> on<00:03:32.420> his<00:03:32.540> face<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:32.900> whatnot<00:03:33.170> from

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
more damage on his face and whatnot from

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.920 
more damage on his face and whatnot from
paint<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:33.950> I'm<00:03:34.460> glad<00:03:34.670> mine<00:03:34.910> was<00:03:35.120> fairly<00:03:35.690> well

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
paint so I'm glad mine was fairly well

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.760 
paint so I'm glad mine was fairly well
done<00:03:37.450> so<00:03:38.450> very<00:03:38.840> cool<00:03:38.990> figure<00:03:39.230> all<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.560> same

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
done so very cool figure all the same

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.490 
done so very cool figure all the same
he's<00:03:40.460> fairly<00:03:40.910> tall<00:03:41.240> for<00:03:41.510> Revoltech<00:03:41.930> figure<00:03:42.320> -

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
he's fairly tall for Revoltech figure -

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.310 
he's fairly tall for Revoltech figure -
he's<00:03:42.680> got<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:43.010> be<00:03:43.100> pushing<00:03:43.370> probably<00:03:44.230> well<00:03:45.230> I

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320

more<00:05:48.570> I<00:05:49.199> don't<00:05:49.979> know<00:05:50.070> they<00:05:50.250> kind<00:05:50.460> of<00:05:50.520> like<00:05:50.820> flop

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
more I don't know they kind of like flop

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.670 
more I don't know they kind of like flop
all<00:05:51.539> over<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:51.810> place<00:05:51.960> they're<00:05:52.169> really<00:05:52.410> more

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
all over the place they're really more

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.800 
all over the place they're really more
annoying<00:05:53.010> I<00:05:53.160> think<00:05:53.430> than<00:05:53.580> anything<00:05:53.789> so<00:05:54.180> I<00:05:54.419> tend

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
annoying I think than anything so I tend

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.469 
annoying I think than anything so I tend
to<00:05:54.930> just<00:05:55.080> plug<00:05:55.289> them<00:05:55.470> right<00:05:55.500> in<00:05:55.919> from<00:05:56.190> here<00:05:56.479> so

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
to just plug them right in from here so

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:05.430 
to just plug them right in from here so
I<00:05:57.510> can<00:05:58.110> get<00:05:58.199> these<00:05:58.349> in<00:05:58.590> show<00:05:58.919> you

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.900 

sometimes<00:06:06.440> it<00:06:06.590> feels<00:06:06.740> like<00:06:07.010> they're<00:06:07.220> it's

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
sometimes it feels like they're it's

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.310 
sometimes it feels like they're it's
quite<00:06:08.150> difficult<00:06:08.420> to<00:06:08.690> get<00:06:08.840> them<00:06:09.020> in<00:06:09.140> but<00:06:09.290> I

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
quite difficult to get them in but I

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.260 
quite difficult to get them in but I
think<00:06:09.380> you<00:06:09.590> just<00:06:09.620> have<00:06:09.920> to<00:06:10.070> kind<00:06:10.280> of<00:06:10.370> hit<00:06:11.030> the

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
think you just have to kind of hit the

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.510 
think you just have to kind of hit the
actual<00:06:11.990> thing<00:06:12.200> from<00:06:12.350> the<00:06:12.470> right<00:06:12.650> angle<00:06:12.800> so

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
actual thing from the right angle so

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.670 
actual thing from the right angle so
there<00:06:13.670> you<00:06:13.760> can<00:06:13.790> see<00:06:14.030> them<00:06:14.120> with<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:14.300> wings<00:06:14.680> as

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
there you can see them with the wings as

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.470
