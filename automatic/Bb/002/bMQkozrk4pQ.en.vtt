00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
you know i really didn't know that much

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.470 
you know i really didn't know that much
about<00:00:16.320> anti-venom<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.880> i<00:00:17.910> did<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> little<00:00:18.270> bit

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
about anti-venom so i did a little bit

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.599 
about anti-venom so i did a little bit
of<00:00:18.600> research<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.289> learned<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.130> couple<00:00:20.279> things

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
of research and learned a couple things

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.779 
of research and learned a couple things
but<00:00:21.480> let's<00:00:21.779> take<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> look<00:00:22.350> at<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.920> box<00:00:23.130> first

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
but let's take a look at the box first

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.410 
but let's take a look at the box first
now<00:00:24.710> we<00:00:25.710> opened<00:00:26.099> up<00:00:26.189> spider-man<00:00:26.820> who<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
now we opened up spider-man who was the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.999 
now we opened up spider-man who was the
first<00:00:27.810> figure<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:30.289> anti-venom<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.560> second

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
first figure and anti-venom is a second

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.400 
first figure and anti-venom is a second
and<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:33.329> all<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.809> these<00:00:33.930> other<00:00:33.989> figures

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and I have all of these other figures

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.610 
and I have all of these other figures
that<00:00:34.890> we're<00:00:35.010> gonna<00:00:35.100> look<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:36.780> little<00:00:37.530> later

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that we're gonna look at a little later

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.119 
that we're gonna look at a little later
and<00:00:38.100> once<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.879> get<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.480> these<00:00:39.750> figures<00:00:40.260> we

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
and once we get all of these figures we

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.680 
and once we get all of these figures we
can<00:00:41.340> build<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.270> Hobgoblin<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:44.270> that<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.420> so

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
can build the Hobgoblin and that is so

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.900 
can build the Hobgoblin and that is so
cool<00:00:45.739> because<00:00:46.739> each<00:00:47.129> one<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.340> these<00:00:47.520> figures

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
cool because each one of these figures

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.299 
cool because each one of these figures
comes<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> couple<00:00:49.110> pieces<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
comes with a couple pieces of the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.490 
comes with a couple pieces of the
Hobgoblin<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.780> build<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.230> whole

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
Hobgoblin so we can build a whole

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.770 
Hobgoblin so we can build a whole
another<00:00:52.980> figure<00:00:53.340> which<00:00:53.820> i<00:00:53.940> think<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.300> pretty

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
