00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
mostly succeeded in doing this well the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.730 
mostly succeeded in doing this well the
safety<00:01:55.010> of<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.370> almonds<00:01:55.700> was<00:01:55.790> a<00:01:55.850> success<00:01:56.740> so

right now we're gonna sift the icing
sugar<00:01:59.780> this<00:02:00.470> is<00:02:00.860> way<00:02:01.490> easier<00:02:02.050> yeah<00:02:04.000> that's

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
sugar this is way easier yeah that's

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.030 
sugar this is way easier yeah that's
done<00:02:05.620> we're<00:02:06.620> going<00:02:07.010> together

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.610 

well<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.160> castor<00:02:13.520> sugar<00:02:13.550> is<00:02:14.000> finer<00:02:14.510> now<00:02:14.840> this

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
well the castor sugar is finer now this

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.890 
well the castor sugar is finer now this
recipe<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.490> kind<00:02:16.850> of<00:02:16.940> doomed<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:17.390> fail<00:02:17.630> because

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
recipe is kind of doomed to fail because

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.080 
recipe is kind of doomed to fail because
I<00:02:18.080> don't<00:02:18.260> have<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.590> proper<00:02:18.830> ingredients<00:02:19.280> so

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
I don't have the proper ingredients so

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.150 
I don't have the proper ingredients so

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
if these cookies turn out to be terrible

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.850 
if these cookies turn out to be terrible
okay<00:02:25.880> that's<00:02:26.270> on<00:02:26.450> there<00:02:26.690> we're<00:02:27.230> going<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.650> put

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
the egg whites in there and then a

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.720 
the egg whites in there and then a
little<00:02:32.060> pinch<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:33.170> salt

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.100 

okay<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:38.790> now<00:02:39.000> we're<00:02:39.150> supposed<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.630> add<00:02:39.780> the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
okay so now we're supposed to add the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:48.170 
okay so now we're supposed to add the
caster<00:02:40.590> sugar<00:02:40.970> blood<00:02:42.080> blood<00:02:46.700> it's<00:02:47.700> gonna<00:02:48.000> be

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
caster sugar blood blood it's gonna be

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.870 
caster sugar blood blood it's gonna be
so<00:02:48.510> red<00:02:49.940> these<00:02:50.940> are<00:02:51.000> my<00:02:51.240> first<00:02:51.510> batch<00:02:52.700> but<00:02:53.700> egg

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
so red these are my first batch but egg

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.960 
so red these are my first batch but egg
whites<00:02:54.210> failed<00:02:54.960> cuz<00:02:55.620> they<00:02:56.370> were<00:02:56.430> stiff<00:02:56.940> and

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
whites failed cuz they were stiff and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.720 
whites failed cuz they were stiff and
then<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.510> put<00:02:57.870> coloring<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.340> should<00:02:59.580> have

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
then I put coloring in and I should have

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.610 
then I put coloring in and I should have
wished<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.300> there<00:03:01.200> might<00:03:01.350> have<00:03:01.380> been<00:03:01.530> a

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
wished that there might have been a

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.030 
wished that there might have been a
little<00:03:01.800> bit<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.070> yellow<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.030> parts<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.230> so

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
little bit of yellow and parts in it so

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.460 
little bit of yellow and parts in it so
I'm<00:03:05.100> doing<00:03:05.130> this<00:03:05.400> again<00:03:05.550> right<00:03:06.210> now<00:03:06.390> sugar<00:03:07.170> I

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
I'm doing this again right now sugar I

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.340 
I'm doing this again right now sugar I
actually<00:03:07.830> chose<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.790> go<00:03:09.690> for<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:09.990> different

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
actually chose to go for a different

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.410 
actually chose to go for a different
kind<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.650> sugar<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.700> internal<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.270> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
kind of sugar the internal of the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.790 
kind of sugar the internal of the
translation<00:03:13.080> is<00:03:13.200> where<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.470> would<00:03:13.650> be<00:03:13.770> I

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
translation is where that would be I

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.440 
translation is where that would be I
will<00:03:14.280> look<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.580> up<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.850> put<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.270> the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
will look it up and put it in the

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.060 
will look it up and put it in the
doobly-do<00:03:16.050> it's<00:03:16.410> looking<00:03:16.680> pretty<00:03:16.830> good<00:03:16.950> so

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
doobly-do it's looking pretty good so

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:24.040 
doobly-do it's looking pretty good so
far<00:03:17.390> let's<00:03:18.390> hope<00:03:18.570> it<00:03:18.690> works

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.450 

oh<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:25.370> looks<00:03:25.400> like<00:03:25.790> it's<00:03:25.940> done<00:03:26.980> BAM

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
oh it looks like it's done BAM

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.510 
oh it looks like it's done BAM
it<00:03:28.760> totally<00:03:28.970> worked<00:03:29.620> as<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.860> might<00:03:31.070> have

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
it totally worked as you might have

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.070 
it totally worked as you might have
noticed<00:03:31.580> I've<00:03:32.120> also<00:03:32.240> changed<00:03:32.720> into<00:03:33.050> a

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
noticed I've also changed into a

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.590 
noticed I've also changed into a
different<00:03:33.800> color<00:03:33.980> because<00:03:34.430> that<00:03:34.850> might<00:03:35.450> be

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
different color because that might be

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.840 
different color because that might be
easier<00:03:35.960> when<00:03:36.230> you're<00:03:36.350> adding<00:03:36.530> pink<00:03:37.370> food<00:03:37.580> dye

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
easier when you're adding pink food dye

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.830 
easier when you're adding pink food dye
let's<00:03:38.300> do<00:03:38.480> it

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840
