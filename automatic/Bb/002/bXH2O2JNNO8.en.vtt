 I would like to see you 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.789
 simply to be able 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.789

 [Music] 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:17.830
 I know we had a sincere friendship 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:22.770
 united us and that allowed me to understand what 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.770
 I felt it was 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.750
 and something else 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.439
 but I was not able to tell you how much you 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.439
 I loved 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.000

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.500

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.329
 [Music] 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.100
 to my person 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.590
 and demonstrate 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.590
 too intense 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.980
 [Music] 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.200
 of everything 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.490
 it's too much 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.560
 [Music] 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.870
 our substance strengthened and this that 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.600
 I feel for you secretly or has grown up 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.580
 for the fear of losing you to put it 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.880
 our risks never stronger 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.340
 decided to fine you this I feel 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.070
 this passion this fire that burns me for 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.950
 but I can not take it anymore 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.530
 I can resist I have to scream 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.319
 to the four winds that you always 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.620
 loved that since I have 15 I have 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.870
 dreamed and I do not know if it was your look you know 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.510
 ways of talking or how I hugged 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.420
 but I left you thinking and I left 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.030
 wrapping and without realizing me vienna 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.700
 dwelling and in whom you accept me such and 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.519
 As I am from you, you know everything has already happened 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.950

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.430

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.150

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.150
 Without condition 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.599
 look 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.599
 [Music] 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.400
 my interest now 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.230
 more intense 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.380
 [Music] 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.540
 many times I suppose frustration we 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.460
 despair if we complain because we do not 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.860
 we have found our ideal partner 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.830
 but how ironic it is when this person 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.990
 whom we so much wish to find 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.330
 we have had right in front of us 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.540
 for so long and we have been unable 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.270
 to realize not waste your time in 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.489
 Relationships that do not come from God 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.720
 look for your address and I assure you that he 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:27.579
 lead your steps 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:27.579
