python tornado web server which is known
for<00:00:34.710> its<00:00:34.890> scalability<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.890> it's<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.640> really

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
for its scalability and it's just really

idea<00:00:55.980> behind<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.760> app<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:59.129> basically

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
idea behind the app so it's basically

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:10.430 
idea behind the app so it's basically
this<00:01:02.989> it's<00:01:03.989> basically<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:05.720> oops<00:01:06.720> oops<00:01:07.640> yeah

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.630 
friend and we're going to try grabbing
its<00:03:07.350> edges

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.940 

and<00:03:10.730> before<00:03:11.300> I<00:03:11.510> hit<00:03:11.720> go<00:03:11.960> I<00:03:12.230> need<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.740> make<00:03:12.920> sure

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
and before I hit go I need to make sure

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.630 
and before I hit go I need to make sure
we<00:03:13.520> have<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:15.140> server<00:03:15.440> running<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.250> I<00:03:16.370> don't

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
we have the server running and I don't

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.790 
we have the server running and I don't
so<00:03:17.300> this<00:03:17.600> is<00:03:17.780> going<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.050> be<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.290> first<00:03:18.560> thing

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
so this is going to be the first thing

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.970 
so this is going to be the first thing
you<00:03:19.190> guys<00:03:19.400> have<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.730> do<00:03:20.410> around<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.740> server

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
you guys have to do around the server

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.470 
you guys have to do around the server
second<00:03:26.230> so<00:03:27.230> yeah<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:28.070> just<00:03:28.250> do<00:03:28.490> pilum<00:03:29.060> tornado

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
second so yeah you just do pilum tornado

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:37.540 
second so yeah you just do pilum tornado
server<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:32.980> wait<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.310> little<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:35.680> ok<00:03:36.680> now<00:03:37.310> it's

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
server and wait a little and ok now it's

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.330 
server and wait a little and ok now it's
listening<00:03:39.819> now<00:03:40.819> I<00:03:40.850> can<00:03:41.360> just<00:03:41.569> let<00:03:41.810> go<00:03:42.110> and<00:03:42.350> the

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
listening now I can just let go and the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.320 
listening now I can just let go and the
picture<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.850> will<00:03:44.000> be<00:03:44.180> sent<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.600> server

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
picture it will be sent to the server

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.470 
picture it will be sent to the server
receives<00:03:47.330> it<00:03:47.890> modifies<00:03:48.890> it<00:03:49.190> and<00:03:49.370> returns<00:03:50.239> it

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
receives it modifies it and returns it

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.960 
receives it modifies it and returns it
to<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.840> app<00:03:51.019> ok<00:03:51.830> this<00:03:51.980> picture<00:03:52.340> didn't<00:03:52.700> look

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
to the app ok this picture didn't look

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.259 
to the app ok this picture didn't look
very<00:03:53.300> good<00:03:53.450> with<00:03:53.780> grab<00:03:54.110> edges<00:03:54.620> but<00:03:55.269> yeah

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
very good with grab edges but yeah

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.300 
very good with grab edges but yeah
that's<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.750> idea<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:58.870> it's<00:03:59.870> quite<00:04:00.860> easy<00:04:00.890> to

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
that's the idea and it's quite easy to

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.210 
that's the idea and it's quite easy to
change<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:02.720> transformations<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:03.860> to<00:04:04.070> add

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
change the transformations and to add

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.490 
change the transformations and to add
new<00:04:04.430> ones<00:04:04.630> this<00:04:05.630> get<00:04:06.110> edges<00:04:06.590> is<00:04:06.800> just<00:04:08.500> it's

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
new ones this get edges is just it's

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.090 
new ones this get edges is just it's
actually<00:04:10.310> just<00:04:10.580> a<00:04:10.790> single<00:04:11.290> simple<00:04:12.290> CV<00:04:12.650> command

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
actually just a single simple CV command

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.240 
actually just a single simple CV command
just<00:04:13.610> at<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:14.269> doing<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.230> edges<00:04:15.650> command<00:04:16.040> on

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
just at the doing the edges command on

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.370 
just at the doing the edges command on
the<00:04:16.430> image<00:04:16.700> so<00:04:17.690> there<00:04:18.500> is<00:04:18.620> actually<00:04:20.200> there<00:04:21.200> are

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
the image so there is actually there are

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.409 
the image so there is actually there are
actually<00:04:21.859> unlimited<00:04:22.490> possibilities<00:04:23.180> you

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
actually unlimited possibilities you

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.620 
actually unlimited possibilities you
just<00:04:23.690> need<00:04:23.840> to<00:04:23.960> be<00:04:24.080> creative<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:25.390> do<00:04:26.390> whatever

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
just need to be creative and do whatever

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.010 
just need to be creative and do whatever
you<00:04:26.900> want<00:04:27.110> I<00:04:27.380> can<00:04:28.100> show<00:04:28.760> there's<00:04:29.750> another

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
you want I can show there's another

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.909 
you want I can show there's another
there's<00:04:31.010> another<00:04:31.479> effect<00:04:32.479> that<00:04:33.320> might<00:04:33.680> be<00:04:33.890> a

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
there's another effect that might be a

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.159 
there's another effect that might be a
little<00:04:34.160> more<00:04:34.430> interesting<00:04:35.650> let<00:04:36.650> me<00:04:36.950> just<00:04:37.250> find

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
little more interesting let me just find

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.680 
little more interesting let me just find
ok<00:04:39.550> this<00:04:40.630> Cilic<00:04:41.630> picture<00:04:42.050> of<00:04:42.200> me<00:04:42.380> here<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:43.690> now

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
ok this Cilic picture of me here and now

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:51.580 
ok this Cilic picture of me here and now
rotate<00:04:45.410> it<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:46.419> try<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.479> wanted<00:04:48.050> poster

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.450 

okay<00:04:52.590> so<00:04:53.129> this<00:04:53.729> is<00:04:53.909> it<00:04:54.319> the<00:04:55.319> user<00:04:55.590> could<00:04:56.039> either

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
okay so this is it the user could either

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.230 
okay so this is it the user could either
delete<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.240> or<00:04:57.419> share<00:04:58.050> it<00:04:58.219> using<00:04:59.240> whatever

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
can just touch click the picture and a

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.689 
can just touch click the picture and a
viewer<00:05:14.669> opens<00:05:15.210> up<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.659> this<00:05:16.650> is<00:05:16.830> it<00:05:17.069> this<00:05:17.580> is

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
viewer opens up and this is it this is

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.879 
viewer opens up and this is it this is
just<00:05:17.969> another<00:05:18.419> example<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:19.770> other

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
just another example and other

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.189 
just another example and other
transformation<00:05:20.819> also<00:05:21.419> quite<00:05:21.719> easy<00:05:22.050> to<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:24.240> to

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
transformation also quite easy to to to

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.679 
transformation also quite easy to to to
write<00:05:25.469> to<00:05:26.129> develop<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:28.729> that's<00:05:29.729> the<00:05:30.000> idea<00:05:30.330> you

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:30.689 
write to develop and that's the idea you

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.850 
write to develop and that's the idea you
can<00:05:30.900> just<00:05:32.000> change<00:05:33.000> it<00:05:33.270> however<00:05:33.990> you<00:05:34.289> want<00:05:34.469> you

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
can just change it however you want you

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.529 
can just change it however you want you
can<00:05:35.189> deem<00:05:35.849> the<00:05:36.150> app<00:05:36.330> and<00:05:37.969> your<00:05:38.969> app<00:05:39.240> doesn't

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
can deem the app and your app doesn't

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.290 
can deem the app and your app doesn't
need<00:05:39.750> to<00:05:39.990> give<00:05:40.349> the<00:05:40.500> user<00:05:40.710> a<00:05:41.610> choice<00:05:42.029> of

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
need to give the user a choice of

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.240 
need to give the user a choice of
transformations<00:05:43.199> you<00:05:43.529> can<00:05:43.710> you<00:05:44.069> can<00:05:44.219> just

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
transformations you can you can just

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.790 
transformations you can you can just
think<00:05:44.759> of<00:05:44.969> one<00:05:45.300> really<00:05:45.840> good<00:05:45.990> transformation

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
think of one really good transformation

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:54.230 
think of one really good transformation
and<00:05:49.250> design<00:05:50.250> and<00:05:50.960> user<00:05:51.960> interface<00:05:52.620> and<00:05:53.240> use

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
and design and user interface and use

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.790 
and design and user interface and use
the<00:05:54.629> app<00:05:55.199> for<00:05:55.529> just<00:05:55.919> with<00:05:56.370> this<00:05:56.669> only<00:05:57.419> one

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
the app for just with this only one

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.899 
the app for just with this only one
transformation<00:05:59.479> so<00:06:00.479> yeah<00:06:01.409> that's<00:06:01.770> it<00:06:02.099> you<00:06:02.639> can

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
transformation so yeah that's it you can

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:06.760 
transformation so yeah that's it you can
just<00:06:03.180> clone<00:06:04.020> my<00:06:04.259> repository<00:06:04.650> in<00:06:05.099> here<00:06:05.460> and

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
just clone my repository in here and

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.790 
just clone my repository in here and
have<00:06:07.770> some<00:06:07.800> fun<00:06:08.219> yeah<00:06:09.120> you<00:06:09.990> can<00:06:10.169> seem<00:06:10.500> to<00:06:10.650> read

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
have some fun yeah you can seem to read

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.659 
have some fun yeah you can seem to read
me<00:06:10.830> how<00:06:11.550> you<00:06:11.610> set<00:06:12.210> things<00:06:12.509> up<00:06:12.750> and<00:06:13.050> everything

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
me how you set things up and everything
