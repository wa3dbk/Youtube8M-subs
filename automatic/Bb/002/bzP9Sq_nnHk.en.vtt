through my hair so my hair feels a bit

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.579 
through my hair so my hair feels a bit
saturated<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.660> feel<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
saturated but I feel that it's all the
