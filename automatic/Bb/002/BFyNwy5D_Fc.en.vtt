the first braid to add extra support you

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.820 
the first braid to add extra support you
know<00:02:18.510> some<00:02:18.750> people's<00:02:19.050> edges<00:02:19.500> are<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> little

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
know some people's edges are a little

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.980 
know some people's edges are a little
shorter<00:02:20.220> than<00:02:20.340> others<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.420> don't<00:02:21.780> want<00:02:21.930> to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
shorter than others so you don't want to

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.050 
shorter than others so you don't want to
put<00:02:22.140> too<00:02:22.290> much<00:02:22.320> weight<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.980> weave<00:02:23.130> I'm

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
put too much weight with the weave I'm

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.720 
put too much weight with the weave I'm
using<00:02:24.390> Qi<00:02:24.780> hair<00:02:24.990> spray<00:02:25.320> on<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.190> ends<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.610> her

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.520 
using Qi hair spray on the ends of her
hair<00:02:26.760> because<00:02:27.270> as<00:02:27.420> I'm<00:02:27.810> braiding<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.290> down

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
hair because as I'm braiding it down

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.860 
hair because as I'm braiding it down
it's<00:02:29.070> unraveling<00:02:29.490> so<00:02:30.000> if<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.270> run<00:02:30.630> into<00:02:30.750> that

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
it's unraveling so if you run into that

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.080 
it's unraveling so if you run into that
problem<00:02:31.020> just<00:02:31.980> spray<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.220> little<00:02:32.370> hairspray<00:02:32.670> on
