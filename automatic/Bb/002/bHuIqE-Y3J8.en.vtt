00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:18.680
 Speech galera besa was the xp drill brf de 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.109
 one more job as late black ops 2 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.210
 this time the continuation of our series d 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.210
 nuclear weapon with all weapons like you 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.449
 are seeing is there is a nucleus with FAO 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.210
 once there the fao is is a jump in rif 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.340
 very good it is 5-sided without staying 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.850
 push the release button several times 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.149
 and as there the game mode was in the 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.069
 end of new in free for all is one more 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.920
 ace will make the danger of scorpion also 

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:48.859
 in the end I 'm using there in the network 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.229
 dot and stock for me are the best 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:55.129
 even team her because she already loads 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:57.859
 very fast and ammunition is no use sex and 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.190
 click because because she's single fire is you 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.780
 does not spend a lot of shots and will not 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.600
 There's a lot of bullet that way. 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.780
 three shots and killed a guy then did not 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.900
 You need to have always gets 35 bullets do not 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.270
 remember totalizing red dot keet or net 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.520
 dot and the red dot stock because 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.290
 Watching her is not bad but 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.170
 also not good so the teacher rené 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.930
 dotti to give more precision I think 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.300
 it gets a lot better and another one that is the stock 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.660
 the stock I think is key in 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.880
 All self and I did and will see that I go 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.890
 're using will see it makes a difference in 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.570
 A few moments is while you are 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.470
 taking a face if you stay 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.810
 moving 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.610
 Does it make a difference, says the guy, if I do not? 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.830
 would have gone to the side so fast 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.230
 the guy can kill you so I guess 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.060
 What makes a difference, yes, and I also took 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.120
 the semsur graneiro that I think a 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.880
 floral makes difference you use in mode 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.080
 normal so without being free for all is or 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.550
 I do not think the difference you 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.100
 practically know where the 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.110
 enemies and then I did not know their 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.310
 enemies then makes a difference so 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.750
 It helps a little and you're using it. 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.509
 access to the grid and there was also the bag 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.720
 I bet it's good to bet on betty too. 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.079
 free for all since the power bimbo cattle 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.939
 Do you know how to be reborn sometimes? 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.290
 side so I leave the purse in 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.349
 low logo renato 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.540
 Who ever catches someone like this cgi with 10 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.700
 and then get the site with 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.170
 21 pick up the second from the site 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.040
 so always when you stayed where you did not 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.049
 buying more stay not the floor of both 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.879
 in the lighthouse until you get the first site there 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.849
 When I get it, I 've tried to get a 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.040
 according to the website before it 's over 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.739
 there is I come out of that part of 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.750
 map why playing foral is not you staying 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.310
 running randomly on the map you get 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.560
 Speaking this will not make a difference. 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.079
 none are almost going to die 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.340
 very sweaty head and then Fahel 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.470
 which I recommend you will stay in a 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.299
 area of ​​the map where you know where the 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.079
 I cannabis paulo , I know the team. 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.269
 main 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.129
 I'm near the lake, that's not even 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.919
 practically a block 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.290
 there on those stones and behind the trail 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:08.030
 there was also and there in the bottom of the other side 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.340
 there near that house and she from the radio 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.250
 so I was just in that area there already knowing 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.439
 Where were they going to leave, no problem? 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.810
 some days someone kills me from behind 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.329
 The chances were that this happened, but the 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.370
 chances were not so great is this 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.799
 happen you have to talk to 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.680
 will not have the next episode in this 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.989
 Friday because I did not have 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.299
 I played only a week until I played but not for 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.060
 nuclear pick up and I threw there about three 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.609
 four matches this is yesterday 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.919
 hospital I do not touch any guide 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.169
 nuclear Gravatai for this series then 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:43.699
 this Friday there will not be video then 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:46.849
 it will only take 20 seconds and cut this 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:49.940
 week the fourth rtd step is ready 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.819
 and such is also that I do not know if I go 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.729
 continue with this series until the end 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.099
 even it is not fiscal it is such a difficult game 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:59.810
 I think I can take it and like that with time. 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.430
 It makes sense that I will not be at first 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.099
 so the jacquard will not pick up with the 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.930
 Time is, I'll catch it, but it's already there. 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.750
 also who Joaldo've talked it over 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.519
 times I 'm repeating this but I 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.560
 I'll talk again, because a lot of 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.470
 people got charged for nuclear video 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.570
 I do not know what it is, I do not have it. 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.209
 played very open lobby and got lots of 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.039
 people say sandro already blow lobby is the 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.139
 that is the people who do not even know what you think 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.440
 public web and put a praxe to 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.360
 normal start and find the starting line 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.510
 so let's say free for all 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.700
 County 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.150
 I have not played on the floor you have played 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.160
 enough league play and enough 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.750
 competitive several championships all 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.910
 weekend is practically taking place 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.280
 a championship or if this Saturday in 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.760
 Saturday and Sunday always have championship and 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.770
 That's when I end up not even playing the pilot. 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.240
 during the weekend and as a worldwide 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.910
 during the week you also do not have the time 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.080
 to record in magny play then i will 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.030
 start betting on a website team is 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.820
 cool but gameplay hanging out on the channel is 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.880
 divide competitive play and even to 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.040
 increase and people know more about 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.170
 competitive and begin to play and form 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.470
 such a team is a lot of people who play 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:15.030
 well, but not even in this game is it free. 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.430
 For this business we know that this 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.580
 So he tried to set up such a team. 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.620
 It's really cool if you play and then you're stopped. 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.530
 practically with the public lobby has 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.560
 played a lot and do not cost a game that is 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.500
 competitive by taking x4 other clans is and 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.570
 playing the championship everyone sees that I 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.670
 I got nuclear if exhausted if I let 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.740
 like leaving the favorite to help in the 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.090
