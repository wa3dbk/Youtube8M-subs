00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:31.889 
groove is where the wheels supposed to

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:35.270 
groove is where the wheels supposed to
sit<00:01:32.219> now<00:01:33.119> look<00:01:33.299> at<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.569> wheel<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:34.319> see<00:01:35.159> it's

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
sit now look at this wheel here see it's

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.809 
sit now look at this wheel here see it's
on<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.520> outside<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.920> first<00:01:37.920> groove<00:01:38.520> it
