added pressure we were a confident

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.620 
added pressure we were a confident
football<00:02:28.070> team<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.550> we<00:02:29.240> knew<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:29.540> if<00:02:29.600> we

football team and we knew that if we
went<00:02:29.840> out<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:29.990> played<00:02:30.140> well<00:02:30.350> we<00:02:30.410> had<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.560> chance

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
went out and played well we had a chance

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.410 
went out and played well we had a chance
to<00:02:30.950> win<00:02:31.100> we<00:02:31.310> put<00:02:31.490> ourselves<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:31.940> position<00:02:32.330> to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
to win we put ourselves in position to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.820 
to win we put ourselves in position to
win<00:02:32.540> we<00:02:32.690> just<00:02:32.720> came<00:02:32.990> off<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> little<00:02:33.380> bit<00:02:33.530> short

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
win we just came off a little bit short

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.370 
win we just came off a little bit short
but<00:02:34.820> I<00:02:35.060> think<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.480> Mary<00:02:35.720> played<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.080> same<00:02:36.260> in

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
but I think that Mary played the same in

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.070 
but I think that Mary played the same in
every<00:02:36.470> game<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:37.310> 1988<00:02:38.030> bedlam<00:02:38.450> game<00:02:38.660> lived<00:02:38.930> up
