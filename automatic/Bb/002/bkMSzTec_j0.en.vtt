may<00:01:58.310> think<00:01:58.549> that<00:01:58.729> planting<00:01:59.210> as<00:01:59.360> many<00:01:59.540> trees<00:01:59.869> as

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.469 
may think that planting as many trees as
possible<00:02:00.619> is<00:02:00.799> a<00:02:00.860> way<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:01.220> increase<00:02:01.579> yield<00:02:02.060> but

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
possible is a way to increase yield but

apart are more productive you may think

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.460
