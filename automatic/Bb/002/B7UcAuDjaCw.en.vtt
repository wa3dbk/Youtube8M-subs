only thing about like these bump

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.559 
only thing about like these bump
hairstyles<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.390> that

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.709 

it's<00:03:28.140> virtually<00:03:29.129> impossible<00:03:29.549> to<00:03:30.120> make<00:03:30.420> it

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:30.719 
it's virtually impossible to make it

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.390 
it's virtually impossible to make it
look<00:03:30.959> exactly<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:31.650> same<00:03:31.739> as<00:03:32.069> it<00:03:32.189> did<00:03:32.370> last

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
look exactly the same as it did last

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.809 
look exactly the same as it did last
time<00:03:33.409> because<00:03:34.409> they're<00:03:34.799> their<00:03:35.159> little<00:03:35.489> twists

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
time because they're their little twists

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.509 
time because they're their little twists
and<00:03:36.060> bumps<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.569> can't<00:03:37.069> it's<00:03:38.069> like<00:03:38.189> impossible

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
and bumps you can't it's like impossible

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.610 
and bumps you can't it's like impossible
to<00:03:38.969> make<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.329> look<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.659> same<00:03:39.689> each<00:03:40.079> time<00:03:40.379> but

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
to make that look the same each time but

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.990 
to make that look the same each time but
it's<00:03:40.799> similar<00:03:41.040> enough<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.519> guys<00:03:41.670> get<00:03:41.879> the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
it's similar enough you guys get the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.390 
it's similar enough you guys get the
idea<00:03:42.079> now<00:03:43.079> I'm<00:03:43.560> taking<00:03:43.859> all<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.129> my<00:03:44.220> hair
