um then this is legit so I just want to

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.390 
um then this is legit so I just want to
take<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.480> now<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.720> didn't<00:02:23.290> necessarily<00:02:23.620> point

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400

article in an article I read online

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.410 
article in an article I read online
there<00:02:30.010> were<00:02:30.069> five<00:02:30.310> companies<00:02:30.640> mentioned<00:02:31.300> and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
there were five companies mentioned and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.309 
there were five companies mentioned and
they<00:02:31.480> were<00:02:31.540> one<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.840> them

they were one of them

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.290 
they were one of them
so<00:02:32.770> everybody<00:02:33.220> automatically<00:02:33.819> assumed<00:02:34.209> that

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
so everybody automatically assumed that

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.600 
so everybody automatically assumed that
they're<00:02:34.540> still<00:02:34.780> doing<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.200> now<00:02:35.340> whether<00:02:36.340> it

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
they're still doing it now whether it

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.160 
they're still doing it now whether it

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
ways to interpret things I'm gonna just

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.410 
ways to interpret things I'm gonna just
say<00:02:57.540> based<00:02:58.540> on<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:59.100> one<00:03:00.100> this<00:03:00.310> um<00:03:00.549> analysis<00:03:01.330> I

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
say based on this one this um analysis I

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.840 
say based on this one this um analysis I
read<00:03:01.600> from<00:03:01.720> suitable<00:03:02.290> labs<00:03:02.470> which<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.549> located

in Texas based on this test I am reading
now<00:03:07.500> prosupps

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
now prosupps

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.479 
now prosupps
PS<00:03:09.100> way<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.700> not<00:03:09.910> spite<00:03:10.510> okay<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:12.010> that's<00:03:12.250> one

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
PS way is not spite okay so that's one

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.280 
PS way is not spite okay so that's one
we<00:03:12.640> could<00:03:12.819> cross<00:03:13.030> off<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.510> oh<00:03:13.540> shit<00:03:14.019> list

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
we could cross off the oh shit list

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.259 
we could cross off the oh shit list
that's<00:03:14.920> one<00:03:15.190> we<00:03:15.340> can<00:03:15.489> say<00:03:15.640> okay<00:03:16.030> there's

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
that's one we can say okay there's

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.229 
that's one we can say okay there's

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
what to do well first of all the ones

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.410 
what to do well first of all the ones
who<00:03:28.959> were<00:03:29.109> majorly<00:03:29.620> spiking<00:03:30.280> things<00:03:30.549> okay

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
who were majorly spiking things okay

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.680 
who were majorly spiking things okay
they're<00:03:32.140> gonna<00:03:32.530> be<00:03:32.739> in<00:03:32.859> deep<00:03:33.040> shit<00:03:33.070> okay<00:03:33.730> what

they're gonna be in deep shit okay what

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.910 
they're gonna be in deep shit okay what
it's<00:03:34.840> going<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.019> do<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.440> is<00:03:35.590> it's<00:03:35.739> going<00:03:35.859> to

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
it's going to do to is it's going to

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.620 
it's going to do to is it's going to
clean<00:03:36.160> up<00:03:36.310> or<00:03:36.459> let's<00:03:36.640> assume<00:03:36.850> a<00:03:36.970> company<00:03:37.390> what

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
clean up or let's assume a company what

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.300 
clean up or let's assume a company what
a<00:03:37.660> spike<00:03:37.989> I'm<00:03:38.170> not<00:03:38.350> saying<00:03:38.590> prosupps<00:03:39.010> was

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
a spike I'm not saying prosupps was

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.849 
a spike I'm not saying prosupps was
let's<00:03:40.209> say<00:03:40.420> they<00:03:40.600> were<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:41.079> they<00:03:41.170> change<00:03:41.560> that

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
let's say they were and they change that

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.039 
let's say they were and they change that
changes<00:03:42.310> for<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.579> better<00:03:42.609> so<00:03:43.450> imagine<00:03:43.870> in<00:03:43.959> the

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
changes for the better so imagine in the

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.259 
changes for the better so imagine in the
future<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.530> go<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.890> store<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.489> you<00:03:46.120> can

future you go to the store and you can

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.720 
future you go to the store and you can
buy<00:03:46.329> way<00:03:46.959> based<00:03:47.799> on<00:03:48.010> your<00:03:48.100> preference<00:03:48.549> whether

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
buy way based on your preference whether

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.310 
buy way based on your preference whether
it's<00:03:48.940> because<00:03:49.299> I'm<00:03:49.480> saying<00:03:49.870> it's<00:03:50.109> good
