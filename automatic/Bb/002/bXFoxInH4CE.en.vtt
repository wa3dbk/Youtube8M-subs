00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.460
 yes 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.910
 now I am pete seeger and welcome 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.770
 back to the channel this time 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.139
 we will talk about two important changes or 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.030
 prototypes that are trying on the ct or 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.440
 community test environment these two 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.180
 changes modify two aspects 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.619
 fundamentals of the game as is the 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.230
 simple fact of shooting behind 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.060
 coverage and management and most of all the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.310
 playability around the vehicles 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.949
 airways more specifically talking about 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.960
 the cases especially even of the fighter 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.939
 furtive as always remember that it is very 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.920
 important that they participate to see if 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.050
 these prototypes are ready to be 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.969
 thrown in the next patch on the ct 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.320
 link is in the description given 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.360
 If you do not even know what 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.800
 is 7 so they can help and also 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.359
 to answer some questions these 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.609
 changes are not yet planned for 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.010
 leave in a patch in the official version 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.079
 they are simply in evidence but it is 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.640
 probable or is it rather possible that 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.010
 could leave for the next patch 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.809
 in March for the main game that 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.190
 depends on how much progress is made with these 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.809
 prototypes and that both help 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.859
 community and now we talk about the 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.289
 changes that come without saying 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.900
 well prototype number 2 which is the 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.090
 gp charge of leasing is that effect 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.620
 that you have when for example 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.840
 sell to an enemy by shooting behind 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.700
 coverage only adds part of your 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.320
 and still he can shoot them 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.420
 obviously real life that can not be 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.700
 you need to take the weapon above the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.950
 coverage to be able to shoot obviously 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.109
 this is not a mistake properly 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.000
 banfield is practically present in 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.280
 any game in which bullets do not 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.409
 come out of the gun barrel come out of the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.000
 eyes or at eye level this is because 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.490
 issues involved in this has been 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.109
 for quite a few years and if well 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.060
 for you who is shooting is much more 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:39.979
 easy to recognize that you can shoot in 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.079
 that coverage that you can see 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.670
 through your look you say oh ok I see me 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.039
 look free I can not shoot anything 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.259
 more that's to make life easier 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.959
 who is pulling but also carries 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.060
 on the other side of the coin where you say and 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.739
 that guy is shooting me behind 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.420
 coverage I only half of his 

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:59.149
 head and he can see me totally 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.340
 shoot me that's not fair is where 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.679
 enters the first change of the ct that are 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.530
 testing or rather the alpha stage of 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:09.259
 complete anti hedwing model this 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.390
 try that number one bullets 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.430
 now they come out completely from the canyon here if 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.560
 they leave the canyon at that height also the 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.090
 what will correspond correspond to see 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.890
 that the bullets will do exactly that 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.720
 this change applies to all 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.370
 weapons that are behind coverage and 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.590
 so that the player who is shooting 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.209
 do not find it so strange to say and 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.920
 why my bullets are striking on 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.630
 coverage when I see my enemy 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.140
 clearly the way he has been 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.640
 modified this behavior is that 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.010
 when you approach a 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.680
 coverage at a trigger level in the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.240
 that you would impact on the barrier 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.520
 that is in front and not the enemy 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.650
 directly the weapon is simply lowered 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.209
 if you decide to set your sights 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.980
 put the look but they will realize that 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.320
 continues to impact against the barrier that 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.450
 have in front of us we see that if we move the 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.730
 look a little further up where the canyon 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.769
 I could pass over that 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.959
 coverage now you can put the look 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.180
 without any problem and the bullets will go to 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.760
 beyond coverage I think that 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.160
 this change is excellent because how many 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.050
 Sometimes it seems unfair to you 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.850
 are trying to move forward and just 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.860
 the enemy is behind the boxes see 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.690
 in the middle of the head and then some do not 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.340
 you will find it very nice obviously 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.300
 here also takes away the fact that 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.860
 generally the user more 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.470
 experienced is the one who knows how to use 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.150
 that kind of barriers but obviously it 's 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.490
 a change that makes the game a little more 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.470
 realistic more balanced and what 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.540
 makes search for new and new coverages 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.610
 strategies I think it will be a bit of 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.930
 difficult to understand at first but at 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.490
 At the end of the day I think that all the 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.500
 world will get used and it will bring a 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.210
 much greater long-term benefit the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.950
 second prototype under test is the 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.130
 prototype number 4 concerning 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.800
 around the passing game in this case 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.840
 some of the most notorious changes is 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.240
 the control of fighters especially 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.590
 furtive in the base game in the game 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.390
 original in the young woman and there as 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.700
 want to say if you catch a fighter 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.770
 and they always maintain the speed of 313 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.720
 and they make turns they're always going to turn the 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.880
 optimum speed and they go to practically 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.010
 kick ass to any other 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.600
 player who does not know that speed 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.060
 changes now with the controls are that 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.860
 although you want to go faster your turn 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.960
 you will give faster if you want to go more 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.900
 slow the turn will be more closed but not 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.880
 there is a magic 313 that makes the 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.860
 turn is perfect this is a bit 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.959
 difficult to explain so more than anything 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.120
 I will tell you instead of the changes that 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.550
 they did or what text they give us that 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.290
 it's simple now it 's much harder 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.860
 maintain that speed if you're giving 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.660
 turns 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.030
 obviously you do not accelerate so easily 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.790
 because you have an inertia that 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.680
 circular sentence that does not let you advance 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.660
 or accelerate that vehicle your vehicle 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.370
 have to fight more strength and 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.370
 obviously you can not accelerate so easily 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.740
 then it makes the flight model be 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.690
 relatively more realistic too 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.730
 making it a little simpler for the 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.370
 novice players since more than looking 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.020
 a speed of 313 perfect like that 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.630
 you feel that the plane is dying in 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.910
 the turns as you decide to accelerate a 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.530
 little more braked even you say ok I'm going to 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.240
 slow down at this moment the enemy me 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.910
 comes chasing brakes as much as 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.620
 you can and the enemy can pass you by 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.170
 on the one hand because it did not accelerate 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.120
 the correct speed this makes the 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.270
 dogfighting not that fighting like 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.270
 they call it be more dynamic not 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.390
 only turn turn turn sm turn 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.880
 turn pretzel and scissors cut circle 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.710
 inverted and again we continue with what 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.380
 This means that the cases are not 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.330
 so perfect and meticulous with the 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.040
 speeds but make it more dynamic 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.960
 another change is about the post 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.720
 combustion or when you squeeze the 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.030
 key to run as infantry and already 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.840
 they see the stealth fighters comes a 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.760
 flare 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.949
 makes it accelerate faster and this 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.750
 only lasts approximately I want 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:46.520
 believe that the last change I leave in 7 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.400
 seconds and it takes to recharge 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.680
 completely other 7 that does not 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.840
 are infinitely squeezing flare 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.090
 brake flare brake flare brake 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.430
 then you say oh that here if 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.520
 I need all the power possible and 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.860
 better here I save the energy saving the 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.680
 post combustion saving the fuel and 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.120
 again makes fights between jets 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.310
 be more dynamic 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.010
 finally the changes around the 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.620
 vehicles have seen several changes 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.660
 maybe already about the rock that is not 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.220
 moves so fast the radio won the rifle 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.410
 magnetic sniper end 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.330
 are you stick like Mullah the fighters 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.610
 they have also modified certain things 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.770
 so that it is not so dangerous to fly 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.840
 around these weapons the change them 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.270
 sincerely I did not like the one of 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.000
 king with yes I liked also affected the 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.400
 way in how for example the cannons 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.139
 of the furtive cases work now 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.610
 they have to shoot those in bursts 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.320
 small so that the dispersion is 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.289
 minor as they do with weapons in 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.659
 solid ground and they have made every 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:49.189
 type of ammunition in the fighters have the 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:51.050
 same damage per second against 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:53.360
 vehicles but that are more specific 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.889
 towards what they are looking for what I 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.330
 I mean that for example the 20 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:59.180
 millimeters have given you an approach to 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:02.360
 very high speed for the bullet and that 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.039
 makes it more against helicopters by 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.319
 example that are much more goals 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:08.719
 mobile than any other that could 

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:11.270
 face in furtive cases the 25 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:13.550
 millimeters is more balanced is more like 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.409
 that focused against the infantry itself 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.360
 you want to shoot them there are also 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:18.919
 to notice that now the bullets of the 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.809
 cases make a small explosion 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:23.119
 around them therefore now 

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:25.039
 attacking the infantry is a little more 

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:27.050
 easy but not as easy as in 

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:28.909
 banfield 3 and finally the ammunition of 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.979
 30 millimeters which is more well designed 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:34.939
 against lightly armored vehicles 

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:36.919
 like jeeps trucks vans and so on and yes 

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:38.809
 well there are many more changes that have 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:40.699
 done in the ct I tried to summarize the most 

00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:42.409
 important of these two prototypes in 

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:44.419
 this video anything can go 

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:46.909
 directly to the ct to read the changes 

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:48.469
 and above all to help the community if 

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:50.300
 this informative video please give it 

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:51.800
 a rating if you are not subscribed 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.539
 consider doing it later 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.979
 the videos that I have in the channel the 

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:56.539
 social networks as always in the 

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:58.759
 screen in the description in all 

00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:01.120
 very recommended sides and see you in the 

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:01.120
