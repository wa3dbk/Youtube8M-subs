I enjoyed them

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.450

so<00:00:54.820> first<00:00:55.149> up<00:00:55.390> tennis<00:00:56.140> was<00:00:56.410> by<00:00:56.620> far<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.219> best

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
so first up tennis was by far the best

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.189 
so first up tennis was by far the best
of<00:00:57.609> the<00:00:57.760> bunch<00:00:57.879> it<00:00:58.300> controlled<00:00:58.719> just<00:00:58.899> like<00:00:59.079> the

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
of the bunch it controlled just like the

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.810 
of the bunch it controlled just like the
Wii<00:00:59.320> Sports<00:00:59.469> version<00:01:00.039> of<00:01:00.160> tennis<00:01:00.489> where<00:01:00.730> the

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
Wii Sports version of tennis where the

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.950 
Wii Sports version of tennis where the
characters<00:01:01.239> move<00:01:01.420> on<00:01:01.629> their<00:01:01.750> own

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
characters move on their own

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.450 
characters move on their own
and<00:01:02.289> swinging<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.679> racket<00:01:02.920> was<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.370> only

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
and swinging the racket was the only

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.650 
and swinging the racket was the only
thing<00:01:03.609> you<00:01:03.730> had<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:03.879> worry<00:01:03.969> about<00:01:04.210> it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
thing you had to worry about it

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.600 
thing you had to worry about it
controlled<00:01:05.110> perfectly<00:01:05.710> even<00:01:06.280> when<00:01:06.400> you<00:01:06.460> use

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
controlled perfectly even when you use

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.550 
controlled perfectly even when you use
the<00:01:06.760> gamepad<00:01:07.030> where<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:07.720> swipe<00:01:08.050> to<00:01:08.320> swing

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
the gamepad where you swipe to swing

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.920 
the gamepad where you swipe to swing
your<00:01:08.710> racket<00:01:08.860> it<00:01:09.310> read<00:01:09.670> it<00:01:09.790> really<00:01:10.030> well<00:01:10.330> it

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
your racket it read it really well it

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.600 
your racket it read it really well it
felt<00:01:11.110> like<00:01:11.230> I<00:01:11.350> really<00:01:11.620> had<00:01:11.830> control<00:01:12.250> over<00:01:12.280> the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
felt like I really had control over the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.360 
felt like I really had control over the
ball<00:01:12.790> soccer<00:01:13.630> if<00:01:14.470> you've<00:01:14.650> watched<00:01:14.860> my<00:01:15.010> reviews

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
ball soccer if you've watched my reviews

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.650 
ball soccer if you've watched my reviews
before<00:01:15.700> you<00:01:15.790> might<00:01:15.940> know<00:01:16.090> my<00:01:16.240> thoughts<00:01:16.480> on

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
before you might know my thoughts on

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.570 
before you might know my thoughts on
soccer<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:17.290> they're<00:01:17.410> not<00:01:17.530> very<00:01:17.590> favorable<00:01:18.040> I

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
soccer and they're not very favorable I

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.820 
soccer and they're not very favorable I
find<00:01:19.060> it<00:01:19.180> boring<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.750> repetitive<00:01:19.840> however

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
find it boring and repetitive however

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.860 
find it boring and repetitive however
this<00:01:21.040> game<00:01:21.250> controls<00:01:21.730> just<00:01:21.970> fine<00:01:22.240> it's<00:01:22.720> not

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
this game controls just fine it's not

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.690 
this game controls just fine it's not
really<00:01:23.140> gonna<00:01:23.260> be<00:01:23.440> a<00:01:23.470> high<00:01:23.710> scoring<00:01:24.070> game<00:01:24.370> and

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
really gonna be a high scoring game and

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.490 
really gonna be a high scoring game and
it's<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:24.880> bit<00:01:25.060> simplistic<00:01:25.300> but<00:01:25.960> for<00:01:26.170> what<00:01:26.350> it<00:01:26.470> is

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
it's a bit simplistic but for what it is

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.710 
it's a bit simplistic but for what it is
it's<00:01:27.190> enjoyable<00:01:27.730> at<00:01:28.180> least<00:01:28.300> for<00:01:28.510> a<00:01:28.540> little

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
it's enjoyable at least for a little

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.480 
it's enjoyable at least for a little
while<00:01:28.930> golf<00:01:29.440> plays<00:01:29.770> just<00:01:30.040> like<00:01:30.130> Wii<00:01:30.370> Sports

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
while golf plays just like Wii Sports

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.120 
while golf plays just like Wii Sports
golf<00:01:30.940> and<00:01:31.270> I<00:01:31.390> mean<00:01:31.660> it<00:01:31.810> plays<00:01:32.020> exactly<00:01:32.530> like<00:01:32.890> it

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
golf and I mean it plays exactly like it

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.800 
golf and I mean it plays exactly like it
however<00:01:33.580> since<00:01:33.820> I<00:01:33.940> think<00:01:34.000> it<00:01:34.210> had<00:01:34.330> great<00:01:34.570> play

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
however since I think it had great play

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.600 
however since I think it had great play
controls<00:01:35.230> on<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.440> Wii<00:01:35.560> Sports<00:01:35.740> that's<00:01:36.370> not

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
controls on the Wii Sports that's not

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.640 
controls on the Wii Sports that's not
really<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.910> bad<00:01:37.120> thing<00:01:37.450> racing<00:01:38.170> was<00:01:38.320> just<00:01:38.500> one

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
really a bad thing racing was just one

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.960 
really a bad thing racing was just one
of<00:01:38.740> those<00:01:38.830> ones<00:01:39.070> where<00:01:39.220> you<00:01:39.310> go<00:01:39.460> around<00:01:39.580> on<00:01:39.880> a

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
of those ones where you go around on a

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
pitching in the outfield just because it

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.309 
pitching in the outfield just because it
was<00:02:24.370> okay<00:02:24.819> at<00:02:25.000> best<00:02:25.030> in<00:02:25.690> order<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:26.020> pitch<00:02:26.140> the

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
was okay at best in order to pitch the

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.690 
was okay at best in order to pitch the
ball<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.650> have<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.860> draw<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.130> line<00:02:27.250> on<00:02:27.610> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
ball you have to draw a line on the

ball you have to draw a line on the
gamepad<00:02:28.150> where<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.510> want<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.840> throw<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.110> ball

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
gamepad where you want to throw the ball

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.320 
gamepad where you want to throw the ball
but<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:29.920> means<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.250> can<00:02:30.400> do<00:02:30.490> crazy<00:02:30.730> pitches

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
but that means you can do crazy pitches

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.120 
but that means you can do crazy pitches
but<00:02:31.720> something<00:02:32.020> as<00:02:32.140> simple<00:02:32.410> as<00:02:32.650> throwing<00:02:33.040> a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
but something as simple as throwing a

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.130 
but something as simple as throwing a
ball<00:02:33.310> really<00:02:33.580> fast<00:02:33.910> straight<00:02:34.540> down<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.900> plate

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
ball really fast straight down the plate

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.170 
ball really fast straight down the plate
was<00:02:35.560> much<00:02:35.830> harder<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.610> catch<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:37.000> ball<00:02:37.150> you

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
was much harder to catch the ball you

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.699 
was much harder to catch the ball you
have<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.420> hold<00:02:37.690> up<00:02:37.810> your<00:02:37.989> gamepad<00:02:38.410> like<00:02:38.590> you

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
have to hold up your gamepad like you

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.320 
have to hold up your gamepad like you
were<00:02:38.800> looking<00:02:39.160> for<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.370> ball<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.910> if<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.209> can

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
were looking for the ball and if you can

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.760 
were looking for the ball and if you can
find<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.690> ball<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.020> time<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.440> will<00:02:41.560> catch<00:02:41.739> it

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
find the ball in time you will catch it

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.070 
find the ball in time you will catch it
and<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.400> was<00:02:42.610> kind<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.239> clever<00:02:43.510> but<00:02:43.959> the

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
and that was kind of clever but the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.290 
and that was kind of clever but the
batting<00:02:44.590> was<00:02:44.770> just<00:02:45.220> awful

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
batting was just awful

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.120 
batting was just awful
unlike<00:02:46.720> Wii<00:02:46.900> Sports<00:02:47.080> which<00:02:47.500> didn't<00:02:47.890> have<00:02:48.010> the

this game does and it actually makes it

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
much worse and no time does it feel like

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.280 
much worse and no time does it feel like
you<00:02:55.090> had<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.269> control<00:02:55.450> on<00:02:55.810> how<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.019> were

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
you had the control on how you were

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.050 
you had the control on how you were
hitting<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.650> ball<00:02:56.890> because<00:02:57.489> all<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.730> swings

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
hitting the ball because all the swings

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.420 
hitting the ball because all the swings
felt<00:02:58.390> rough<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:58.959> unnatural<00:02:59.320> what's<00:03:00.190> even

worse was the very lazy outfielders when
you<00:03:03.010> hit<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.250> ball<00:03:03.370> more<00:03:03.610> times<00:03:03.850> than<00:03:04.000> not<00:03:04.060> the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
you hit the ball more times than not the

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.000 
you hit the ball more times than not the
outfielder<00:03:05.200> would<00:03:05.350> just<00:03:05.500> pick<00:03:05.650> up<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.860> ball

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
outfielder would just pick up the ball

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.710 
outfielder would just pick up the ball
and<00:03:06.250> throw<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.030> pitcher<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.540> you

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
and throw it to the pitcher and you

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.690 
and throw it to the pitcher and you
would<00:03:07.870> be<00:03:08.019> safe<00:03:08.200> at<00:03:08.380> first<00:03:08.650> even<00:03:09.280> if<00:03:09.370> he<00:03:09.459> headed

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
would be safe at first even if he headed

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.699 
would be safe at first even if he headed
to<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.910> first<00:03:10.150> baseman<00:03:10.750> he<00:03:11.170> would<00:03:11.290> throw<00:03:11.590> it

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
to the first baseman he would throw it

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.650 
to the first baseman he would throw it
to<00:03:11.830> another<00:03:12.100> base<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.730> ignore<00:03:13.060> me<00:03:13.239> as<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.540> got

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660

on<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.080> base<00:03:14.290> or<00:03:14.739> just<00:03:15.010> throw<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.400> the

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
on the base or just throw it to the

on the base or just throw it to the
pitcher<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.269> was<00:03:16.450> dumbfounding<00:03:17.140> on<00:03:17.260> how

stupid<00:03:18.010> these<00:03:18.160> outfielders<00:03:18.790> could<00:03:19.000> be<00:03:19.120> if

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
stupid these outfielders could be if
