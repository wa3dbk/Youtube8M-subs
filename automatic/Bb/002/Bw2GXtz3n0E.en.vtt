and of course we'll just go over it one
by<00:00:31.630> one<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.680> of<00:00:36.010> course<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.820> first<00:00:36.850> thing<00:00:37.149> I

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
by one so of course the first thing I

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
wanted to show you guys was the valve

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.420 
wanted to show you guys was the valve
itself<00:00:40.530> now<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.559> couple<00:00:41.890> things<00:00:42.010> about<00:00:42.160> this

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
itself now a couple things about this

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.130 
itself now a couple things about this
valve<00:00:42.640> is<00:00:42.879> going<00:00:43.149> to<00:00:43.270> look<00:00:43.449> pretty<00:00:43.629> similar<00:00:44.110> to

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
valve is going to look pretty similar to

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.380 
valve is going to look pretty similar to
your<00:00:44.379> stock<00:00:44.620> valve<00:00:44.859> this<00:00:45.039> is<00:00:45.160> actually<00:00:45.520> for

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
your stock valve this is actually for

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.709 
your stock valve this is actually for
the<00:00:46.420> weight<00:00:46.719> plus<00:00:47.020> WRX<00:00:47.800> and<00:00:47.920> models<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.579> so<00:00:49.449> of

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
the weight plus WRX and models and so of

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.860 
the weight plus WRX and models and so of
course<00:00:49.899> it<00:00:50.079> comes<00:00:50.170> with<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.680> gasket<00:00:51.430> here

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
course it comes with the gasket here

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.689 
course it comes with the gasket here
nice<00:00:52.870> thick<00:00:53.199> flange<00:00:53.800> I'll<00:00:54.129> see<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.489> see<00:00:54.640> it

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
nice thick flange I'll see and see it

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.259 
nice thick flange I'll see and see it
aluminum<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.890> course<00:00:57.219> we've<00:00:57.370> got<00:00:57.399> me<00:00:57.670> go<00:00:57.969> fast

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
aluminum of course we've got me go fast

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.990 
aluminum of course we've got me go fast
bits<00:00:58.600> logo<00:00:59.079> up<00:00:59.320> there<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.800> then<00:01:00.010> response<00:01:00.730> I

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
bits logo up there and then response I

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.020 
bits logo up there and then response I
really<00:01:01.359> pronounced<00:01:01.660> that<00:01:01.780> response<00:01:02.410> response

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
really pronounced that response response

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.840 
really pronounced that response response
maybe<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.080> S<00:01:05.229> is<00:01:05.470> silent<00:01:05.500> possibly<00:01:06.250> not<00:01:06.580> quite

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
maybe the S is silent possibly not quite

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.880 
maybe the S is silent possibly not quite
sure<00:01:06.880> on<00:01:07.150> that<00:01:07.210> but<00:01:07.720> you<00:01:08.080> can<00:01:08.259> adjust<00:01:08.350> the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
sure on that but you can adjust the

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.160 
sure on that but you can adjust the
spring<00:01:09.369> tension<00:01:09.759> or<00:01:09.880> preload<00:01:10.270> up<00:01:10.720> here<00:01:10.990> with

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
spring tension or preload up here with

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.230 
spring tension or preload up here with
this<00:01:11.380> adjustment<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.580> what<00:01:12.850> I<00:01:12.880> like<00:01:13.090> about

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
this adjustment and what I like about

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.609 
this adjustment and what I like about
this<00:01:13.450> is<00:01:13.600> this<00:01:13.689> valve<00:01:13.960> is<00:01:14.080> easily

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
this is this valve is easily

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:15.660 
this is this valve is easily
disassembled

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
disassembled

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.520 
disassembled
just<00:01:16.150> using<00:01:16.479> these<00:01:16.600> up<00:01:16.900> here<00:01:17.200> and<00:01:17.350> then<00:01:17.439> the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
just using these up here and then the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.719 
just using these up here and then the
whole<00:01:17.650> thing<00:01:17.890> comes<00:01:18.100> apart<00:01:18.250> so<00:01:18.610> you<00:01:18.700> can

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
whole thing comes apart so you can

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.429 
whole thing comes apart so you can
service<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.180> clean<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.479> toilet<00:01:19.810> whatever<00:01:20.320> you

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
service it clean a toilet whatever you

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.010 
service it clean a toilet whatever you
want<00:01:20.590> to<00:01:20.680> do<00:01:20.829> and<00:01:21.610> my<00:01:22.090> favorite<00:01:22.720> part<00:01:22.869> about

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
want to do and my favorite part about

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.319 
want to do and my favorite part about
this<00:01:23.290> valve<00:01:23.560> of<00:01:23.829> course<00:01:24.280> is<00:01:24.759> this<00:01:25.060> I<00:01:25.240> don't

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
this valve of course is this I don't

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:26.069 
this valve of course is this I don't
know<00:01:25.420> if<00:01:25.450> you<00:01:25.540> guys<00:01:25.630> are<00:01:25.750> gonna<00:01:25.840> be<00:01:25.930> able<00:01:25.990> to

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
know if you guys are gonna be able to

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.649 
know if you guys are gonna be able to
see<00:01:26.259> this<00:01:26.380> very<00:01:26.590> well<00:01:26.829> you<00:01:27.520> can<00:01:27.700> spin<00:01:28.210> this<00:01:28.420> did

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
see this very well you can spin this did

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.030 
see this very well you can spin this did
you<00:01:28.689> see<00:01:28.930> that<00:01:29.079> and<00:01:29.740> watch<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.810> opens<00:01:32.229> up<00:01:32.380> so

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
you see that and watch that opens up so

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.520 
you see that and watch that opens up so
you<00:01:33.070> can<00:01:33.310> make<00:01:33.579> this<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:34.149> fully<00:01:34.810> recirculating

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
you can make this a fully recirculating

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.090 
you can make this a fully recirculating
a<00:01:35.939> fully<00:01:36.939> atmospheric<00:01:37.659> for<00:01:37.899> a<00:01:37.930> 50/50<00:01:38.710> valve<00:01:38.920> or

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
a fully atmospheric for a 50/50 valve or

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.080 
a fully atmospheric for a 50/50 valve or
anywhere<00:01:39.610> in<00:01:39.640> between

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
anywhere in between

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.819 
anywhere in between
I<00:01:40.509> don't<00:01:41.020> want<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.200> say<00:01:41.320> it's<00:01:41.470> infinitely

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
I don't want to say it's infinitely

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.620 
I don't want to say it's infinitely
adjustable<00:01:42.159> because<00:01:42.700> obviously<00:01:43.149> you<00:01:43.479> don't

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
adjustable because obviously you don't

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.109 
adjustable because obviously you don't
have<00:01:43.780> infinite<00:01:44.560> adjustment<00:01:45.130> in<00:01:45.219> a<00:01:45.310> 360<00:01:45.939> degree

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
have infinite adjustment in a 360 degree

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.690 
have infinite adjustment in a 360 degree
rotation<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.890> it's<00:01:48.009> about<00:01:48.159> as<00:01:48.280> close<00:01:48.460> to

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
rotation but it's about as close to

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.910 
rotation but it's about as close to
infinite<00:01:49.180> as<00:01:49.329> you<00:01:49.570> can<00:01:49.780> get<00:01:49.990> just<00:01:50.229> very<00:01:50.619> very

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
infinite as you can get just very very

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.160 
infinite as you can get just very very
cool<00:01:51.159> so<00:01:51.640> you<00:01:51.700> can<00:01:51.880> kind<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.119> mess<00:01:52.689> around<00:01:52.869> with

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
cool so you can kind of mess around with

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.289 
cool so you can kind of mess around with
it<00:01:53.320> see<00:01:53.560> how<00:01:53.649> your<00:01:53.860> car<00:01:54.040> responds<00:01:54.610> see<00:01:55.119> how<00:01:55.210> it

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
it see how your car responds see how it
