Berlin actually completely screwless

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.960

looks<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> semi<00:00:43.770> mini<00:00:44.010> frame<00:00:44.309> doesn't<00:00:44.790> it

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
looks like a semi mini frame doesn't it

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.119 
looks like a semi mini frame doesn't it
but<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:45.750> actually<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> rim<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.589> goes<00:00:46.979> all

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
but it's actually the rim it goes all

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.710 
but it's actually the rim it goes all
the<00:00:47.159> way<00:00:47.220> around<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.699> sits<00:00:48.030> inside<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.540> lens

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
the way around it sits inside the lens

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.210 
the way around it sits inside the lens
the<00:00:48.960> lens<00:00:49.080> will<00:00:49.290> never<00:00:49.440> pop<00:00:49.650> out<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.070> you

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
the lens will never pop out on you

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.460 
the lens will never pop out on you
there's<00:00:50.970> no<00:00:51.059> screws<00:00:51.600> anywhere<00:00:52.080> in<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.229> frame

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
there's no screws anywhere in the frame

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.890 
there's no screws anywhere in the frame
and<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.339> completely<00:00:53.790> flexible<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.479> mean<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
and it's completely flexible I mean you

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.899 
and it's completely flexible I mean you
know<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.229> just<00:00:55.379> bonkers<00:00:55.979> it<00:00:56.190> really<00:00:56.519> is<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
know it's just bonkers it really is and

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.710 
know it's just bonkers it really is and
it's<00:00:57.720> so<00:00:57.900> lightweight<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.860> also<00:00:59.430> the<00:01:00.000> color<00:01:00.360> I

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
it's so lightweight and also the color I

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.930 
it's so lightweight and also the color I
mean<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.440> color<00:01:01.769> on<00:01:01.830> this<00:01:02.070> plane<00:01:02.339> will<00:01:02.729> never

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
mean this color on this plane will never

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.070 
mean this color on this plane will never
chip<00:01:03.239> off<00:01:03.449> flank

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
chip off flank

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.750 
chip off flank
because<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:04.979> done<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.280> gases<00:01:05.610> at<00:01:05.729> high

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
because it's done with gases at high

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.120 
because it's done with gases at high
temperature<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.600> cooled<00:01:06.840> down<00:01:06.990> rapidly<00:01:07.380> you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
temperature and cooled down rapidly you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.010 
temperature and cooled down rapidly you
know<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.640> drop<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.060> concrete<00:01:09.270> step<00:01:09.810> on

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
know if you drop it on concrete step on

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.250 
know if you drop it on concrete step on
it

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.170 
it
yeah<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.619> could<00:01:10.770> scratch<00:01:11.190> you<00:01:11.820> know<00:01:11.940> but<00:01:12.090> it's

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
yeah it could scratch you know but it's

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.630 
yeah it could scratch you know but it's
like<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.510> not<00:01:12.690> gonna<00:01:12.869> chip<00:01:13.140> or<00:01:13.290> flake<00:01:13.640> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
like it's not gonna chip or flake the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.020 
like it's not gonna chip or flake the
frame<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.299> entirely<00:01:15.810> made<00:01:16.020> out<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.550> what<00:01:17.550> front

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
frame is entirely made out of what front

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.730 
frame is entirely made out of what front
is<00:01:18.150> entirely<00:01:18.510> made<00:01:18.690> out<00:01:18.870> of<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.140> piece<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
is entirely made out of one piece and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.530 
is entirely made out of one piece and
the<00:01:19.920> arms<00:01:20.250> are<00:01:20.430> two<00:01:20.820> separate<00:01:21.090> pieces<00:01:21.240> but

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the arms are two separate pieces but

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.900 
the arms are two separate pieces but
yeah<00:01:21.900> front<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:22.860> made<00:01:23.010> out<00:01:23.160> of<00:01:23.190> one<00:01:23.430> piece<00:01:23.460> so

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
yeah front it's made out of one piece so

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.220 
yeah front it's made out of one piece so
even<00:01:24.360> these<00:01:24.480> bits<00:01:24.750> here

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
even these bits here

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.840 
even these bits here
there's<00:01:25.440> no<00:01:25.590> soldering<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.280> all<00:01:26.460> which<00:01:26.640> means

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
there's no soldering at all which means

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.140 
there's no soldering at all which means
it's<00:01:27.120> pretty<00:01:27.690> unlikely<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:29.220> break<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:30.030> know

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
it's pretty unlikely to break you know

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.000 
it's pretty unlikely to break you know
obviously<00:01:30.510> if<00:01:30.690> you're<00:01:30.810> gonna<00:01:30.900> keep<00:01:31.140> twisting

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
obviously if you're gonna keep twisting

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.040 
obviously if you're gonna keep twisting
it<00:01:32.190> around<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.760> flexing<00:01:33.390> all<00:01:33.480> over<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> place

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
it around and flexing all over the place

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.100 
it around and flexing all over the place
maybe<00:01:34.950> after<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> year<00:01:35.880> or<00:01:35.910> two<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.600> could<00:01:36.630> break

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
maybe after a year or two it could break

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.540 
maybe after a year or two it could break
but<00:01:37.410> it's<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.040> you're<00:01:38.220> going<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.400> do

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
but it's not like you're going to do

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.130 
but it's not like you're going to do
