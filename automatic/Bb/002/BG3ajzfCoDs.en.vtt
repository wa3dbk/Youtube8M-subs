00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.970
[Intro: Alyssa Marie]
You have no idea who i am

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.970
But I'm going to respond anyway
Aye

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:08.970
[Verse: Alyssa Marie]
Mr. Lamar

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.970
Listen, for all the rappers mad cause you
missed 'em

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.120
Or pissed cause they thought your list wasn't
finished,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.500
That harbor feelings of bitterness
Hearts that's littered with scars

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.119
From the written bars that they took to it
Looking too far and intricately into it

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.970
See everyone gonna be quick to diss be ready
to get it in fifty fifty

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.349
Spitters and listeners both, you knew that
the shit was risky

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.769
From people who misunderstood it for dissing
the people you listed

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.960
To the irrelevant rappers you didn't consider
thinking you skip 'em deliberately

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.749
Then the ignorant ones that's screaming out
blasphemy

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:34.820
Kendrick's king of New York but from Cali?

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.820
(what?)

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.820
the audacity
That's where the half of these problems spawn

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.270
They heard the words but ignored the context
and react but they got it wrong

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.950
Like you calling out Rocky, Sean, Jay Electron,
Drake, and the rest of 'em?

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.350
Sure, but you're really making the best of
'em

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.050
Surface, cause nothing's making a rapper snap
on a record worse

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.320
Than name drops in a verse that lethal, public,
and personal

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.550
Everyone one of us cursed with competitive
pens

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.090
Imperious egos, said that he's better than
me?

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.490
(oh..) never again
Bet, in the end...that competition's the only

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.620
thing that can save us
Making sure we're so high even heaven's left

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.309
in our angel dust
Is how the game became what it was

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.860
The hunger pains plaguing the stomach of artists
paving the way with their blood

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.760
So wake up
I think that's the message Kendrick intended

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.720
If not, I'll send it myself, been through
hell of entering benched

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.590
Having to prove that I'm better before ever
touching the field

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.470
So I know from experience you won't grow with
nothing to build

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.210
That's why we're stuck in a still frame
Who cares about who's the realest

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.210
Who's rocking realest chain?!

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.620
Who's pocket is spilling change?!

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.030
Who's dropping the illest lyrics?

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.030
(no.)

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.030
Who's words you're really feeling (no.)

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.700
Who's flow is the most appealing?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.700
(no,no.)

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.510
The ceilings low nobody's standing to raise
it without a challenge

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.510
We're stagnant, when there's no talent to
outshine, and no balance

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.600
To keep it's about time that reach to a change
Inspire each other to even if it means we're

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.760
speaking their names
And calling 'em out sometimes you gotta be

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.700
the hero in a villains mask
An arrow aiming at the throne, the narrow

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.400
thinkers sit and laugh
But who's the joke really on?

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.400
silly pawns..

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.210
We can say to appreciate it, but you won't
until it's gone

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.950
Mr. Lamar, if I'm wrong and that song was
only to flex

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.170
You still lit a spark in this genre, for that
you own the respect

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.659
For that we owe you the debt and we'll pay
it with change

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.200
Not with the dollars, not gonna follow their
ways with the same

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.599
Pace, it's a race I'm dropping 'em all
Maltese to the rot wilder

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.670
Got leashes and shock collars no peace/piece
for the shot callers

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.670
They're calling it beef..I'm okay with that
Cause they'll always try to make it that

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.020
But they took our lane we just want to take
it back

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.770
Maybe that's how we can take his verse
In every game, a little competition makes

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.770
the players work
So let's go.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.770
[Outro: Alyssa Marie]
This is hip hop

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:36.500
You must have forgot that
I got love for big shots and pop rap

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:47.090
Corner freestylers, hobby rhymers, 'round
the clock acts

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:58.890
In life we can be cool, behind the mic is
where that stops at

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.340
This is my lane
I'm sorry you ain't know that

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.730
But you became my target once you drove passed
I'm not trying to take shots, I keep it peaceful

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:31.880
Just don't take that as a weakness cause there's
nothing I'm-a hold back.
