00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
off blew up my turbo was blown when I

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.810 
off blew up my turbo was blown when I
got<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.110> didn't<00:00:43.350> know<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:46.820> here's

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
got it but I didn't know that so here's

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.190 
got it but I didn't know that so here's
the<00:00:48.030> trick<00:00:48.270> Omega

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the trick Omega

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:58.490 
the trick Omega
it's<00:00:50.010> an<00:00:50.100> SR<00:00:52.129> 20s<00:00:53.129> 13<00:00:53.489> red<00:00:53.670> top<00:00:54.649> t25<00:00:55.850> turbo<00:00:57.500> so

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
it's an SR 20s 13 red top t25 turbo so

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.110 
it's an SR 20s 13 red top t25 turbo so
on<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> stock<00:00:59.070> CA<00:00:59.340> manifold

on the stock CA manifold

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.349 
on the stock CA manifold
I<00:01:00.980> organized<00:01:01.980> all<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> bolts<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.879> parts<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
I organized all the bolts and parts and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.050 
I organized all the bolts and parts and
 this<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.790> o2<00:01:06.270> sensor<00:01:06.900> right<00:01:07.049> there

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
 this on o2 sensor right there

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.899 
 this on o2 sensor right there
wastegate<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.810> off<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.610> going<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> get<00:01:11.760> some

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
wastegate just off on going to get some

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.300 
wastegate just off on going to get some
stainless<00:01:12.360> steel<00:01:12.570> lines<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.880> here's<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
stainless steel lines and here's the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:29.830 
stainless steel lines and here's the
shaft<00:01:17.310> li<00:01:19.280> see<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.090> here

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:48.980 

very<00:01:30.840> much<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.590> little<00:01:32.400> bit<00:01:32.549> noticeable<00:01:33.380> but

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.050 

spins<00:01:49.990> freely<00:01:50.229> still<00:01:50.650> that's<00:01:51.280> good<00:01:51.580> so<00:01:51.970> the

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
spins freely still that's good so the

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.420 
spins freely still that's good so the
wheel<00:01:52.210> run<00:01:52.420> damage<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:56.049> every<00:01:56.799> time<00:01:57.040> I'd<00:01:57.280> get

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
wheel run damage but every time I'd get

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.020 
wheel run damage but every time I'd get
on<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.200> lit<00:01:59.650> off<00:01:59.860> man<00:02:00.220> I'd<00:02:00.430> smoke<00:02:00.759> like

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030
