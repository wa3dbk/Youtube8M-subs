00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
bow

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.059 
bow
so<00:00:05.100> if<00:00:05.250> we<00:00:05.490> start<00:00:05.850> right<00:00:06.180> around<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:07.440> area<00:00:07.770> of

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
so if we start right around this area of

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.459 
so if we start right around this area of
the<00:00:08.160> boat<00:00:08.370> we're<00:00:08.670> getting<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.120> tip<00:00:09.469> we're

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
the boat we're getting to the tip we're

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.020 
the boat we're getting to the tip we're
splitting<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.070> bone<00:00:11.280> into<00:00:11.429> three<00:00:11.639> parts<00:00:11.790> so

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
splitting this bone into three parts so

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.060 
splitting this bone into three parts so
with<00:00:12.840> swinging<00:00:13.290> three<00:00:13.559> notes<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.920> might

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
with swinging three notes you might

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.220 
with swinging three notes you might
start<00:00:14.370> maybe<00:00:14.580> here<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.179> then<00:00:15.630> split<00:00:16.020> this

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
start maybe here and then split this

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.870 
start maybe here and then split this
into<00:00:16.529> three<00:00:16.890> different<00:00:17.220> parts

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
into three different parts

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.480 
into three different parts
so<00:00:18.449> one<00:00:18.810> note<00:00:19.020> one<00:00:19.050> note<00:00:19.289> one<00:00:19.740> note<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.189> then

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
so one note one note one note and then

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.550 
so one note one note one note and then
the<00:00:20.580> same<00:00:20.760> thing<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.240> other<00:00:21.359> way<00:00:21.449> now<00:00:22.350> make

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
the same thing the other way now make

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.830 
the same thing the other way now make
sure<00:00:22.590> when<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:23.039> do<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.510> that<00:00:24.510> you're<00:00:24.630> not

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
moderate tempo now watch to make sure

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.020 
moderate tempo now watch to make sure
that<00:01:44.979> you're<00:01:45.159> slurring<00:01:47.369> into<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.460> next<00:01:48.820> slur

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
that you're slurring into the next slur

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.999 
that you're slurring into the next slur
correctly<00:01:49.600> so<00:01:49.899> you're<00:01:50.049> going<00:01:50.439> three<00:01:50.799> down

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
correctly so you're going three down

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.130 
correctly so you're going three down
three<00:01:51.039> up<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:51.850> not<00:01:52.000> stopping<00:01:52.329> so<00:01:52.689> that's<00:01:52.869> take

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
three up and not stopping so that's take

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.660 
three up and not stopping so that's take
practice<00:01:53.560> let's<00:01:54.159> try<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.399> from<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.640> top

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
practice let's try it from the top

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.930 
practice let's try it from the top
moderate<00:01:55.210> tempo

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940
