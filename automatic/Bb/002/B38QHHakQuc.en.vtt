how<00:00:00.269> can<00:00:00.630> you<00:00:00.659> maximize<00:00:01.170> what<00:00:02.159> we<00:00:02.280> call<00:00:02.490> eyes

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
how can you maximize what we call eyes

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.390 
how can you maximize what we call eyes
on<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.240> target<00:00:03.680> maximize<00:00:04.680> eyes<00:00:04.950> on<00:00:05.310> the

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
on the target maximize eyes on the

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.460 
on the target maximize eyes on the
target<00:00:05.460> so<00:00:06.000> what<00:00:06.150> happens<00:00:06.629> is<00:00:06.870> we've

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
target so what happens is we've

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.530 
target so what happens is we've
developed<00:00:07.830> come<00:00:08.309> on<00:00:08.460> down<00:00:08.610> here<00:00:08.760> Lex<00:00:08.970> we

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
developed come on down here Lex we

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.370 
developed come on down here Lex we
develop<00:00:10.849> away<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.389> when<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.660> ball<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:12.900> coming

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
develop away so when the ball is coming

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.980 
develop away so when the ball is coming

what we do we teach them not to do that
we<00:00:37.649> teach<00:00:37.920> them<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.700> ball<00:00:38.879> gets<00:00:39.390> roughly

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
we teach them as the ball gets roughly

we teach them as the ball gets roughly
about<00:00:39.870> two<00:00:40.140> feet<00:00:40.350> away<00:00:40.500> she<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
about two feet away she now is going to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.610 
about two feet away she now is going to
look<00:00:41.850> at<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.390> rim<00:00:42.570> knows<00:00:42.809> how<00:00:42.989> she<00:00:43.050> turns<00:00:43.440> your

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
look at the rim knows how she turns your

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.740 
look at the rim knows how she turns your
head<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.280> she's<00:00:44.489> getting<00:00:44.760> max<00:00:45.059> amount<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.510> time

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
head so she's getting max amount of time

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.290 
head so she's getting max amount of time
to<00:00:46.320> put<00:00:46.559> eyes<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.489> target<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> rim

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
to put eyes on the target at the rim

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.209 
to put eyes on the target at the rim
ball<00:00:48.870> still<00:00:49.170> go<00:00:49.320> coming<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> same<00:00:50.039> spot

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
ball still go coming to the same spot

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.490 
ball still go coming to the same spot
she<00:00:50.910> puts<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> into<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.539> comfort<00:00:51.989> zone<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.379> she

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
she puts it into a comfort zone and she

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.650 
she puts it into a comfort zone and she
gets<00:00:52.649> ready<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.949> take<00:00:53.100> her<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> shot<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:54.420> is

gets ready to take her a shot that is

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.090 
gets ready to take her a shot that is
crucial<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.199> talking<00:00:55.469> about<00:00:55.530> getting<00:00:55.860> times

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
crucial we talking about getting times

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.180 
crucial we talking about getting times
off<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.550> difference<00:00:57.000> between<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:58.190> as

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
off the difference between that is as

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.860 
off the difference between that is as
the<00:00:59.699> ball<00:00:59.879> is<00:00:59.910> coming<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.570> difference

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
the ball is coming the difference

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.180 
the ball is coming the difference
between<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> when<00:01:01.590> she<00:01:01.680> gets<00:01:01.710> waked<00:01:02.070> the

between that is when she gets waked the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.009 
between that is when she gets waked the
shot<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.609> chicken<00:01:02.969> you're<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> get

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
shot is chicken you're not going to get

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.719 
shot is chicken you're not going to get
there<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.320> time<00:01:04.350> whereas<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.070> she<00:01:05.309> takes<00:01:05.460> time

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
there in time whereas if she takes time

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.960 
there in time whereas if she takes time
to<00:01:05.850> get<00:01:06.030> there<00:01:06.150> find<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.720> rim<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.140> then<00:01:07.970> just

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
to get there find the rim and then just

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.090 
to get there find the rim and then just
how<00:01:09.150> far<00:01:09.390> she<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.780> did<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.650> ready<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> get
