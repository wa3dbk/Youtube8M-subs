00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.330
 we will comment that you use a good touch 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.100
 I know you see many videos of people 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.050
 urinating without protections but they are 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.840
 professionals they will already know what 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.820
 does when we introduce an object between 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.190
 two wheels a curious effect occurs 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.900
 both wheels rotate in senses 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.150
 opposites 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.160
 you can not see all of us 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.740
 step on a branch when we go skating and 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.900
 the skate is blocked this can we 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.230
 serve to perform some tricks of 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.230
 freestyle 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.910
 Y 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.760
 to dominate your life where you have the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.799
 wheels will usually be easier if 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.799
 between the second and third 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.979
 wheel learns with one leg and then with 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.080
 the other one presses backwards when leaving and 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.550
 remember that as a whole I jump what 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.140
 important is also the reception 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.510
 use your pictures as shock absorbers 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.340
 when you already dominate nailing between 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.800
 second and the third wheel starts at 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.000
 climb the other foot first one and then the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.000
 another do not hurry 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.730
 You can put both feet at the same time 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.130
 remember to keep your foot at about 45 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.110
 degrees with respect to the ground but instead of 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.110
 to nail what you do is to climb the step 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.560
 good 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.560
 Y 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.060
 to learn to turn around first 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.060
 learn with one foot and then you will already 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.080
 now
