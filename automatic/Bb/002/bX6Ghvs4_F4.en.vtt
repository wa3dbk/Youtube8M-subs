00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.290
 hi all we are left a good plan 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.060
 for the debrief with the other good evening 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.040
 claude good evening thierry good evening all 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.090
 world the csp lost his head tonight 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.349
 after this defeat 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.900
 bad operation for limougeauds 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.029
 90 72 for nanterre stunt 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.380
 first home defeat for the csp 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.660
 then notary who is really 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.520
 impressed bah listens and once 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.500
 is not customary I'm going a little bit more 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.410
 maybe talked about early or nanterre 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.739
 who tonight made the perfect match 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.690
 what a pleasure to see them play so that has 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.430
 always been my club after the csp my 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.510
 heart club nanterre because I love 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.450
 what they have done for years 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.860
 I love the game that offers so it's 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.250
 true that we saw what it was that the 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.230
 basketball a very fast game a 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.180
 exceptional ball circulation and 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.290
 especially a phenomenal address since 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.700
 55% success and 22 in which 12 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.260
 out of 22 at three points 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.900
 already that explains a lot of things 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.979
 still players rai the schuller 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.180
 who likes beaublanc people who 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.399
 are always hurting where you have it 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.899
 said nanterre's big address and for 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.479
 limoges it was much more complicated 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.670
 yes we have been deluded during a 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.680
 half time since there were only three 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.360
 point half-time 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.340
 a half time where we make a good first 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.140
 quarter time it's a very nice match 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.600
 basketball on both sides and very good bath 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.500
 players on change have been changed on 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.200
 rhythm has gone down 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.210
 and there it is true that we took we took 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.549
 water from all over took the water with 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.810
 four points of nanterre and then there is 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.560
 always a player at nanterre where the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.960
 pain 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.790
 riley stone prioux wings too and that 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.220
 ping underneath and two because it got him 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.960
 always found the key to % play his 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.090
 team yes but one in earth the 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.979
 difference between for me on this match 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.470
 fundamental between nanterre and sunday 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.360
 is that ball circulation of 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.070
 nanterre about the systems they have who 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.619
 are nanterre is a team that plays 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.299
 very wide with corridors it leaves 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.830
 corridors to make them a contract 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.530
 that they do very well then after they 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.189
 stand out the ball so we nos 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.729
 systems 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:13.189
 we make them to two by the hour so that's 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.900
 been shouting today we never 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:17.330
 found a good shooting position 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.430
 jamar is increasingly being watched 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.799
 so very complicated to find him there 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.200
 never an easy shoot on this cover 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.240
 March of Malawi it does not surprise me that does not 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.480
 do not surprise me 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.550
 e then for me today there 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.880
 no photo there is no photo is what 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.040
 it's tiredness is what it is 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.260
 thought maybe a little too beautiful there 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.940
 has things that will have to rework 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.620
 I admit that it worries me a little 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.350
 shortly after us before our move 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.770
 of the week by cutting them off a whole 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.660
 canton 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.950
 this is the first defeat at home this 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.090
 always hurts also to lose to 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.250
 home this invincibility 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.960
 yes, well, that must have happened one day 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.640
 we still have 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.470
 let's not forget won over to our lands 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.210
 gained in strasbourg gragnague ravine 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.010
 close up the soup by cons by 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.020
 against we lose the point which can 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.730
 to be disabling but good the essential 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.320
 for me is to finish in the four 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.460
 first 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.410
 that this match serves as a lesson a big 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.970
 satisfaction in this match for me and 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.640
 I think I'm saying it now to 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.790
 every debrief the game quality of 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.950
 zerbo tonight who was with nobel the 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.260
 ground to be at its level this point for 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.000
 Frejus 11 points and especially 14 of 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.710
 waltzes and in a play time when 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.580
 even he has he played a little more 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:33.420
 good when jean-marc after trying not 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.600
 a lot of things he tried to play 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.700
 five little ones ie moerman and I have 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.180
 had the ball inside he tried 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.990
 even of me now I have a hole on his 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.920
 name it's a little better 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:53.280
 it'll come back to me I'll get there 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.510
 excuse me will cut camara and at 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.210
 post 5 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.510
 but nothing good did nanterre a 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.760
 unrolled with a nanterre it's a 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.700
 team if you want to let play 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.650
 their pace and want you i'm going 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.720
 not say put brown but very 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.060
 solid it is they who impose their 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.780
 rhythm and there you are dead and tonight 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.920
 we saw what did pascal donnadieu 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.350
 for some time for me there is 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.790
 nanterre it will become one of my favorites 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.140
 for the title 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.060
 best attack of the championship 90 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.310
 points again we've seen it rolls 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.540
 everywhere in all directions does this 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.880
 third quarter time the csp takes on 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.220
 minus 22 there is a bronca what can it 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.920
 also influence the arbitration a little 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.870
 little we were told that no it was necessary 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.220
 not hide behind that me when we 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.410
 takes 90 72 and it's cheap paid because 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.970
 that our rivers in the end went well 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.600
 there have been decisions but there are 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.000
 decisions 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.980
 I think in particular a huge fault of 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.070
 zerbo on shalit and who goes to the counters 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.770
 or just fresh shears her arms 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.080
 sap was whistled there so we have to stop 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.510
 to hide behind the arbitration that has 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.920
 been a little weird at times but I 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.750
 mean an arbitration of a dinner a 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.420
 weekend on the other sabari of a match 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.250
 on the other savary and especially do we 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.970
 let's not hide behind such arguments 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.790
 who who for me would be unwelcome on a 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.200
 defeat of this magnitude in the csp a 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.280
 been a ton below tonight 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.500
 unfortunately lets believe that it's going 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.750
 get better next Monday facing 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.760
 villeurbanne for the return of the prey 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.720
 before that when we announce in section 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.460
 from Europe we saw it was in the middle of 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.410
 week the csp who can in case of 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.660
 win to contout eventually do 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.250
 a step closer to a win at caen 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.500
 everything would be forgiven a validation 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.200
 almost to go further now 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.560
 I saw playing when all here the 11 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.720
 points that we put them metayer president 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.250
 it's a bit far- fetched 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.380
 a lot of luck winning 11 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.250
 points so that's fine we did a very 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.669
 good money time 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.030
 now we know that the csp in section 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:02.030
 from Europe outside it's complicated 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.860
 so it's true that relying on the 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.780
 today's match by getting back into 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.240
 question by putting one's head back to 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.310
 the place 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.900
 maybe the players will react and 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.450
 who are going to make the match he has to 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.070
 do it all but be careful 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.350
 attention because when or 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.950
 villeurbanne 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:24.110
 if we bounce not seen what I have 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.480
 felt tonight the sequel can be 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.090
 complicated over the next two 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.380
 matches we hope that the suspect is going 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.150
 bounce we will follow that in any case 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.560
 thank you very much for this analysis 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.210
 this new debrief we find ourselves very 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.540
 quickly on the site is limoges csp to 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.830
 soon 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.830
 see you soon good evening
