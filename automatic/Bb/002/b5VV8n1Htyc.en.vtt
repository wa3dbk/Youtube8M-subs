00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.620 
didn't really have much to talk about
mainly<00:03:36.459> because<00:03:36.610> of<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.910> time<00:03:37.090> constriction

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
mainly because of the time constriction

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.160 
mainly because of the time constriction
of<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.750> video<00:03:38.050> itself<00:03:38.640> so<00:03:39.640> if<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.390> guys<00:03:40.570> would
