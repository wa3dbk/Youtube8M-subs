to<00:00:42.430> use<00:00:42.579> this<00:00:43.480> is<00:00:43.660> like<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:43.809> knockoff<00:00:44.350> pipe<00:00:44.620> by<00:00:44.770> a

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
to use this is like a knockoff pipe by a

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.150 
to use this is like a knockoff pipe by a
basket<00:00:45.250> pipe<00:00:45.460> I<00:00:45.640> picked<00:00:45.880> up<00:00:46.030> a<00:00:46.239> long<00:00:46.570> time<00:00:46.600> ago

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
basket pipe I picked up a long time ago

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.440 
basket pipe I picked up a long time ago
it's<00:00:48.160> a<00:00:48.280> little<00:00:48.550> marking<00:00:49.000> on<00:00:49.149> its<00:00:49.270> number

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
it's a little marking on its number

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.389 
it's a little marking on its number
marking<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.200> it's<00:00:50.350> about<00:00:50.680> so<00:00:50.950> I<00:00:50.980> know<00:00:51.129> about

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
marking and it's about so I know about

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.900 
marking and it's about so I know about
it

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
it

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.560 
it
I<00:00:51.940> think<00:00:52.809> BA<00:00:53.289> Cassini<00:00:53.739> has<00:00:54.390> something<00:00:55.390> looks

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
I think BA Cassini has something looks

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.040 
I think BA Cassini has something looks
very<00:00:55.960> very<00:00:56.230> close<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.829> it<00:00:56.920> I<00:00:56.950> mean<00:00:57.010> it<00:00:57.219> could<00:00:57.370> be

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
very very close to it I mean it could be

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.529 
very very close to it I mean it could be
a<00:00:59.050> mistake<00:00:59.980> or<00:01:00.579> something<00:01:01.000> in<00:01:01.120> here<00:01:01.149> but<00:01:01.480> you

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
a mistake or something in here but you

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.049 
a mistake or something in here but you
know<00:01:01.660> what<00:01:01.980> they<00:01:02.980> smoke<00:01:03.309> just<00:01:03.489> as<00:01:03.640> good<00:01:03.789> as<00:01:03.910> any

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
know what they smoke just as good as any

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.690 
know what they smoke just as good as any

here and this is a whole flake do that
not<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.640> thickness<00:01:28.229> might<00:01:29.229> be<00:01:29.439> a<00:01:29.470> little<00:01:29.770> bit

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040

not the thickness might be a little bit
more<00:01:30.220> than<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.340> millimeter<00:01:32.159> think<00:01:33.159> they're

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
more than a millimeter think they're

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
about a millimeter thick I put that in

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.440 
about a millimeter thick I put that in
there<00:01:36.130> now<00:01:36.280> those<00:01:36.460> little<00:01:36.640> pieces<00:01:36.850> in<00:01:37.240> there

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
it again now this particular pipe

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.490 
it again now this particular pipe
doesn't<00:02:04.899> it's<00:02:05.229> not<00:02:05.439> deep<00:02:06.810> now<00:02:07.810> if<00:02:07.930> I<00:02:08.019> fold<00:02:08.350> this

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
doesn't it's not deep now if I fold this

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.880 
doesn't it's not deep now if I fold this
in<00:02:08.739> half<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.840> going<00:02:11.079> to<00:02:11.140> be<00:02:11.200> sticking<00:02:11.500> out<00:02:11.709> of

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
in half it's going to be sticking out of

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.780 
in half it's going to be sticking out of
the<00:02:11.950> pipe<00:02:12.269> maybe<00:02:13.269> that<00:02:13.570> much<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:15.040> I'll<00:02:15.280> fold<00:02:15.610> it

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
the pipe maybe that much so I'll fold it

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.309 
the pipe maybe that much so I'll fold it
in<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:16.000> third

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.229 

do<00:02:23.319> it<00:02:23.470> over<00:02:23.709> your<00:02:23.830> bowl<00:02:24.099> because<00:02:25.030> what's

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
going to happen is pieces are coming off

fold it long ways to fold it in half

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.090 
fold it long ways to fold it in half
then<00:03:40.569> stick<00:03:40.870> in<00:03:41.019> your<00:03:41.170> pipe<00:03:41.410> I've<00:03:41.680> done<00:03:41.920> that

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
then stick in your pipe I've done that

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.330 
then stick in your pipe I've done that
with<00:03:42.250> my<00:03:42.310> 7le<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.180> works<00:03:43.359> great<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.980> bowl<00:03:45.250> is

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
with my 7le it works great this bowl is

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.330 
with my 7le it works great this bowl is
just<00:03:45.370> slightly<00:03:45.760> smaller<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.480> I<00:03:46.540> can't<00:03:46.870> put<00:03:47.049> a

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
just slightly smaller so I can't put a

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.569 
just slightly smaller so I can't put a
flake<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.609> half<00:03:48.819> in<00:03:49.060> there<00:03:51.269> so<00:03:53.250> one<00:03:54.250> flake

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
flake and a half in there so one flake

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.500 
flake and a half in there so one flake
is<00:03:54.790> good<00:03:55.060> it's<00:03:55.540> easy<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:55.959> keep<00:03:56.109> track<00:03:56.410> of<00:03:56.650> them

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
is good it's easy to keep track of them

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.539 
is good it's easy to keep track of them
okay<00:03:58.510> so<00:03:58.569> this<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:59.049> a<00:04:01.109> packing<00:04:02.109> flake<00:04:02.889> tobacco

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
okay so this is a packing flake tobacco

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:11.910 
okay so this is a packing flake tobacco

and if you have anything to contribute
but<00:04:17.130> that's<00:04:18.130> my<00:04:18.430> method<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:18.970> works<00:04:19.120> great<00:04:19.479> it

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
but that's my method it works great it

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.870 
but that's my method it works great it
stays<00:04:19.870> little<00:04:20.289> way<00:04:20.470> down<00:04:20.799> so<00:04:21.099> it's<00:04:21.430> you<00:04:21.760> know

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
stays little way down so it's you know

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.029 
stays little way down so it's you know
it's<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:22.180> cool<00:04:22.360> smokes<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.110> slow<00:04:23.440> smoking

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
it's a cool smokes and slow smoking

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.279 
it's a cool smokes and slow smoking
because<00:04:24.490> still<00:04:24.880> has<00:04:25.060> that<00:04:25.270> flake<00:04:25.599> form<00:04:25.960> in<00:04:26.139> it

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
because still has that flake form in it

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.890 
because still has that flake form in it
and<00:04:27.510> if<00:04:28.510> I<00:04:28.659> was<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:28.960> rub<00:04:29.169> this<00:04:29.409> out<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:30.720> use<00:04:31.720> the

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
and if I was to rub this out and use the

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.210 
and if I was to rub this out and use the
Frank<00:04:32.200> method

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
Frank method

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.930 
Frank method
