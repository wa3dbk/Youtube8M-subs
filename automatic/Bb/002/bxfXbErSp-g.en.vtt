00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.760 
then if your paint the antennas of the
butterfly<00:02:00.180> with<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.930> thin<00:02:01.140> brush<00:02:03.470> so<00:02:04.470> all<00:02:04.650> you

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
butterfly with the thin brush so all you

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.560 
butterfly with the thin brush so all you
do<00:02:04.920> for<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.190> body<00:02:05.400> is<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.060> runs<00:02:06.300> a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
do for the body is you just runs a

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.630 
do for the body is you just runs a
thicker<00:02:06.780> brush<00:02:07.020> up<00:02:07.320> through<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.770> center<00:02:07.979> then

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
thicker brush up through the center then

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.100 
thicker brush up through the center then
you<00:02:08.729> take<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> thinner<00:02:09.240> brush<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.869> make<00:02:09.990> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
you take the thinner brush and make the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.990 
you take the thinner brush and make the
antennas<00:02:10.500> there<00:02:11.370> are<00:02:11.520> different<00:02:11.670> variations

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
antennas there are different variations

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.020 
antennas there are different variations
I've<00:02:12.660> we've<00:02:13.080> done<00:02:13.320> three<00:02:13.760> you've<00:02:14.760> got<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
I've we've done three you've got the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.120 
I've we've done three you've got the
longer<00:02:15.360> antennas<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:15.840> come<00:02:16.320> up<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.770> swirl

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
longer antennas that come up and swirl

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.330 
longer antennas that come up and swirl
in<00:02:17.930> then<00:02:18.930> these<00:02:19.110> are<00:02:19.170> shorter<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.740> squirrel

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
in then these are shorter and squirrel

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.210 
in then these are shorter and squirrel
in<00:02:20.660> these<00:02:21.660> have<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.959> thinner<00:02:22.320> bodies<00:02:22.800> with<00:02:23.190> a

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
in these have a thinner bodies with a

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.150 
in these have a thinner bodies with a
little<00:02:23.490> head<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.950> thick

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
little head and this is just a thick

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.630 
little head and this is just a thick
body<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:27.110> we<00:02:28.110> used<00:02:28.620> our<00:02:28.800> seven<00:02:29.220> month<00:02:29.250> old<00:02:29.489> son

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
body and we used our seven month old son

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.060 
body and we used our seven month old son
so<00:02:30.300> that's<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.600> lot<00:02:30.810> harder<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.350> get<00:02:31.470> footprint

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
so that's a lot harder to get footprint

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.250 
so that's a lot harder to get footprint
so<00:02:32.340> obviously<00:02:32.820> if<00:02:33.150> you're<00:02:33.360> doing<00:02:33.660> like<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> two

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
so obviously if you're doing like a two

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.780 
so obviously if you're doing like a two
or<00:02:34.290> three<00:02:34.620> year<00:02:34.770> old<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.070> might<00:02:35.220> be<00:02:35.370> able<00:02:35.520> to

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
or three year old you might be able to

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.290 
or three year old you might be able to
get<00:02:35.970> them<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.330> sit<00:02:37.320> still<00:02:37.680> longer<00:02:38.040> but<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> mean

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
get them to sit still longer but I mean

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.479 
get them to sit still longer but I mean
it's<00:02:39.450> not<00:02:39.630> going<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.870> be<00:02:39.989> perfect<00:02:40.310> but<00:02:41.310> it's

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
it's not going to be perfect but it's

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.100 
it's not going to be perfect but it's
still<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.760> really<00:02:41.880> really<00:02:42.270> cute<00:02:42.570> gift<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.020> they

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
still a really really cute gift and they

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.350 
still a really really cute gift and they
still<00:02:43.320> turn<00:02:43.500> out<00:02:43.590> really<00:02:43.739> good<00:02:44.150> when<00:02:45.150> you're

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
still turn out really good when you're

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.150 
still turn out really good when you're
done<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:46.020> can<00:02:46.200> write<00:02:46.380> on<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.620> back<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.800> them

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
done you can write on the back of them

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.890 
done you can write on the back of them
these<00:02:47.400> are<00:02:47.459> for<00:02:47.760> Mother's<00:02:48.060> Day<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.660> great

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
finished filling them with flowers this

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.520 
finished filling them with flowers this
is<00:03:05.280> what<00:03:05.459> they<00:03:05.640> look<00:03:05.880> like<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.540> before<00:03:07.500> you

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
is what they look like and before you

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.530 
is what they look like and before you
fill<00:03:08.070> them<00:03:08.190> with<00:03:08.250> flowers<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:08.790> potting<00:03:09.269> soil

fill them with flowers and potting soil

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.840 
fill them with flowers and potting soil
I<00:03:09.780> would<00:03:10.019> wait<00:03:10.200> an<00:03:10.350> hour<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.830> make<00:03:11.310> sure<00:03:11.549> the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
I would wait an hour to make sure the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.560 
I would wait an hour to make sure the
paint<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.239> completely<00:03:12.870> dry<00:03:13.049> or<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:14.459> can<00:03:14.670> try

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
paint is completely dry or you can try

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.180 
paint is completely dry or you can try
them<00:03:15.870> with<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.110> hair<00:03:16.260> dryer<00:03:16.470> for<00:03:16.769> two<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:17.010> five

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
them with the hair dryer for two to five

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.640 
them with the hair dryer for two to five
minutes<00:03:17.610> but<00:03:17.910> then<00:03:18.030> wait<00:03:18.269> an<00:03:18.420> hour<00:03:18.650> because

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
minutes but then wait an hour because

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.460 
minutes but then wait an hour because
they<00:03:19.769> won't<00:03:19.890> be<00:03:20.070> completely<00:03:20.489> cured<00:03:20.700> yet<00:03:21.470> so

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
they won't be completely cured yet so

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.410 
they won't be completely cured yet so
just<00:03:22.739> fuel<00:03:22.980> dry<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.370> touch<00:03:23.489> but<00:03:23.910> this<00:03:24.209> is

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
just fuel dry to the touch but this is

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.550 
just fuel dry to the touch but this is
what<00:03:24.630> they<00:03:24.900> should<00:03:25.079> look<00:03:25.110> like<00:03:25.230> when<00:03:25.410> you're

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
what they should look like when you're

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.020 
what they should look like when you're
finished<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.220> can<00:03:26.400> fell<00:03:26.579> them<00:03:26.700> with<00:03:26.820> any

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
finished and you can fell them with any

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.049 
finished and you can fell them with any
of<00:03:27.269> your<00:03:27.390> favorite<00:03:27.540> flowers
