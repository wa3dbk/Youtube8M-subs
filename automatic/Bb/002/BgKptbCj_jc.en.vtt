well it's actually has an aspect ratio

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.240 
well it's actually has an aspect ratio
of<00:01:02.190> about<00:01:02.399> 21<00:01:03.239> by<00:01:03.480> 9<00:01:03.840> which<00:01:04.110> works<00:01:04.320> out<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.800> 2

is<00:06:24.740> a<00:06:24.770> little<00:06:25.130> bit<00:06:25.250> tougher<00:06:25.580> than<00:06:25.699> this

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
is a little bit tougher than this

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.779 
is a little bit tougher than this
although<00:06:26.180> LG<00:06:26.539> does<00:06:26.900> include<00:06:27.500> a<00:06:27.590> utility<00:06:28.160> for

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
although LG does include a utility for

although LG does include a utility for

splitting into three horizontal for this

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.240 
splitting into three horizontal for this
way<00:06:32.510> I<00:06:32.539> think<00:06:32.840> you<00:06:32.930> can<00:06:33.110> do<00:06:33.320> three<00:06:33.680> sorry

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
way I think you can do three sorry

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.379 
way I think you can do three sorry
excuse<00:06:34.490> me<00:06:34.610> three<00:06:34.760> vertical<00:06:35.000> you<00:06:35.180> can<00:06:35.240> do

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
excuse me three vertical you can do

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:37.060 
excuse me three vertical you can do
three<00:06:35.570> horizontal<00:06:35.780> if<00:06:36.169> you<00:06:36.289> want<00:06:36.470> and<00:06:36.680> allows

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
three horizontal if you want and allows

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.290 
three horizontal if you want and allows
you<00:06:37.190> to<00:06:37.280> split<00:06:37.430> the<00:06:37.610> monitor<00:06:37.880> up<00:06:37.970> into<00:06:38.180> little

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
you to split the monitor up into little

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.320 
you to split the monitor up into little
virtual<00:06:38.570> monitors<00:06:39.320> as<00:06:39.560> well<00:06:40.370> or<00:06:40.669> you<00:06:41.030> can<00:06:41.210> use

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
virtual monitors as well or you can use

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.170 
virtual monitors as well or you can use
a<00:06:41.360> third-party<00:06:41.800> utility<00:06:42.800> for<00:06:43.280> it<00:06:43.400> so<00:06:43.940> I<00:06:43.970> guess

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
a third-party utility for it so I guess

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.909 
a third-party utility for it so I guess
the<00:06:44.330> last<00:06:44.450> thing<00:06:44.630> is<00:06:44.840> basically<00:06:45.020> to<00:06:45.470> give<00:06:45.650> a

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
the last thing is basically to give a

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.490 
the last thing is basically to give a
few<00:06:46.310> of<00:06:46.430> my<00:06:46.460> own<00:06:46.610> thoughts<00:06:47.150> on<00:06:47.510> using<00:06:48.139> one<00:06:48.470> of

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
few of my own thoughts on using one of

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
these as a daily driver for me

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.490 
these as a daily driver for me
personally<00:06:50.630> for<00:06:51.440> work<00:06:51.860> it<00:06:52.160> is<00:06:53.090> hands<00:06:53.690> down<00:06:53.960> my
