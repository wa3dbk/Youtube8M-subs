00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Today I'll teach you a challenge to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.140
 you do with your friends and they will 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.360
 find it practically impossible to 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.519
 solve everything you'll need 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.320
 some old cards from a deck that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.719
 You already lost some letters, you can not 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.390
 play nothing else you will use a card 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.150
 only the next challenge will you give 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.250
 your friend and tell him that you 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.640
 he has to cut this card from a 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.279
 the way he can get inside 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.679
 of the load that's right he's going to have to 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.270
 go inside the house 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.190
 we made this challenge with some 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.329
 people who came to visit the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.410
 All wet world what happened 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:45.960
 You'll have to go through the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.260
 home I'm you you read you can not 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.090
 cut the letter into two pieces but you 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.090
 can stick what you want 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:15.420
 it's not a hole I think it's not so small 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:17.159
 so great that it will happen in July 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.530
 existed 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.070
 good they gave up hope that I hope 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.240
 that you're at home try until 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.310
 finish the pack 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.100
 if you return to the bar can not 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.000
 make leaving the link of the revelation here 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.909
 down 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.189
 But this starts here you find yourself in the 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.759
 watch this video in full screen or 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.979
 hd 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.509
 finally the ones in the world manual are all 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.130
 recorded on full HD 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.530
 you must have noticed in the eye too 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.180
 there is a yellow spot on the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.650
 account 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.640
 and this is not makeup not this 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.890
 happened because I went to a 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.800
 ophthalmologist this morning and she bim 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.120
 good deal weird in the eye and in the hour 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.830
 He did not give to see anything but at the time the 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.990
 people started filming realized that 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.680
 There was a yellow spot around the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.710
 eye 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.360
 so this is probably an ink 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.610
 a pigment that we can only see 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.820
 with a light that you can see 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.710
 infrared as the color 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.630
 goes through the camera after the camera shows 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.380
 it's possible for us to 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.660
 camera can translate some things 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.690
 that we can not see with the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.460
 naked eye just looking at the simca so i go 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.960
 put two very links down here 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.910
 cool that have to do with it 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.430
 this side here like seeing the light 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.740
 infrared your remote control 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.410
 yes that little light that is invisible in the 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.230
 remote control has a way to reach out and 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.510
 on this side here not leaving as 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.700
 make an invisible ink that can only 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.700
 be seen when you use a black light
