00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.630 
we had a fabulous night we were
surrounded<00:00:35.190> by<00:00:36.260> dozens<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.710> shekels<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.520> they

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
surrounded by dozens of shekels and they

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
surrounded by dozens of shekels and they
were<00:00:38.700> howling<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.930> whole<00:00:40.110> night<00:00:40.380> but<00:00:40.650> still

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
were howling the whole night but still

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.940 
were howling the whole night but still
we<00:00:41.730> slept<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:42.989> good<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.410> really

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
we slept really really good it's really

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.150 
we slept really really good it's really
comfortable<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.420> had<00:00:45.540> a<00:00:45.570> great<00:00:45.900> time<00:00:46.160> this

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
comfortable and we had a great time this

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.810 
comfortable and we had a great time this
is<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.600> deep<00:00:48.600> jungle<00:00:49.020> excel<00:00:49.740> so<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.550> means

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
is the deep jungle excel so this means

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.400 
is the deep jungle excel so this means
it<00:00:51.480> has<00:00:51.540> a<00:00:51.750> double<00:00:52.230> layer<00:00:52.260> here<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:55.260> can

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
it has a double layer here so you can

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.000 
it has a double layer here so you can
put<00:00:55.620> some<00:00:55.770> insulation<00:01:00.200> if<00:01:01.200> it<00:01:01.350> gets<00:01:01.560> colder

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
put some insulation if it gets colder

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.600 
put some insulation if it gets colder
and<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.340> does<00:01:02.550> get<00:01:02.820> colder<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:04.610> because

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and it does get colder here not because

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.330 
and it does get colder here not because
you're<00:01:06.450> sleeping<00:01:07.320> back<00:01:07.560> cannot<00:01:07.979> cope<00:01:08.310> with

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
you're sleeping back cannot cope with

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.550 
you're sleeping back cannot cope with
that<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:09.000> compressed<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> lower

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
that it's compressed and on the lower

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.679 
that it's compressed and on the lower
part<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.880> there<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.180> no<00:01:12.329> insert

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
part and so there is no insert

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.740 
part and so there is no insert
insulation<00:01:13.380> left<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.390> put<00:01:15.540> your

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
insulation left and so if you put your

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.560 
insulation left and so if you put your
insulation<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:16.980> and<00:01:17.250> they<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> very

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
insulation here and they have a very

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.330 
insulation here and they have a very
less<00:01:18.920> mattress<00:01:19.920> from<00:01:20.730> Tennessee<00:01:21.620> then<00:01:22.620> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
less mattress from Tennessee then you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
less mattress from Tennessee then you
won't<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.760> cold<00:01:24.030> from<00:01:24.510> from<00:01:24.930> from<00:01:25.230> underneath

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
won't get cold from from from underneath

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.190 
won't get cold from from from underneath

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
we've tried it without it and it was

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.219 
we've tried it without it and it was

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
in another video how to build to to to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.270 
in another video how to build to to to
build<00:02:00.270> them<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.510> and<00:02:00.900> it's<00:02:01.290> really<00:02:01.530> easy<00:02:01.830> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
build them up and it's really easy and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.320 
build them up and it's really easy and
fast<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.909> now<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:04.049> breaking<00:02:04.890> camp<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.490> just

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
fast and now this breaking camp is just

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.380 
fast and now this breaking camp is just
as<00:02:06.510> easy<00:02:06.690> and<00:02:07.049> really<00:02:07.770> fast<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.909> didn't<00:02:09.179> use

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
as easy and really fast we didn't use

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.559 
as easy and really fast we didn't use
the<00:02:09.810> rain<00:02:10.019> fly<00:02:10.640> because<00:02:11.640> we<00:02:11.970> obviously<00:02:12.090> don't

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
the rain fly because we obviously don't

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.619 
the rain fly because we obviously don't
need<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.989> we're<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.470> desert<00:02:13.950> here<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.480> mean<00:02:15.480> this

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
need it we're in desert here I mean this

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.320 
need it we're in desert here I mean this
is<00:02:15.840> some<00:02:16.080> vases<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:17.010> basically<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:18.120> never

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
is some vases but basically it never

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.260 
is some vases but basically it never
rains<00:02:18.599> here<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.490> so<00:02:20.490> we<00:02:20.610> don't<00:02:20.730> need<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.120> rain

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
rains here and so we don't need the rain

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.850 
rains here and so we don't need the rain
fly<00:02:21.569> we<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.110> left<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:24.780> don't<00:02:24.900> use

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
fly we just left it and we don't use

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.460 
fly we just left it and we don't use
the<00:02:26.120> snakeskin<00:02:27.120> either<00:02:27.480> we<00:02:27.870> use<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:28.050> different

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
the snakeskin either we use a different

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.270 
the snakeskin either we use a different
method<00:02:28.650> here<00:02:29.070> we<00:02:29.580> keep<00:02:29.790> our<00:02:30.420> rain<00:02:30.960> fly<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
method here we keep our rain fly in the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.060 
method here we keep our rain fly in the
snakeskin<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.270> in<00:02:33.420> case<00:02:33.630> we<00:02:33.660> should<00:02:34.380> need<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.680> I

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
snakeskin so in case we should need it I

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.820 
snakeskin so in case we should need it I
mean<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.850> does<00:02:36.030> rain<00:02:36.510> here<00:02:36.960> once<00:02:37.200> or<00:02:37.320> twice<00:02:37.560> a

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830

Tennessee have this mosquito net and we

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.440 
Tennessee have this mosquito net and we

were really thankful for that this night

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.380 
were really thankful for that this night
because<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:01.110> was<00:03:01.140> like<00:03:01.440> thousands<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.430> hungry

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
because it was like thousands of hungry

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.290 
because it was like thousands of hungry
vampires<00:03:04.080> trying<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:05.070> suck<00:03:05.280> our<00:03:05.430> blood<00:03:06.000> and

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
vampires trying to suck our blood and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.690 
vampires trying to suck our blood and
they<00:03:06.570> did<00:03:06.750> not<00:03:06.900> succeed<00:03:07.170> because<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:08.520> is<00:03:08.670> a

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
they did not succeed because this is a

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.810 
they did not succeed because this is a
really<00:03:09.030> good<00:03:09.480> mosquito<00:03:09.989> net<00:03:10.260> it's<00:03:10.530> very<00:03:10.820> fine

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
really good mosquito net it's very fine

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.270 
really good mosquito net it's very fine
and<00:03:12.180> there's<00:03:12.600> no<00:03:12.739> insect<00:03:13.739> that<00:03:13.770> can<00:03:14.040> pass

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
and there's no insect that can pass

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.160 
and there's no insect that can pass
through<00:03:14.720> all<00:03:15.720> right

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
through all right

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.530 
through all right
so<00:03:16.530> breaking<00:03:16.890> camp<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.310> easy<00:03:17.520> you<00:03:18.090> just<00:03:18.120> take

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
so breaking camp is easy you just take

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:28.670 
so breaking camp is easy you just take
away<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:24.540> prevent<00:03:26.690> from<00:03:27.690> from<00:03:28.110> swinging<00:03:28.590> too

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
away to prevent from from swinging too

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.130 
away to prevent from from swinging too
much<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:31.160> which<00:03:32.160> provides<00:03:32.790> no<00:03:33.000> snakes<00:03:33.360> don't

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
much and which provides no snakes don't

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.570 
much and which provides no snakes don't
need<00:03:34.260> them<00:03:34.380> anymore<00:03:34.910> made<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:37.489> recycling<00:03:38.489> piece

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
need them anymore made a recycling piece

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.479 
need them anymore made a recycling piece
and<00:03:41.580> we<00:03:41.700> close<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:45.239> zipper<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:46.560> now<00:03:46.739> for<00:03:47.370> this

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
and we close the zipper and now for this

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.009 
and we close the zipper and now for this
knot<00:03:48.480> here

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
knot here

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.350 
knot here
this<00:03:49.260> is<00:03:49.410> really<00:03:49.709> really<00:03:49.890> good<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:51.180> could

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
this is really really good you could

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.380 
this is really really good you could
sleep<00:03:51.570> on<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.110> on<00:03:52.290> one<00:03:53.250> week<00:03:53.459> on<00:03:53.640> end<00:03:53.880> on<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.180> and

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
sleep on it on one week on end on it and

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.539 
sleep on it on one week on end on it and
it<00:03:54.630> would<00:03:54.780> not<00:03:54.989> get<00:03:55.200> stuck<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:55.769> what<00:03:56.400> I'm<00:03:56.519> just

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
it would not get stuck so what I'm just

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.930 
it would not get stuck so what I'm just
doing<00:03:56.790> is<00:03:57.000> just<00:03:57.890> losing<00:03:58.890> it<00:04:00.019> and<00:04:01.790> that's<00:04:02.790> about

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
doing is just losing it and that's about

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.990 
doing is just losing it and that's about
it<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:04.519> just<00:04:05.519> use<00:04:06.260> three<00:04:07.260> or<00:04:07.380> four<00:04:07.440> turns<00:04:08.000> that

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
it I just use three or four turns that

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.910 
it I just use three or four turns that
always<00:04:09.799> is<00:04:10.799> enough

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.600 

both<00:04:18.920> of<00:04:19.130> their<00:04:19.280> tree<00:04:19.580> huggers<00:04:20.030> they<00:04:21.610> take

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
both of their tree huggers they take

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.580 
both of their tree huggers they take
care<00:04:22.850> that<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.270> tree<00:04:23.510> is<00:04:23.540> not<00:04:23.840> damaged<00:04:24.320> I

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
method for kind of traveling if you had

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.530

the<00:06:24.890> second<00:06:25.250> snakeskin<00:06:25.760> you<00:06:25.970> would<00:06:26.270> just

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
the second snakeskin you would just

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.340 
the second snakeskin you would just
leave<00:06:27.170> it<00:06:27.200> on<00:06:27.410> the<00:06:27.470> ropes<00:06:27.790> close<00:06:28.790> no<00:06:29.690> snakeskin

leave it on the ropes close no snakeskin
from<00:06:30.650> both<00:06:30.830> sides<00:06:31.160> and<00:06:31.430> then<00:06:32.240> you<00:06:34.780> so<00:06:35.780> that's

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
from both sides and then you so that's
