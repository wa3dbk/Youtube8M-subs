that a lot but the most important

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.830 
that a lot but the most important
feature<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.340> any<00:01:44.610> specialization<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.689> that

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
feature of any specialization is that

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
what that what that entails because it's

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.850 
what that what that entails because it's
not<00:02:00.119> very<00:02:00.420> obvious<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:01.290> by<00:02:01.380> reading<00:02:01.619> the

the<00:02:05.399> stealth<00:02:06.329> upgrade<00:02:06.840> enhances<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.979> in

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
the stealth upgrade enhances you in

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.729 
the stealth upgrade enhances you in
three<00:02:08.550> ways<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:09.270> dampens<00:02:09.750> your<00:02:09.840> footsteps<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
three ways it dampens your footsteps and

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.710 
three ways it dampens your footsteps and
makes<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.580> lot<00:02:11.730> harder<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.180> your<00:02:12.390> enemies

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
makes it a lot harder for your enemies

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.910 
makes it a lot harder for your enemies
to<00:02:12.930> see<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.260> when<00:02:13.440> their<00:02:13.560> skin

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
to see you when their skin

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.750 
to see you when their skin
Promethean<00:02:14.700> vision<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.930> increases<00:02:16.620> your

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
Promethean vision and it increases your

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.970 
Promethean vision and it increases your
assassinations<00:02:17.760> speed<00:02:18.180> okay<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.530> those<00:02:19.770> are

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
assassinations speed okay so those are

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.979 
assassinations speed okay so those are
some<00:02:20.130> interesting<00:02:20.340> points<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:21.330> I'm<00:02:21.569> going<00:02:21.900> to

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
some interesting points but I'm going to

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.850 
some interesting points but I'm going to
give<00:02:22.340> stealth<00:02:23.480> ad<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.900> terms<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.650> letter

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
give stealth ad in terms of the letter

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.210 
give stealth ad in terms of the letter
grade<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.459> slightly<00:02:27.000> better<00:02:27.360> than<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.690> failure

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
grade so slightly better than a failure

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.830 
grade so slightly better than a failure
because<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.489> is<00:02:29.670> nowhere<00:02:29.910> near<00:02:30.120> as

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
because this is nowhere near as

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.809 
because this is nowhere near as
effective<00:02:31.050> as<00:02:31.500> something<00:02:31.860> like<00:02:31.980> ammo<00:02:32.520> or

it<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.459> barely<00:02:44.880> increases<00:02:45.480> your

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
assassination speed at all it doesn't

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.250 
assassination speed at all it doesn't
make<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.760> much<00:02:47.819> faster<00:02:48.300> honestly<00:02:49.019> and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
make it that much faster honestly and

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.000 
make it that much faster honestly and
you<00:02:50.190> know<00:02:50.489> quieter<00:02:51.150> footsteps<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.140> being

you know quieter footsteps and being

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.160 
you know quieter footsteps and being
more<00:02:53.489> difficult<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:54.030> scan<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.569> Promethean

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
more difficult to scan of Promethean

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.830 
more difficult to scan of Promethean

upgrades they're not going to help you
in<00:03:00.030> very<00:03:00.209> many<00:03:00.450> circumstances<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.890> the

the amount of support they do give you
is<00:03:04.980> really<00:03:05.700> going<00:03:05.819> to<00:03:05.910> be<00:03:06.000> very<00:03:06.030> limited<00:03:06.450> so

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
is really going to be very limited so

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.590 
is really going to be very limited so
I'm<00:03:07.140> gonna<00:03:07.290> give<00:03:07.530> this<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.709> letter<00:03:08.549> d<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.269> terms

I'm gonna give this a letter d in terms

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.280 
I'm gonna give this a letter d in terms

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
of the support upgrade stealth now I'm

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.020 
of the support upgrade stealth now I'm
not<00:03:13.530> going<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.799> give<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.100> grade<00:03:14.459> on<00:03:14.489> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
not going to give you a grade on the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.479 
not going to give you a grade on the
appearance<00:03:15.660> items<00:03:16.260> because<00:03:16.890> that's<00:03:17.160> up<00:03:17.340> to

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
appearance items because that's up to

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.930 
appearance items because that's up to
you<00:03:17.640> but<00:03:18.410> anyway<00:03:19.410> wet<00:03:19.650> work<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.100> operator<00:03:20.579> is

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
you but anyway wet work and operator is

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.370 
you but anyway wet work and operator is
the<00:03:21.540> only<00:03:21.810> two<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:23.280> know<00:03:23.400> it's<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.760> first<00:03:23.970> two

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
the only two you know it's the first two

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.330 
the only two you know it's the first two
specializations<00:03:25.380> that<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:25.920> will<00:03:26.100> have

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
specializations that you will have

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.460 
specializations that you will have
available<00:03:26.850> when<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.120> first<00:03:27.420> hit<00:03:27.750> level<00:03:28.019> fifty

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
available when you first hit level fifty

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.840 
available when you first hit level fifty
so<00:03:28.530> you're<00:03:28.769> really<00:03:29.130> only<00:03:29.340> gonna<00:03:29.579> have<00:03:29.820> a

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
so you're really only gonna have a

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.300 
so you're really only gonna have a
couple<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.299> choices<00:03:30.450> wet<00:03:31.440> work<00:03:31.620> or<00:03:31.829> operator

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
couple of choices wet work or operator

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.120 
couple of choices wet work or operator
so<00:03:33.049> this<00:03:34.049> is<00:03:34.260> what<00:03:34.560> you're<00:03:34.680> gonna<00:03:34.739> get<00:03:34.980> with

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
so this is what you're gonna get with

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.460 
so this is what you're gonna get with
wet<00:03:35.340> work<00:03:35.660> if<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.840> want<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.049> know<00:03:37.170> what<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.350> get
