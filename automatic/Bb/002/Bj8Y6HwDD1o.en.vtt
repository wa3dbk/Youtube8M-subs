00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
I mean most recently we saw something

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.579 
I mean most recently we saw something
like<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:03.360> definitive<00:01:03.630> edition<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.350> Tomb

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
like the definitive edition of Tomb

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.830 
like the definitive edition of Tomb
Raider<00:01:04.619> which<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.850> know<00:01:05.970> apparently<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.750> was

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
Raider which you know apparently it was

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.780 
Raider which you know apparently it was
pretty<00:01:07.110> good<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.979> game<00:01:08.189> wasn't<00:01:08.430> even

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
pretty good but the game wasn't even

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.179 
pretty good but the game wasn't even
like<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.060> year<00:01:09.479> old<00:01:09.780> before<00:01:10.350> they<00:01:10.500> released<00:01:10.890> an

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
like a year old before they released an

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.490 
like a year old before they released an
HD<00:01:11.850> upgrade<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> wasn't<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.380> i

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
HD upgrade to it and it wasn't up i

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.890 
HD upgrade to it and it wasn't up i
don't<00:01:13.710> put<00:01:14.009> HD<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.430> quotes<00:01:14.670> because<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.450> wasn't

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
don't put HD in quotes because it wasn't

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.260 
don't put HD in quotes because it wasn't
actually<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.619> was<00:01:16.920> updated<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.000> looked

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
actually like it was updated it looked

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.330 
actually like it was updated it looked
better<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.810> was<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> better<00:01:19.590> definitive

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
better it was a better definitive

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.160 
better it was a better definitive
version<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> game<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> fact<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.050> it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
version of the game but the fact that it

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.740 
version of the game but the fact that it
was<00:01:22.260> so<00:01:22.440> close<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.980> actual<00:01:23.220> release<00:01:23.750> kind

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
was so close to the actual release kind

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.270 
was so close to the actual release kind
of<00:01:24.810> makes<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.050> wonder<00:01:25.200> where<00:01:25.800> you<00:01:25.920> compared

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
of makes you wonder where you compared

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.130 
of makes you wonder where you compared
to<00:01:26.490> something<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.210> don't<00:01:27.450> know<00:01:27.659> HD

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to something like I don't know HD

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.410 
to something like I don't know HD
remakes<00:01:28.620> of<00:01:28.830> some<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.490> tony<00:01:29.700> hawk<00:01:29.909> game<00:01:30.180> so

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
remakes of some of the tony hawk game so

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.640 
remakes of some of the tony hawk game so
those<00:01:30.720> actually<00:01:31.080> weren't<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.380> great<00:01:31.530> either

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
those actually weren't that great either

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.610 
those actually weren't that great either
so<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.370> have<00:01:32.760> there<00:01:32.940> been<00:01:32.970> really<00:01:33.510> any<00:01:33.540> good<00:01:33.870> HD

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
think of any right now so maybe it's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.830 
think of any right now so maybe it's
just<00:01:41.550> not<00:01:41.760> coming<00:01:41.940> to<00:01:42.180> me<00:01:42.300> not<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.570> say<00:01:42.690> that
