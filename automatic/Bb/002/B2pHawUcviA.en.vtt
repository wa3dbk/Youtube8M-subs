just thought I'd try this the reason why
I'm<00:01:52.079> bringing<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.280> from<00:01:53.520> a

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
I'm bringing this up is that from a

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.120 
I'm bringing this up is that from a
dermatillomania<00:01:54.030> perspective<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.439> find<00:01:56.040> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
dermatillomania perspective I find that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.800

still<00:02:18.780> kind<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.200> learning<00:02:19.440> what<00:02:19.769> they<00:02:19.950> do<00:02:20.010> to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
still kind of learning what they do to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.369 
still kind of learning what they do to
my<00:02:20.879> knowledge<00:02:21.030> right<00:02:21.330> now<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.569> just<00:02:21.959> smother

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379
