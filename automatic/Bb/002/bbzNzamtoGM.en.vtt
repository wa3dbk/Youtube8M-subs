00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 from beatbox to pan flute and all 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.589
 styles here there is only one step hesitate 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.820
 not there is only one step and not to laugh 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.639
 because you tell us that you 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.230
 did have these beautiful tran concert 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.420
 but I have a number of antics that 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.970
 I call because I have written 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.430
 music for flute for you even 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:27.330
 turns and and organ or harp 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:30.689
 that is to say that I play I pretty much 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.710
 2 interesting fact you will participate in 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.020
 the next edition of the competition 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.200
 bbox to death twice for you 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.489
 present nor forgive you are because 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.110
 you are an artist with multiple 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.239
 facets it's still interesting 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.450
 you are both a musician composer 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.469
 and teacher inventor good it's a 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.090
 big definition indeed and so not 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.199
 obvious have the common point in all this 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.420
 it's the pan flute 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.399
 what led you to work 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.350
 was slowly I was already playing the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.250
 recorder flute of which there are 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.760
 a few years when I was a lot 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.739
 younger 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.470
 and then I discovered the pan flute 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.880
 around the age of 20, I basically 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.799
 first had the idea of ​​making a flute 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.030
 pan to decorate my room but 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.080
 really soon after I got 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.150
 says why finally what I 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.040
 will not play and then I gave up all 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.479
 the other instruments to play that of 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.360
 the pan flute because if you said 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.619
 there you life you make you have 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 survived all of Africa since I 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.680
 even improve the system ie 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.090
 that I do a lot of concerts in 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.450
 church a son otherwise seen zero 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.960
 elsewhere kate this is the case since 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.540
 30 years already 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.420
 Well I had a lot of problems 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.380
 when I granted but shhh 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.030
 traditionally with wax 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.650
 bee as it was since 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.150
 millennia and I replaced the wax 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.380
 of bee by pistons that makes that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.340
 in each pipe I put little ones 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.579
 cork stoppers with a crimped nut 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.170
 in the little cork and with 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.560
 a sexuality I can shoot push the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.299
 pistons that allows to grant very quickly 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.250
 and that must still be emphasized 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.860
 you have patented the filing a patent 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.780
 passion and it's is marketed in 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.990
 forty countries I believe you 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.440
 maybe we can play a piece 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.660
 that you have there 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.729
 a piece for just to clarify the 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.040
 things we do not know but you have 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.350
 interpreted many tunes including 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.150
 for commercials I also 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.090
 participated go there to sign my meeting 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.800
 and I was with him maybe 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.630
 can you indeed we play 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:36.940
 brought who will tell us something 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:39.160
 go tell apart the coffee is so so 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.770
 you are under your control you have 15 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.300
 albums you also received nine 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.460
 until outside say that in your 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.210
 last album this one travels on an air 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.620
 pan flute 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.600
 it's music that I have 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.130
 composed through all my travels to 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.470
 around the world what and then then 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.780
 your act iv actuality very very simple 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.970
 is that you give a concert on the 2nd 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.610
 June at the church of Bailly at the church on 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.050
 valier a concert that combines flute 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.700
 pan and in front of the organs 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.590
 these have said I have a very look 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.600
 original of a concert for the lions club 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.550
 and whose recipe will be 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.730
 fully fully repaid 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.110
 for disabled children and from where you 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.650
 came this idea then to associate 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.730
 these two instruments the organ the party 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.470
 otherwise because it's already 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.000
 as when his look looks like 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.100
 really an order since the flute of 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.750
 pan is the ancestor of the organ is a 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.459
 the Greek who is called applies 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.750
 steve-o what is the idea of ​​achieving 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.580
 a much larger panpipes 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.200
 he had been calling for a year but 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.070
 it's really the same system 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.010
 me when I blow I trained with 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.690
 the student sort of whistle this is the 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.360
 base of each water pipe found 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.250
 the same 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.650
 a little whistle so to speak 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.630
 of conical shape at the base then on 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.550
 francis vidil so he accompanies you 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.440
 so and organist and accompanies you 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.670
 for this recital which did not 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.660
 unfortunately could not come on the 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.120
 plateau this strong but we have it 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.010
 met yesterday at the church of levis a year 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.720
 and he's going to give us he's going to us 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.430
 explain exactly what it represents 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.810
 for him 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.030
 the combination of these two instruments to 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.540
 school we talk about vibrations in 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.670
 music 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.090
 but we talk about vibrations in 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.760
 the scientific universe tell you that 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.650
 the universe is just vibrations and the 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.480
 pan flute vibration wakes up in 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.950
 we have something very archaic 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.480
 because it's probably the first 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.810
 music instrument 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.390
 because he acted with the breath and 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.460
 that breath the equivalent of the 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.550
 divine creation 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.289
 that the pan flute then adds d 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.230
 him a little bit static on the plane of 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:44.220
 sound driving since the wind and 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.690
 regulate called by mechanisms the 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.830
 flutist him naturally to all his 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.590
 human breath with its possibilities of 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.630
 of coldness ripples of coldness and 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.530
 its limits and that make the instrument 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.530
 is really touching 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.900
 no 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.160
 virtual tables managed care 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.200
 lowered mouse and francis lamy is 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.690
 really is one of the best 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.290
 organists of France 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.020
 so what are you going 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.900
 interpret then on June 2nd 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:06.430
 at the church of bailly so pieces of 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:09.070
 bach mozart erik satie of the classic in 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.630
 general and also a music of 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.400
 ennio morricone because I had the 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.110
 happiness really that I can say about 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.210
 exceptional moments of my life from 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.130
 work with ennio morricone then 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.840
 to get an idea of his tunes 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.570
 classics I suggest you listen to a 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.530
 piece so a schubert ave maria 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.910
 which you have interpreted as 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.900
 Here with the same German church 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.900
 francis success 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.390
 e 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.960
 e 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.870
 so george then we remind that the 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:14.020
 funds that are harvested so will go for 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.480
 the lion's-club foundation and then we 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.300
 remember the date is June 2nd at 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.430
 17.30 at the church of ben ali and you have 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.320
 a website also in w vef a 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.540
 player I'm pointing this poster 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.710
 had mentioned ennio morricone could 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.310
 do some notes you know 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.050
 work with us 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.780
 I do not have the right flute but I'm going 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.080
 really try what really was 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.080
 not planned 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.630
 thank you so much
