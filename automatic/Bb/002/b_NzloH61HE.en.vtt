00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.970
 youtube people like this I hope that 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.160
 be in awe 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.010
 I will explain why those are cause 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.200
 circumstance does not serve the track that 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:19.580
 I had offered them that this is the 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:23.029
 windows 8 pro is simply one 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.960
 I was previously testing because 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:30.580
 the failure of one comes out an error that is very 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.340
 common that something like that 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:38.910
 what it says installation error is not 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:41.700
 can continue error but good one 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.930
 that tiny mistake is by two simple 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.420
 reasons 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.540
 have tried to update with another 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.970
 activator which leaves traces and windows 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.220
 automatically update 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.490
 to update 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.160
 a file that disabled this 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.320
 form of update that I recommend 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.620
 just do one of those that what 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.630
 you want well also activated what form 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.530
 is your computer 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.710
 simply 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.570
 and digital this clear by making a 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.880
 partition where they keep the most files 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.649
 important 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.320
 but in all cases that you do not want it 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.119
 do and you just want to install it 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.909
 for that I have other 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.880
 another video where you can as well 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.810
 simply activate it serves both 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.870
 windows 8.1 produced about 8.1 with a 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.750
 windows media center 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.000
 if you realize here I am in another 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.580
 computer is not good 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.850
 Now yes, my brother, because honey 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.070
 it just broke down the condemned 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.310
 charger 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.619
 disabled on my machine 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.780
 I have already done that simply in the optimal 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.740
 here is the video where it shows the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.920
 process of building 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.180
 Any other suggestion please 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.700
 before 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.670
 a negative comment or saying no 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.209
 works la la la 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.209
 just watch this video good 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.290
 If you want to go around my page 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.939

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.549

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.260
 really high for me since I just 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.049
 starting 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.519
 that I wanted all that would be all here 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.709
 I simply give them the explanation of 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.829
 why not work them anything 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.010
 suggestion are welcome good until 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.010
