00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
to show you we got 69 Celsius cod is

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.490 
to show you we got 69 Celsius cod is
obviously<00:03:31.090> intended<00:03:31.300> I'm<00:03:31.510> percentile<00:03:32.080> 90

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
obviously intended I'm percentile 90

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.790 
obviously intended I'm percentile 90
percentile<00:03:33.130> which<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:34.260> where<00:03:35.260> we<00:03:35.410> want<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.680> see

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
percentile which is where we want to see

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.650 
percentile which is where we want to see
it<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:36.460> never<00:03:36.640> get<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.820> hundred<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.390> don't

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
it you never get a hundred so don't

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.440 
it you never get a hundred so don't
think<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.870> do<00:03:38.250> fan<00:03:39.250> is<00:03:39.430> at<00:03:39.580> seventy-seven

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
think you do fan is at seventy-seven

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.380 
think you do fan is at seventy-seven
percent<00:03:40.870> return<00:03:41.650> my<00:03:41.830> god<00:03:45.090> yeah<00:03:46.090> we're<00:03:46.240> going

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
percent return my god yeah we're going

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.850 
percent return my god yeah we're going
this<00:03:46.480> way<00:03:46.540> so<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:50.110> know<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.230> obviously<00:03:50.650> have

this way so you know I obviously have

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.380 
this way so you know I obviously have
manual<00:03:51.250> fan<00:03:51.490> control<00:03:51.850> on<00:03:52.030> we<00:03:52.180> have<00:03:52.300> it

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
manual fan control on we have it

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.590 
manual fan control on we have it
overclocked<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.810> 1400<00:03:53.620> one<00:03:53.970> megahertz<00:03:54.970> it's<00:03:55.390> a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
overclocked to 1400 one megahertz it's a

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.900 
overclocked to 1400 one megahertz it's a
very<00:03:56.110> sweet<00:03:56.320> spot<00:03:56.770> and<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.520> RAM<00:03:57.730> is

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
very sweet spot and the RAM is

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.950 
very sweet spot and the RAM is
overclocked<00:03:58.330> 150<00:03:59.490> megahertz<00:04:00.490> Tim<00:04:00.820> so<00:04:01.300> let's

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
overclocked 150 megahertz Tim so let's

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:10.030 
overclocked 150 megahertz Tim so let's
say<00:04:02.550> here<00:04:03.550> a<00:04:03.580> lot<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.880> bullets
