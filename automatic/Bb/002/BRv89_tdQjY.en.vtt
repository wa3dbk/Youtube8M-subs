00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.740
 good to say that we have given ourselves and that well 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.870
 found on our channel today we are 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.090
 here with the new made knife made 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.739
 from me it the match with the whole team 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.199
 support that played with shields but 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.909
 then we move on to gameplay and now it is 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.710
 tell you two things because I read in 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.419
 comments from people who wrote rieck 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.050
 because you don't bring your gameplay here 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.669
 one 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.499
 but it is not that I do not bring them because I do not 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.480
 I'm capable because I don't want it because 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:35.210
 they are scarce because I am always behind 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.960
 here youtube video with while so the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.210
 time and less 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.460
 then when he tried gameplay or are there 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.460
 the hackers or anyway a veteran or here 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.710
 so you don't find the lobbies or the minors cod 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.780
 honestly they have a little broken the bales 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.150
 with ross I can't play it then 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.680
 sometimes I get a gameplay now 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.590
 I'm waiting for the new call of duty ma 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.329
 quiet then I had often read joy 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.579
 that there is only you on the channel a 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.530
 obvious comment but long ago 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.420
 they said I was the only one with the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.610
 gameplay then a mere moment 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.960
 calmed down and then tried to load 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.759
 a bit also those of others but 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.130
 as people want to see mei 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.249
 gameplay says I'm not worthy of the del 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.999
 cannes that I created and also brings a 

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:18.679
 my well place then I wanted immediately 

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:20.270
 thank all the guys who have me 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.130
 helped and I hope my story of 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.340
 my voice feels good because anyway 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.139
 I'm talking to from adagio because I don't have to 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.499
 wake up any guys who have me 

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:33.020
 helped were only alien z spark dark 

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:35.240
 never cripto and the viper I thank 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.039
 very much because they were out and about with 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.619
 shields attracted enemies from behind me 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.179
 with a knife he stabbed them and they are 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.670
 managed to make this mob that was 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.590
 sweaty enough but I did not 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.139
 I managed to make it the only one is also 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.029
 because there is no cable too long 

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:51.979
 where precisely I have to leave on vacation 

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:53.990
 so I chose the team mode 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.029
 deathmatch where there are the most scarce and 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.950
 with this technique with the shields we are 

00:01:56.029 --> 00:02:00.270
 managed to do it even if it lasts a while 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.270
 so I cut the pieces more 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.369
 then I wanted to take the opportunity to 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.960
 sponsor two people anyway 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.239
 did something for us is not that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.870
 sponsors people I fucking sponsor 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.300
 then the first it all our king 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.190
 official graph that is always done 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.170
 miniatures always made logos made of 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.470
 everything is very very available 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.269
 channel in description of hacked 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.400
 the channel understood cat success 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.349
 they opened a new one so I wanted to 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.360
 say you have to go if you want 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.129
 the other on the TV network another guy who 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.110
 he gave me some miniatures 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.299
 lately because precisely the king was a 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.840
 busy with school exams 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.650
 and then he helped me and a boy 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.019
 extremely helpful that he parental of 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.120
 call of duty is also very nice to 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.280
 comment then pass I leave the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.530
 his channel in description nothing now 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.720
 let's move on to today's topic which is a 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.730
 cigarettes are smoke and smoke 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.190
 kills all that crap 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.579
 I have never tried smoking before 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.620
 the gypsy on duty was not annexed 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.510
 iraqi but joy that you smoke and already 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.489
 tried to bet we never have 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.250
 tried it I think it's bullshit 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.730
 so I will never try it unless at least 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.519
 I know it turns me in the scazzo and it just isn't 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.280
 something I set out to do 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.950
 I don't like it bothers me badly 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.709
 the smell and then I think it 's one thing 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.530
 really stupid to smoke because not 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.530
 enters in no advantage indeed 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.560
 cigarettes cost a lot to ruin you and 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.260
 health because they generate crack andry 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.900
 other stupid things you all know 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.840
 precisely on the cigarette packet there is 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.989
 also written smoking kills the boys 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.630
 there was the sense you get so much fumes 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.030
 in so much yellow teeth nails 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.940
 anyway there is yellow even if it was in a 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.139
 apartment the walls turn yellow 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.380
 so really suck you ruin yourself 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.419
 and that's enough , people insist on smoking 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.180
 the beauty that if you go there to ask 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.510
 that person but why he was 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.489
 that of ends I told you I started from 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.969
 kid because my parents did it 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.989
 peers my friends or does not know what to tell you 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:17.060
 and this is an embarrassing thing 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.940
 ridiculous because one who does a thing e 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.070
 he does n't know why he does it or does it because he thinks 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.070
 to be a son because there are people 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.500
 boys and kids who smoke because 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.530
 they think they're cool and this thing 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.810
 really disconcerting but you think it's cool 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:38.000
 because it spoils your health, you waste money 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:40.490
 you have something to keep in your mouth and it arrives 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.479
 I just don't explain I don't understand the 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.490
 people who smoke I totally find 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.949
 ridiculous because like I told them not 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.099
 they have a valid reason to do so 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:55.520
 they are some of the goats that they think of 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:57.440
 being cool in doing it or imitating it 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.770
 hoisted when they were small they limit 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.229
 someone older or why? 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.280
 friends do it must do it too 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.770
 boys 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.650
 friends are one of the few things that 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.360
 you can choose to take an example i 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.289
 relatives are not you choose them are 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.110
 those point is enough 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.300
 pick friends if I have friends 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.729
 who smoke but it's not because I don't smoke 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.289
 they exclude them or shit like that 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.699
 my friends respect them 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.880
 respect my choices 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.919
 so it's not because someone from mine 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.360
 company was but I have to smoke and what 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:34.820
 he does not understand people because according to them 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.349
 if your friends smoke then you must 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.020
 start yourself because they do it 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:42.009
 if known they exclude a fucking like me 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.180
 these things I really don't agree with then is 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:46.250
 very difficult to stop smoking I have 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.659
 having seen so many people have us 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.810
 I went out maybe for a couple of 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:53.990
 weeks a month but then a straw 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.690
 you do it again and therefore it is a circle 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.680
 vicious that then the anti- tieri behind for 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.870
 always and generates sick and cheering in 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.110
 crap makes you spend so many 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.060
 money and nothing brings you brings you 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.849
 only in ridicule because I never have 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.669
 heard 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:16.020
 a serious motivation for someone who 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:18.089
 smokes there I don't know I don't know how to explain it to you 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.520
 but I really want to know yours 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:22.619
 opinion on this thing if you smoke 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.199
 tell me why you do it 

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:28.439
 but give yourself a serious knife motivation 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.580
 write me bullshit or things that are not 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:31.469
 neither in heaven nor on earth 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.719
 give me a serious reason why 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:34.800
 someone smoke because your parents 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:36.509
 smoke 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.219
 here is if you have heard the bet 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.319
 ask your parents if they smoke 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:42.269
 because they do such things because 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:44.039
 I believe there are still so much 

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:45.479
 ridiculous nothing imprinted 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:47.939
 coming to an end and I hope this 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:49.919
 topic you enjoyed I want to know 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:52.800
