00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.360
 dental kitchens die from 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.470
 still need a place to put 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.510

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.540

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.230

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.420
 places 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.829

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.980
 OK 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.620
 there where you are seeing is a use of 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.239
 jump lane and sometimes when not 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.280

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.090
 I mean, there and there are the males and 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:13.709

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:27.889
 better here is a little pizza deal 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.319
