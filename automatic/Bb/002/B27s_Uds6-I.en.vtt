00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.639
 Hi, I'm good, as you can see. 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.670
 I'm a little bit of a lot of partying 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.400
 I would say too much and I bring you 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.160
 end the top 10 of the champions that more 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.590
 they put in fear a top at level 6 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.460
 if you think that in the top 10 is swan 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.880
 White 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.680
 you are wrong and you should give him a 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.690
 look at the video 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.279
 it's bring a guest called masters 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.470
 play off in nine years help comment 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.470
 the videos dale started 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.579
 good these days we have to fides tricks 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.410
 but well there we see how you are 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.000
 escaping and yes yes yes I did not move 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:03.000
 is going to stay there waiting to die 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 in number 9 now we have a heel 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.880
 although such is no longer as popular as 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.350
 before, I think he keeps putting a 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.350
 bestiality especially at 6 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.770
 we continue with the top 8 in the 8 we have a 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.770
 morgana 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.930
 well after that even if it's your character 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.900
 a little passive online do not carry six 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.810
 if it bursts you 10 in addition to this one 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.660
 when passive and I say your love wins not me 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.470
 it takes away my skin is your undertaking and 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.470
 volleyball and volleyball 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.510
 and with the top 7 we have the Lord of the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.510
 bush in one 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.300
 one like you have to ask 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.940
 be well but good 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.070
 good day with the last one to put a 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.600
 I think it's your favorite character 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.390
 of aran can be 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.370
 I love the country that is the see and 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.370
 very good singing egg 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.380
 and in the 6 we have james 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.380
 for some countries 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:17.750
 surely this season will give you a prize 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:20.569
 6 is my son of a bitch and it cost me 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.940
 quite stress skills in order with a 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.540
 true socket pair 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.860
 and well we have reached the middle of the top 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.860
 and we continue with the top 5 that is 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.860
 going down 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.890
 al sajar I think it was designed to 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.980
 hide in the bush and wait for 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.880
 seven defeats in lack be that many 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.880
 people 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.690
 and approaching the medal table in the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.580
 position 4 without drama 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.220
 if it comes in I think it's the champions that 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.830
 more competitive are playing now and I 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.160
 late 73 you already know that I got a 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.160
 bestiality 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.300
 finally we get to the top 3 and we go with the 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.300
 bronze medal and now 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.159
 the cold filters online because it was 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.010
 quite do the entire rotation with the 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.349
 fuck the french fruit 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.159
 yes to be a champion of only target 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:27.800
 I'm fair and I do not see it well 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:31.100
 know the average skills 25 years 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:35.260
 finally the silver medal 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.830
 and in the top 2 we have 0 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.519
 the son of the runes who did not like the 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.650
 idea 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.040
 it's a bit impossible to the three charges 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.019
 true 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.019
 the truth is that it does not seem fair to me 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:56.280
 but we are assuming that the one who 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.819
 like the three goats worth 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.100
 without this 1 the gold medal goes down to 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.840
 champion that I like to me now 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.840
 warlike 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.960
 here we have the pulpit I am with you from 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.060
 rage in the top 1 the champion who gets 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.150
 very much I think it was the reasons why 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.090
 what is not playing in this first shot 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.360
 he even did not miss life he missed life of the 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.780
 cider 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.780
 because I was missing 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:36.869
 is the champion who has broken the barrier of 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:40.199
 1000 8,030 damage and you know that 

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:42.869
 that spy with the sturm and I inflate in 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.279
 my studies ports well I say many 

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:47.549
 thanks for helping out too 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:49.439
 thanks to pike and want to get there I'm 

00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:52.129
 fined many many hours trying 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:55.469
 champions of almost all even to burgos 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:58.110
 many laughs and we were surprised by the top 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:05:01.079
 the truth yes yes I thought that between the 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.559
 top 10 leblanc and those you but it seems 

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:06.299
 that they do not lack the year in fact and who 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:08.889
 know in the future equal in the top 10 

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:12.270
 of champions that least get 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.270
 and this person see you
