00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.430 

we<00:00:11.059> designed<00:00:11.420> a<00:00:11.570> lot<00:00:11.719> of<00:00:11.840> the<00:00:11.930> weapons<00:00:12.289> and

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
we designed a lot of the weapons and

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.470 
we designed a lot of the weapons and
vehicles<00:00:12.469> on<00:00:13.100> the<00:00:13.160> western<00:00:13.730> coast<00:00:13.760> inside<00:00:14.330> to

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
vehicles on the western coast inside to

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.099 
vehicles on the western coast inside to
have<00:00:14.600> more<00:00:14.869> of<00:00:14.900> a<00:00:15.049> bird<00:00:15.740> beak<00:00:16.190> ish<00:00:16.430> winged<00:00:17.300> feel

have more of a bird beak ish winged feel

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.470 
have more of a bird beak ish winged feel
whereas<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:18.710> red<00:00:18.859> star<00:00:19.130> stuff<00:00:19.490> I<00:00:19.730> was<00:00:20.300> more

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
whereas the red star stuff I was more

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.689 
whereas the red star stuff I was more
bearish<00:00:20.990> you<00:00:21.169> see<00:00:21.349> Klaus<00:00:21.769> and<00:00:21.800> you<00:00:22.220> see<00:00:22.400> fangs

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
bearish you see Klaus and you see fangs

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.999 
bearish you see Klaus and you see fangs
and<00:00:23.029> you<00:00:23.119> see<00:00:23.269> dragon<00:00:23.869> the<00:00:24.289> weapons<00:00:24.710> are

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
and you see dragon the weapons are

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.640 
and you see dragon the weapons are
extrapolated<00:00:25.699> from<00:00:26.089> real<00:00:27.019> weapons<00:00:27.380> that<00:00:27.560> are

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
extrapolated from real weapons that are

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.589 
extrapolated from real weapons that are
out<00:00:27.740> there<00:00:27.769> right<00:00:28.160> now<00:00:28.220> being<00:00:28.759> a<00:00:28.880> research<00:00:29.359> and

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
out there right now being a research and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.779 
out there right now being a research and
developed<00:00:29.929> by<00:00:30.019> the<00:00:30.050> military<00:00:30.199> I<00:00:30.949> myself<00:00:31.369> have

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
developed by the military I myself have

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.010 
developed by the military I myself have
a<00:00:31.970> background<00:00:32.210> working<00:00:32.630> with<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:32.900> military

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
a background working with the military

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.870 
a background working with the military
so<00:00:33.590> there<00:00:34.040> are<00:00:34.100> a<00:00:34.130> lot<00:00:34.250> of<00:00:34.280> things<00:00:34.550> that<00:00:34.610> I<00:00:34.730> have

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
so there are a lot of things that I have

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.970 
so there are a lot of things that I have
actually<00:00:35.239> been<00:00:35.450> involved<00:00:35.900> with<00:00:36.140> that<00:00:36.530> I've

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
actually been involved with that I've

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.310 
actually been involved with that I've
taken<00:00:37.190> into<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.790> game<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.450> more<00:00:38.630> electronic

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
taken into the game the more electronic

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.930 
taken into the game the more electronic
and<00:00:39.500> high-tech<00:00:39.860> equipment<00:00:40.100> that<00:00:40.460> you<00:00:40.610> can<00:00:40.760> put

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
and high-tech equipment that you can put

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.340 
and high-tech equipment that you can put
in<00:00:40.970> the<00:00:41.120> vehicle<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:41.540> less<00:00:41.750> people<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.200> need

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
in the vehicle the less people you need

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.960 
in the vehicle the less people you need
to<00:00:42.410> manage<00:00:42.770> now<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:43.280> tank<00:00:43.580> could<00:00:43.700> be<00:00:43.820> a<00:00:43.850> little

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
to manage now the tank could be a little

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.570 
to manage now the tank could be a little
smaller<00:00:44.420> little<00:00:44.720> lower<00:00:45.020> profile<00:00:48.400> you<00:00:49.400> don't

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
smaller little lower profile you don't

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.490 
smaller little lower profile you don't
just<00:00:49.730> pick<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.910> weapon<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:50.750> should<00:00:50.960> put<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.170> roll

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
just pick a weapon and should put a roll

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.740 
just pick a weapon and should put a roll
separately<00:00:51.950> for<00:00:52.520> minerals<00:00:52.910> ok<00:00:53.270> well<00:00:53.480> we<00:00:53.600> have

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
separately for minerals ok well we have

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.420 
separately for minerals ok well we have
the<00:00:53.960> ground<00:00:54.350> support<00:00:54.500> role<00:00:54.830> and<00:00:55.070> game<00:00:55.250> is

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
the ground support role and game is

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.530 
the ground support role and game is
based<00:00:55.700> on<00:00:55.790> this<00:00:55.910> front<00:00:56.120> line<00:00:56.270> that<00:00:56.390> moves

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
based on this front line that moves

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.390 
based on this front line that moves
forward<00:00:56.900> and<00:00:57.020> backwards<00:00:57.380> so<00:00:57.950> once<00:00:58.130> you<00:00:58.220> get

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
forward and backwards so once you get

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.650 
forward and backwards so once you get
the<00:00:58.520> front<00:00:58.730> you<00:00:58.850> really<00:00:59.030> want<00:00:59.180> to<00:00:59.240> defend<00:00:59.480> it

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
the front you really want to defend it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.200 
the front you really want to defend it
so<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.440> ground<00:01:00.710> support<00:01:00.860> role<00:01:01.190> is<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.520> place

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
so the ground support role is to place

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.940 
so the ground support role is to place
the<00:01:02.420> playable<00:01:02.780> weapons<00:01:03.080> down<00:01:03.230> like<00:01:03.470> rank<00:01:03.770> you

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
the playable weapons down like rank you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.310 
the playable weapons down like rank you
for<00:01:04.189> example<00:01:04.460> for<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.509> Western<00:01:05.750> coalition

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
for example for the Western coalition

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.349 
for example for the Western coalition
you<00:01:06.560> can<00:01:06.710> deploy<00:01:07.030> employable<00:01:08.030> grenade

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:08.359 
you can deploy employable grenade

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:11.410 
you can deploy employable grenade
launcher<00:01:08.810> kind<00:01:09.679> of<00:01:09.799> evolved<00:01:10.159> from<00:01:10.249> the<00:01:10.399> XM<00:01:10.729> 307

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:22.929 
star lines actually has a sentry gun
what's<00:01:21.679> really<00:01:22.009> powerful<00:01:22.369> really<00:01:22.579> cool<00:01:22.759> to

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
what's really powerful really cool to

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.389 
what's really powerful really cool to
take<00:01:23.090> out<00:01:23.210> history<00:01:23.359> as<00:01:23.659> well<00:01:23.840> as<00:01:23.899> vehicles<00:01:24.469> the

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
take out history as well as vehicles the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.399 
take out history as well as vehicles the
second<00:01:25.850> rolls<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.210> countermeasures<00:01:26.749> roll<00:01:26.929> so

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
second rolls the countermeasures roll so

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.620 
second rolls the countermeasures roll so
say<00:01:27.890> if<00:01:28.219> there's<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.670> lot<00:01:28.909> of<00:01:28.939> equals<00:01:29.359> around

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
you could shoot a rocket out and will

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.209 
you could shoot a rocket out and will
disable<00:01:35.929> the<00:01:36.170> beef<00:01:36.319> so<00:01:36.649> it'll<00:01:36.799> shut<00:01:37.069> down

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
disable the beef so it'll shut down

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.370

specialize<00:03:17.209> in<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:17.630> let's<00:03:17.810> say<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:17.989> want<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.230> be

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
specialize in so let's say I want to be

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.569 
specialize in so let's say I want to be
assault<00:03:18.650> but<00:03:18.829> I<00:03:18.889> want<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.099> specialize<00:03:19.549> in

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
drone technology so i can combine those

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.550

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
game so I can do the opposite i can be

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.839 
game so I can do the opposite i can be
the<00:03:41.989> same<00:03:42.260> sniper<00:03:42.470> but<00:03:42.919> use<00:03:43.069> drone<00:03:43.370> tech<00:03:43.579> and
