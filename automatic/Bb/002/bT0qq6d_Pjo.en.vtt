00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.250
We are back here in Are for Red Bull Home Run.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.180
This is my favorite event, I won it a year ago.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.220
There are more people now, I'm going to ski away from 350 people.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.310
It will be harder this year, Petter Nortugh is here.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.180
There are professionals here as well as regular skiers

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.070
and then you have people here which are just here looking for a good time. 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.050
They have dressed up and are just enjoying this, and its this mix that makes it so great. 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.100
There are lots of people here who want to beat me, but I'm prepared for that.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.080
I have scared away everybody, im here on my own now. People are scared to be around me but why?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.160
Am I really that dangerous?  

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.010
This will be dangerous and fun.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.090
I have a tazer with me, im going to use it

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.070
on people that will try and pass me.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.240
Competitions are just fun when you finish and win. 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.240
Everything else in a competition is really pretty shitty.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.010
The Snow is very hard

00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:09.220
it's scary

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.210
 lots of anxiety

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.060
it's

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.170
really no fun.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.010
Bloody hell!

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.240
It was extremely loose, bang bang bang bang.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.150
They where behind me all time like fa fa fa fa

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.140
It was very hard work but funny as hell.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.200
This is much harder then a 50km XC race,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.120
much harder!

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.100
I was so angry and exhausted, oh my good.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.140
Insanely fun and insanely hard

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.050
It went well.  Really cool!

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.210
At the beginning, I was flying over the moguls

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.020
but later I was just sliding over them.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.020
This was really cool, people where flying,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.020
skis came flying and there was poles everywhere!

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.130
So yes, this was really cool.
