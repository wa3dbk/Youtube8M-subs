magic wand tool and I want to make sure

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.210 
magic wand tool and I want to make sure
that<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:58.720> is<00:02:58.900> sitting<00:02:59.320> on<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.830> add<00:03:00.010> the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
selection and the tolerance I usually

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.030 
selection and the tolerance I usually
work<00:03:04.030> anywhere<00:03:04.480> from<00:03:04.960> ten<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.530> thirty<00:03:05.920> and

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.710 
work anywhere from ten to thirty and
it's<00:03:06.280> set<00:03:06.550> at<00:03:06.700> twenty<00:03:07.120> right<00:03:07.270> now<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.630> I'm

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
it's set at twenty right now so I'm

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.270 
it's set at twenty right now so I'm
going<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.900> try<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.200> what<00:03:08.680> I'm<00:03:08.770> looking<00:03:09.040> for

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
going to try that what I'm looking for

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.950 
going to try that what I'm looking for
is<00:03:09.400> just<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.820> see<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.060> it's<00:03:10.330> picking<00:03:10.690> up<00:03:10.780> the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
is just to see that it's picking up the

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.170 
is just to see that it's picking up the
gray<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.590> it's<00:03:11.770> not<00:03:11.980> spilling<00:03:12.520> on<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:13.030> my

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
gray and it's not spilling on to my

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.100 
gray and it's not spilling on to my
subjects<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:16.360> I'm<00:03:16.510> just<00:03:16.630> going<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.840> click

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
subjects so I'm just going to click

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.240 
subjects so I'm just going to click
through<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.770> gray<00:03:18.870> until<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.110> picks<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.070> all

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
through the gray until it picks it all

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.270 
through the gray until it picks it all
up<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:25.090> looks<00:03:25.360> pretty<00:03:25.750> good<00:03:26.020> I<00:03:26.350> don't

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
up and that looks pretty good I don't

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.970 
up and that looks pretty good I don't
see<00:03:27.610> any<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.239> spilling<00:03:28.810> on<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.230> my<00:03:29.410> subjects

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
see any of it spilling on to my subjects

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.979 
see any of it spilling on to my subjects
and<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.310> think<00:03:30.580> I've<00:03:30.700> got<00:03:30.940> all<00:03:31.180> of<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.570> gray

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
and I think I've got all of the gray

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.170 
and I think I've got all of the gray
background<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:33.160> now<00:03:33.310> I'm<00:03:33.400> going<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.730> go<00:03:33.880> pick

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
background so now I'm going to go pick

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.110 
background so now I'm going to go pick
up<00:03:34.330> my<00:03:34.540> brush<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.290> I'm<00:03:36.220> just<00:03:36.250> using<00:03:36.730> the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
up my brush and I'm just using the

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.030 
up my brush and I'm just using the
average<00:03:37.300> brush<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.959> I<00:03:38.080> always<00:03:38.470> kind<00:03:38.800> of<00:03:38.860> go

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
average brush that I always kind of go

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.490 
average brush that I always kind of go
to<00:03:39.100> I<00:03:39.730> use<00:03:39.940> this<00:03:40.239> one<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.750> doesn't<00:03:41.110> matter<00:03:41.290> if

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
to I use this one it doesn't matter if

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.050 
to I use this one it doesn't matter if
it's<00:03:41.680> hard<00:03:41.920> or<00:03:42.070> soft<00:03:42.220> right<00:03:42.580> now<00:03:42.610> because

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
it's hard or soft right now because

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.830 
it's hard or soft right now because
you've<00:03:43.540> selected<00:03:44.050> just<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.920> background<00:03:45.840> I'm

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
you've selected just the background I'm

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.990 
you've selected just the background I'm
going<00:03:47.020> to<00:03:47.080> use<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.380> right<00:03:47.590> bracket<00:03:47.920> key<00:03:48.190> to

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
going to use the right bracket key to

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.990 
going to use the right bracket key to
increase<00:03:49.300> my<00:03:49.480> brush<00:03:49.720> size<00:03:50.670> because<00:03:51.670> I'm<00:03:51.820> only

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
increase my brush size because I'm only

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.870 
increase my brush size because I'm only
at<00:03:52.270> 40%<00:03:52.720> this<00:03:53.320> is<00:03:53.530> generally<00:03:54.160> where<00:03:54.370> I<00:03:54.400> do<00:03:54.580> my

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880

over<00:04:09.489> here<00:04:09.790> that's<00:04:10.000> what<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.150> used<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.600> do<00:04:10.920> but

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
over here that's what I used to do but

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.229 
over here that's what I used to do but
now<00:04:12.070> that<00:04:12.220> I've<00:04:12.340> gotten<00:04:12.550> used<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.970> where<00:04:13.209> I

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
now that I've gotten used to where I

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.600 
now that I've gotten used to where I
like<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:13.930> it's<00:04:14.620> easier<00:04:14.920> for<00:04:14.950> me<00:04:15.130> to<00:04:15.250> see<00:04:15.430> what

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
like it it's easier for me to see what

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.509 
like it it's easier for me to see what
I'm<00:04:15.700> doing<00:04:16.180> if<00:04:16.870> I<00:04:17.080> have<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:17.799> at<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.070> opacity

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
I'm doing if I have it at the opacity

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.570 
I'm doing if I have it at the opacity
that<00:04:18.850> I'm<00:04:19.150> going<00:04:19.570> to<00:04:19.690> finish<00:04:19.810> with<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:21.280> I'm

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
that I'm going to finish with so I'm

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.659

I'm going to come over here to my paint
layer<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:45.080> turn<00:04:45.259> it<00:04:45.439> off<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:46.099> turn<00:04:46.310> it<00:04:46.340> back

on to make sure it's not spilled on to

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.059 
on to make sure it's not spilled on to
anything<00:04:49.939> that<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.270> don't<00:04:50.569> want<00:04:50.840> it<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:51.169> and<00:04:51.680> it

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.069 
anything that I don't want it to and it

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.700 
anything that I don't want it to and it
looks<00:04:52.280> pretty<00:04:52.550> good<00:04:52.849> and<00:04:53.139> again<00:04:54.139> I<00:04:54.169> can<00:04:54.469> come

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
looks pretty good and again I can come

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.159 
looks pretty good and again I can come
over<00:04:54.740> here<00:04:55.039> to<00:04:55.430> my<00:04:55.909> opacity<00:04:56.240> on<00:04:56.719> that<00:04:56.900> layer

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
over here to my opacity on that layer

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.679 
over here to my opacity on that layer
and<00:04:57.740> mess<00:04:58.159> with<00:04:58.430> it<00:04:58.580> to<00:04:58.759> see<00:04:59.300> if<00:04:59.389> I<00:04:59.449> want<00:04:59.629> to

00:04:59.679 --> 00:04:59.689 
and mess with it to see if I want to

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:01.689 
and mess with it to see if I want to
pull<00:04:59.870> more<00:05:00.110> of<00:05:00.229> that<00:05:00.379> shadow<00:05:00.889> and<00:05:01.340> but<00:05:01.610> I<00:05:01.639> think

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
pull more of that shadow and but I think

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.550 
pull more of that shadow and but I think
I<00:05:01.969> like<00:05:02.210> it

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
I like it

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.820 
I like it
at<00:05:03.949> a<00:05:04.009> hundred<00:05:04.580> percent<00:05:05.439> now<00:05:06.439> this<00:05:06.650> is

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
at a hundred percent now this is

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.649 
at a hundred percent now this is
basically<00:05:07.370> done<00:05:07.729> as<00:05:07.909> far<00:05:08.120> as<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.419> backdrop

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:08.659 
basically done as far as the backdrop

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.129 
basically done as far as the backdrop
goes<00:05:10.029> everything<00:05:11.029> is<00:05:11.330> nice<00:05:11.509> and<00:05:11.539> smooth<00:05:11.990> I

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
goes everything is nice and smooth I

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.200 
goes everything is nice and smooth I
still<00:05:12.409> have<00:05:12.590> a<00:05:12.620> light<00:05:12.919> side<00:05:13.189> and<00:05:13.219> I<00:05:13.669> still<00:05:14.000> have

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
still have a light side and I still have

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.879 
still have a light side and I still have
my<00:05:15.050> shadow<00:05:15.379> over<00:05:15.889> here<00:05:16.569> I<00:05:17.569> would<00:05:18.469> take<00:05:18.680> this<00:05:18.830> a

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
my shadow over here I would take this a

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.679 
my shadow over here I would take this a
step<00:05:19.009> further<00:05:19.400> because<00:05:19.699> I<00:05:19.879> have<00:05:20.150> an<00:05:20.240> action

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 
step further because I have an action

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.140 
step further because I have an action
set<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.259> I<00:05:21.289> use<00:05:21.529> for<00:05:21.740> my<00:05:21.860> newborn's<00:05:22.580> and<00:05:22.879> I'm

going to go ahead and play one of those
so<00:05:25.849> you<00:05:25.879> can<00:05:25.969> see<00:05:26.300> what<00:05:26.449> it<00:05:26.569> looks<00:05:26.779> like<00:05:27.159> I<00:05:28.839> use

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:52.819 
kind of lightens it and makes it a
