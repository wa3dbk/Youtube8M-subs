00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
step okay I brought it to a boil after

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.210 
step okay I brought it to a boil after
it<00:02:15.990> started<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.410> boil<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.800> dropped<00:02:17.070> the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
it started to boil I dropped the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.190 
it started to boil I dropped the
temperature<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.790> I've<00:02:17.940> simmered<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.570> for<00:02:18.750> 25

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
temperature and I've simmered it for 25

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.910 
temperature and I've simmered it for 25
minutes<00:02:20.150> now<00:02:21.150> what<00:02:21.330> we're<00:02:21.450> going<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.630> do<00:02:21.840> is

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
have an old bed sheet set up here for a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.090 
have an old bed sheet set up here for a
1/2<00:02:29.430> gallon<00:02:29.760> bucket<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.620> put<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> rubber<00:02:31.860> band

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
1/2 gallon bucket I put a rubber band

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.920 
1/2 gallon bucket I put a rubber band
around<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.700> could<00:02:32.820> also<00:02:32.970> use<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> bungee

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
around it you could also use a bungee

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.230 
around it you could also use a bungee
cord<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.230> hold<00:02:34.500> it

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
cord to hold it

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.270 
cord to hold it
we're<00:02:36.240> going<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.450> strain<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:37.320> our<00:02:38.040> tea

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
we're going to strain it on our tea

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.970 
we're going to strain it on our tea
mixture<00:02:38.640> through<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.480> I've<00:02:39.980> doubled

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
mixture through that and I've doubled

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:56.320 
mixture through that and I've doubled
that<00:02:41.070> up<00:02:41.130> about<00:02:41.520> four<00:02:41.820> times<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:43.350> filter<00:02:43.680> it

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.490 

this<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.480> gonna<00:02:57.630> be<00:02:57.810> better<00:02:58.019> than<00:02:58.230> anything

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
this is gonna be better than anything

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.770 
this is gonna be better than anything
you<00:02:58.800> buy<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.280> hunting<00:02:59.580> store<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.630> the

you buy in the hunting store and the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.180 
you buy in the hunting store and the
reason<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.440> because<00:03:01.680> you're<00:03:01.950> getting

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
reason that is is because you're getting

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.510 
reason that is is because you're getting
stuff<00:03:02.430> from<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.670> area<00:03:03.090> you're<00:03:03.330> hunting

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.460 

instead<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.270> relying<00:03:08.600> on<00:03:08.840> what's<00:03:09.080> in<00:03:09.290> the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
instead of relying on what's in the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.680 
instead of relying on what's in the
purchase<00:03:10.370> product<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.240> would<00:03:14.330> be<00:03:14.420> careful
