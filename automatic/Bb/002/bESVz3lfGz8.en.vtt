00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.060 
basically what they're writing on here
is<00:01:47.909> there<00:01:48.240> taking<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.960> well-known<00:01:49.890> name

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
is there taking a a well-known name

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.950 
is there taking a a well-known name
that's<00:01:50.310> already<00:01:50.610> implemented<00:01:51.210> itself<00:01:51.570> into

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that's already implemented itself into

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.340 
that's already implemented itself into
the<00:01:52.049> industry<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.680> trying<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:54.140> translate<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the industry and trying to translate it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.920 
the industry and trying to translate it
over<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> whole<00:01:56.040> new<00:01:56.219> audience<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:57.570> problem

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
over to a whole new audience the problem

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.660 
over to a whole new audience the problem
is<00:01:58.079> they're<00:01:58.799> hoping<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> audience

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
is they're hoping that the audience

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.310 
is they're hoping that the audience
that's<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.299> now<00:02:00.479> we'll<00:02:00.780> stick<00:02:01.079> with<00:02:01.110> it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
that's with it now we'll stick with it

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.510 
that's with it now we'll stick with it
which<00:02:01.979> unfortunately<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.329> think<00:02:03.780> they<00:02:04.170> won't

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
which unfortunately I think they won't

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
which unfortunately I think they won't
actually<00:02:05.520> fortunately<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.180> think<00:02:06.360> they<00:02:06.420> don't

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
actually fortunately I think they don't

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.180 
actually fortunately I think they don't
so<00:02:06.719> maybe<00:02:06.899> they<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.170> stop<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.860> actually

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
so maybe they can stop this and actually

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.449 
so maybe they can stop this and actually
keep<00:02:08.789> making<00:02:09.090> RPGs<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.899> not<00:02:10.619> leave<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.250> roots

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
keep making RPGs and not leave the roots

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.830 
keep making RPGs and not leave the roots
