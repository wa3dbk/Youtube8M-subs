to do is I'm just going to try to show
you<00:01:40.170> guys<00:01:40.380> without<00:01:41.990> messing<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.140> up<00:01:43.380> but

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
you guys without messing this up but

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.230 
you guys without messing this up but
what<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.130> want<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.850> want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.030> make<00:01:45.210> sure

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
what I want to do is I want to make sure

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.749 
what I want to do is I want to make sure
that<00:01:45.600> there<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> Lisa<00:01:46.409> 1/4<00:01:47.009> seam<00:01:47.310> allowance

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
that there is a Lisa 1/4 seam allowance

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.609 
that there is a Lisa 1/4 seam allowance
around<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.180> whole<00:01:48.390> thing<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.110> when<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.439> go

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
around the whole thing so that when I go

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.950 
around the whole thing so that when I go
to<00:01:49.649> cut<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.070> out<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.729> cut<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.240> now

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
to cut this out I can cut this out now

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.050 
to cut this out I can cut this out now
this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:52.950> important<00:01:53.399> thing<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.759> found

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
this is one important thing that I found

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.929 
this is one important thing that I found
out<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:55.049> difference<00:01:55.439> between<00:01:55.939> these

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
out the difference between these

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.670 
out the difference between these
particular<00:01:57.270> patterns<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.110> are<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> book

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
particular patterns that are in the book

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.969 
particular patterns that are in the book
as<00:01:58.969> well<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.899> patterns<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.770> would

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
as well as the patterns that you would

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.039 
as well as the patterns that you would
actually<00:02:02.430> sew<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.299> McCall<00:02:03.600> patterns

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
actually sew it like the McCall patterns

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.270 
actually sew it like the McCall patterns
and<00:02:04.259> different<00:02:04.500> things<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.100> vogue

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and different things like that the vogue

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.150 
and different things like that the vogue
patterns<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:07.170> wouldn't<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.890> way<00:02:08.099> but

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
patterns you wouldn't do it this way but

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.499 
patterns you wouldn't do it this way but
I'm<00:02:08.429> going<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.610> show<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.090> way<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> do

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
I'm going to show you the way that I do

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.350 
I'm going to show you the way that I do
this<00:02:10.080> particular<00:02:10.950> pattern<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.970> think<00:02:12.209> this

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
this particular pattern and I think this

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.490 
this particular pattern and I think this
is<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.569> way<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.810> they<00:02:12.959> teach<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.319> in

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
is the way that they teach you in

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.860 
is the way that they teach you in
book<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:14.520> what<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.970> want<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.300> do<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.570> actually

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
book so what you want to do is actually

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.740 
book so what you want to do is actually
um<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:17.130> want<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.580> put<00:02:18.000> your<00:02:18.150> pattern<00:02:18.540> piece

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
um you want to put your pattern piece

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.530 
um you want to put your pattern piece
down<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.380> just<00:02:20.160> make<00:02:20.250> sure<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:21.060> meets<00:02:21.210> up

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
down and just make sure that it meets up

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.370 
down and just make sure that it meets up
really<00:02:21.900> well

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
really well

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.320 
really well
underneath<00:02:22.800> meaning<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.580> your<00:02:23.820> fabric<00:02:24.090> is

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
underneath meaning that your fabric is

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.600 
underneath meaning that your fabric is
the<00:02:24.450> same<00:02:24.690> length<00:02:24.990> on<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.920> underneath<00:02:26.370> side

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
the same length on the underneath side

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.030 
the same length on the underneath side
and<00:02:27.000> all<00:02:27.540> I'm<00:02:27.720> going<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.960> do<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.230> just<00:02:28.440> trace

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and all I'm going to do is just trace

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.830 
and all I'm going to do is just trace
her<00:02:29.340> out<00:02:29.550> if<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.360> do<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.440> around<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
her out if I can do this around the the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.070 
her out if I can do this around the the
tripod<00:02:34.410> but<00:02:34.770> I'm<00:02:34.920> just<00:02:35.190> simply<00:02:35.870> tracing<00:02:36.870> out

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
tripod but I'm just simply tracing out

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.490 
tripod but I'm just simply tracing out
the<00:02:37.709> image<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:40.740> am<00:02:41.640> tracing<00:02:42.420> directly<00:02:43.320> on

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
the image and I am tracing directly on

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.080 
the image and I am tracing directly on
the<00:02:43.650> line<00:02:44.000> but<00:02:45.260> that<00:02:46.260> is<00:02:46.440> going<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.709> be

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
the line but that is going to be

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.290 
the line but that is going to be
actually<00:02:48.090> where<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.330> sew<00:02:49.070> okay<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:50.940> I'm<00:02:51.090> going

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
actually where I sew okay so I'm going

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.530 
actually where I sew okay so I'm going
to<00:02:51.330> actually<00:02:51.510> sew<00:02:52.110> on<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:53.250> same<00:02:53.550> lines<00:02:53.940> right

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
to actually sew on the same lines right

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:02.030 
to actually sew on the same lines right
now<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:55.950> am<00:02:56.450> tracing<00:02:57.450> out<00:02:57.780> oh<00:02:58.320> oh<00:03:01.040> I'm

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
now that I am tracing out oh oh I'm

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.400 
now that I am tracing out oh oh I'm
sorry<00:03:02.250> guys<00:03:03.170> I'm<00:03:04.170> messing<00:03:04.650> up<00:03:04.739> here<00:03:09.170> it's<00:03:10.170> hard

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
sorry guys I'm messing up here it's hard

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.580 
sorry guys I'm messing up here it's hard
to<00:03:10.590> do<00:03:10.830> this<00:03:11.040> around<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.090> camera<00:03:12.540> but<00:03:12.780> we're

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
to do this around the camera but we're

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.640 
to do this around the camera but we're
going<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.800> make<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.040> work<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:15.470> like<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.590> said

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
going to make it work and like I said

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.580 
going to make it work and like I said
this<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.190> air<00:03:17.430> erasable<00:03:18.269> pen<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:19.110> any

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
this is the air erasable pen so any

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.320 
this is the air erasable pen so any
little<00:03:19.950> bubbles<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.549> make<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.030> doesn't

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
little bubbles that I make it doesn't

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.520 
little bubbles that I make it doesn't
really<00:03:21.420> matter<00:03:21.690> because<00:03:21.900> it's<00:03:22.350> going<00:03:22.470> to

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
really matter because it's going to

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.550 
really matter because it's going to
erase<00:03:22.950> anyway<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:24.510> can<00:03:24.660> also<00:03:24.840> take<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.200> damp

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
erase anyway you can also take a damp

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.009 
erase anyway you can also take a damp
rag<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.250> wipe<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.670> away<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.570> just<00:03:27.840> knew<00:03:27.959> I

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
rag and wipe it away so I just knew I

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.199 
rag and wipe it away so I just knew I
need<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.320> come<00:03:28.530> all<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.950> way<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.220> here<00:03:29.549> but

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
need to come all the way in here but

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.539 
need to come all the way in here but
that<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:30.840> my<00:03:31.049> pattern<00:03:31.440> piece<00:03:31.620> traced<00:03:32.040> out<00:03:32.280> and

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
that is my pattern piece traced out and

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.640 
that is my pattern piece traced out and
I<00:03:32.670> got<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.970> come<00:03:33.150> all<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.600> way<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.959> right<00:03:34.320> here

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
I got to come all the way in right here

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.570 
I got to come all the way in right here
so<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:36.090> my<00:03:36.840> girl<00:03:37.080> so<00:03:37.350> far<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.950> mind<00:03:38.459> you

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
so that is my girl so far and mind you

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.400

your machine you would sew it in this

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.960 
your machine you would sew it in this
case<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.930> would<00:04:25.020> actually<00:04:25.340> trace<00:04:26.340> out<00:04:26.610> your

1/4 now you can do it the other way you

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.200 
1/4 now you can do it the other way you
can<00:04:40.530> cut<00:04:40.920> make<00:04:41.460> sure<00:04:41.640> that<00:04:41.730> you're<00:04:41.940> cutting

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
1/4 around the entire body to make sure

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.540 
1/4 around the entire body to make sure
that<00:04:46.170> you<00:04:46.320> have<00:04:46.500> enough<00:04:46.740> room<00:04:46.860> when<00:04:47.280> you<00:04:47.370> go<00:04:47.490> to

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
that you have enough room when you go to

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.160 
that you have enough room when you go to
cut<00:04:47.790> but<00:04:48.000> then<00:04:48.150> you're<00:04:48.600> going<00:04:48.690> to<00:04:48.780> have<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:49.020> go

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
cut but then you're going to have to go

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.630 
cut but then you're going to have to go
back<00:04:49.350> and<00:04:49.500> pin<00:04:49.680> this<00:04:49.830> together<00:04:50.010> and<00:04:50.430> all<00:04:50.610> that

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640

back and pin this together and all that
good<00:04:50.910> stuff<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.330> think<00:04:51.870> that<00:04:51.990> it's<00:04:52.110> easier<00:04:52.470> to

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
good stuff I think that it's easier to

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.280 
good stuff I think that it's easier to
just<00:04:53.010> go<00:04:53.670> ahead<00:04:53.730> and<00:04:54.270> sew<00:04:55.230> this<00:04:55.470> before

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.920 
just go ahead and sew this before
before<00:04:58.290> you<00:04:58.670> cut<00:04:59.670> it<00:04:59.760> out<00:04:59.850> so<00:05:00.420> I'll<00:05:00.630> be<00:05:00.780> back

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930
