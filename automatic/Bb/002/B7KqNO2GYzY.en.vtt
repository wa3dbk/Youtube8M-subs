00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.000
Abuelita.. Me dices unos de esos poemas que tu sabes?

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.500
Sure, Phizz. Which one you want?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
El de los colores

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.000
Ok, the one about all the colors

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Red is a tasty apple
You crunch and you munch,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Red is your favorite jello
You eat for your lunch!

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Colours, colours, everywhere

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.800
I see colours here and there,
Upstairs, downstairs, inside and out

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.300
Colours make me want to shout!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.200
Yellow is the sun
Shining bright and warm,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.500
Yellow is a banana
And a sweet, delicious corn.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.000
Colours, colours, everywhere

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.000
I see colours here and there,
Upstairs, downstairs, inside and out

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Colours make me want to shout!

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.800
Blue is the sky
Where the birds fly,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.300
Blue is the ocean
With fishes swimming by.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.500
Colours, colours, everywhere

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.900
I see colours here and there,
Upstairs, downstairs, inside and ou

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.500
Colours make me want to shout!

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.800
Green is the grass
Underneath my feet,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.800
Green are the vegetables
That I love to eat.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.500
Colours, colours, everywhere

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I see colours here and there,
Upstairs, downstairs, inside and ou

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.500
Colours make me want to shout!

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.500
White is the snow
That falls from the sky,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
White are cottontails
On bunnies hopping by.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.900
Colours, colours, everywhere

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.000
I see colours here and there,
Upstairs, downstairs, inside and out

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.900
Colours make me want to shout!

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.400
Black are my shoes
you wear to school,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.000
Black is the night
Where the air is cool.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.500
Colours, colours, everywhere

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I see colours here and there,
Upstairs, downstairs, inside and out

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.000
Colours make me want to shout!

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.700
Otra vez abuelita

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.700
Itâ€™s your turn now
