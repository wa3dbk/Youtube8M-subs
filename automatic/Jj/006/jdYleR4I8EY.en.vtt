00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 Hello everyone and today I will show you how 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.670
 make coffee here in this coffee machine 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.519
 i will make cappuccino 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.509
 before making coffee you need to pour in 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.690
 this tank 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.680
 water is the most important thing that the water level is not 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.320
 reached the maximum following what we 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:35.850
 you need to do this and of course pour 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:40.940
 coffee here we got coffee and for this 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.940
 we will need such a spoon 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.180
 so how can I say baby therefore 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.120
 I will need less coffee 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:05.580
 than for adults it's about here 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:13.820
 so much we pour now we take another 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.820
 side of the boat and press down we rammed 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.640
 so that everything is even 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:35.420
 somehow so i think i have enough back 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:40.320
 paste and scroll to the end 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:44.479
 closing the coffee and she is no longer 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:49.430
 will need now we take a mug and 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.430
 pour milk there 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:04.070
 Now we turn on the coffee machine and wait 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.700
 when it warms up when this lights up 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.530
 light bulb then it means the output is warmed up 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.610
 when the light is green 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.650
 then you can switch to cappuccinator and 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.360
 wait for this button to light up 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.280
 green but for steam 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:28.190
 but for now we are waiting for steam we add in 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:31.310
 milk is sugar well and how much sugar 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.050
 it is up to you and so is ours 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.650
 light bulb lit up now we can 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.000

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.040

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.010
