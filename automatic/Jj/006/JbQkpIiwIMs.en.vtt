00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.380
 Ice hockey we play is a very 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.570
 fast sport clearly the fastest 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.490
 Team sports of the world a very 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.970
 fine trickier and technology richer 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.970
 Sports 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.609
 so from three years, that makes sense 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.409
 some children from 3 years to the 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:47.829
 four of us are also in order 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.030
 5 is already good and then it will be 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.100
 thanks for a bit harder one 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.780
 bit difficult but so 10 12 is 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.979
 then it will be difficult 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.519
 enter because the others are already 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.519
 really good 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.570
 exclusion criterion, there's no first 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.280
 So especially if children a bit too 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.719
 a lot on the ribs shows up 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.969
 that regular training of 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:21.750
 Hockey really helps a bit 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.750
 slim down 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.320
 action factor ice hockey that really high 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.570
 so if I think so from my perspective 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.640
 should then be after mine 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.990
 view football is about here 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.110
 in any case, but in any case corners 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.429
 Everything's okay, there it is 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.590
 really action because in such a 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.810
 real ice hockey montur with helmet and 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.240
 Strike out and against the others 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.470
 compete and on the ice and again high 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.689
 and may be yes but not really 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.689
 hurt this is action factor pure 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.219
 there are always injuries 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.349
 ice hockey that is mostly in the 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:31.859
 a little older age is when the 15 so 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.810
 16 why just so ostliga puberty in it 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.769
 yes, then the action is loaded and 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.599
 Sometimes they are also sometimes 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.599
 aggressive and heed the rules 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.000
 we're trying a social one 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.500
 with each other so that the basic idea 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.850
 of team sports too 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.350
 and that 's what it's about 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.330
 win again why had to lose 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.680
 I'm coming to terms with both circumstances 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.830
 there we are like other sports 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.830
 also 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.750
 they have to introduce themselves as well 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.400
 your children grow up at home and everyone 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.050
 Buy fall shoes and buy a pair of trousers 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.560
 and then it grows again and again 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.940
 buy new 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.319
 so it is with ice hockey and that 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.970
 Of course that means one 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.340
 huge fundus of used things 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.810
 there are in circulation and they are there 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.810
 relatively cheap 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:57.310
 they do not make cdg and kv yes the 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.210
 Great clubs but we are not 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.150
 here too there is a first team 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.410
 yes, they are then regionalliga and that 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.060
 also a compensation 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.730
 here you still get 500 euros a month 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.250
 or you get the big one in 2000 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.960
 15,000 So where is the limit 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.600
 absolute profile love foreign canadian 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.160
 Czech league a little maybe 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.160
 one percent 2
