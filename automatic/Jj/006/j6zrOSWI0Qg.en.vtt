00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
physics engine I did not expect this at

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.219 
physics engine I did not expect this at
all<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.850> while<00:01:48.360> I've<00:01:48.540> looked<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> physics

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
all and while I've looked at the physics

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.139 
all and while I've looked at the physics
engine<00:01:49.350> doesn't<00:01:49.710> look<00:01:49.950> too<00:01:50.369> entirely

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
engine doesn't look too entirely

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.389 
engine doesn't look too entirely
different<00:01:51.509> from<00:01:51.659> Madden<00:01:52.020> 12<00:01:52.290> I've<00:01:52.590> noticed

different from Madden 12 I've noticed

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.819 
different from Madden 12 I've noticed
some<00:01:53.549> changes<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:54.030> tackling<00:01:54.750> mainly<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
some changes with tackling mainly and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.590 
some changes with tackling mainly and
we'll<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.189> what<00:01:56.340> further<00:01:56.610> tuning<00:01:57.270> they<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.420> to

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
we'll see what further tuning they do to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.240 
we'll see what further tuning they do to
the<00:01:57.719> game<00:01:57.930> before<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.350> August<00:01:58.590> twenty-eighth

gameplay for madden 13 I've seen a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.060 
gameplay for madden 13 I've seen a
little<00:02:03.450> bit<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.380> want<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.619> see<00:02:04.829> more<00:02:05.009> of

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
little bit I just want to see more of

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.560 
little bit I just want to see more of
like<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.610> wide<00:02:05.939> receiver<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.509> defensive

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
like the wide receiver and defensive

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.210 
like the wide receiver and defensive
back<00:02:07.079> interaction<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.039> how<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
back interaction and see how the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.859 
back interaction and see how the
computer<00:02:08.789> can<00:02:09.000> cover<00:02:09.239> certain<00:02:09.569> routes

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
computer can cover certain routes

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.910 
computer can cover certain routes
because<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.229> course<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.560> Madden<00:02:10.860> 12<00:02:11.069> there<00:02:11.730> are

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
because of course in Madden 12 there are

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.920 
because of course in Madden 12 there are
rhodes<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.370> computer<00:02:12.849> simply<00:02:13.150> cannot<00:02:13.540> handle

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
rhodes the computer simply cannot handle

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.660 
rhodes the computer simply cannot handle
the<00:02:14.050> halfback<00:02:14.500> angle<00:02:14.980> route<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.459> four

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
the halfback angle route the four

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.430 
the halfback angle route the four
verticals<00:02:16.180> play<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.630> computer<00:02:16.989> can't<00:02:17.230> cover

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
verticals play the computer can't cover

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.410 
verticals play the computer can't cover
a<00:02:17.560> lot<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.800> stuff<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.970> that's<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.180> one<00:02:19.300> of

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.309 
game I never my last game I played it
was<00:03:10.060> probably<00:03:10.269> about<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.450> hundred<00:03:10.690> combined

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
was probably about a hundred combined

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.870 
was probably about a hundred combined
points<00:03:11.650> scored<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.310> there<00:03:12.400> was<00:03:12.489> like<00:03:12.640> kick

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
points scored and there was like kick

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.490 
points scored and there was like kick
returns<00:03:13.180> for<00:03:13.450> touchdowns<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.290> was<00:03:14.380> just

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
returns for touchdowns and it was just

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.099 
returns for touchdowns and it was just
an<00:03:14.590> offensively<00:03:15.190> focused<00:03:15.700> game<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.870> did

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
an offensively focused game and I did

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.810 
an offensively focused game and I did
not<00:03:17.260> like<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.500> all<00:03:17.769> because<00:03:18.040> I'm<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.190> sim<00:03:18.489> style

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
very good motor is probably better on

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.319 
very good motor is probably better on
the<00:03:35.709> PlayStation<00:03:36.340> 2<00:03:36.549> but<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.850> can't<00:03:37.120> remember

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
the PlayStation 2 but I can't remember

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.960 
the PlayStation 2 but I can't remember
that<00:03:37.600> far<00:03:37.660> back<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:39.280> connected<00:03:39.700> careers

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
that far back so the connected careers

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.490 
that far back so the connected careers
mode<00:03:40.209> as<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:40.420> other<00:03:40.540> big<00:03:40.780> thing<00:03:41.019> besides<00:03:41.350> the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
mode as the other big thing besides the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.830

physics<00:03:41.890> engine<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.459> course<00:03:43.090> there's<00:03:43.329> now<00:03:43.450> the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
physics engine of course there's now the

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.960 
physics engine of course there's now the
opportunity<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.440> play<00:03:44.560> as<00:03:44.799> our<00:03:44.980> control<00:03:45.940> a

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
opportunity to play as our control a

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.849 
opportunity to play as our control a
coach<00:03:46.390> I<00:03:46.600> guess<00:03:46.780> which<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.109> same<00:03:47.320> thing<00:03:47.380> as

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
coach I guess which is the same thing as

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.680 
coach I guess which is the same thing as
being<00:03:48.100> in<00:03:48.280> franchise<00:03:48.790> mode<00:03:49.090> except<00:03:49.450> for

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
being in franchise mode except for

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.360 
being in franchise mode except for
you're<00:03:50.230> more<00:03:50.470> of<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.680> character<00:03:50.920> you're<00:03:51.250> not

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
you're more of a character you're not

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.190 
you're more of a character you're not
taking<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:51.940> role<00:03:52.120> of<00:03:52.150> like<00:03:52.420> Leslie<00:03:52.870> Frazier

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
taking the role of like Leslie Frazier

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.809 
taking the role of like Leslie Frazier
against<00:03:53.590> our<00:03:53.739> kind<00:03:53.890> of<00:03:53.950> its<00:03:54.070> like<00:03:54.130> overseeing

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
against our kind of its like overseeing

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.309 
against our kind of its like overseeing
is<00:03:55.030> like<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.269> god<00:03:55.540> of<00:03:55.569> the<00:03:55.870> football<00:03:56.109> team

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
is like the god of the football team

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.380 
is like the god of the football team
you're<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.310> coach<00:03:57.519> you<00:03:57.790> make<00:03:57.940> all<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.209> same

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
you're the coach you make all the same

you're the coach you make all the same
decisions<00:03:58.959> as<00:03:59.140> you<00:03:59.290> used<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.650> and<00:03:59.950> now<00:04:00.519> there's

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
decisions as you used to and now there's

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.390

a<00:04:00.910> new<00:04:01.060> like<00:04:01.410> RPG<00:04:02.410> element<00:04:02.890> where<00:04:03.069> you<00:04:03.190> use

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
a new like RPG element where you use

a new like RPG element where you use
your<00:04:03.730> experience<00:04:04.390> points<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.900> earn<00:04:05.079> if<00:04:05.709> you

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
your experience points you earn if you

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.740 
your experience points you earn if you
spend<00:04:06.190> on<00:04:06.340> like<00:04:06.700> increasing<00:04:07.150> certain<00:04:07.569> things

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750

I<00:04:07.870> don't<00:04:07.930> really<00:04:08.109> know<00:04:08.350> it<00:04:08.500> much<00:04:08.769> for<00:04:09.010> the

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
I don't really know it much for the

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.710 
I don't really know it much for the
coaches<00:04:09.459> I<00:04:09.549> know<00:04:09.609> it<00:04:09.790> for<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.000> players<00:04:10.299> like

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
coaches I know it for the players like

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.539 
coaches I know it for the players like
you<00:04:11.230> are<00:04:11.319> in<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.440> certain<00:04:11.680> amount<00:04:11.799> of<00:04:11.889> XP<00:04:12.340> and

you are in a certain amount of XP and

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.640 
you are in a certain amount of XP and
you<00:04:12.910> can<00:04:13.060> up<00:04:13.209> certain<00:04:13.660> ratings<00:04:14.230> it's<00:04:14.410> a<00:04:14.470> lot

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
you can up certain ratings it's a lot

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.590 
you can up certain ratings it's a lot
like<00:04:14.799> it<00:04:14.950> was<00:04:15.130> in<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.400> madden<00:04:15.700> superstar<00:04:16.269> last

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
like it was in the madden superstar last

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.080 
like it was in the madden superstar last
year<00:04:16.959> but<00:04:17.350> I<00:04:17.410> like<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.769> new<00:04:18.160> mechanic<00:04:18.700> for<00:04:18.970> it

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
year but I like the new mechanic for it

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.120 
year but I like the new mechanic for it
and<00:04:19.269> i<00:04:19.299> think<00:04:19.630> is<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:19.870> lot<00:04:20.109> more<00:04:20.320> options<00:04:20.620> as<00:04:21.099> far

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
and i think is a lot more options as far

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.110 
and i think is a lot more options as far
as<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.489> goes<00:04:21.640> i<00:04:21.849> just<00:04:22.060> think<00:04:22.240> in<00:04:22.390> madden

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
as it goes i just think in madden

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.640 
as it goes i just think in madden
Road<00:04:23.240> to<00:04:23.360> Glory<00:04:23.630> it<00:04:23.750> was<00:04:23.840> kind<00:04:24.080> of<00:04:24.139> easy<00:04:24.410> to

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
Road to Glory it was kind of easy to

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.590
