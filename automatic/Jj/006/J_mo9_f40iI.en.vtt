 hello youtube friends welcome a 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.840
 more and more speculations we have in a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.210
 passing a case or a liner for the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.259
 second generation altar or third 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.090
 relationship the new iPad is in July the 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.850
 rest is not only a kit for the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.490
 iPad also comes with a keyboard that 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.140
 operates through bluetooth société 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.510
 a little more function is needed 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.220
 your ipad at the level of the integrated this 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.559
 Christ is going to solve it, we are going to take it out 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.530
 the claws are going to connect you an ipad and 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.149
 let's see how about this July 15 a 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.309
 time more grace and have time 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.469
 loan them this case to be able to make 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.840
 this one zinc pack and the next video 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.210
 soon if the many videos by but 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.620
 how I like it if they are going to throw us 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.130
 subscribe let's start with this 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.720
 video 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.020
 can be the presentation in this video 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.650
 We will have the study for the experts and 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.210
 for the 3rd generation third forgiveness and it's 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.190
 a casey is not only one who made a 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.199
 forum to protect the ipad with better 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.650
 finish has a keyboard that works 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.650
 with bluetooth 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:24.370
 and the field fiber function 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:26.680
 in Libya let's see how they can put 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.200
 because I have prepared it on this side and 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.660
 keyboard is removed if they do not have it 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.210
 Well, it's going to be a little bit further from 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.700
 We can use it that way but 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.390
 we are going to 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.390
 remove them from cakes of your vegetable box 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.070
 Pianist 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.569
 publish for age 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.270
 all right 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:05.070
 USB usb usb cable to charge the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:08.069
 keyboard we also have your keyboard or 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.810
 can see keyboard quite wide 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.620
 quite 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.349
 uncomfortable what this program itself 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.159
 and up here I'll have something connect 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:23.190
 subtract your work on your committee to 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.590
 that does not slip and we're going to go back to 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.170
 that side has sunk x as they can 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.960
 see very hard carbon fiber 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.280
 and let's see 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.880
 with you here I have 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.620
 a third generation and I want to see nothing 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.620
 more like lights 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.440
 placed 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.900
 above 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.640
 all right 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.220
 tight but say there is no 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.220
 a lot of movement and 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.310
 two 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.489
 which closed as you can see above 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.140
 couple connectors of the hearing aids for 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.870
 learn to turn off your camera 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.450
 installed has the cut to give it 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.480
 volume and to go up for a couple that pays 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.330
 down has its costs for the horn and 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:34.780
 of the cost to connect them to load it 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.780
 and opening it comes out of nike 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.540
 on this side I would like to use the keyboard 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.370
 It is not like this 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.370
 Y 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.610
 unless it's a way to ignore power 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.770
 stop the ipad with this 6 but of all 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.290
 modes in this is was more has been 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.330
 the compact zinc of the sector you kiss for 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.890

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.960
 generation let's have a river and 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.730
 complete this case for no more than 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.800
 sin more than the function how it works 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.500

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.070
