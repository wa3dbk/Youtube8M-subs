00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.099
 truly 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.409
 North America coming out 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.409
 I thought it might be good but 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.740
 Musically 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.870
 I want the continuation of the country 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.710
 bolt 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.390
 Masako Kono of his own 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.470
 Expected to die 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.470
 A term 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.810
 Announced as a member 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.300
 Hey you 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.470
 Hey you 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.450
 What 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.990
 Since 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.610
 It is said that it is wrong 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.410
 Really better opportunity 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.410
 To rest support 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.560
 ap 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.560
 And yes 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.830
 on the other hand 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.750
 16th 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.750
 We adopt room and roof 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.080
 End 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.080
 Akikawa was 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820
 First 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.480
 I do not regret 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.200
 Director Kim 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.969
 Why do things like this even in the first armed forces Visual and auditory fill well 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.540
 There are places that I do not understand 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.350
 To the station, it has changed with 5 days 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.619
 Also at this timing he got sad but got sad 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.869
 That's the kind of pop-tuned lyrics 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.869
 I thought it would be nice if I could do it last time 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.999
 Also for them 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.269
 There is also a place where she is doing this 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.509
 That minute 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:32.129
 Tanaka, though 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.639
 It somehow becomes the lyrics of the song and the lyrics 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.599
 Because it is about golf 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.309
 It seems to me on that 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:40.660
 That kind of thing 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.210
 It is important to have the upper grip on you 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.749
 I'm offering this song to quite a few people now 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.300
 I had an offer to ask the clerk this time 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.569
 For me it was out there that I was 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.869
 I will 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:02.799
 10th anniversary 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:03.739
 Yeah 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.980
 I will think about the coming life that will come again 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.079
 Even in the market 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.859
 Transportation 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.019
 Aiming for adults to be performed later in a good sense 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.720
 I will do my best to sing
