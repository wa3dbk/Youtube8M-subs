same<00:00:51.360> process<00:00:51.780> till<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.290> is<00:00:52.410> happening

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
same process till this is happening

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.430 
same process till this is happening
let's<00:00:53.160> get<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> some<00:00:53.640> chopping<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:57.290> don't<00:00:58.290> want

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
let's get to some chopping I don't want

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.899 
let's get to some chopping I don't want
the<00:00:58.530> seeds<00:00:58.830> or<00:00:59.070> tomatoes<00:00:59.460> because<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> don't

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
the seeds or tomatoes because I don't

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.430 
the seeds or tomatoes because I don't
want<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.089> make<00:01:00.150> it<00:01:00.300> messy<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.780> I'm<00:01:01.230> gonna

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
want to make it messy so I'm gonna

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.260 
want to make it messy so I'm gonna
remove<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.890> seeds

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.450 

so<00:01:08.750> this<00:01:08.960> is<00:01:09.200> actually<00:01:09.620> called<00:01:09.830> as<00:01:09.950> roasting

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
so this is actually called as roasting

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.160 
so this is actually called as roasting
of<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.670> Bengal<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:11.150> in<00:01:11.540> this<00:01:11.720> process<00:01:12.140> you

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
of the Bengal and in this process you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.370 
of the Bengal and in this process you
need<00:01:12.410> to<00:01:12.530> keep<00:01:12.920> swirling<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.180> after<00:01:14.990> every<00:01:15.230> two

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
need to keep swirling it after every two

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.350 
need to keep swirling it after every two
to<00:01:15.500> three<00:01:15.530> minutes<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.370> that<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:16.610> Bengal<00:01:17.030> the

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
to three minutes so that the Bengal the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.840 
to three minutes so that the Bengal the
aubergine<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.290> eggplant<00:01:18.740> cooks<00:01:19.280> right

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
aubergine the eggplant cooks right

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.520 
aubergine the eggplant cooks right
across<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.930> whole<00:01:21.080> sphere<00:01:21.530> of<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:22.130> fruit<00:01:23.530> all

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
across the whole sphere of the fruit all

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.250 
across the whole sphere of the fruit all
right<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.210> you<00:01:26.210> can<00:01:26.390> see<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.960> aubergine

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
right so you can see that the aubergine

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
right so you can see that the aubergine
is<00:01:27.590> nicely<00:01:28.580> done<00:01:28.850> it's<00:01:29.150> charred<00:01:29.960> it's<00:01:30.320> it's

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
is nicely done it's charred it's it's

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.050 
is nicely done it's charred it's it's
now<00:01:31.550> soft<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:32.810> is<00:01:33.080> ready<00:01:33.890> for<00:01:34.550> Ben<00:01:34.729> inverter

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
now soft this is ready for Ben inverter

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.789 
now soft this is ready for Ben inverter
and<00:01:35.510> also<00:01:36.020> below

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.620 

so<00:01:43.280> once<00:01:43.430> you've<00:01:43.549> filled<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.150> aubergine<00:01:44.390> you

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
so once you've filled the aubergine you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.120 
so once you've filled the aubergine you
need<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.869> cut<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.229> top<00:01:45.440> off<00:01:45.619> because<00:01:45.830> that's

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
need to cut the top off because that's

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.170 
need to cut the top off because that's
not<00:01:46.310> what<00:01:46.940> we<00:01:46.970> really<00:01:47.240> need<00:01:47.479> no<00:01:48.470> seeds<00:01:48.799> no<00:01:49.180> skin

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
not what we really need no seeds no skin

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.480 
not what we really need no seeds no skin
only<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:51.170> pulp<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.800> simple<00:01:52.250> trick<00:01:52.460> to

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
only the pulp so a simple trick to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.420 
only the pulp so a simple trick to
remove<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.970> seeds<00:01:53.270> is<00:01:53.540> just<00:01:54.050> lightly<00:01:54.770> slit<00:01:55.340> it

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
remove the seeds is just lightly slit it

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.510 
remove the seeds is just lightly slit it
up<00:01:55.550> and<00:01:55.790> open<00:01:56.210> this<00:01:56.330> so<00:01:56.960> we're<00:01:57.320> gonna<00:01:57.409> get<00:01:58.100> rid

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
up and open this so we're gonna get rid

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.320 
up and open this so we're gonna get rid
of<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.729> seeds<00:02:03.369> all<00:02:04.369> right<00:02:04.490> so<00:02:04.640> once<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:04.970> seeds

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
of the seeds all right so once the seeds

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.300 
of the seeds all right so once the seeds
are<00:02:05.509> off<00:02:05.720> I'm<00:02:06.110> sure<00:02:06.350> you<00:02:06.680> can't<00:02:06.920> get<00:02:07.070> rid<00:02:07.220> of

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
are off I'm sure you can't get rid of

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.550 
are off I'm sure you can't get rid of
them<00:02:07.460> completely<00:02:07.640> because<00:02:08.300> they're<00:02:08.450> kind<00:02:09.440> of

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
them completely because they're kind of

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.309 
them completely because they're kind of
intertwined<00:02:10.100> but<00:02:10.610> get<00:02:10.819> rid<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:11.030> as<00:02:11.239> many<00:02:11.959> seeds

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
intertwined but get rid of as many seeds

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.740 
intertwined but get rid of as many seeds
as<00:02:12.500> possible<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.190> aubergine<00:02:13.790> or<00:02:14.239> skip<00:02:14.660> a

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
as possible of the aubergine or skip a

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.400 
as possible of the aubergine or skip a
scattering<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.320> down<00:02:16.090> chop<00:02:17.090> chop<00:02:17.420> chop<00:02:17.660> chop

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
scattering of a down chop chop chop chop

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.750 
scattering of a down chop chop chop chop
chop<00:02:18.440> chop<00:02:19.190> chop<00:02:19.670> chop

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.000 

so<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.880> reason<00:02:23.150> I'm<00:02:23.269> doing<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:24.320> don't

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
so the reason I'm doing this is I don't

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.479 
so the reason I'm doing this is I don't
want<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.430> complete<00:02:25.820> mash<00:02:26.650> musici<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.769> for<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.310> set
