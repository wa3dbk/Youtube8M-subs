think<00:02:02.230> individual<00:02:02.860> is<00:02:03.100> it's<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.490> sparse<00:02:03.820> parcel

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
think individual is it's a sparse parcel

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.940 
think individual is it's a sparse parcel
of<00:02:04.330> it<00:02:04.480> you<00:02:04.660> know<00:02:04.810> it's<00:02:05.140> just<00:02:05.200> what<00:02:05.530> skill<00:02:05.860> is

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
of it you know it's just what skill is

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.980 
of it you know it's just what skill is
what<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.220> can<00:02:06.370> do<00:02:06.460> as<00:02:07.000> an<00:02:07.120> individual<00:02:07.570> but

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
what you can do as an individual but

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.600 
what you can do as an individual but
then<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.200> know<00:02:08.320> put<00:02:08.680> me<00:02:08.800> out<00:02:08.890> there<00:02:09.070> with<00:02:09.190> a

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
then you know put me out there with a

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.430 
then you know put me out there with a
good<00:02:09.760> group<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.000> guys<00:02:10.149> who<00:02:10.480> want<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.899> win<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.380> I

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
good group of guys who want to win and I

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.530 
good group of guys who want to win and I
think<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:11.770> could<00:02:11.920> show<00:02:12.070> more<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.940> know<00:02:13.060> than

think I could show more you know than

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.120 
think I could show more you know than
just<00:02:13.840> my<00:02:13.990> individual<00:02:14.440> talent<00:02:14.770> no<00:02:14.980> I'm<00:02:15.040> just

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
just my individual talent no I'm just

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.470 
just my individual talent no I'm just
I'm<00:02:15.340> not<00:02:15.400> just<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.790> scorer<00:02:16.060> you're<00:02:16.240> not<00:02:16.360> going

I'm not just a scorer you're not going

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.210 
I'm not just a scorer you're not going
to<00:02:16.540> pass<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.840> ball<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.680> think<00:02:17.890> those<00:02:18.010> last

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
to pass the ball and I think those last

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.320 
to pass the ball and I think those last
three<00:02:18.370> years<00:02:18.550> at<00:02:18.640> Arizona<00:02:18.940> State<00:02:19.000> really

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
straw he this past year he added a

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.570 
straw he this past year he added a
mid-range<00:04:39.170> jumper<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:40.190> know<00:04:40.310> so<00:04:40.460> he's

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
mid-range jumper you know so he's

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.080

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.790 

right<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.120> think<00:04:47.390> scoring<00:04:48.290> by<00:04:48.680> passing<00:04:49.220> defense

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
right I think scoring by passing defense

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.050 
right I think scoring by passing defense
maybe<00:04:51.800> maybe<00:04:52.010> help<00:04:52.370> them<00:04:52.460> do<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:52.610> up<00:04:52.820> to<00:04:52.910> one

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060
