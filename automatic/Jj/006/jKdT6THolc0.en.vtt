00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.570 
why Caterina's early game is actually
not<00:05:44.330> that<00:05:44.360> good<00:05:44.720> because<00:05:45.590> Katarina<00:05:46.310> is<00:05:46.550> a

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
not that good because Katarina is a

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.600 
not that good because Katarina is a
reset<00:05:47.180> champion<00:05:47.659> Riot<00:05:48.349> has<00:05:48.650> made<00:05:48.889> her<00:05:49.099> basic

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
reset champion Riot has made her basic

abilities marginally shittier than other

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.310 
abilities marginally shittier than other
mid<00:05:52.370> laners<00:05:52.759> so<00:05:53.539> if<00:05:53.810> you're<00:05:53.960> playing<00:05:54.139> an

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
mid laners so if you're playing an

for the full duration of the ultimate
you<00:05:59.330> can<00:05:59.509> probably<00:05:59.810> 1v1<00:06:00.409> or<00:06:00.710> if<00:06:00.860> you're

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
you can probably 1v1 or if you're

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.820 
you can probably 1v1 or if you're
