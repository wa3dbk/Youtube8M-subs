00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
bit of a gradient going on with your
cape<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.450> guys<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.750> definitely<00:01:49.079> recommend

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
reset that to the volt to go back to the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.639 
reset that to the volt to go back to the
standard<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> button<00:02:01.380> next<00:02:01.500> to

this<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.810> will<00:02:06.960> remove<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.380> by<00:02:07.530> five<00:02:07.770> again

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
this this will remove it by five again

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.430 
this this will remove it by five again
like<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> other<00:02:09.239> value<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.020> I'll<00:02:10.259> just

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
like the other value and I'll just

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.920 
like the other value and I'll just
change<00:02:10.709> down<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.400> actual<00:02:12.180> saturation<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
change down the actual saturation of the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.970 
change down the actual saturation of the
color<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.650> don't<00:02:13.830> give

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
color so don't give

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.619 
color so don't give
a bit<00:02:14.250> more<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.640> gradient<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.450> sort

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
a bit more of a gradient and that sort

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:16.970 
a bit more of a gradient and that sort
of<00:02:15.659> thing<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:15.870> guys<00:02:16.200> these<00:02:16.349> tools<00:02:16.620> down<00:02:16.830> here

this sort of works so guys for

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.869 
this sort of works so guys for
complementary<00:02:56.160> colors<00:02:56.430> these<00:02:56.549> are<00:02:56.609> on<00:02:56.790> the

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
complementary colors these are on the

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.280 
complementary colors these are on the
opposite<00:02:57.269> sides<00:02:57.329> of<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.690> color<00:02:57.930> wheel<00:02:58.109> and

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
opposite sides of the color wheel and

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.500 
opposite sides of the color wheel and
they<00:02:58.650> do<00:02:58.709> give<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.160> offer<00:02:59.430> they<00:03:00.150> offer<00:03:00.329> you

maximum contrast sorry and two main

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.059 
maximum contrast sorry and two main
shades<00:03:02.970> with<00:03:03.209> two<00:03:03.420> accents<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.500> goes<00:03:04.680> on<00:03:04.920> to

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
shades with two accents that goes on to

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.890 
shades with two accents that goes on to
analogous<00:03:05.640> or<00:03:05.879> colors<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.569> are<00:03:06.660> sort<00:03:06.810> of

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
analogous or colors that are sort of

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.479 
analogous or colors that are sort of
exactly<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.560> same<00:03:07.769> on<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.040> color<00:03:08.190> wheel<00:03:08.250> as

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
exactly the same on the color wheel as

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.099 
exactly the same on the color wheel as
you<00:03:08.640> can<00:03:08.730> see<00:03:08.819> right<00:03:09.000> there<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.420> yellow<00:03:09.750> green

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
you can see right there so yellow green

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.349 
you can see right there so yellow green
and<00:03:10.319> dark<00:03:10.560> green<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.519> one<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.030> these<00:03:12.150> color

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
and dark green the one of these color

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.819 
and dark green the one of these color
usually<00:03:12.840> dominates<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.440> there's<00:03:13.620> usually

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
usually dominates and there's usually

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.770 
usually dominates and there's usually
three<00:03:14.069> colors<00:03:14.670> group<00:03:14.940> together<00:03:15.269> side<00:03:15.540> by<00:03:15.569> side

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
three colors group together side by side

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.099 
three colors group together side by side
on<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.440> color<00:03:16.680> wheel<00:03:16.769> now<00:03:17.640> guys<00:03:17.879> as<00:03:18.120> for<00:03:18.930> hue

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
on the color wheel now guys as for hue

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.159 
on the color wheel now guys as for hue
and<00:03:19.230> saturation<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:20.010> luminosity<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:21.690> hue<00:03:21.930> is

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
and saturation and luminosity the hue is

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.720 
and saturation and luminosity the hue is
what<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.470> color<00:03:22.650> actually<00:03:22.889> is<00:03:23.280> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
what the color actually is the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.849 
what the color actually is the
saturation<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.450> how<00:03:24.660> intense<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.500> color<00:03:25.530> is

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
saturation is how intense the color is

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.099 
saturation is how intense the color is
or<00:03:26.010> how<00:03:26.130> dense<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:27.120> luminosity<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.900> how

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
or how dense and the luminosity is how

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.690 
or how dense and the luminosity is how
bright<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.560> color<00:03:28.769> is<00:03:28.919> so<00:03:29.099> sometimes<00:03:29.519> is

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
bright the color is so sometimes is

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.309 
bright the color is so sometimes is
called<00:03:29.849> brightness<00:03:30.329> but<00:03:30.569> that's<00:03:30.810> exactly

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
called brightness but that's exactly

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.930 
called brightness but that's exactly
what<00:03:31.440> it's<00:03:31.560> called<00:03:31.620> on<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:31.950> guide<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:32.910> a

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
what it's called on the guide this is a

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.979 
what it's called on the guide this is a
little<00:03:33.180> bit<00:03:33.269> easier<00:03:33.540> for<00:03:33.569> people<00:03:33.810> to

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
little bit easier for people to

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.080 
little bit easier for people to
understand<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.069> guys<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:35.880> pretty

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
understand so guys so that is pretty

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.909 
understand so guys so that is pretty
much<00:03:36.239> what<00:03:36.419> the<00:03:36.540> color<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:37.019> how<00:03:37.440> intense<00:03:37.650> that

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
much what the color is how intense that

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.800 
much what the color is how intense that
color<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.609> how<00:03:38.700> bright<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.060> color<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:39.660> as

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
color is and how bright that color is as

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.530 
color is and how bright that color is as
well<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:41.340> guys<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.730> show<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:41.970> these<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.269> effect

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
well so guys to show you these in effect

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.670 
well so guys to show you these in effect
I'll<00:03:42.720> just<00:03:42.840> click<00:03:43.049> onto<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.380> color<00:03:43.530> wheel

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
I'll just click onto the color wheel

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.750 
I'll just click onto the color wheel
right<00:03:43.859> there<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.160> as<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.370> can<00:03:44.459> see<00:03:44.609> right

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
right there and as you can see right

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.089 
right there and as you can see right
here<00:03:44.819> we<00:03:45.419> do<00:03:45.540> have<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.810> hue<00:03:46.079> right<00:03:46.650> here<00:03:46.919> and

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
here we do have the hue right here and

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.589 
here we do have the hue right here and
you<00:03:47.160> can<00:03:47.310> move<00:03:47.430> this<00:03:47.549> up<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.880> down<00:03:48.000> as<00:03:48.299> you<00:03:48.359> can

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
you can move this up and down as you can

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.569 
you can move this up and down as you can
see<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.870> color<00:03:49.109> wheel<00:03:49.169> does<00:03:49.620> change<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.489> can

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
see the color wheel does change you can

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.949 
see the color wheel does change you can
change<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:50.940> color<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.329> whatever<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.690> want

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
change the color to whatever you want

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.930 
change the color to whatever you want
and<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:52.380> does<00:03:52.739> change<00:03:53.069> your<00:03:53.220> color<00:03:53.430> value<00:03:53.760> on

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
and this does change your color value on

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.449 
and this does change your color value on
the<00:03:54.269> actual<00:03:54.569> picker<00:03:54.810> now<00:03:55.530> guys<00:03:55.739> if<00:03:56.069> you<00:03:56.280> see

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
the actual picker now guys if you see

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.159 
the actual picker now guys if you see
you<00:03:56.669> can<00:03:56.819> move<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.239> up<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:57.599> it<00:03:57.720> does<00:03:57.900> change

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
you can move this up and it does change

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.170 
you can move this up and it does change
that<00:03:58.349> hue<00:03:58.560> as<00:03:58.709> well<00:03:58.919> so<00:03:59.430> for<00:03:59.669> saturation<00:04:00.030> you

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
that hue as well so for saturation you

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.369 
that hue as well so for saturation you
move<00:04:00.419> it<00:04:00.510> up<00:04:00.599> and<00:04:00.720> down<00:04:00.750> as<00:04:00.959> well<00:04:01.079> but<00:04:01.290> this

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
move it up and down as well but this

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.170 
move it up and down as well but this
moves<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.980> little<00:04:02.099> toggle<00:04:02.609> on<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.940> color

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
moves the little toggle on the color

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.020 
moves the little toggle on the color
wheel<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:03.720> side<00:04:03.959> so<00:04:04.230> this<00:04:04.349> is<00:04:04.410> exactly<00:04:05.400> how

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
wheel to the side so this is exactly how

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.180 
wheel to the side so this is exactly how
much<00:04:06.239> what's<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.109> call<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.410> saturation<00:04:08.010> is

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
much what's the call the saturation is

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.580 
much what's the call the saturation is
in<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.489> actual<00:04:08.669> color<00:04:09.569> now<00:04:09.989> moving<00:04:10.290> down<00:04:10.440> to

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
in the actual color now moving down to

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.539 
in the actual color now moving down to
the<00:04:10.650> brightness<00:04:11.040> this<00:04:11.220> change<00:04:11.459> is

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
the brightness this change is

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.670 
the brightness this change is
up-and-down<00:04:11.970> vertical<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.410> doesn't

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
up-and-down vertical so it doesn't

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.199 
up-and-down vertical so it doesn't
change<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:14.099> actual<00:04:14.430> brightness<00:04:14.699> of<00:04:15.120> each

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
change the actual brightness of each

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.870 
change the actual brightness of each
color<00:04:15.569> you'll<00:04:16.049> want<00:04:16.229> to<00:04:16.289> be<00:04:16.380> picking<00:04:16.590> now<00:04:17.340> onto

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
color you'll want to be picking now onto
