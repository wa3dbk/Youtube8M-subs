 It is this time we will do snow year 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.670
 As Sugii Re is easy to understand 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.170
 Since there was a gunpla saved, I will introduce 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.970
 It is- 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.970
 Sword Strike Gundam is nice 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.370
 Yes

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.530
 Still nothing 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.530
 Not painted 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.590
 It is the head of the trike 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.920

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.560
 tissue 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.430
 Because it is a cotton swab f 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.640
 You can take a shot, so it's okay if you see it a bit 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.640
 Yes 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.530
 Wintering 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.450
 Explained earlier 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.760
 It is what say the mold is to Gunpla 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.570
 Izumidake

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.970
 Please do it in the image to push down the timelessness as much as possible 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.620
 Yes 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.180

 The husband and wife 9 e 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.350

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.890
 Give to feed the 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.120
 Wipe off from here 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.980
 Beautiful 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.620
 Hey 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:35.569
 The following video this 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:39.370
 Basically, a fine place is a cotton swab does not reach and of that room tissue 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.370
 Make good use of rolled tissue and so on 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.140
 Yes 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.140
 Recovery 1 is here 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.020
 All had come to clean 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.240
 There is mold parts 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.240
 I think you can see if it is floating 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.710
 go in 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.430
 It is this time 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.600
 I'm sorry 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.290
 By any means 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.470
 To Frey 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.670
 It is hard to enter a professional course 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.340
 Also I think there is mold 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.790
 About here 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.280
 I used it last time 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.440
 La Milo Lou 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.050
 is not it 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.520
 Petit, etc., to in 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.120
 Part of the wire mold in front 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:34.110
 Dig in 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:36.560
 Dark black is stained when we put brush of inking in there in the second round 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.220
 More than anything 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.280
 That cool 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:48.550
 I think it will finish, so please try it 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:52.130
 In is I turn here next time 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:55.900
 Marker one 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.900
 I hope to introduce you 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.940
 goo 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.840
 me 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.430
 me 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.830
 5 minutes 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.160
 No, only now 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.670
 Because I have a meal 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.860
 It is a strike of the state of the composition 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:17.380
 Just put it in and change how much it changes 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.380
 I think that I want to carry out 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:33.240
 Yes , it's the result of inking quickly but it looks like this 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.350
 It is a strike 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.650
 If you look drunkenly 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.240
 The difference is 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.280
 Enough to make a sound 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.630
 I think it is a thing 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:52.860
 Well Kedomo it's nothing to do with that I think a little in the corner like a little more only accompanied by a color 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:56.600
 Strike colored with only Gundam markers 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.110
 I want to make a little 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.630
 It is good to enter 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.380
 I made it quickly 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.380
 It is a wallet 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:12.180
 Because anyone with broken lapi can 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.630
 Please try by all means try 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.630
 There was you
