tape<00:00:42.480> would<00:00:42.809> work<00:00:43.079> unless<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.950> cut<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.219> into

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
tape would work unless you cut it into

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.420 
tape would work unless you cut it into
with<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.660> now<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.530> use<00:00:46.710> clear<00:00:47.070> see
