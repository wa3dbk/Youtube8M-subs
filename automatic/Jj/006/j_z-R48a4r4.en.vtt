regular and so on and so on I really

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.880 
regular and so on and so on I really
feel<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.600> push<00:01:03.809> sled<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.140> probably<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
feel that the push sled is probably the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.440 
feel that the push sled is probably the
single<00:01:05.400> most<00:01:05.430> effective<00:01:05.760> strength<00:01:06.299> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
single most effective strength and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.990 
single most effective strength and
conditioning<00:01:06.810> tool<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.530> exists<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.939> know

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
conditioning tool that exists and I know

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.420 
conditioning tool that exists and I know
that<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.390> quite<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.840> quite<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> big<00:01:10.860> claim<00:01:11.189> but

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
that is quite a quite a big claim but

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
that is quite a quite a big claim but
honestly<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.270> think<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.960> will<00:01:13.080> find<00:01:13.380> that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
honestly I think you will find that

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.100 
honestly I think you will find that
again<00:01:14.189> some<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.490> those<00:01:14.729> people<00:01:15.420> named<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
again some of those people named and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.080 
again some of those people named and
people<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.619> used<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.009> big<00:01:17.640> push<00:01:17.850> sleds

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
people that have used the big push sleds

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.030 
people that have used the big push sleds
extensively<00:01:18.689> generally<00:01:19.470> seem<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> come<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
extensively generally seem to come to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.240 
extensively generally seem to come to
the<00:01:20.130> same<00:01:20.280> conclusion<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.860> if<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.979> don't

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the same conclusion so a if you don't

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.160 
the same conclusion so a if you don't
have<00:01:23.460> access<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> push<00:01:24.330> sled<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.960> one

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that it has one but honestly I do not

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.190 
that it has one but honestly I do not

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
think there is a better use of time bang

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.109 
think there is a better use of time bang

push list because I will tell you the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.080 
push list because I will tell you the

thinner metal and stuff I've seen them

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.880 
thinner metal and stuff I've seen them
fall<00:02:02.340> apart<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:03.240> may<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.509> fine<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:03.990> light

conditioning<00:02:05.460> work<00:02:05.640> but<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.000> tell<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.329> when

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
conditioning work but I tell you when

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.459 
conditioning work but I tell you when
you<00:02:06.450> weigh<00:02:06.600> put<00:02:06.750> some<00:02:06.899> weight<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.079> them<00:02:07.350> and

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
you weigh put some weight on them and

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.990 
you weigh put some weight on them and
you<00:02:07.829> get<00:02:07.979> some<00:02:08.099> strong<00:02:08.340> people<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.729> have

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
you get some strong people I have

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.339 
you get some strong people I have
personally<00:02:09.479> seen<00:02:09.509> them<00:02:09.750> literally<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.200> fall

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
personally seen them literally just fall

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.770 
personally seen them literally just fall
apart<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.739> seams<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.390> definitely

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
apart of the seams so it is definitely

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.730 
apart of the seams so it is definitely
one<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:12.930> those<00:02:13.140> get<00:02:13.319> what<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.530> pay

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
one of those get what you pay

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.160 
one of those get what you pay
for<00:02:14.630> situations<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.620> what<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.130> have<00:02:17.490> done<00:02:18.170> has

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
for situations so what I have done has

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
for situations so what I have done has
put<00:02:19.440> together<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:21.170> cohesive<00:02:22.170> program<00:02:22.920> that

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
put together a cohesive program that

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.640 
put together a cohesive program that

incorporates the push led into a total
body<00:02:25.830> program<00:02:26.570> probably<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.690> two<00:02:27.870> mistakes

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
body program probably the two mistakes

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.820 
body program probably the two mistakes
that<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.620> see<00:02:28.710> people<00:02:29.220> make<00:02:29.970> with<00:02:30.180> sleds<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.830> a

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
that I see people make with sleds is a

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.130 
that I see people make with sleds is a
they<00:02:32.670> use<00:02:32.880> them<00:02:33.120> mostly<00:02:33.450> for<00:02:33.600> conditioning

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
they use them mostly for conditioning

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.110 
they use them mostly for conditioning
that<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.710> fairly<00:02:35.310> lightweight<00:02:35.580> for

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
that is a a fairly lightweight for

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.600 
that is a a fairly lightweight for
higher<00:02:36.270> speeds<00:02:36.660> they<00:02:37.260> rarely<00:02:37.650> really<00:02:38.160> pile<00:02:38.370> up

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
higher speeds they rarely really pile up

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.980 
higher speeds they rarely really pile up
the<00:02:38.640> weight<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.270> think<00:02:39.480> that's<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.870> mistake

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
the weight and I think that's a mistake

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.410 
the weight and I think that's a mistake
and<00:02:40.440> two<00:02:41.100> they<00:02:41.460> tend<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.730> be<00:02:41.880> used<00:02:42.090> sort<00:02:42.330> of

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
and two they tend to be used sort of

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.870 
and two they tend to be used sort of
peripherally<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.740> program<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.460> you

peripherally to the program that is you

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
know people will kind of throw in a few

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.440 
know people will kind of throw in a few
sets<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.590> push<00:02:46.770> sled<00:02:47.010> here<00:02:47.250> or<00:02:47.460> there<00:02:47.970> but

sets of push sled here or there but

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.060 
sets of push sled here or there but
they're<00:02:48.600> not<00:02:48.720> really<00:02:48.990> part<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.470> cohesive
