00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.960
Hello everyone, I'm live from the DreamHack Valencia in Spain.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.350
We arrived by plane yesterday (Friday) morning at 10 AM.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.750
We took our computer with us to train ourselves,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.850
so we trained all day long yesterday.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:51.450
We refined every details and revised our gameplay for every team.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.070
We just ended the first game versus DN-Gaming on dust2

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.170
we won 16-0 everything went fine even though we should have lost some rounds

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.070
we made some nice clucthes and nice round endings.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.870
It makes us confident for the next 2 groupstages matches,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:20.680
we're going to face k1ck-eSports on mirage and ASES on nuke

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.970
both are good teams, they can disturb us.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.470
We know we can do well, but we don't know if they can

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.770
we didn't played them that much

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.680
we know these games can be close so we're going to be careful.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.170
As you can see this is where we play.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.790
This is on these 5 computers and the 5 others on the other side

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.390
that we're going to play our groupstages matches.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.300
We're in an area like we were in ESWC, it's really well presented.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:56.500
Computers are average, FPS are not that great and it's 75Hz

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.490
but it's still playable and strats are going to pay the most.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.590
For people wondering, our preparation is really short

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.810
we had to end our events on Source so we had around 3 weeks.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.510
We had players recently going back to studies last weeks

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.510
so our preparation is not great but we have good tactics,

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.910
we know how to disturb people and have some surprises

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.620
for best teams like NiP. We're confident, we did our best

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.330
we have nothing to lose since we're here as outsiders

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.430
we have the rage and we want to win, we'll see how it ends.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.563
Stay tuned to follow the rest of the tournament. See you soon.
