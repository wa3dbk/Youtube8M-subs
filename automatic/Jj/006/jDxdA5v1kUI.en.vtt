your HTC One S is a Snapdragon as we are
as<00:00:26.910> far<00:00:27.119> because<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:29.150> on<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.390> HTC<00:00:31.050> as

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
as far because we have on that HTC as

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
your HTC One as few weeks ago it must be

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.090 
your HTC One as few weeks ago it must be
a<00:00:54.739> s4<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.420> are<00:00:57.570> about<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.409> just<00:00:58.710> two

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
a s4 but if you are about it just two

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.380 
a s4 but if you are about it just two
days<00:00:59.250> ago<00:00:59.460> it<00:01:00.120> could<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.659> an<00:01:01.049> as<00:01:01.440> s<00:01:02.159> free<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.089> all

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
days ago it could be an as s free so all

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.359 
days ago it could be an as s free so all
to<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.409> can't<00:01:04.710> really<00:01:04.949> know<00:01:05.100> if

to know that you can't really know if
this<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.840> free<00:01:07.110> or<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.530> far<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.190> you<00:01:08.400> can

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
this is as free or as far but you can

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.810 
this is as free or as far but you can
estimate<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.560> download<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.400> of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
estimate it you have to download one of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.440 
estimate it you have to download one of
these<00:01:12.090> two<00:01:12.330> applications<00:01:13.340> CPUs<00:01:14.340> by<00:01:14.729> our<00:01:15.000> quick

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
these two applications CPUs by our quick

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.800 
these two applications CPUs by our quick
system<00:01:15.780> info<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.490> launch<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.850> when

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
system info you have to launch it when

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.289 
system info you have to launch it when
you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.380> know<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:20.400> cheese<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:21.060> time

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
you can know what cheese with time

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.470 
you can know what cheese with time
instead<00:01:21.660> for<00:01:21.990> from<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.470> CPU<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:24.360> is

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
instead for from your CPU if there is

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.570 
instead for from your CPU if there is
about<00:01:24.860> 1.5<00:01:26.480> Google<00:01:27.480> it<00:01:27.990> must<00:01:28.410> be<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:29.070> far<00:01:29.370> if

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
about 1.5 Google it must be as far if

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.670 
about 1.5 Google it must be as far if
it's<00:01:30.150> about<00:01:30.710> 1.7<00:01:31.710> Giga<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.820> must<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:33.360> as<00:01:34.230> free

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
it's about 1.7 Giga it must be as free

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.340 
it's about 1.7 Giga it must be as free
so<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.550> have<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.820> test<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.390> CPU<00:01:36.840> spy<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
so you have to test it with CPU spy and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.760 
so you have to test it with CPU spy and
you<00:01:37.830> have<00:01:37.950> confirmation<00:01:38.490> with<00:01:39.330> this<00:01:39.510> one<00:01:39.770> here

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
you have confirmation with this one here

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.280 
you have confirmation with this one here
you<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.160> go<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> processor<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:43.080> can

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
you have to go to processor and you can

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.090 
you have to go to processor and you can
see<00:01:43.730> current<00:01:44.730> frequency<00:01:44.940> CPU<00:01:45.750> screen<00:01:46.260> okay

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
see current frequency CPU screen okay

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.970 
see current frequency CPU screen okay
here<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.380> 1.5<00:01:49.380> Giga<00:01:49.980> so<00:01:50.720> it<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.680> far

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
here you have 1.5 Giga so it is as far

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.860 
here you have 1.5 Giga so it is as far
if<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.940> you<00:01:54.150> as<00:01:54.930> freedom<00:01:55.440> could<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:56.040> here

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
if one of you as freedom could see here

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.200 
if one of you as freedom could see here
1.7<00:01:57.870> I<00:01:58.440> just<00:01:59.220> want<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.490> picture<00:01:59.670> if<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.090> can
