00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.669
 hello and welcome is another video to learn to draw in the course given that 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:16.659
 the 30 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:20.019
 and this time we will see how to change the color modes 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.869
 in 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.079
 I know that our archives and is that market or regime 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.960
 in that case since it creates a file in rg by I put some color boxes I want 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.840
 pay attention to this 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.280
 these one hundred 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.520
 three colors because colors are the regime red green and blue 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.810
 the colors 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.810
 and here there is a black color proper to the regime 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.090
 at the bottom here we have 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.300
 the sharia color manent to 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.720
 for this one 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.270
 yellow 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.420
 but these with their respective percent percent colors 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.870
 for example here we have the sae aromos to put in tension percent 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.740
 it would 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.969
 our color in 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.980
 little seeds 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.650
 we see that there is not much change 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.200
 and this is because basically 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.430
 the rcv colors on their common screens 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.830
 because they can hardly produce them 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.870
 true colors ensemble snail in which the colors in little seed 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.310
 are the pigment colors and we will use them whenever we want to do 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.570
 impressions 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.170
 what percent 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.720
 eat well I know they create 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.210
 we create documents that will come out under pressure 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.690
 in this case for example it can be put in January to create him 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.600
 absolute black 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.380
 so to speak 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.759
 but if you notice 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.290
 here there is talgo 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.720
 that there is a change in pitch or a change in maximum value 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.859
 that is the one of the special region 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.690
 black seeds 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.429
 they will find something funny 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.360
 in question of what 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.520
 the colors in which they are going to look a little more opaque 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.530
 then yes and from my own experience and I recommend them 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.950
 that you are going to create a document for printing 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.680
 It is acquired by contact in the post 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.190
 a cover 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.620
 this comfort and eto'o tarjetería et cetera 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.479
 medical laarense 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.089
 Juan works 72 of pellizotti after also his resolution to 300 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.019
 in everything she knows that there will not be much problem 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.309
 Now I want us to pay attention 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:24.669
 in this case we said that our document is in rgb the fashion color 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.709
 and we just have to go at least fail 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.239
 file promotion 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.370
 and in álava for the inferior and we find apart from this here you what 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.760
 eat eto'o where we will see for example the properties of our file as 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.759
 the sizes 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:40.019
 we will find percent the color 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.079
 demo the color mode of the document from that place is also medica 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.159
 and look specifically at the rgb colors that we have on top of 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.159
 pictures of red green and blue 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.359
 see what happened 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.049
 okay I hope that what 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.579
 I'm going to do it again 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.579
 once again 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.469
 without citing America, they did not cause as much difference as the arrests of 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.419
 the rcd became too pacos 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.619
 and that's because you have 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:10.589
 I commented 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.589
 what for the screens is very difficult 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:16.859
 actually interpreting the umbilical cords 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.229
 they do it as close as possible and it's a problem then that's why we're going to 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:22.139
 work with 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.509
 also as spam you take that the paltones unlike many 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:29.799
 they think it's a color or not pantone or a brand as a company rather than 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.309
 has its registered trademark 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:35.229
 and that created a selection of colors ie the plastic 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.990
 in numbers 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.759
 percent are adequate let's say that the 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.829
 It is not an international standard and standard 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.520
 the one most commonly used in Vienna 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.789
 easier to use 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:51.569
 if you wonder why they cost so much programs for example as for 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.920
 true to the ball sector or perseo 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.699
 it's because they include the pantone licenses 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.049
 and that is why 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.959
 they increase their value 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.620
 of this part that the sun Thursday is very hurtful are 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.359
 adobe your programs 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.249
 and quite stable 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:10.099
 quite powerful 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.819
 to greg that price and that's why we have sometimes it's hard to get 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:18.359
 good programs still low cost in this case I am using the version 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.599
 devaluation 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.719
 if we go back to 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:24.719
 color to pop-up runner mode 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.900
 because the difference changed because the document interpreted the 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.129
 rgb files 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:32.559
 and now he reinterprets us 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:33.800
 and it is not the same if 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.370
 change its values ​​we will return 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.469
 for example when we had it 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:39.999
 This is going to be the color 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.029
 rgb 0 99 and 100 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:44.620
 in case of rege b 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.309
 base at 155 which is the maximum 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:48.350
 for red 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.060
 the whereabouts of zero and for your interest I also know what there is 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.310
 now let's move 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.360
 this goes 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.620
 and let's see what happens assem the ica 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.039
 changed the tone 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.589
 but let's see 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:04.589
 what past 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:11.559
 the color is fixed, the mind changes although the cemex ica continued 0 99 and 100 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:14.440
 the rcd changed his tone because he tried to interpret it 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.440
 wolf better than he could to our screens 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.949
 yes now we return to return it aguerre gb 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.450
 It is a color that 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.409
 yes dirty 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.569
 and will hardly go back to 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.770
 255 of the red be or of turin and he stopped it 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.810
 that you have to have very important says that it is a subject that maybe many 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.580
 they considered useless 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.719
 but the truth 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:38.960
 thanks to this 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.650
 they are going here 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.600
 terrible headaches and I tell you from experience that's all for 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.980
 today he secured in Chile until later
