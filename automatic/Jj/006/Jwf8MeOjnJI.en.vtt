00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
problem you can go to your account and

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.599 
problem you can go to your account and
you<00:00:19.619> can<00:00:19.650> look<00:00:20.250> what's<00:00:20.789> about<00:00:21.029> them<00:00:21.529> however

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
you can look what's about them however

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.580 
you can look what's about them however
it<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.760> alpha<00:00:24.090> beta<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.720> won't<00:00:24.900> work<00:00:25.289> right

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
it is alpha beta so it won't work right

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.950 
it is alpha beta so it won't work right
now<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> near<00:00:27.210> future<00:00:27.269> he'll<00:00:27.720> probably

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
now so in the near future he'll probably

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.650 
now so in the near future he'll probably
work<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:29.010> search<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.760> setup<00:00:30.510> does

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
work and the search and the setup does

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.889 
work and the search and the setup does
not<00:00:30.779> work<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.170> if<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:31.560> go<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.769> search<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.899> it

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
not work so if we go to search and it

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.020 
not work so if we go to search and it
will<00:00:33.989> say<00:00:34.230> error<00:00:34.500> loading<00:00:34.920> page<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.790> that

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
will say error loading page like that

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.510 
will say error loading page like that
and<00:00:36.239> setup<00:00:36.809> does<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.170> work<00:00:37.380> either<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.950> we're

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
and setup does not work either so we're

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.030 
and setup does not work either so we're
just<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.790> head<00:00:38.940> over<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.239> sessions<00:00:40.040> well

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
just going to head over to sessions well

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.740 
just going to head over to sessions well
I<00:00:41.070> think<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.520> far<00:00:41.790> with<00:00:42.000> my<00:00:42.090> experience<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.660> I

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
I think so far with my experience of I

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.779 
I think so far with my experience of I
dev<00:00:42.989> store<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.350> pretty<00:00:43.620> simple<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.219> neat<00:00:44.550> it

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
dev store it's pretty simple and neat it

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.810 
dev store it's pretty simple and neat it
will<00:00:45.059> definitely<00:00:45.390> help<00:00:45.539> new<00:00:46.020> jailbreakers

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
will definitely help new jailbreakers

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.619 
will definitely help new jailbreakers
especially<00:00:47.820> ones<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.090> are<00:00:48.270> not<00:00:48.390> familiar

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
especially ones that are not familiar

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.020 
especially ones that are not familiar
with<00:00:49.110> Cydia<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.860> also<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.000> great

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
with Cydia and also I think it's a great

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.180 
with Cydia and also I think it's a great
UI<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:52.230> moving<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.620> we're<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> look<00:00:53.039> at

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
UI but moving on we're going to look at

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.430 
UI but moving on we're going to look at
the<00:00:53.340> sections<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.870> see<00:00:55.079> there's<00:00:55.260> all

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the sections so you see there's all

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.630 
the sections so you see there's all
these<00:00:55.590> sections<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.219> kind<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.489> small

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
these sections it's kind of small

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.790 
these sections it's kind of small
because<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.180> alpha<00:00:57.510> beta<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:57.989> still<00:00:58.530> there's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
because in alpha beta but still there's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.610 
because in alpha beta but still there's
a<00:00:59.039> pretty<00:00:59.760> good<00:01:00.059> amount<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.390> packages<00:01:00.899> so

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
a pretty good amount of packages so

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.959 
a pretty good amount of packages so
we're<00:01:01.739> going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> install<00:01:02.010> mix<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
we're going to install mix to the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.329 
we're going to install mix to the
YouTube<00:01:03.420> video<00:01:03.570> converter<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.500> caused<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.159> lot

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
YouTube video converter it caused a lot

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.969 
YouTube video converter it caused a lot
of<00:01:05.369> tweaks<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.790> pro<00:01:06.150> tube<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.659> your<00:01:06.689> tube<00:01:07.140> so

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
of tweaks like pro tube in your tube so

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:08.960 
of tweaks like pro tube in your tube so
we're<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> head<00:01:08.700> over<00:01:08.939> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
we're just going to head over to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.480 
we're just going to head over to
multimedia<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.830> definitely<00:01:11.250> recommend

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
multimedia and I definitely recommend

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.870 
multimedia and I definitely recommend

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you to be on Wi-Fi when you install any

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.929 
you to be on Wi-Fi when you install any
other<00:01:15.180> tweaks<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.869> Deb<00:01:16.140> store<00:01:16.409> because<00:01:17.280> it

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
other tweaks on I Deb store because it

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.300 
other tweaks on I Deb store because it
will<00:01:18.119> not<00:01:18.299> work<00:01:18.330> well<00:01:18.869> if<00:01:19.170> you're<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.590> solar<00:01:19.920> I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
will not work well if you're on solar I

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.370 
will not work well if you're on solar I
tried<00:01:20.790> downloading<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.420> lot<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.990> stuff<00:01:22.229> on

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
tried downloading a lot of stuff on

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.469 
tried downloading a lot of stuff on
cellular<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.009> does<00:01:23.369> not<00:01:23.520> work<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
cellular and does not work and but that

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.480 
cellular and does not work and but that
could<00:01:24.689> be<00:01:24.720> an<00:01:25.049> issue<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.439> because<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
could be an issue just because the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.910 
could be an issue just because the
packages<00:01:26.909> don't<00:01:27.119> work<00:01:27.299> or<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.200> because

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
packages don't work or just because

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.620 
packages don't work or just because
there's<00:01:29.280> some<00:01:29.610> problem<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> seller<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.509> we're
