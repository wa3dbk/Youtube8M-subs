00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.750
Breath Jane...breath..

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.750
everything’s fine now.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.750
You came back to the base

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It worked.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.750
Monroe was about to present

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.250
the final article of an investigation he was working on for months.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.360
He said to his editor 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.000
that he had almost found out the connections 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.250
between the government and some experiments

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.500
carried out secretly out of the country.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.250
He raved about time travels. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.750
Stabbed to the throat...

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.750
You came back. 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.500
I knew you would have done it sooner or later. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So that's how it has to happen..

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.750
At least I hoped I could make sense of what you are about to do.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.750
People who sent you here play God.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.750
But you can't.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.750
You can't change the past.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.750
You can't!

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.250
It seems that there are no tracks left by the killer. 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.750
No signs.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.500
After the assassination it’s as if he has desappeared.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.750
We'll never know what Lance Monroe was working on.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.250
The news I've just read to you, dates back 15 years.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.000
Our data were correct, Jane..

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.250
we've got back Monroe's files without changing the events order. 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.250
Everything’s gone as we expected.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.750
Three minutes. 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.500
They're perfect for you to stay in the past.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.250
All you have to do, is to kill.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.500
We'll take care of taking you back home.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.000
Be prepared...

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.750
we are going to start the next session. 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.500
This time you'll be directed to London

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
your next target, it's a subway station.
0:04:10.750,0:04:10.500
We are sending you to 2005.
