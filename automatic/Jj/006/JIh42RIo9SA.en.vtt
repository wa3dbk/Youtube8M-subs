00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:19.050
 hello and welcome to a new lesson of 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:22.750
 academy graphic in this lesson 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.660
 I will explain a pattern that you already find on the 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.310
 academic graphic blog explaining in 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.320
 simple steps like drawing a rose 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.489
 this lesson was requested by 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:40.589
 so many of you have therefore decided to 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.299
 insert it into our educational program 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:46.600
 as you have already seen for the ho pictures 

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:47.440
 drawn a stem with leaves in it 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.830
 high 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.769
 I marked a kind of bell 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.500
 upside down with an ellipse for those who don't 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:01.239
 knew an ellipse and a has the form of 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.820
 a flying saucer or a circle 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.090
 mashed 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.570
 after drawing the main outline 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:16.950
 I go on to work on details like i 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.950
 petals the leaves and the stem 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:04.190
 I add the chiaroscuro that I will make 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:12.380
 on the sides to give for the desired effect 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:18.430
 almost cylindrical later 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.430
 I also make rose leaves 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:39.050
 and I continue to work within the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:43.120
 bud in this way I can give 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.120
 that depth effect 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:03:00.769
 it also passes over the stem flown sense for 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.629
 darken one side and have the other side longer 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:10.250
 clear in this way we are the effect 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:12.860
 optical of roundness while now you 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.359
 show another scheme as well 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.659
 simple to draw a pink start 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:25.790
 drawing a sphere above and 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:31.430
 then I add the style later 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:35.139
 I add he said at the top of the circle and 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.139
 drawing two side lines 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:50.079
 I add the lines where they are drawn 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.079
 leaves 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.710
 both above and in coop below 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:09.250
 start working on design details 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.250
 the first petro is slightly open 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.830
 recalculates bud tip and there 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.970
 draw a spiral inside always 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:24.350
 squashed joint nor did I say add 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:27.890
 others the petals behind the bud 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.530
 which of course following the rule 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.880
 of the perspective must always be more 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.350
 rich to give with the effect of 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:39.700
 depth and distance of the petal 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.700
 so he started to trace everything 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.930
 adding more details 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:11.539
 I add the chiaroscuro to render more 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:14.729
 voluminous the bud but in this case 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:20.280
 I have to darken the petals that are found 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:23.340
 behind and make it emerge like this 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:31.919
 wonderful understanding you will have this 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:36.419
 effect of calculation depth on 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:39.110
 sketched outline drawing lines 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.110
 more decisive 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:54.470
 darken one side of the leaves to make them 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:58.190
 emerge to make them at least plants and 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:04.910
 I move back to the tip of the 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:09.970
 bud to darken the spiral e 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.970
 deepen the bud itself 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:21.110
 Review on the leaves are slightly 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:25.310
 sharp and isolated lines following the lines 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:29.000
 main I want to remind you that below 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:33.230
 to the video you will find a link where you can 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:38.300
 download the images of the scheme from 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:41.540
 follow to draw a rose for 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:45.710
 this lesson is all a greeting from ubaldo 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:48.680
 freelance draftsman and vi 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:51.550
 I leave with my motto good graphics a 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.550
 all bye
