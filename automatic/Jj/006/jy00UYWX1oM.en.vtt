interest<00:04:12.150> in<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.600> game<00:04:12.750> so<00:04:13.620> that's<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.820> little

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
interest in the game so that's a little

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.210 
interest in the game so that's a little
bit<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:15.870> an<00:04:15.959> insight<00:04:16.260> or<00:04:16.320> not<00:04:16.709> really<00:04:16.859> insider

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
bit of an insight or not really insider

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.740 
bit of an insight or not really insider
thing<00:04:17.519> but<00:04:17.760> that's<00:04:18.239> kind<00:04:18.419> of<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.540> way<00:04:18.630> it

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
thing but that's kind of the way it

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.740 
thing but that's kind of the way it
works<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.169> when<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.380> see<00:04:19.530> some<00:04:19.739> channels<00:04:20.160> like

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
works so when you see some channels like

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.870 
works so when you see some channels like
they'd<00:04:21.750> have<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:21.959> ton<00:04:22.229> of<00:04:22.260> subscribers<00:04:22.950> go<00:04:23.729> and
