leftovers actually made a mistake in my
last<00:00:15.929> video<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.850> really<00:00:17.850> listened<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.570> song

last video I really listened to the song
realized<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> messed<00:00:21.480> up<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
realized that I messed up in the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.439 
realized that I messed up in the
beginning<00:00:22.350> part<00:00:22.850> it's<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.970> little<00:00:24.210> different

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
beginning part it's a little different

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.620 
beginning part it's a little different
it's<00:00:25.140> not<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.650> much<00:00:25.830> different<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.539> let<00:00:27.539> me

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
it's not that much different but let me

00:00:27.630 --> 00:01:25.110 
it's not that much different but let me
play<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.960> first<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.470> then<00:00:28.939> play<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.060> slowly

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.190 

then<00:01:28.720> alright<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:29.960> basically<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.500> first<00:01:30.710> part

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
then alright so basically the first part

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.010 
then alright so basically the first part
you're<00:01:33.200> going<00:01:33.320> to<00:01:33.410> play<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:34.010> chords<00:01:35.020> four

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
you're going to play the chords four

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.780 
you're going to play the chords four
times<00:01:36.410> each<00:01:37.160> one<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:39.200> first<00:01:39.440> one<00:01:39.710> not<00:01:40.610> going

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
times each one the first one not going

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.760 
times each one the first one not going
to<00:01:40.880> I<00:01:41.270> don't<00:01:41.960> know<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.170> names<00:01:42.410> of<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.620> chords

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
to I don't know the names of the chords

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.980 
to I don't know the names of the chords
I'm<00:01:43.070> self-taught<00:01:43.550> so<00:01:43.880> you're<00:01:44.690> going<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.840> have

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
I'm self-taught so you're going to have

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.990 
I'm self-taught so you're going to have
to<00:01:45.170> just<00:01:45.350> figure<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.190> out<00:01:46.280> yourself

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
to just figure it out yourself

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.340 
to just figure it out yourself
sorry<00:01:48.130> that's<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.280> truth<00:01:49.910> okay<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.140> first

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
sorry that's the truth okay so the first

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.340 
sorry that's the truth okay so the first
chord<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:51.920> going<00:01:52.190> to<00:01:52.250> be<00:01:52.550> these<00:01:53.150> three<00:01:53.570> keys<00:01:53.900> I

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
chord is going to be these three keys I

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.110 
chord is going to be these three keys I
believe<00:01:55.130> it's<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:56.390> pc<00:01:57.400> there's<00:01:58.400> this<00:01:58.520> E<00:01:58.790> flat<00:01:59.440> G

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
believe it's a pc there's this E flat G

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.970 
believe it's a pc there's this E flat G
it's<00:02:02.120> going<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.330> take<00:02:02.480> too<00:02:02.630> long<00:02:02.660> if<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.140> figure

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
it's going to take too long if I figure

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.580 
it's going to take too long if I figure
it<00:02:04.100> out<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.750> first<00:02:05.990> chord<00:02:06.260> these

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
it out so this is the first chord these

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.810 
it out so this is the first chord these
three<00:02:06.920> keys<00:02:08.320> and<00:02:09.320> there's<00:02:10.280> two<00:02:10.429> ways<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.670> play

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
three keys and there's two ways to play

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.560 
three keys and there's two ways to play
um<00:02:11.180> in<00:02:11.540> in<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.140> actual<00:02:12.440> show<00:02:12.740> they<00:02:13.520> play<00:02:13.910> the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
um in in the actual show they play the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.480 
um in in the actual show they play the
slow<00:02:14.840> version<00:02:14.870> which<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.710> what<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.040> play<00:02:16.340> it

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
slow version which is what I play it

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:24.730 
slow version which is what I play it
it's<00:02:16.970> easier<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:23.960> could<00:02:24.200> do<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.320> that<00:02:24.560> way

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
it's easier so you could do it that way

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:33.930 
it's easier so you could do it that way
and<00:02:24.950> once<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.310> get<00:02:25.460> better<00:02:25.870> they<00:02:26.870> do<00:02:27.050> a<00:02:27.080> little

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.560 

so<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.330> way<00:02:35.810> is<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.020> little<00:02:36.230> more<00:02:36.470> exciting

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
so that way is a little more exciting

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.240 
so that way is a little more exciting
but<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.810> would<00:02:39.230> start<00:02:39.440> out<00:02:39.650> with<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.130> know

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
but I would start out with you know

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.640 
but I would start out with you know
simple<00:02:40.910> one<00:02:41.330> two<00:02:41.600> three<00:02:41.900> one<00:02:42.080> two<00:02:42.110> three<00:02:42.350> one

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
simple one two three one two three one

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:53.830 
simple one two three one two three one
two<00:02:42.800> three<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:50.239> play<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.480> sport<00:02:50.900> tips

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.130 

keep<00:02:54.840> your<00:02:55.020> finger<00:02:55.320> here<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:56.580> move<00:02:56.760> down

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
keep your finger here and you move down

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:10.010 
keep your finger here and you move down
over<00:02:58.140> here<00:03:07.640> still<00:03:08.640> keep<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.090> here<00:03:09.360> now<00:03:09.960> you

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
over here still keep it here now you

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:18.809 
over here still keep it here now you
play<00:03:10.380> these<00:03:10.710> three<00:03:11.010> keys

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:31.240 

go<00:03:19.819> back<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.300> original<00:03:20.360> cord<00:03:29.830> also<00:03:30.830> for

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
go back to the original cord also for

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.620 
go back to the original cord also for
saps<00:03:31.550> and<00:03:31.910> then<00:03:33.490> keep<00:03:34.490> these<00:03:34.760> these<00:03:35.360> are<00:03:35.510> the

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
saps and then keep these these are the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:43.480 
saps and then keep these these are the
same<00:03:35.810> you<00:03:36.050> just<00:03:36.260> move<00:03:37.120> from<00:03:38.560> this<00:03:40.060> ABC<00:03:41.060> C<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:42.890> B

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
same you just move from this ABC C to B

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:52.440 
same you just move from this ABC C to B
flat

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:11.650 

down<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.750> B<00:04:05.470> then<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:07.760> next<00:04:08.060> part<00:04:08.239> is<00:04:10.660> it's

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
down to B then the next part is it's

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.470 
down to B then the next part is it's
easier<00:04:12.290> so<00:04:12.769> it's<00:04:13.070> it's<00:04:13.880> basically<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.239> start

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
easier so it's it's basically you start

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.390 
easier so it's it's basically you start
off<00:04:14.540> with<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:14.780> same<00:04:14.989> chord<00:04:17.890> but<00:04:18.890> this<00:04:19.190> time

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
off with the same chord but this time

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.690 
off with the same chord but this time
you<00:04:19.549> only<00:04:19.579> play<00:04:19.940> twice<00:04:21.250> each<00:04:22.250> chord<00:04:22.580> is<00:04:22.669> played

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
you only play twice each chord is played

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:33.850 
you only play twice each chord is played
twice<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:26.410> then<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:27.500> move<00:04:27.680> up<00:04:28.120> key<00:04:29.120> right<00:04:29.600> here

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:45.220 

back<00:04:34.860> down<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.280> key<00:04:35.670> and<00:04:35.940> down<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.720> key<00:04:37.080> over<00:04:37.320> here

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:05:01.870 

so<00:04:46.230> basically<00:04:46.620> it's<00:04:57.560> and<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.590> play<00:04:58.950> that<00:04:58.980> with

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.030

simple okay so once you got that down
you<00:05:24.240> could<00:05:24.650> you<00:05:25.650> basically<00:05:25.980> start<00:05:26.430> off<00:05:26.640> with

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
you could you basically start off with

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.440 
you could you basically start off with
after<00:05:28.590> you<00:05:28.650> play<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.920> first<00:05:29.070> part<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:30.090> you

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
after you play the first part and you

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:56.640 
after you play the first part and you
finish<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:31.020> so<00:05:31.350> let's<00:05:32.250> just<00:05:32.550> play<00:05:32.700> it

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.650

same time so same thing with this key
you<00:06:25.730> hit<00:06:25.880> it<00:06:26.000> first<00:06:27.730> then<00:06:28.730> you<00:06:28.910> go<00:06:29.030> at<00:06:29.120> the<00:06:29.210> same

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
you hit it first then you go at the same

00:06:29.360 --> 00:07:04.210 
you hit it first then you go at the same
time<00:07:00.220> now<00:07:01.220> the<00:07:01.280> next<00:07:01.700> part<00:07:01.880> of<00:07:02.060> this<00:07:02.270> is<00:07:03.220> you

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.220 
time now the next part of this is you

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:15.010 
time now the next part of this is you
start<00:07:04.550> off<00:07:04.700> this<00:07:05.420> key<00:07:12.460> and<00:07:13.460> it's<00:07:13.850> it's<00:07:14.720> played

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
start off this key and it's it's played

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:22.150 
start off this key and it's it's played
quicker<00:07:15.380> than<00:07:15.680> the<00:07:15.800> first<00:07:16.040> part<00:07:20.800> you<00:07:21.800> go<00:07:21.950> back

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 
quicker than the first part you go back

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.690 
quicker than the first part you go back
soon

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:26.700 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.860 

and<00:07:27.700> I<00:07:27.760> think<00:07:28.090> I<00:07:28.420> hear<00:07:28.750> them<00:07:29.380> go<00:07:30.000> down<00:07:31.000> a<00:07:31.450> key

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:31.870 
and I think I hear them go down a key

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:37.790 
and I think I hear them go down a key
once<00:07:32.860> you<00:07:33.130> get<00:07:33.700> over<00:07:33.970> here<00:07:34.270> to<00:07:34.600> this<00:07:34.750> chord<00:07:35.080> a

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.240 

little<00:07:38.800> subtle<00:07:39.310> dramatic<00:07:39.910> feel<00:07:40.890> okay<00:07:41.890> so<00:07:41.950> that

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.250 
little subtle dramatic feel okay so that

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.840
