analogy the point of the well ran

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.740 
analogy the point of the well ran
because<00:00:35.860> right<00:00:36.579> now<00:00:36.789> there's<00:00:37.090> a<00:00:37.149> big<00:00:37.390> change

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
because right now there's a big change

the<00:00:40.059> food<00:00:40.239> pyramid<00:00:40.510> just<00:00:41.260> something<00:00:41.679> that's

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
the food pyramid just something that's

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.889

are<00:00:49.149> going<00:00:49.420> away<00:00:49.719> from<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:50.019> pyramid<00:00:50.409> which

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
are going away from the pyramid which

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.649 
are going away from the pyramid which
people<00:00:50.800> couldn't<00:00:51.039> really<00:00:51.190> relate<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.699> when<00:00:52.539> it

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
people couldn't really relate to when it

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.090 
people couldn't really relate to when it
came<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.929> putting<00:00:53.050> food<00:00:53.289> on<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.530> plate<00:00:53.769> now

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
came to putting food on the plate now

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.349 
came to putting food on the plate now
it's<00:00:54.249> a<00:00:54.309> plate<00:00:54.519> people<00:00:54.850> can<00:00:54.969> relate<00:00:55.179> to<00:00:55.239> a

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
it's a plate people can relate to a

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.139 
it's a plate people can relate to a
plate<00:00:55.629> basically<00:00:56.079> it's<00:00:56.620> very<00:00:56.710> simple<00:00:57.249> half<00:00:57.879> of

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
plate basically it's very simple half of

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:59.219 
plate basically it's very simple half of
your<00:00:58.300> plate<00:00:58.420> should<00:00:58.690> be<00:00:58.749> fruits<00:00:58.839> and

00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.229 
your plate should be fruits and

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:01.020 
your plate should be fruits and
vegetables<00:00:59.710> half<00:01:00.190> of<00:01:00.339> your<00:01:00.460> plate<00:01:00.609> should<00:01:00.760> be

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
vegetables half of your plate should be

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.119 
vegetables half of your plate should be
grains<00:01:01.449> in<00:01:01.659> protein<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.170> then<00:01:02.620> you<00:01:02.739> have<00:01:02.979> your

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
grains in protein and then you have your

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.070 
grains in protein and then you have your
dairy<00:01:03.460> at<00:01:03.729> each<00:01:03.909> meal<00:01:04.150> because<00:01:04.449> kids<00:01:04.720> need<00:01:04.839> to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
dairy at each meal because kids need to

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.810 
dairy at each meal because kids need to
have<00:01:05.229> three<00:01:05.500> servings<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:05.979> dairy<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.340> day<00:01:06.400> you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
have three servings of dairy a day you

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.430 
have three servings of dairy a day you
know<00:01:06.909> it<00:01:07.120> does<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.600> simplifies<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.409> whole

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
know it does it simplifies the whole

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.230 
know it does it simplifies the whole
process<00:01:08.830> you<00:01:09.100> can<00:01:09.280> glance<00:01:09.520> at<00:01:09.760> that<00:01:09.909> you<00:01:10.060> can

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
process you can glance at that you can

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.680 
process you can glance at that you can
remember<00:01:10.600> that<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:11.050> lot<00:01:11.410> more<00:01:12.160> easily<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:13.270> it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
remember that a lot more easily and it

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.840 
remember that a lot more easily and it
also<00:01:13.900> gives<00:01:14.320> you<00:01:14.470> that<00:01:14.500> approach<00:01:14.980> of<00:01:15.280> instead

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
also gives you that approach of instead

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.690 
also gives you that approach of instead
of<00:01:15.970> all<00:01:16.180> these<00:01:16.510> different<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:17.380> know

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
of all these different you know

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.460 
of all these different you know
percentages<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:19.030> consider<00:01:19.450> half<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.290> half

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
percentages to consider half and half

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.500 
percentages to consider half and half
you<00:01:20.920> didn't<00:01:21.100> count<00:01:21.280> it<00:01:21.370> Yancy<00:01:21.820> all<00:01:22.180> right<00:01:22.390> all

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
you didn't count it Yancy all right all

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.370 
you didn't count it Yancy all right all
right<00:01:22.540> well<00:01:22.720> let's<00:01:22.840> talk<00:01:22.990> about<00:01:23.230> how<00:01:23.320> you

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
right well let's talk about how you

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.170 
right well let's talk about how you
break<00:01:23.680> that<00:01:23.860> down<00:01:23.920> from<00:01:24.400> from<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.910> different

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
break that down from from the different

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.940 
break that down from from the different
types<00:01:25.360> of<00:01:25.600> meals<00:01:25.810> that<00:01:25.960> we<00:01:26.140> have<00:01:26.320> each<00:01:26.500> day<00:01:26.710> I

have an example for each meal and here
we<00:01:29.470> have<00:01:29.680> half<00:01:30.040> our<00:01:30.370> grain<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:31.000> our<00:01:31.920> protein

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
we have half our grain and our protein

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.890 
we have half our grain and our protein
the<00:01:33.190> eggs<00:01:33.370> are<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.670> protein<00:01:34.060> are<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.510> great
