00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.689
 I was thinking in reality I have 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.689
 enough time without recording a review 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.770
 or criticisms as they are as seen in the 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.510
 title today I bring you a new review and 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.070
 this time I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.350
 circle this is a book of the publishing house 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.640
 Ocean has about 500 thirteen 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.820
 pages 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.460
 9 line road anna carina and vanessa 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.579
 5 girls are totally different 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.340
 one of the other all of them in a city 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.770
 something particular after the assumption 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.809
 suicide of the best friend of line 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.370
 these five girls are joined by one 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.050
 supernatural force which is going on 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.879
 create a mission that goes against 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.860
 everything she wrote but if they 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.510
 evil does not overcome consuming the world 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.159
 They need to be together to achieve 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.050
 fulfill this mission because together they are 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.150
 stronger these girls are chosen 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.370
 for something mysterious to be part of 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.260
 the circle exactly like the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.090
 brothers do not choose either they have 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.980
 had this possibility and as well as the 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.420
 brothers also they have to 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.949
 learn to live together as the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.870
 time one one begins to have a 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.729
 approach to death can not 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.530
 fight because they still do not understand many of 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.660
 the things about this mission are waiting for their 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.420
 turn as sacrificial animals this 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.970
 book is full of witches demons 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.590
 missions prophecies and other worlds mun2 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.550
 that actually not even our 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.550
 protagonists with the 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.579
 this book I decided to read it after having 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.350
 listened to a lot about how wonderful and 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.909
 how cool it was I want to start 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.369
 saying that I gave him three stars on 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.860
 5 is a book with a theme that does not 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.710
 I had read in other books a theme 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.990
 of witches approached the demon already with 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.490
 books with satanic rites and 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.130
 principle I thought it would be a novel 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.079
 good simply that I would like it to be 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.610
 I did not put many expectations but of 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.159
 same way I have to clarify that if I 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.110
 defrauded is a pretty pretty novel 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.119
 introductory and this is what I do not 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.890
 like as the chapters advance the 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.479
 book is telling you different 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.280
 perspectives of the protagonists that 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.780
 I just mentioned that there are six which 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.630
 I liked it a lot, it's that each one has 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.939
 his personality and it's nothing nothing 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.679
 complicated to locate who is who when 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.970
 is telling you the story for the same reason 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.619
 in which book is very instructor I and 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.329
 protagonists are not united nor 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.099
 even at the beginning but as they go 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.260
 to be these 500 pages are getting closer 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.910
 more I think the union is one of the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.010
 important things in this book 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.019
 referring to the great girls fort is 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.970
 a pretty dark city with enough 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.709
 mysteries and enough things that have 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.700
 Attention is a point that I add to 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.739
 the writers because I really did 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.629
 that there was a city that gave you 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.459
 I was afraid I would give you some suspense 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.569
 I am a reader and not all 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.000
 protagonists of the story 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.590
 to fall well or I can all fall ill 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.810
 so this is what happens to me with these 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.370
 protagonists are all girls and I think 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.440
 that I can not identify with 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.330
 none absolutely with any and of 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.250
 done when I became fond of 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.250
 one of the protagonists was passing something 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.260
 super fatal and made me send them to the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.239
 chingada know and writers also 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.620
 it has not stayed quite full and without 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.319
 But I have to say that it is a 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.060
 very very original story at my point of 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.549
 view I think the second part that is 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.010
 game to be with everything will come 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.420
 quite pretty well written I do not know 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.799
 but I'm creating very expectations 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.120
 good the second book even though 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.489
 This is one of the books that has not 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.930
 liked a lot is the book is well it 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.700
 I recommend it because I know they are going to 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.470
 have a good time and I know it can be the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.940
 favorite book of many people 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.650
 who are watching but then however 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.140
 mine was not it is in fact one of the 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.180
 books that I read for a month and I 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.440
 I was angry because I could not 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.690
 finish sometimes the book is mentioned 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.400
 quite heavy and when something like that happened 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.049
 super hooks before the authors of 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.030
 change the theme so super fast 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.209
 they hooked clear 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.410
 that heaviness of max and sara narration 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.660
 they really have in their writing 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.209
 something very dark that makes you true 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.950
 feel inside that darkness that 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.470
 gray tone they want to give the novel 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.450
 they do it very well and I really liked it 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.880
 but there are details that simply do not 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.830
 they finished pleasing see if ocean 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.470
 crossing decides to continue continuing with 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.910
 this saga because I think that in Spain and 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.830
 manage to continue with it after publishing 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.720
 the second book and in Mexico because I do not know 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.209
 what happened I will continue reading the saga if 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.380
 no, well, it's not something that you lose if 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.030
 I want to read the second part because 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.140
 I have enough expectations with the 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.790
 fact that history is not going to be so 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.430
 introductory there is something missing 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.739
 the book is full of color post-its 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.230
 yellow and green there are enough 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.459
 parts that I like a lot a lot and 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.810
 which are remarkable within the 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.760
 story but the parts that I do not 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.590
 they just did not have to be 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.780
 there and they were not necessary simple had 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.760
 many stuff stuff there are good quotes 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.560
 that are left with the story that are left 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.110
 perfectly with what turns around 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.669
 of the novel but I already tell you this is a 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.710
 book that I gave 3 stars out of five 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.360
 in guthrie if you already read it 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.130
 put in the comments how they 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.670
 it seemed and if you feel like reading it 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.530
 ahead 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.030
 I bought it because I really hope that 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.530
 any of you who are watching this 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.090
 video is your favorite book because you 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.440
 I say is a book with potential has 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.090
 something pretty good that I know a lot 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.010
 people liked it and then this is all 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.290
 see you in the next review I am 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.790
 alexis and remember that elector chooses 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.610
 the book if not the book chooses reader 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.290
 see you later I can not believe I'm going to 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.630
 talk about you I can not believe that I follow 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.240
 thinking and believing I need you time 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:07.210
 for me I need time to fix the 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.210
 broken piece of broken piece
