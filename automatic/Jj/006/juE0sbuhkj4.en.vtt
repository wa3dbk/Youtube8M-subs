00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
canvas because it was straight how it

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.859 
canvas because it was straight how it
was<00:00:26.189> folded<00:00:26.400> now<00:00:27.210> make<00:00:27.390> sure<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.689> have

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
was folded now make sure that you have

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.660 
was folded now make sure that you have
this<00:00:27.990> aligned<00:00:28.410> how<00:00:28.650> you'd<00:00:28.830> like<00:00:29.070> depending<00:00:29.550> on

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
this aligned how you'd like depending on

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.299 
this aligned how you'd like depending on
your<00:00:29.760> pattern<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.300> cut<00:00:31.260> about<00:00:31.439> an<00:00:31.800> inch<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.279> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
your pattern and cut about an inch and a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.010 
your pattern and cut about an inch and a
half<00:00:32.340> around<00:00:32.790> each<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.930> sides

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.320 

once<00:00:40.020> all<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> excess<00:00:40.650> is<00:00:40.860> turned<00:00:41.190> off<00:00:41.400> then<00:00:42.030> I

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
once all the excess is turned off then I

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.150 
once all the excess is turned off then I
just<00:00:42.630> make<00:00:42.810> sure<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.110> my<00:00:43.230> pattern<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.830> still

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
just make sure that my pattern is still

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.130 
just make sure that my pattern is still
how<00:00:44.370> I'd<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.880> to<00:00:45.060> be<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> canvas<00:00:45.900> and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
how I'd like it to be on the canvas and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.780 
how I'd like it to be on the canvas and
everything's<00:00:46.830> nice<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.370> straight

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.670 

then<00:00:50.790> grab<00:00:51.030> your<00:00:51.210> hot<00:00:51.360> glue<00:00:51.540> gun<00:00:51.630> and<00:00:52.110> get

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
then grab your hot glue gun and get

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.880 
then grab your hot glue gun and get
going<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.690> I'm<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.900> starting<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.620> side

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
going so I'm just starting with one side

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.500 
going so I'm just starting with one side
here<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.790> very<00:00:56.970> bottom<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
here this is just the very bottom and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.080 
here this is just the very bottom and
you<00:00:58.380> just<00:00:58.410> once<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.160> glue<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.520> there<00:00:59.850> make

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you just once the glue is on there make

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.360 
you just once the glue is on there make
sure<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.330> so<00:01:00.570> hot<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:01.410> very<00:01:01.620> careful<00:01:02.070> because

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
sure it's so hot be very careful because

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.740 
sure it's so hot be very careful because
it<00:01:02.580> will<00:01:02.700> come<00:01:02.880> through<00:01:03.030> your<00:01:03.180> fabric<00:01:03.360> be

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
it will come through your fabric be

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.420 
it will come through your fabric be
careful<00:01:04.020> when<00:01:04.140> you're<00:01:04.199> pushing<00:01:04.440> but<00:01:05.160> you<00:01:05.250> just

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
careful when you're pushing but you just

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.469 
careful when you're pushing but you just
want<00:01:05.550> to<00:01:05.610> make<00:01:05.700> sure<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.940> you<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> all

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
want to make sure that you have it all

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.900 
want to make sure that you have it all
nice<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.110> press<00:01:07.830> down<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.550> once<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
nice and press down so that once the

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.460 
nice and press down so that once the
glue<00:01:09.090> dries<00:01:09.390> which<00:01:09.780> will<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.020> pretty<00:01:10.259> quick

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
glue dries which will be pretty quick

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.800 
glue dries which will be pretty quick
it'll<00:01:11.160> stick<00:01:11.400> nicely<00:01:11.550> so<00:01:12.300> and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.509> now<00:01:12.720> I'm

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
it'll stick nicely so and then now I'm

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.140 
it'll stick nicely so and then now I'm
going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> take<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> opposite<00:01:13.860> side<00:01:14.160> opposite

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
going to take the opposite side opposite

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.609 
going to take the opposite side opposite
from<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.660> did<00:01:16.050> and<00:01:16.320> I'm<00:01:16.410> going<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
from the one I just did and I'm going to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.650 
from the one I just did and I'm going to
pull<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.800> a<00:01:17.009> little<00:01:17.340> bit<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.790> same<00:01:18.450> thing<00:01:18.479> with

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
pull it a little bit and same thing with

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.990 
pull it a little bit and same thing with
the<00:01:18.869> glue<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:20.160> folding<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.670> up

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.539 

now<00:01:26.000> we're<00:01:26.149> going<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.299> go<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.539> a<00:01:27.109> new<00:01:27.679> side<00:01:28.039> here

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
now we're going to go to a new side here

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.459 
now we're going to go to a new side here
and<00:01:28.700> you're<00:01:29.390> going<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.539> fold<00:01:29.750> these<00:01:29.990> just<00:01:30.350> like

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
and you're going to fold these just like

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:32.230 
and you're going to fold these just like
you<00:01:30.590> would<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.799> present<00:01:31.369> so<00:01:31.640> that<00:01:31.789> it<00:01:31.850> has<00:01:31.969> nice

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
you would a present so that it has nice

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.840 
you would a present so that it has nice
corners<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:33.009> then<00:01:34.009> we're<00:01:34.130> gonna<00:01:34.219> glue<00:01:34.549> it<00:01:34.670> so

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
corners and then we're gonna glue it so

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.069 
corners and then we're gonna glue it so
here's<00:01:35.060> what<00:01:35.210> it<00:01:35.240> would<00:01:35.360> look<00:01:35.509> like

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
here's what it would look like

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.840 
here's what it would look like
make<00:01:36.500> sure<00:01:36.679> your<00:01:36.829> pattern<00:01:37.130> is<00:01:37.280> your<00:01:37.640> print

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
make sure your pattern is your print

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.029 
make sure your pattern is your print
still<00:01:38.119> sitting<00:01:38.509> how<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:38.659> want<00:01:38.899> it<00:01:39.049> put<00:01:39.890> your

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
still sitting how you want it put your

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.710 
still sitting how you want it put your
glue<00:01:40.280> on

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.310
