00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
two and a half minutes just about yeah I

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.979 
two and a half minutes just about yeah I
am<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.530> didn't<00:02:29.129> walk<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.459> circles<00:02:29.670> i<00:02:30.239> just

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
am that I didn't walk in circles i just

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.750 
am that I didn't walk in circles i just
walked<00:02:31.230> directly<00:02:31.620> here<00:02:32.040> those<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.430> quickest

walked directly here those the quickest

walked directly here those the quickest
way<00:02:32.819> i<00:02:32.940> could<00:02:33.150> possibly<00:02:33.510> go<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:34.019> think<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.040> is
