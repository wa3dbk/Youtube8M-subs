already discussed the somewhat clunky
hit<00:05:07.530> detection<00:05:08.070> but<00:05:08.340> if<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.580> take<00:05:08.820> your<00:05:09.000> time

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
hit detection but if you take your time

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.430 
hit detection but if you take your time
flip<00:05:10.169> the<00:05:10.320> turbo<00:05:10.650> switch<00:05:10.919> up<00:05:11.160> and<00:05:11.460> punch<00:05:12.090> away

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
flip the turbo switch up and punch away

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.560 
flip the turbo switch up and punch away
judging<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.560> timing<00:05:14.040> isn't<00:05:14.430> really<00:05:14.880> too<00:05:15.060> bad

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
judging the timing isn't really too bad

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.680 
judging the timing isn't really too bad
hence<00:05:16.470> what<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:16.890> said<00:05:17.250> earlier<00:05:17.460> about<00:05:17.880> taking

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
hence what I said earlier about taking

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.490 
hence what I said earlier about taking
it<00:05:18.840> slow<00:05:19.169> and<00:05:19.530> one<00:05:20.100> step<00:05:20.490> at<00:05:20.640> a<00:05:20.700> time

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
it slow and one step at a time

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.840 
it slow and one step at a time
unlike<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.680> demo<00:05:23.010> on<00:05:23.040> the<00:05:23.340> title<00:05:23.640> screen

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
unlike the demo on the title screen

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.420 
unlike the demo on the title screen
where<00:05:24.330> we<00:05:24.360> are<00:05:24.600> just<00:05:24.870> running<00:05:25.229> free<00:05:25.800> and<00:05:25.830> fast

what<00:05:32.160> a<00:05:32.190> prankster

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.379 

shadow<00:05:37.770> of<00:05:37.860> the<00:05:37.979> beast<00:05:38.100> tries<00:05:38.610> to<00:05:38.880> be<00:05:39.000> creepy

at<00:05:39.540> times<00:05:39.810> but<00:05:40.199> also<00:05:40.350> doesn't<00:05:40.680> take<00:05:40.949> itself

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
at times but also doesn't take itself

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.180 
at times but also doesn't take itself
too<00:05:41.400> seriously<00:05:41.580> I<00:05:42.449> mean<00:05:43.080> later<00:05:43.680> in<00:05:43.889> the<00:05:43.979> game

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
enemies down in the air and eventually

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.999 
enemies down in the air and eventually
attack<00:05:49.169> a<00:05:49.410> giant<00:05:50.100> toad<00:05:51.380> so<00:05:52.380> I<00:05:52.410> mean<00:05:52.710> you<00:05:52.979> know
