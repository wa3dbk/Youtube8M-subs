00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
a hand reload and then it is a lot

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.950 
a hand reload and then it is a lot
faster<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.780> actually

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
faster and what you do is you actually

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.290 
faster and what you do is you actually
instead<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.710> tapping<00:00:53.039> X<00:00:53.430> once<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.000> reload

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
instead of just tapping X once to reload

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.770 
instead of just tapping X once to reload
you<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.750> tap<00:00:54.960> x<00:00:55.230> twice<00:00:55.770> pretty<00:00:56.219> quickly<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
you just tap x twice pretty quickly and

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.689 
you just tap x twice pretty quickly and
it<00:00:57.780> reloads<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.320> lot<00:00:58.559> faster<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.609> this

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it reloads a lot faster for you and this

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.420 
it reloads a lot faster for you and this
isn't<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.030> an<00:01:00.270> easter<00:01:00.600> egg<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:01.309> just<00:01:02.309> helps

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
isn't just an easter egg that just helps

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.560 
isn't just an easter egg that just helps
you<00:01:02.550> reload<00:01:02.879> faster<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.390> you're<00:01:03.480> just

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
you reload faster and you're just

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.840 
you reload faster and you're just
rewarded<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.350> finding<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.769> easter<00:01:05.189> egg<00:01:05.339> but

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
rewarded for finding out easter egg but

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.670 
rewarded for finding out easter egg but
instead<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.570> does<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.380> kind<00:01:07.619> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
instead what it does is it just kind of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.980 
instead what it does is it just kind of
trashes<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.280> entire<00:01:08.729> clip<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:09.869> i<00:01:09.900> mean

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
trashes the entire clip so what i mean

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.980 
trashes the entire clip so what i mean
by<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:11.299> normally<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.750> shoot<00:01:12.930> like

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
by that is normally if you shoot like

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.469 
by that is normally if you shoot like
two<00:01:13.409> bullets<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.580> reload<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.270> puts

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
two bullets and you reload it just puts

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.179 
two bullets and you reload it just puts
like<00:01:15.570> two<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.200> bullets<00:01:16.530> back<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.890> your<00:01:17.009> gun

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
like two more bullets back in your gun

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.920 
like two more bullets back in your gun
and<00:01:17.490> that's<00:01:18.030> all<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.210> happens<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.750> if<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and that's all that happens but if you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.260 
and that's all that happens but if you
double<00:01:19.200> tap<00:01:19.350> x<00:01:19.680> instead<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:20.970> your

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
double tap x instead of like your

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.420 
double tap x instead of like your
bullets<00:01:21.600> from<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> clip<00:01:22.200> carrying<00:01:23.100> over<00:01:23.280> to

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
bullets from the clip carrying over to

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.999 
bullets from the clip carrying over to
your<00:01:23.549> next<00:01:23.909> clip<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.470> completely<00:01:25.470> trashes

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
your next clip it completely trashes

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.670 
your next clip it completely trashes
everything<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.990> wastes<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.409> 30

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
everything so it just wastes like 30

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.380 
everything so it just wastes like 30
bullets<00:01:29.100> even<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.549> only<00:01:29.700> shot<00:01:30.060> four

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
bullets even if you only shot four

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.929 
bullets even if you only shot four
bullets<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> little<00:01:32.280> bit<00:01:32.430> risky

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
bullets so it is a little bit risky

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.310 
bullets so it is a little bit risky
because<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.240> lose<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.420> lot<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.600> ammo<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
because you lose a lot of ammo but the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.440 
because you lose a lot of ammo but the
