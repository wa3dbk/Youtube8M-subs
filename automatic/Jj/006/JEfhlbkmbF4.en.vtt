00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.340
 I'll tell you 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.080
 The eyes can no longer see 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.640
 Things that only the heart can understand 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.480
 Fundamental is really love 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.920
 It is impossible to be happy alone 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.980
 The rest is sea 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.040
 It's all I can not tell 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.320
 These are beautiful things that I have to give you. 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.980
 He comes softly to the breeze and tells me 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 It is impossible to be happy alone 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.980
 The first time was the city 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.600
 From the second, the quay and eternity 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.480
 Now I know 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.340
 From the wave that rose in the sea 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.360
 And the stars we forgot to tell 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960
 Love is surprised 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.900
 As the night comes to envelop us 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.080
 Now I know 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.180
 From the wave that rose in the sea 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.880
 And the stars we forgot to tell 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.540
 Love is surprised 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.940
 As the night comes to envelop us 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.580
 I'll tell you
