00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.070
 h 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.650
 23 9 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.290
 I see it differently 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.000
 gentlemen on the couch 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.490
 nice to watch the docusoap 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.270
 that day does not come 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.270
 and suddenly 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.590
 how should you go there 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.479
 I know 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.770
 that must be your country so i pick up 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.130
 you have to be japan 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.410
 computer 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.730
 I have nothing important to discuss Libya 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.850
 so i am camps 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.850
 I'm curious about the service 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.540
 we start pleasantly 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.750
 come in total 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.000
 8 is full for a few minutes 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.970
 something to be experienced too late is gone too late 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.020
 for online research it also turned out to be permissible 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.930
 at that moment if you do a bit more on that the band is on the bar 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.930
 even though you are not even let you know on March 2 a half meter start 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.380
 at half past eight in the field 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.040
 I'm sorry but I'm there then the other important in the planning 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.500
 but the maria place 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.180
 we start with articles 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.320
 based on what is now, it will be an important year for the boat 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.960
 A phone call that is so important is to finally break it 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.340
 successor I was just to make 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.440
 the Dutch national team 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.729
 there might know 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.090
 I do not want 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.580
 the picture on the spot 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.460
 why not 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.140
 I also have the chance to years 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.160
 beautiful music 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.139
 bonus texts grow 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.389
 grab a plug 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:11.690
 that if you hear that 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.239
 a meditation and so brings the system 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.569
 finds were made 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.970
 orange masses are in the stadiums 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.330
 henk van der kolk last year 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.789
 and I'm going to judge 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:24.780
 that also benefits 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.359
 the open day education 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.359
 in the series 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:34.269
 juice jam i don't find you 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.849
 tickets are for it not 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.849
 the secretary's chance rating 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:42.549
 that is 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:43.789
 so there are 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.829
 so making it was the best 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.259
 we are all clear I believe it will hit 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:51.589
 because what kind of music does it have to be no idea 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:54.729
 no idea 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.729
 partly because you then it turned out to be empty 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:02.709
 I hear you have to find out who understands music etc I can start 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.709
 and there comes a big problem for a true return 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:08.529
 the Swedish government 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.529
 but likes 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:15.089
 the venlo nare 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:16.699
 9 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.199
 that the economy in a previous valuation 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.889
 nijmegen almere hmm 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.669
 he assumed 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.019
 paulo 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.019

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:42.409

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.249
 Jaap Stam Douglas and not for the ECA next year 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:48.439
 I think you're the man that you can say 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.989
 know that is exactly what he wants 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.279
 the dim 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:57.329
 neither do I we have no idea the route is missing I keep hoping 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:58.510
 merchant ships 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.510
 the czech netherlands thirteen boats 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.979
 I don't feel like wall street 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.979
 anp you 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.909
 a little bit this year 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.969
 that that note stems from camps 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.439
 digital platforms and the euro the future 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.559
 Protocols We can now occupy the crown on the work 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.509
 we 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.379
 can this work 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:27.379
 I have great dust in my studies 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.259
 a number of 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:31.569
 go looking 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.409
 in the small ice age 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.409
 But then you have to pay downtown 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:45.409
 when they think about one and a half tons, but I call my teammates 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:46.150
 due 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.770
