00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.940
 to be a model 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:22.650
 my business is called tired rivas is 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.140
 located on victoria street 9 22 in the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.849
 rubro I've been like 30 years more children 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.699
 his specialty is to clone 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.230
 shoes or shoe my life was born this 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.070
 shoe for example they brought it from 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.870
 England 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.120
 the girl wanted the same model 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.870
 everything the same then we take 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.000
 this result obviously that is 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.550
 tired I made is a new plastic 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.350

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.629
 natural 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.030
 about a shoe as you 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.610
 it goes from 38 to 45 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.430

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.890
 articles to make footwear 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.770

 Chinese then want a lot of industry 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.840
