are a sign of fertility so

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.240 
are a sign of fertility so
scientifically<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.470> makes<00:01:58.650> sense<00:01:58.830> my<00:01:58.920> guys

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
talking but I'm pretty sure most guys if

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.030 
talking but I'm pretty sure most guys if
not<00:02:03.600> all<00:02:03.810> guys<00:02:04.020> don't<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.470> girls<00:02:04.770> with<00:02:04.890> big
