so<00:00:03.240> so<00:00:03.870> student<00:00:04.230> see<00:00:04.950> we're<00:00:05.759> established

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
so so student see we're established

so so student see we're established
ourselves<00:00:06.330> on<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.839> right<00:00:06.990> downwind<00:00:07.200> because

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
ourselves on the right downwind because

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.470 
ourselves on the right downwind because
fixed<00:00:08.189> wings<00:00:08.340> fly<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.700> left<00:00:09.030> downwind<00:00:09.210> is

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
fixed wings fly the left downwind is

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.450 
fixed wings fly the left downwind is
it's<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:10.170> regulation<00:00:10.710> for<00:00:10.889> this<00:00:11.010> airport

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
it's the regulation for this airport

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.220 
it's the regulation for this airport
major<00:00:11.940> airports<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.570> normally<00:00:12.870> happens<00:00:13.110> like

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
major airports and normally happens like

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.379 
major airports and normally happens like
that<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.040> fly<00:00:14.280> different<00:00:14.790> patterns<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.269> we

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
that so we fly different patterns so we

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.000 
that so we fly different patterns so we
say<00:00:15.570> out<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.780> their<00:00:15.929> way<00:00:16.109> roof<00:00:16.320> by<00:00:16.529> lower<00:00:16.770> than

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
say out of their way roof by lower than

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.470 
say out of their way roof by lower than
them<00:00:17.160> they<00:00:17.279> do<00:00:17.340> 700<00:00:18.439> 1225<00:00:19.439> 500<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.699> there's<00:00:21.240> no

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
them they do 700 1225 500 so there's no

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.290 
them they do 700 1225 500 so there's no
collision<00:00:22.350> problems<00:00:22.710> okay<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.150> see

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
collision problems okay see you see

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.509 
collision problems okay see you see

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
we do and we're going to come in and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.420 
we do and we're going to come in and
warm<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:43.590> we're<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> come<00:00:44.190> in

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
warm in here and we're going to come in

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.360 
warm in here and we're going to come in
and<00:00:44.719> gradually<00:00:45.719> slow<00:00:46.140> ourselves<00:00:46.410> down<00:00:46.829> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
and gradually slow ourselves down and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.410 
and gradually slow ourselves down and
descend<00:00:48.360> slowly<00:00:49.070> ensure<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.610> always<00:00:50.940> are

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
descend slowly ensure that we always are

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.810 
descend slowly ensure that we always are
in<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.600> safe<00:00:51.840> flight<00:00:52.199> profile<00:00:52.829> by<00:00:53.399> doing<00:00:53.670> that

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
in a safe flight profile by doing that

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.090 
in a safe flight profile by doing that
with<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> collect<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.140> slowly<00:00:55.559> lower<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
with the collect if you slowly lower the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.920 
with the collect if you slowly lower the
collective<00:00:56.670> all<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.570> nose<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.899> very

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
collective all right the nose is very

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.260 
collective all right the nose is very
slowly<00:00:58.379> start<00:00:58.680> dropping<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.699> bring

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
slowly start dropping so we just bring

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.450 
slowly start dropping so we just bring
it<00:01:00.539> slightly<00:01:00.780> back<00:01:01.170> now<00:01:01.859> you're<00:01:02.010> taking<00:01:02.160> away

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it slightly back now you're taking away

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.070 
it slightly back now you're taking away
torque<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.090> also<00:01:03.270> put<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.600> bit<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.840> right

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
torque so you also put a bit of right

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.280 
torque so you also put a bit of right
pedal<00:01:04.439> si<00:01:04.710> si<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.970> no<00:01:06.180> pedal<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.260> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
pedal si si this is no pedal this is a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.050 
pedal si si this is no pedal this is a
bit<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.650> right<00:01:07.799> pedal<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.460> looks<00:01:08.610> much<00:01:08.820> nicer

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
bit of right pedal it looks much nicer

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.289 
bit of right pedal it looks much nicer
now<00:01:10.049> our<00:01:10.200> site<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.439> clear<00:01:10.830> no<00:01:11.460> traffic<00:01:11.939> yes

that<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.480> elevation<00:01:44.020> here<00:01:44.110> is<00:01:44.200> 1,000<00:01:44.740> feet<00:01:44.920> we

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
that the elevation here is 1,000 feet we

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.720 
that the elevation here is 1,000 feet we
are<00:01:45.450> 1400<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:47.050> we're<00:01:47.410> 400<00:01:47.830> feet<00:01:47.950> above<00:01:48.010> your

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
are 1400 so we're 400 feet above your

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.580 
are 1400 so we're 400 feet above your
side<00:01:48.910> clear<00:01:49.180> yep<00:01:49.450> my<00:01:49.810> side<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.170> this<00:01:50.290> journey

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
side clear yep my side so this journey

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.110 
side clear yep my side so this journey
all<00:01:50.890> right<00:01:50.980> now<00:01:51.370> we<00:01:51.430> see<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.760> thousand-foot

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
all right now we see the thousand-foot

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.090 
all right now we see the thousand-foot
marker<00:01:52.300> that<00:01:52.750> right<00:01:52.990> we<00:01:53.380> want<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.800> come<00:01:53.980> in

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
marker that right we want to come in

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.940 
marker that right we want to come in
with<00:01:54.280> it<00:01:54.430> like<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.630> 325<00:01:55.630> degree<00:01:55.660> angle<00:01:56.410> so

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
with it like a 325 degree angle so

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.400 
with it like a 325 degree angle so
what's<00:01:57.460> up<00:01:57.640> slowly<00:01:58.390> bleeding<00:01:58.840> that<00:01:59.050> speech

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
what's up slowly bleeding that speech

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.550 
what's up slowly bleeding that speech
just<00:01:59.800> by<00:01:59.980> bringing<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.580> cyclic<00:02:00.940> back<00:02:01.180> see<00:02:01.900> CSP

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
just by bringing the cyclic back see CSP

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.290 
just by bringing the cyclic back see CSP
coming<00:02:02.860> down<00:02:03.010> we<00:02:03.610> can<00:02:03.730> actually<00:02:03.910> see<00:02:04.180> the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
coming down we can actually see the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.940 
coming down we can actually see the
walking<00:02:04.690> pace<00:02:04.870> on<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.170> ground<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:05.650> crash

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
walking pace on the ground and you crash

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.680 
walking pace on the ground and you crash
the<00:02:06.100> sign<00:02:06.310> now<00:02:06.430> but<00:02:06.610> what<00:02:06.730> you<00:02:06.880> hide<00:02:07.030> so<00:02:07.510> let's

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
the sign now but what you hide so let's

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.080 
the sign now but what you hide so let's
slowly<00:02:08.230> lower<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.679> collective<00:02:09.280> now<00:02:09.820> because

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
slowly lower the collective now because

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.520 
slowly lower the collective now because
the<00:02:10.179> torque<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.540> going<00:02:10.780> away<00:02:10.899> our<00:02:11.170> nose<00:02:11.350> is

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
the torque is going away our nose is

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.010 
the torque is going away our nose is
young<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.800> bit<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.310> right<00:02:12.430> pedal<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:13.030> look

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
young a bit of right pedal and look

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.840 
young a bit of right pedal and look
perfect<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:14.980> see<00:02:15.100> how<00:02:15.190> we're<00:02:15.370> established

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
perfect you see how we're established

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.640 
perfect you see how we're established
level<00:02:16.210> our<00:02:16.510> speed<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:16.840> not<00:02:17.080> going<00:02:17.260> up<00:02:17.440> or<00:02:17.620> down

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
level our speed is not going up or down

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.950 
level our speed is not going up or down
we're<00:02:18.280> going<00:02:18.460> down<00:02:18.550> very<00:02:18.880> smoothly<00:02:19.240> but<00:02:19.780> now

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
we're going down very smoothly but now

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.960 
we're going down very smoothly but now
we're<00:02:20.170> getting<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.440> bit<00:02:20.590> too<00:02:20.740> shallow<00:02:21.070> so<00:02:21.459> who

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
we're getting a bit too shallow so who

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.570 
we're getting a bit too shallow so who
wears<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.420> bit<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.660> collective<00:02:23.370> hit<00:02:24.370> luck

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
wears a bit the collective hit luck

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.270 
wears a bit the collective hit luck
pedal<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:26.230> bit<00:02:26.410> for<00:02:26.620> just<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:26.950> keep<00:02:27.100> our

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
pedal and a bit for just to keep our

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.010 
pedal and a bit for just to keep our
speed<00:02:27.550> perfect<00:02:28.150> look<00:02:28.270> at<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.510> look<00:02:28.900> how

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
speed perfect look at this look how

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.670 
speed perfect look at this look how
beautiful<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.590> is

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
beautiful it is

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.940 
beautiful it is
now<00:02:31.159> our<00:02:32.030> descent<00:02:32.420> rate<00:02:32.599> is<00:02:33.079> still<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.620> bit<00:02:33.799> too

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
now our descent rate is still a bit too

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.099 
now our descent rate is still a bit too
slow<00:02:34.219> getting<00:02:34.700> bit<00:02:34.849> too<00:02:35.060> too<00:02:35.390> steep<00:02:35.629> now<00:02:35.780> so<00:02:35.989> we

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
slow getting bit too too steep now so we

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.289 
slow getting bit too too steep now so we
let<00:02:36.349> me<00:02:36.469> lower<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.709> bit<00:02:36.950> more<00:02:37.159> here<00:02:37.700> we<00:02:37.790> go<00:02:37.939> right

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
let me lower a bit more here we go right

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.740 
let me lower a bit more here we go right
pedal<00:02:38.719> lose<00:02:39.379> your<00:02:39.560> torque<00:02:39.769> now<00:02:40.599> when<00:02:41.599> are<00:02:41.689> we

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
pedal lose your torque now when are we

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.000 
pedal lose your torque now when are we
going<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:41.959> come<00:02:42.109> to<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.349> ground<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.769> we<00:02:42.859> lose

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
going to come to the ground and we lose

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.160 
going to come to the ground and we lose
our<00:02:43.219> speed<00:02:43.549> we're<00:02:44.120> going<00:02:44.329> to<00:02:44.420> start<00:02:44.599> pulling<00:02:44.930> a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
our speed we're going to start pulling a

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.410 
our speed we're going to start pulling a
lot<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.849> collective<00:02:46.849> we're<00:02:47.000> going<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.209> have<00:02:47.389> a

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
lot of collective we're going to have a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.580 
lot of collective we're going to have a
lot<00:02:47.599> of<00:02:47.659> torque<00:02:47.959> so<00:02:48.109> we're<00:02:48.230> going<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.409> have<00:02:48.439> to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
lot of torque so we're going to have to

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.080 
lot of torque so we're going to have to
use<00:02:48.799> that<00:02:48.829> left<00:02:49.159> pedal<00:02:49.489> keep<00:02:49.670> us<00:02:49.819> straight

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
use that left pedal keep us straight

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.170 
use that left pedal keep us straight
okay<00:02:50.750> look<00:02:51.739> at<00:02:51.859> this<00:02:51.920> beautiful<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.609> slow<00:02:52.909> nice

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
okay look at this beautiful so slow nice

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
closer you get to the ground the slower

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.910 
closer you get to the ground the slower
you<00:02:56.480> you're<00:02:56.989> bringing<00:02:57.290> yourself<00:02:57.379> to<00:02:57.709> the

let's raise now when you raise the nose

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.039 
let's raise now when you raise the nose
is<00:03:04.129> coming<00:03:04.430> up<00:03:04.579> so<00:03:04.760> push<00:03:04.939> it<00:03:05.060> forward<00:03:05.269> so<00:03:05.689> we<00:03:05.720> or

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
is coming up so push it forward so we or
