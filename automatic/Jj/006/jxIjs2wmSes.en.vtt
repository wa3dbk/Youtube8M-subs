 would really make me very happy 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.510
 first of all you are going to have to 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.299
 return to your apartment went to 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.949
 side of your bed once this is done 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:57.589
 you will just have to put 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.170
 the mask you want to put on 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.940
 your head with this little tip of 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.589
 hold me so it's the raccoon mask 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.549
 scrubber then once you're at 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.619
 side of the bed you simply 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.240
 go on your phone you go 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.100
 in fast activities and get you started 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.909
 any kind of activities 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.079
 quick 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.310
 then you quickly come out 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.399
 phone and you're going to launch a 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.490
 activity of in the activity lists of 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.259
 simi ol gerald leicester or martin and 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.159
 then you quickly run from 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.469
 right once you have 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.750
 selected these so then you 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.869
 see that your character will stay 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.210
 on the bed a moment so it depends 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.229
 of them people for me it remains a 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.909
 little bit of time so I put this in 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.530
 accelerated and then you will have the 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.149
 mission that will launch so you the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.520
 leave the can ask the fastest 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.630
 possible once stalled leave you 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.609
 go see there will be something what the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.170
 fuck you will be standing on the bed so 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.880
 just now you go now 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.170
 get out of your inventory what is 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.299
 not normally possible when one is 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.710
 on his bed and so we are standing 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.990
 so it's even weirder so we 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.299
 goes into an accessory inventory and we 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.579
 will put the glasses and the hat 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.499
 we want so we had already 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.179
 put the mask on before it's already 

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:04.369
 saved in the outfit but there it is 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.999
 not see so that's it the little one 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.999
 little trick 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.400
 so here I am I put my little 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.400
 hat and my little glasses and 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.319
 then simply to have the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.840
 everything will have to leave the bed in 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.760
 making triangle low for to get out of 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.519
 bed is simply there when we see 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.040
 appear like these you'll have 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.810
 the mask with the hat and the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.190
 glasses so I saw the shot as I have 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.690
 took the raccoon mask the 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.019
 glasses do not see themselves are just 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.489
 behind 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.799
 but do not worry if you 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.090
 take another mask it will work 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.409
 it's just that I wanted to 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.090
 take the raccoon mask because 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.560
 that I think it's pretty stylish 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.510
 plus it makes him take off his ears 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.430
 so it's pretty funny on the head 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.140
 and so here I hope that this little 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.940
 video will have pleased you do not hesitate to
