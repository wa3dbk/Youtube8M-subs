thinking<00:02:23.120> 15<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.810> half<00:02:23.870> inches<00:02:24.140> that's<00:02:24.590> not

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
thinking 15 and a half inches that's not

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.400 
thinking 15 and a half inches that's not
right<00:02:25.130> because<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.730> hive<00:02:25.910> has<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.300> be<00:02:26.420> 16<00:02:27.260> and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
right because the hive has to be 16 and

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.050 
right because the hive has to be 16 and
a<00:02:27.440> quarter<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.860> get<00:02:27.980> 10<00:02:28.220> frames<00:02:28.550> in<00:02:28.790> it

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
a quarter to get 10 frames in it

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.210 
a quarter to get 10 frames in it
that's<00:02:29.540> correct<00:02:29.959> but<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.800> way<00:02:30.920> we're<00:02:31.100> going

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
that's correct but the way we're going

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.160 
that's correct but the way we're going
to<00:02:31.280> put<00:02:31.430> these<00:02:31.610> together<00:02:31.820> when<00:02:32.570> we<00:02:32.750> finish

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
to put these together when we finish

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.030 
to put these together when we finish
they<00:02:34.040> will<00:02:34.400> be<00:02:34.610> 16<00:02:35.120> 1/4<00:02:35.510> inches<00:02:35.780> wide<00:02:36.080> you'll

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
they will be 16 1/4 inches wide you'll

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.800 
they will be 16 1/4 inches wide you'll
notice<00:02:37.430> every<00:02:37.760> one<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:37.970> these<00:02:38.150> boards<00:02:38.450> has<00:02:38.780> a

rabbit I make those with a table saw
you<00:02:45.380> can<00:02:45.530> do<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.769> with<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:45.950> router<00:02:46.250> but<00:02:46.519> the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
you can do it with a router but the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.490 
you can do it with a router but the
table<00:02:46.880> saw<00:02:47.030> was<00:02:47.209> easier<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.840> faster<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.320> more

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
table saw was easier and faster and more

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.710

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.670 
I made it's just a real simple little
jig<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:20.299> see<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.630> clamp<00:04:20.900> marks<00:04:21.109> in<00:04:21.470> it<00:04:21.500> where

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
jig you see the clamp marks in it where

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.930 
jig you see the clamp marks in it where
I<00:04:21.709> just<00:04:21.950> clamp<00:04:22.190> it<00:04:22.310> with<00:04:22.340> a<00:04:22.460> pair<00:04:22.700> of<00:04:22.730> vise

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
I just clamp it with a pair of vise

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.930 
I just clamp it with a pair of vise
grips<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:24.230> super<00:04:24.620> in<00:04:25.190> this<00:04:25.580> particular

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
grips to the super in this particular

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.840 
grips to the super in this particular
case<00:04:26.419> I<00:04:26.660> clamp<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.220> about<00:04:28.220> right<00:04:28.460> here<00:04:28.790> I

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
case I clamp it about right here I

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.180 
case I clamp it about right here I
forget<00:04:29.419> exactly<00:04:29.570> where<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.050> clamp<00:04:30.380> it<00:04:30.560> I'll

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
forget exactly where I clamp it I'll

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.909 
forget exactly where I clamp it I'll
drop<00:04:31.460> my<00:04:31.639> plunge<00:04:31.910> router<00:04:32.210> in<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.570> slot<00:04:32.990> move

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
drop my plunge router in the slot move

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.170

it back and forth and up and down and

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.700 
it back and forth and up and down and
you<00:04:35.450> come<00:04:35.630> out<00:04:35.660> with<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.960> handle<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.500> just

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
you come out with a handle that just

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.290 
you come out with a handle that just
looks<00:04:36.949> perfect<00:04:37.400> like<00:04:37.520> that<00:04:37.760> right<00:04:37.970> there<00:04:38.000> and

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
looks perfect like that right there and

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.510 
looks perfect like that right there and
well<00:04:38.449> not<00:04:38.660> perfect<00:04:39.139> nothing<00:04:39.710> I<00:04:39.949> do<00:04:40.100> is<00:04:40.250> perfect
