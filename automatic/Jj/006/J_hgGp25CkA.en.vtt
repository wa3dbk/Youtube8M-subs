simple<00:00:20.160> question<00:00:20.279> for<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.090> virtual

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
simple question for you the virtual

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.420 
simple question for you the virtual
gravity<00:00:21.779> was<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> most<00:00:22.500> successful<00:00:22.680> bowling

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
gravity was the most successful bowling

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.580 
gravity was the most successful bowling
ball<00:00:23.609> storm<00:00:23.970> has<00:00:24.119> ever<00:00:24.240> made<00:00:24.470> how<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:25.529> you

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
ball storm has ever made how do you

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.740 
ball storm has ever made how do you
improve<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.099> kind<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.460> success<00:00:26.750> well

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
improve on that kind of success well

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.060 
improve on that kind of success well
that's<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.019> tough<00:00:28.199> thing<00:00:28.230> Randy<00:00:28.619> because<00:00:28.949> you

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
that's a tough thing Randy because you

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.429 
that's a tough thing Randy because you
know<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.279> try<00:00:29.550> really<00:00:29.849> hard<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.390> find<00:00:31.320> that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
know we try really hard to find that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.020 
know we try really hard to find that
next<00:00:31.619> level<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.009> performance<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
next level of performance and the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.389 
next level of performance and the
virtual<00:00:33.180> gravity<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.110> by<00:00:34.710> far<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.040> best<00:00:35.309> of

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
virtual gravity is by far the best of

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.280 
virtual gravity is by far the best of
all<00:00:35.489> we've<00:00:35.610> ever<00:00:35.730> made<00:00:36.000> most<00:00:36.510> successful<00:00:37.110> and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
all we've ever made most successful and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.260 
all we've ever made most successful and
so<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.489> take<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> really<00:00:39.000> good<00:00:39.149> look

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
so you have to take a really good look

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.569 
so you have to take a really good look
at<00:00:39.540> design<00:00:40.230> development<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.950> try<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.399> figure

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
at design development and try to figure

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369 
at design development and try to figure
out<00:00:41.700> what<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.719> improve<00:00:43.020> upon<00:00:43.320> that

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
out what can we do to improve upon that

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.020 
out what can we do to improve upon that
so<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.340> know<00:00:44.430> we're<00:00:44.579> not<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> really

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
so we know we're not going to really

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.090 
so we know we're not going to really
want<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.300> improve<00:00:45.450> upon<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.750> core<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
want to improve upon the core so the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.810 
want to improve upon the core so the
next<00:00:47.399> level<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.730> cover<00:00:48.120> stock<00:00:48.500> well<00:00:49.579> it<00:00:50.579> did<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
next level is cover stock well it did a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.790 
next level is cover stock well it did a
lot<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.030> research<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.809> found<00:00:52.020> something<00:00:52.410> very

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
lot of research we found something very

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.130 
lot of research we found something very
very<00:00:53.010> special<00:00:53.629> brought<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> market

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
very special brought it to the market

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.750 
very special brought it to the market
now<00:00:55.949> we're<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> call<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.430> virtual

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
now we're going to call it virtual

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700 
now we're going to call it virtual

gravity nano take that same great core
that<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:58.949> used<00:00:59.420> and<00:01:00.420> put<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.629> new<00:01:00.660> cover<00:01:01.020> stock

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that we used and put a new cover stock

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.319 
that we used and put a new cover stock
on<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> whole<00:01:01.770> new<00:01:01.890> base<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.789> special

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
on a whole new base and a special

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.329 
on a whole new base and a special

very very unique virtual gravity nano I

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:17.580 
very very unique virtual gravity nano I
got<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.450> know<00:01:09.540> more<00:01:09.720> about<00:01:09.840> this

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.330 

biggest<00:01:18.590> thing<00:01:18.710> about<00:01:18.859> a<00:01:18.920> virtual<00:01:19.219> gravity

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
biggest thing about a virtual gravity

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.399 
biggest thing about a virtual gravity
nano<00:01:19.759> is<00:01:19.969> it<00:01:20.090> something<00:01:20.359> quite<00:01:20.719> unique<00:01:20.750> first

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
nano is it something quite unique first

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.709 
nano is it something quite unique first
of<00:01:21.530> all<00:01:21.619> it's<00:01:22.219> a<00:01:22.340> very<00:01:22.549> new<00:01:22.700> base<00:01:22.969> reactive

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
of all it's a very new base reactive

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:24.940 
of all it's a very new base reactive
material<00:01:23.990> something<00:01:24.439> that's<00:01:24.619> never<00:01:24.740> been

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
material something that's never been

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.130 
material something that's never been
seen<00:01:25.219> in<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.429> marketplace<00:01:25.909> before<00:01:26.140> something

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
seen in the marketplace before something

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.139 
seen in the marketplace before something
that<00:01:27.409> that<00:01:27.710> chemistry<00:01:28.219> a<00:01:28.520> very<00:01:29.000> new

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
that that chemistry a very new

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.910 
that that chemistry a very new
isocyanate<00:01:29.810> chemistry<00:01:30.319> something<00:01:30.649> that<00:01:30.799> is

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
isocyanate chemistry something that is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.609 
isocyanate chemistry something that is
very<00:01:31.130> very<00:01:31.640> special<00:01:32.210> but<00:01:32.719> we<00:01:32.810> found<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:33.110> special

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
very very special but we found a special

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.559 
very very special but we found a special
additive<00:01:34.100> something<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:34.819> creates<00:01:35.149> a<00:01:35.329> little

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
additive something that creates a little

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.870 
additive something that creates a little
more<00:01:35.689> sub<00:01:35.929> surface<00:01:36.289> texture<00:01:36.799> something<00:01:37.759> that

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
more sub surface texture something that

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.690 
more sub surface texture something that
gives<00:01:38.030> us<00:01:38.500> durability<00:01:39.500> longevity<00:01:39.950> something

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
gives us durability longevity something

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.609 
gives us durability longevity something
we've<00:01:40.880> never<00:01:41.479> seen<00:01:41.630> before<00:01:41.869> in<00:01:42.289> the<00:01:42.380> bowling

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
we've never seen before in the bowling

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.440 
we've never seen before in the bowling
industrial<00:01:43.039> we<00:01:43.429> feel<00:01:43.670> it's<00:01:43.850> like<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.179> next

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
industrial we feel it's like the next

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.870 
industrial we feel it's like the next
generation<00:01:45.110> we<00:01:45.709> saw<00:01:45.890> you<00:01:46.250> know<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.489> angle<00:01:46.640> of

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
generation we saw you know the angle of

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.240 
generation we saw you know the angle of
the<00:01:47.030> 1980s<00:01:47.539> be<00:01:48.289> the<00:01:48.439> first<00:01:48.649> thing<00:01:48.860> in<00:01:48.979> urethane

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
the 1980s be the first thing in urethane

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.880 
the 1980s be the first thing in urethane
and<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:49.789> set<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:50.450> bowling<00:01:50.869> industry<00:01:51.289> on<00:01:51.829> its

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
and and set the bowling industry on its

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.889 
and and set the bowling industry on its
knees<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.610> then<00:01:52.700> all<00:01:52.819> of<00:01:52.849> a<00:01:52.939> sudden<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:53.299> 91<00:01:53.720> we

saw<00:01:54.079> an<00:01:54.170> Excalibur<00:01:54.770> come<00:01:55.009> out<00:01:55.189> and<00:01:55.429> it<00:01:56.149> mark

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
saw an Excalibur come out and it mark

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.539 
saw an Excalibur come out and it mark
McDowell<00:01:57.049> makes<00:01:57.319> the<00:01:57.500> shot<00:01:57.679> peel<00:01:57.950> off<00:01:58.130> you

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
McDowell makes the shot peel off you

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.339 
McDowell makes the shot peel off you
know<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.819> tube<00:01:59.000> or<00:01:59.209> down<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.569> lane<00:01:59.750> and<00:01:59.780> go

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
know the tube or down the lane and go

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:01.809 
know the tube or down the lane and go
high<00:02:00.500> flush<00:02:00.829> and<00:02:00.979> everybody<00:02:01.310> went<00:02:01.429> what<00:02:01.729> in

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
high flush and everybody went what in

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.819 
high flush and everybody went what in
the<00:02:01.880> world<00:02:02.030> is<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.209> and<00:02:02.659> we<00:02:03.380> feel<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.619> the

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
the world is that and we feel that the

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.499 
the world is that and we feel that the
virtual<00:02:04.099> gravity<00:02:04.220> nano<00:02:04.670> is<00:02:04.819> really<00:02:05.360> really

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
virtual gravity nano is really really

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.169 
virtual gravity nano is really really
that<00:02:06.409> next<00:02:06.770> step<00:02:06.890> something<00:02:07.849> that's<00:02:08.000> going<00:02:08.119> to

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
that next step something that's going to

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:19.460 
that next step something that's going to
make<00:02:08.329> the<00:02:08.780> bowling<00:02:09.170> world<00:02:09.259> go<00:02:09.560> wow

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.600 

so<00:02:20.470> Hank<00:02:20.709> for<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:20.950> average<00:02:21.099> League<00:02:21.459> bowlers

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
so Hank for the average League bowlers

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.640 
so Hank for the average League bowlers
out<00:02:21.970> there<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.599> have<00:02:22.690> had<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.870> lot<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.170> success

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
out there that have had a lot of success

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.670 
out there that have had a lot of success
with<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.920> virtual<00:02:24.160> gravity<00:02:24.989> what<00:02:25.989> are<00:02:26.200> some<00:02:26.260> of

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
with a virtual gravity what are some of

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.140 
with a virtual gravity what are some of
the<00:02:26.770> differences<00:02:27.190> are<00:02:27.489> going<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.849> see<00:02:28.000> with

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
the differences are going to see with

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.180 
the differences are going to see with
the<00:02:28.239> new<00:02:28.390> virtual<00:02:28.690> gravity<00:02:29.050> nano<00:02:29.500> biggest

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
the new virtual gravity nano biggest

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.140 
the new virtual gravity nano biggest
thing<00:02:30.280> they're<00:02:30.400> going<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.580> see<00:02:30.700> on<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.940> Nano

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
thing they're going to see on the Nano

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.339 
thing they're going to see on the Nano
is<00:02:31.390> something<00:02:31.720> that's<00:02:31.870> going<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.080> give<00:02:32.200> them

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
is something that's going to give them

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.680 
is something that's going to give them
that<00:02:32.830> same<00:02:33.160> type<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.430> motion<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.239> core<00:02:34.480> motion

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
that same type of motion the core motion

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.960 
that same type of motion the core motion
but<00:02:35.080> all<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.440> sudden<00:02:35.800> down<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.790> lane

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
but all of a sudden down the lane

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.920 
but all of a sudden down the lane
they're<00:02:37.150> going<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.330> see<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> little<00:02:37.660> bit<00:02:37.750> more

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
they're going to see a little bit more

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.270 
they're going to see a little bit more
motion<00:02:38.319> a<00:02:38.350> little<00:02:38.500> bit<00:02:38.590> more<00:02:38.680> off<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.010> spot

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
motion a little bit more off the spot

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.949 
motion a little bit more off the spot
something<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.000> kind<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.239> peels<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.630> pattern

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
something that kind of peels the pattern

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.840 
something that kind of peels the pattern
apart<00:02:41.319> and<00:02:41.530> really<00:02:42.040> gives<00:02:42.220> them<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.489> lot<00:02:42.700> more

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
apart and really gives them a lot more

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.390 
apart and really gives them a lot more
angle<00:02:43.360> down<00:02:43.780> laying<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.650> even<00:02:44.890> as<00:02:44.980> they<00:02:45.130> move

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
angle down laying and even as they move

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.790 
angle down laying and even as they move
and<00:02:45.670> they<00:02:45.760> keep<00:02:45.940> moving<00:02:46.660> left<00:02:46.900> or<00:02:47.200> if<00:02:47.590> you're

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
and they keep moving left or if you're

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.979 
and they keep moving left or if you're
left-hander<00:02:48.519> moving<00:02:48.760> right<00:02:48.910> ball<00:02:49.630> just<00:02:49.840> keeps

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
left-hander moving right ball just keeps

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.120 
left-hander moving right ball just keeps
coming<00:02:50.319> back<00:02:50.350> where<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.769> virtual<00:02:51.040> gravity

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
coming back where the virtual gravity

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.040 
coming back where the virtual gravity
might<00:02:51.430> slow<00:02:51.670> down<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.880> little<00:02:52.150> bit<00:02:52.330> boy<00:02:52.870> this

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
might slow down a little bit boy this

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.449 
might slow down a little bit boy this
one<00:02:53.230> just<00:02:53.319> keeps<00:02:53.560> coming<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.040> subsurface

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
one just keeps coming that subsurface

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.560 
one just keeps coming that subsurface
profile<00:02:55.060> Wow<00:02:55.720> something<00:02:56.200> different
