still taking the piece of just

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.240 
still taking the piece of just
because<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.569> really<00:02:42.599> gets<00:02:43.049> about<00:02:43.349> 4<00:02:43.680> miles<00:02:43.980> a

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
the radio it's 32 right now and I don't

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.800 
the radio it's 32 right now and I don't
know<00:03:33.220> 8:30<00:03:33.760> in<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.000> morning<00:03:34.060> something<00:03:34.720> like

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
know 8:30 in the morning something like

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.229 
know 8:30 in the morning something like
not<00:03:35.019> even<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.379> 30<00:03:35.650> something<00:03:36.639> like<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.970> so

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
not even a 30 something like that so

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.780 
not even a 30 something like that so
it's<00:03:37.420> pretty<00:03:37.480> cold<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:40.349> it<00:03:41.349> it<00:03:42.280> was<00:03:42.430> unhappy

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
it's pretty cold and it it was unhappy

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.740 
it's pretty cold and it it was unhappy
but<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.810> still<00:03:44.049> actually<00:03:44.260> started<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.599> it<00:03:46.599> is

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
but it still actually started and it is

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.899 
but it still actually started and it is
running<00:03:47.139> now<00:03:47.260> now<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:47.590> runs<00:03:47.769> real<00:03:48.220> real<00:03:48.609> rough

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
running now now it runs real real rough

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.430 
running now now it runs real real rough
when<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:49.180> started<00:03:49.659> because<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:50.079> that

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
when you started because of that

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.240 
when you started because of that
ignition<00:03:51.069> module<00:03:51.579> and<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:53.200> did<00:03:53.680> find<00:03:53.950> that<00:03:54.099> if

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
ignition module and I did find that if

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.180 
ignition module and I did find that if
you<00:03:54.430> try<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.030> rev<00:03:55.299> it<00:03:55.450> ever<00:03:55.720> so<00:03:56.019> slightly<00:03:56.379> it

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
you try to rev it ever so slightly it

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.800 
you try to rev it ever so slightly it
will<00:03:57.340> help<00:03:57.519> keep<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:57.909> running<00:03:58.299> that's<00:03:58.659> why

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
will help keep it running that's why

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.740 
will help keep it running that's why
it's<00:03:59.019> told<00:03:59.379> with<00:03:59.680> an<00:03:59.799> abrupt<00:04:00.190> like<00:04:00.750> clunk

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
it's told with an abrupt like clunk

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.420 
it's told with an abrupt like clunk
which<00:04:02.019> is<00:04:02.199> probably<00:04:02.590> due<00:04:02.769> to<00:04:02.919> no<00:04:03.069> engine

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
which is probably due to no engine

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.530 
which is probably due to no engine
mounts<00:04:03.730> and<00:04:04.680> anyway<00:04:05.680> that<00:04:05.709> was<00:04:06.010> that<00:04:06.220> so

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
mounts and anyway that was that so

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.509 
mounts and anyway that was that so
I<00:04:08.659> took<00:04:09.409> care<00:04:09.709> of<00:04:09.769> that<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.129> after<00:04:10.250> it

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
I took care of that and after it

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.089 
I took care of that and after it
actually<00:04:10.819> did<00:04:11.060> fire<00:04:11.329> the<00:04:11.659> computer<00:04:12.650> said<00:04:12.890> oh

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
actually did fire the computer said oh

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.180 
actually did fire the computer said oh
we<00:04:13.609> got<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:13.819> serious<00:04:14.540> malfunction<00:04:14.810> here<00:04:15.620> throat

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
we got a serious malfunction here throat

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.699 
we got a serious malfunction here throat
a<00:04:16.220> check<00:04:16.549> engine<00:04:16.759> light<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.870> threw<00:04:18.109> it<00:04:18.289> and

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
a check engine light so it threw it and

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.949 
a check engine light so it threw it and
I<00:04:18.979> said<00:04:19.250> oh<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.030> gotta<00:04:20.299> get<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:20.570> camera

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
I said oh I gotta get the camera

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.900 
I said oh I gotta get the camera

much<00:04:37.520> battery<00:04:37.880> power<00:04:37.970> we're<00:04:38.330> just<00:04:38.479> going<00:04:38.690> to

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
much battery power we're just going to

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.110 
much battery power we're just going to
work<00:04:38.960> now<00:04:39.789> probably<00:04:40.789> going<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:40.970> be<00:04:41.090> a

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
work now probably going to be a

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.749 
work now probably going to be a
relatively<00:04:42.050> slow<00:04:42.440> day<00:04:42.770> probably<00:04:43.430> got<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.550> bunch

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
relatively slow day probably got a bunch

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.159 
relatively slow day probably got a bunch
of<00:04:43.849> parts<00:04:44.060> coming<00:04:44.479> in<00:04:44.599> to<00:04:44.690> put<00:04:44.870> in<00:04:45.020> and<00:04:47.169> see

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
of parts coming in to put in and see

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.310 
of parts coming in to put in and see
what<00:04:48.349> else<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:50.210> boss<00:04:50.449> is<00:04:50.690> supposed<00:04:50.960> to<00:04:50.990> be<00:04:51.139> off

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
what else the boss is supposed to be off

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.129 
what else the boss is supposed to be off
today<00:04:51.560> so<00:04:51.710> hopefully<00:04:52.840> that<00:04:53.840> was<00:04:53.960> the

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
today so hopefully that was the

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.620 
today so hopefully that was the
unintended<00:04:54.289> overdrive<00:04:55.220> by<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.490> way<00:04:55.669> so

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
unintended overdrive by the way so

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.029 
unintended overdrive by the way so
anyway<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.139> was<00:04:57.259> supposed<00:04:57.620> to<00:04:57.680> be<00:04:57.830> off<00:04:58.009> today

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
anyway that was supposed to be off today

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.089 
anyway that was supposed to be off today
but<00:04:58.580> we'll<00:04:58.669> see<00:04:58.820> how<00:04:58.849> that<00:04:59.000> works<00:04:59.330> and<00:05:00.099> I

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
but we'll see how that works and I

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.620 
but we'll see how that works and I
probably<00:05:01.520> will<00:05:01.759> not<00:05:01.910> have<00:05:02.120> enough<00:05:02.330> power<00:05:02.479> to

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
probably will not have enough power to

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.450 
probably will not have enough power to
do<00:05:02.870> a<00:05:02.900> video<00:05:03.139> on<00:05:03.259> the<00:05:03.440> way<00:05:03.560> home<00:05:03.800> so<00:05:03.830> I<00:05:04.160> begged

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
do a video on the way home so I begged

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.480 
do a video on the way home so I begged
my<00:05:04.610> part<00:05:04.880> okay<00:05:05.530> another<00:05:06.530> day<00:05:06.770> done<00:05:06.979> you<00:05:07.250> can't

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
my part okay another day done you can't

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.550 
my part okay another day done you can't
see<00:05:07.669> anything<00:05:07.910> but<00:05:08.120> it<00:05:08.690> is<00:05:08.720> there<00:05:09.199> for<00:05:09.470> what

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
see anything but it is there for what

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.560 
see anything but it is there for what
it's<00:05:09.710> worth<00:05:09.770> let's<00:05:10.250> see<00:05:10.400> how<00:05:10.490> it<00:05:10.639> starts<00:05:11.060> if<00:05:11.360> it
