00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
this project I've always wanted to build

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.980 
this project I've always wanted to build
the<00:01:38.400> guitar<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.450> seems<00:01:39.750> so

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the guitar but it just seems so

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.210 
the guitar but it just seems so
complicated<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:41.280> out<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.820> reach<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:43.070> using<00:01:44.070> a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
complicated and out of reach but using a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.030 
complicated and out of reach but using a
two-by-four<00:01:45.170> really<00:01:46.170> forced<00:01:46.470> me<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.799> just

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
two-by-four really forced me to just

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.520 
two-by-four really forced me to just
strip<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.399> down<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> basics<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.350> I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
strip it down to just the basics that I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.069 
strip it down to just the basics that I
needed<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.159> make<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.520> guitar<00:01:50.880> work<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.540> I

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
needed to make the guitar work and I

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.499 
needed to make the guitar work and I
think<00:01:52.320> that's<00:01:52.560> what<00:01:52.829> made<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.490> video<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
think that's what made the video and the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.280 
think that's what made the video and the
projects<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.320> much<00:01:55.530> fun<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.750> actually<00:01:57.750> pretty
