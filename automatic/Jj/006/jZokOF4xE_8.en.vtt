00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
are obviously twisted and I decided to

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.940 
are obviously twisted and I decided to
put<00:01:38.369> reflectors<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.869> there's<00:01:40.439> not<00:01:40.740> as

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
put reflectors on because there's not as

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.740 
put reflectors on because there's not as
much<00:01:41.130> grip<00:01:41.430> left<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.150> putting<00:01:42.299> these<00:01:42.509> long

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
much grip left and putting these long

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.510 
much grip left and putting these long
put<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> little<00:01:43.170> extension<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> pedals<00:01:44.250> so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
put a little extension on the pedals so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.920 
put a little extension on the pedals so
it<00:01:44.729> kind<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.030> helps<00:01:45.829> yeah<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.600> then<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> back

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
