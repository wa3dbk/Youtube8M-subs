00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
that I've kind of chosen to use that

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.800 
that I've kind of chosen to use that
they<00:00:23.010> kind<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.250> go<00:00:23.369> along<00:00:23.490> with<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.029> without

they kind of go along with it so without

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.970 
they kind of go along with it so without
further<00:00:24.990> ado<00:00:25.350> let's<00:00:25.560> go<00:00:25.650> ahead<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.920> get

try and keep this a little bit more

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.319 
try and keep this a little bit more
consolidated<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.759> we're<00:00:32.850> gonna<00:00:32.940> start<00:00:33.210> out

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
consolidated and we're gonna start out

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.490 
consolidated and we're gonna start out
with<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.630> that's<00:00:33.780> gonna<00:00:33.960> be<00:00:34.170> called<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
with one that's gonna be called the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.190 
with one that's gonna be called the
ambush<00:00:35.100> setup<00:00:35.610> now<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.300> hadn't<00:00:36.630> used<00:00:36.750> coyotes

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
ambush setup now I hadn't used coyotes

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.780 
ambush setup now I hadn't used coyotes
for<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> while<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> decided<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.370> use<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.700> a

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
for a while so I decided to use them a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.310 
for a while so I decided to use them a
bit<00:00:38.969> lately<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.020> where<00:00:40.170> we're<00:00:40.260> gonna

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
bit lately and this is where we're gonna

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.860 
bit lately and this is where we're gonna
start<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> Coyotes<00:00:41.489> now<00:00:42.059> coyotes<00:00:42.750> are

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
start with the Coyotes now coyotes are

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.240 
start with the Coyotes now coyotes are
kind<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.170> unique<00:00:43.469> creature<00:00:43.710> because<00:00:44.100> it

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
kind of a unique creature because it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.010 
kind of a unique creature because it
long<00:00:44.430> ranges<00:00:45.030> they're<00:00:45.180> only<00:00:45.420> moderately

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
long ranges they're only moderately

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.540 
long ranges they're only moderately
effective<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.770> that's<00:00:46.980> really<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.460> be

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
effective and that's really going to be

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.369 
effective and that's really going to be
determined<00:00:48.059> by<00:00:48.180> how<00:00:48.480> well<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:48.930> lead<00:00:49.170> your

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
determined by how well you can lead your

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.650 
determined by how well you can lead your
targets<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.010> how<00:00:50.160> erratically<00:00:50.789> your<00:00:51.090> target

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
targets and how erratically your target

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.810 
targets and how erratically your target
is<00:00:51.780> flying<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.980> when<00:00:53.250> you're<00:00:53.370> flying<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.789> close

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
is flying so when you're flying in close

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.760 
is flying so when you're flying in close
proximity<00:00:54.239> though<00:00:54.809> they're<00:00:55.020> great<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
proximity though they're great in the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.560 
proximity though they're great in the
ability<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.250> fire<00:00:56.489> switch<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.850> your<00:00:57.090> nose<00:00:57.329> gun

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
ability to fire switch to your nose gun

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.209 
ability to fire switch to your nose gun
and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:57.930> come<00:00:58.140> back<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:58.559> Yotes<00:00:58.829> after

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
and then come back to your Yotes after

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.889 
and then come back to your Yotes after
you've<00:00:59.340> exhausted<00:00:59.460> your<00:00:59.940> nose<00:01:00.270> gun<00:01:00.570> well

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
you've exhausted your nose gun well

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.479 
you've exhausted your nose gun well
really<00:01:01.260> makes<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.680> time<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.980> kill<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.340> them

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
really makes the time to kill on them

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.240 
really makes the time to kill on them
really<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:02.879> fast<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.290> based<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.070> my

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
really really fast so based on this my

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.010 
really really fast so based on this my

the reload speed in the ammo upgrades
like<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.710> would<00:01:19.830> expect<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.119> scope<00:01:21.420> is

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
like you would expect now the scope is

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.330 
like you would expect now the scope is
really<00:01:21.930> gonna<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.259> totally<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
really gonna be totally up to you

really gonna be totally up to you
you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.700> go<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> thermal<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.780> spot

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
you can go with the thermal to spot

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.300 
you can go with the thermal to spot
targets<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.500> ground<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.189> is

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
targets on the ground because it is

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.679 
targets on the ground because it is
going<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.790> damage<00:01:26.970> against<00:01:27.450> ground

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
going to do damage against ground

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.390 
going to do damage against ground
targets<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.200> dump<00:01:28.380> fire<00:01:28.590> mode<00:01:28.799> however

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
targets and dump fire mode however

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.190 
targets and dump fire mode however
that's<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> play<00:01:30.750> style<00:01:30.990> that

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that's not really the play style that

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.440 
that's not really the play style that
we're<00:01:31.320> working<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.820> actually

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
we're working on with this so I actually

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.240 
we're working on with this so I actually
didn't<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.229> spend<00:01:34.439> any<00:01:34.530> certs<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.100> no

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
didn't really spend any certs on no

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.630 
didn't really spend any certs on no
notic

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
notic

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.039 
notic
I<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.970> didn't<00:01:36.180> really<00:01:36.390> see<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> point<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.020> I

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
I just didn't really see a point so I

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.600 
I just didn't really see a point so I
don't<00:01:37.259> use<00:01:37.439> them<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.860> guess<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.310> could<00:01:38.579> use

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
don't use them but I guess you could use

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.960 
don't use them but I guess you could use
zoom<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.780> could<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.079> an<00:01:40.200> acceptable

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
zoom and that could be an acceptable

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.249 
zoom and that could be an acceptable
alternative<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.180> cheap<00:01:42.360> at<00:01:42.600> longer<00:01:42.810> ranges

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
alternative for cheap at longer ranges

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.560 
alternative for cheap at longer ranges
to<00:01:43.409> see<00:01:43.560> how<00:01:43.710> far<00:01:43.950> off<00:01:44.009> your<00:01:44.310> shots<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.759> it's

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
to see how far off your shots are it's

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.300 
to see how far off your shots are it's
all<00:01:45.720> really<00:01:45.899> going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.409> preference<00:01:47.040> but

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
all really going to be preference but

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.740 
all really going to be preference but
you<00:01:47.490> know<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.759> nothing<00:01:47.939> there<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.390> really

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
you know that nothing there is really

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.080 
you know that nothing there is really
required<00:01:49.310> now<00:01:50.310> you're<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.729> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> be

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
required now you're not going to be

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.460 
required now you're not going to be
using<00:01:51.390> afterburners<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.170> you're<00:01:52.290> less

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
using afterburners so you're less

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.440 
using afterburners so you're less
maneuverable<00:01:53.220> overall<00:01:53.700> against<00:01:54.060> someone

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
maneuverable overall against someone

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.569 
maneuverable overall against someone
with<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.840> external<00:01:55.259> tanks<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> prefer<00:01:56.460> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
with the external tanks so I prefer to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.340 
with the external tanks so I prefer to
get<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.820> jump<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.270> someone<00:01:57.689> instead<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.110> going

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
get to jump on someone instead of going

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.889 
get to jump on someone instead of going
straight<00:01:58.619> up<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.100> dogfight<00:01:59.369> now<00:02:00.270> because<00:02:00.750> of

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
straight up in a dogfight now because of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.780 
straight up in a dogfight now because of
this<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.290> defensive<00:02:01.829> slot<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.250> recommend

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
this the defensive slot that I recommend

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.030 
this the defensive slot that I recommend
is<00:02:02.939> stealth<00:02:03.320> this<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.439> going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.710> help<00:02:04.829> keep

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
is stealth this is going to help keep

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.499 
is stealth this is going to help keep
you<00:02:05.219> off<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.520> mini-map<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.000> allow<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.390> to

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
you off the mini-map and allow you to

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.910 
you off the mini-map and allow you to
get<00:02:06.719> up<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:07.020> your<00:02:07.049> target<00:02:07.469> without<00:02:07.590> them

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
get up on your target without them

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.070 
get up on your target without them
knowing<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.340> you're<00:02:08.489> actually<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:09.090> but

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
knowing that you're actually there but

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.540 
knowing that you're actually there but
the<00:02:10.200> super<00:02:10.530> fast<00:02:10.739> time<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.129> kill<00:02:11.340> being

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
the super fast time to kill being

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.520 
the super fast time to kill being
effective<00:02:12.000> at<00:02:12.120> closer<00:02:12.360> ranges<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.020> pieces<00:02:13.379> at

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
effective at closer ranges the pieces at

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.760 
effective at closer ranges the pieces at
that

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.320 
that
peace<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.100> actually<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.880> really<00:02:15.090> crucial

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
peace is actually really really crucial

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.780 
peace is actually really really crucial
so<00:02:16.170> get<00:02:16.410> close<00:02:16.590> without<00:02:16.860> being<00:02:17.310> noticed<00:02:17.670> is

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
so get close without being noticed is

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.970 
so get close without being noticed is
the<00:02:17.910> goal<00:02:18.170> now<00:02:19.170> you're<00:02:19.470> gonna<00:02:19.590> want<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.860> get

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the goal now you're gonna want to get

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.260 
the goal now you're gonna want to get
close<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.190> your<00:02:20.430> target<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:20.880> external

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
close to your target so external

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.060 
close to your target so external
afterburner<00:02:21.900> tanks<00:02:22.320> would<00:02:22.530> be<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.740> great

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
afterburner tanks would be a great

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.950 
afterburner tanks would be a great
alternative<00:02:23.190> but<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.150> coyotes<00:02:24.360> instead

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
alternative but you have coyotes instead

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.260 
alternative but you have coyotes instead
so<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.890> make<00:02:26.130> up<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.460> then<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.820> will<00:02:27.000> use<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
so to make up for then I will use the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.840 
so to make up for then I will use the
razor<00:02:27.840> airframe<00:02:28.290> now<00:02:28.980> with<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> recent<00:02:29.490> buff

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
razor airframe now with the recent buff

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.150 
razor airframe now with the recent buff
to<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.060> razor<00:02:30.690> frame<00:02:31.020> you're<00:02:31.530> much<00:02:31.680> faster

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
to the razor frame you're much faster

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.680 
to the razor frame you're much faster
and<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.490> close<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.880> gap<00:02:32.910> without<00:02:33.420> having

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
and you can close the gap without having

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.230 
and you can close the gap without having
to<00:02:33.810> use<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.020> external<00:02:34.620> tanks<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:36.120> then

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
to use the external tanks and then

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.640 
to use the external tanks and then
finally<00:02:36.600> when<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.750> comes<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.200> utility

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
finally when it comes to the utility

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.650 
finally when it comes to the utility
spot<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.130> recommend<00:02:38.580> using<00:02:38.730> fire<00:02:39.060> suppressions

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
spot I recommend using fire suppressions

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.600 
spot I recommend using fire suppressions
for<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> few<00:02:40.110> reasons

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
for a few reasons

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.890 
for a few reasons
one<00:02:41.610> is<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.850> you're<00:02:42.000> using<00:02:42.180> stealth<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:42.840> it

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
one is that you're using stealth so it

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.540 
one is that you're using stealth so it
takes<00:02:43.110> longer<00:02:43.320> for<00:02:43.500> lock-ons<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.250> actually

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
takes longer for lock-ons to actually

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.880 
takes longer for lock-ons to actually
acquire<00:02:45.330> their<00:02:45.570> locks<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.590> can<00:02:46.710> feel

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
acquire their locks so you can feel

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.970 
acquire their locks so you can feel
relatively<00:02:47.430> safe<00:02:47.670> without<00:02:48.210> using<00:02:48.600> flares<00:02:48.980> if

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
relatively safe without using flares if

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.740 
relatively safe without using flares if
you<00:02:50.130> do<00:02:50.310> get<00:02:50.490> hit<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.910> can<00:02:51.060> repair<00:02:51.330> yourself

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
you do get hit you can repair yourself

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.630 
you do get hit you can repair yourself
which<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.080> fairly<00:02:52.350> new<00:02:52.530> change<00:02:52.890> I'm<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.550> by

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
which is a fairly new change I'm just by

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.340 
which is a fairly new change I'm just by
activating<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.270> fire<00:02:54.450> suppression<00:02:55.020> thus

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
activating the fire suppression thus

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.200 
activating the fire suppression thus
making<00:02:55.590> up<00:02:55.830> for<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.280> loss<00:02:56.490> of<00:02:56.640> nanite<00:02:57.000> auto

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
making up for the loss of nanite auto

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.690 
making up for the loss of nanite auto
repair<00:02:57.600> what<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.840> gave<00:02:58.050> up<00:02:58.230> for<00:02:58.260> stealth<00:02:58.700> and

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
repair what you gave up for stealth and

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.340 
repair what you gave up for stealth and
then<00:02:59.880> finally<00:03:00.180> by<00:03:00.360> using<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.750> racer<00:03:01.080> frame

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
then finally by using the racer frame

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.320 
then finally by using the racer frame
you're<00:03:01.590> likely<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.160> take<00:03:02.430> more<00:03:02.670> damage<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.240> a

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
you're likely to take more damage in a

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.610 
you're likely to take more damage in a
dogfight<00:03:03.600> than<00:03:04.020> you<00:03:04.140> would<00:03:04.290> use<00:03:04.470> in<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
dogfight than you would use in the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.260 
dogfight than you would use in the
dogfight<00:03:05.160> or<00:03:05.310> hover<00:03:05.490> frames<00:03:05.850> because<00:03:06.060> you

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
dogfight or hover frames because you

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.060 
dogfight or hover frames because you
lose<00:03:06.450> out<00:03:06.570> on<00:03:06.630> some<00:03:06.860> maneuverability<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:07.950> the

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
lose out on some maneuverability and the

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.100 
lose out on some maneuverability and the
air<00:03:08.220> break<00:03:08.520> so<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.210> fire<00:03:09.390> suppression<00:03:09.630> can

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
air break so the fire suppression can

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.630 
air break so the fire suppression can
keep<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.380> alive<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.680> little<00:03:10.890> bit<00:03:11.160> longer<00:03:11.400> to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
keep you alive a little bit longer to

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.670 
keep you alive a little bit longer to
make<00:03:11.670> up<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.030> difference<00:03:12.180> there<00:03:12.600> so<00:03:13.380> that's

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
make up the difference there so that's

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.620 
make up the difference there so that's
gonna<00:03:13.800> be<00:03:14.010> your<00:03:14.100> basic<00:03:14.520> loadout<00:03:14.910> you're<00:03:15.300> fast

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
gonna be your basic loadout you're fast

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.510 
gonna be your basic loadout you're fast
you're<00:03:15.990> sneaky<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.710> you're<00:03:16.980> designed<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.370> get

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
you're sneaky and you're designed to get

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.610 
you're sneaky and you're designed to get
the<00:03:17.640> jump<00:03:17.910> on<00:03:18.030> your<00:03:18.180> opponents<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:19.020> with<00:03:19.410> that

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
the jump on your opponents so with that

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.440 
the jump on your opponents so with that
in<00:03:19.770> mind<00:03:19.980> there's<00:03:20.310> two<00:03:20.490> primary<00:03:21.000> ways<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.240> I

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
in mind there's two primary ways that I

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.750 
in mind there's two primary ways that I
like<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.690> use<00:03:22.020> this<00:03:22.230> loadout<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:23.340> first<00:03:23.580> of

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
like to use this loadout the first of

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.280 
like to use this loadout the first of
which<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.120> fly<00:03:24.390> really<00:03:24.660> high<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.230> to

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
which is to fly really high and to

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.020 
which is to fly really high and to
monitor<00:03:25.530> below<00:03:26.100> for<00:03:26.370> those<00:03:26.490> targets<00:03:26.940> that

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
monitor below for those targets that

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.820 
monitor below for those targets that
you're<00:03:27.180> going<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.420> be<00:03:27.570> coming<00:03:27.810> in<00:03:28.110> on<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.800> know

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
you're going to be coming in on you know

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.050 
you're going to be coming in on you know
they<00:03:28.980> hopefully<00:03:29.190> come<00:03:29.520> in<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.700> little<00:03:29.970> bit

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
they hopefully come in a little bit

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.820 
they hopefully come in a little bit
lower<00:03:30.209> not<00:03:30.420> too<00:03:30.870> many<00:03:31.050> people<00:03:31.260> fly<00:03:31.620> at<00:03:31.740> the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
lower not too many people fly at the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.890 
lower not too many people fly at the
flight<00:03:32.070> ceiling<00:03:32.459> you're<00:03:33.180> then<00:03:33.390> gonna<00:03:33.510> swoop

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
flight ceiling you're then gonna swoop

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.990 
flight ceiling you're then gonna swoop
down<00:03:33.930> get<00:03:34.650> behind<00:03:34.800> your<00:03:35.130> target<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.670> unleash

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
down get behind your target and unleash

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.970 
down get behind your target and unleash
all<00:03:36.180> six<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.570> your<00:03:36.720> rockets<00:03:37.050> then<00:03:37.709> switch<00:03:37.950> to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
all six of your rockets then switch to

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.800 
all six of your rockets then switch to
your<00:03:38.160> rotary<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.760> empty<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.120> clip<00:03:39.270> then

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
your rotary and empty the clip then

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.570 
your rotary and empty the clip then
switch<00:03:40.080> back<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.590> Coyotes<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.220> basically

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
switch back to the Coyotes and basically

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.250 
switch back to the Coyotes and basically
just<00:03:41.850> rinse<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.270> repeat<00:03:42.570> until<00:03:42.750> they're<00:03:43.020> dead

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
just rinse and repeat until they're dead

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.180 
just rinse and repeat until they're dead
now<00:03:43.880> remember<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.180> try<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.780> engage<00:03:46.190> your

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
now remember to try and engage your

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.949 
now remember to try and engage your
target<00:03:47.640> as<00:03:47.760> close<00:03:47.940> as<00:03:48.120> possible<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.630> sometimes

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
target as close as possible so sometimes

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.150 
target as close as possible so sometimes
you're<00:03:49.050> gonna<00:03:49.140> have<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.530> wait<00:03:49.740> and<00:03:49.920> really

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
you're gonna have to wait and really

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.040 
you're gonna have to wait and really
close<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.580> gap<00:03:50.820> but<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:51.720> want<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.900> wait<00:03:52.020> until

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
close the gap but you want to wait until

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.020 
close the gap but you want to wait until
you're<00:03:52.290> close<00:03:52.440> enough<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.800> reliably<00:03:53.340> land<00:03:53.730> all

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
you're close enough to reliably land all

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.900 
you're close enough to reliably land all
of<00:03:54.209> your<00:03:54.360> coyotes<00:03:55.130> now<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.160> prefer<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.640> use<00:03:56.760> this

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
of your coyotes now I prefer to use this

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.940 
of your coyotes now I prefer to use this
one<00:03:57.090> I'm<00:03:57.209> trying<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.660> do<00:03:57.780> like<00:03:57.959> area-denial

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
one I'm trying to do like area-denial

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.440 
one I'm trying to do like area-denial
you<00:03:59.130> know<00:03:59.220> if<00:03:59.310> your<00:03:59.459> factions<00:03:59.850> doing<00:04:00.090> battle

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
you know if your factions doing battle

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.000 
you know if your factions doing battle
below<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:01.050> kind<00:04:01.230> of<00:04:01.290> stay<00:04:01.470> on<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.680> outliers

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
below you kind of stay on the outliers

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.800 
below you kind of stay on the outliers
then<00:04:02.340> well<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:02.910> can<00:04:03.000> kind<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.270> avoid<00:04:03.570> some

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
then well you can kind of avoid some

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.840 
then well you can kind of avoid some
lock-ons<00:04:04.230> from<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.560> ground<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:05.580> then<00:04:05.760> your

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
lock-ons from the ground and then your

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.280 
lock-ons from the ground and then your
goal<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:06.150> really<00:04:06.300> just<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.630> keep<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.930> enemy

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
goal is really just to keep the enemy

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.190 
goal is really just to keep the enemy
air<00:04:07.470> away<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:09.090> know<00:04:09.180> under<00:04:09.450> slower<00:04:09.690> times<00:04:10.050> on

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
air away you know under slower times on

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.900 
air away you know under slower times on
the<00:04:10.320> server's<00:04:10.680> um<00:04:10.980> I've<00:04:11.310> also<00:04:11.489> some<00:04:11.790> about

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
the server's um I've also some about

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.430 
the server's um I've also some about
times<00:04:12.150> like<00:04:12.300> hung<00:04:12.480> out<00:04:12.600> by<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.900> enemy<00:04:13.260> warp

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
times like hung out by the enemy warp

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.960 
times like hung out by the enemy warp
gates<00:04:13.680> at<00:04:13.860> very<00:04:14.070> high<00:04:14.130> altitudes<00:04:14.820> or

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
gates at very high altitudes or

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.580 
gates at very high altitudes or
sometimes<00:04:15.360> even<00:04:15.540> waited<00:04:15.930> on<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.140> ground<00:04:16.440> with

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
sometimes even waited on the ground with

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.800 
sometimes even waited on the ground with
a<00:04:16.620> decent<00:04:16.890> camo<00:04:17.430> I'm<00:04:17.669> just<00:04:18.330> keeping<00:04:18.600> an<00:04:18.660> eye<00:04:18.780> on

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
a decent camo I'm just keeping an eye on

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.990 
a decent camo I'm just keeping an eye on
the<00:04:19.049> gate<00:04:19.230> and<00:04:19.380> then<00:04:19.980> when<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.310> see<00:04:20.730> an<00:04:20.850> enemy

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
the gate and then when you see an enemy

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.909 
the gate and then when you see an enemy
fighter<00:04:21.359> leave<00:04:21.720> you<00:04:21.960> just<00:04:22.140> kind<00:04:22.320> of<00:04:22.380> sneak<00:04:22.680> in

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
fighter leave you just kind of sneak in

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.680 
fighter leave you just kind of sneak in
behind<00:04:23.130> them<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:23.970> can<00:04:24.330> kind<00:04:24.510> of<00:04:24.570> take

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
behind them and you can kind of take

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.880 
behind them and you can kind of take
them<00:04:24.900> out<00:04:25.020> on<00:04:25.050> their<00:04:25.260> way<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.470> wherever

them out on their way to wherever

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.110 
them out on their way to wherever
they're<00:04:26.100> going

with this kit on the ambush setup that
we're<00:05:06.120> talking<00:05:06.210> about<00:05:06.449> here<00:05:06.979> and<00:05:07.979> even<00:05:08.280> though

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
we're talking about here and even though

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.430 
we're talking about here and even though
it's<00:05:08.610> still<00:05:08.820> pretty<00:05:09.180> effective<00:05:09.419> you<00:05:10.380> know

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
it's still pretty effective you know

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.260 
it's still pretty effective you know
somewhat<00:05:10.949> effective<00:05:11.370> setup<00:05:11.639> for<00:05:11.789> this<00:05:11.880> is<00:05:12.090> the

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
somewhat effective setup for this is the

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.270 
somewhat effective setup for this is the
one-on-one<00:05:12.510> head-to-head<00:05:13.500> engagements<00:05:14.130> with

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
good pilots who are using afterburner

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.740 
good pilots who are using afterburner
tanks<00:05:16.350> they<00:05:17.100> can<00:05:17.280> somewhat<00:05:17.729> reliably<00:05:18.360> avoid

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
tanks they can somewhat reliably avoid

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.480 
tanks they can somewhat reliably avoid
your<00:05:18.930> rockets<00:05:19.410> then<00:05:20.070> they<00:05:20.190> can<00:05:20.340> outmaneuver

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
your rockets then they can outmaneuver

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.490 
your rockets then they can outmaneuver
you<00:05:21.030> because<00:05:21.900> they've<00:05:22.050> got<00:05:22.199> the<00:05:22.320> additional

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
you because they've got the additional

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.469 
you because they've got the additional
afterburner<00:05:23.190> fuel<00:05:23.520> so<00:05:24.000> it's<00:05:24.210> not<00:05:24.330> an

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
afterburner fuel so it's not an

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.240 
afterburner fuel so it's not an
impossible<00:05:24.810> battle<00:05:25.260> but<00:05:25.680> it's<00:05:25.800> a<00:05:25.860> bit<00:05:26.039> of<00:05:26.130> an

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
impossible battle but it's a bit of an

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.890 
impossible battle but it's a bit of an
uphill<00:05:26.400> battle<00:05:26.580> against<00:05:27.270> a<00:05:27.330> worthy<00:05:27.630> opponent

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
uphill battle against a worthy opponent

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.379 
uphill battle against a worthy opponent
on<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.729> situation<00:05:29.729> you<00:05:29.820> really<00:05:29.850> want<00:05:30.300> to

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
on the situation you really want to

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.940 
on the situation you really want to
avoid<00:05:30.510> and<00:05:30.870> this<00:05:30.990> really<00:05:31.260> applies<00:05:31.530> in<00:05:31.740> most

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
avoid and this really applies in most

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.560 
avoid and this really applies in most
situations<00:05:32.160> is<00:05:32.669> being<00:05:32.940> tremendously

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
situations is being tremendously

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.680 
situations is being tremendously
outnumbered<00:05:34.940> you've<00:05:35.940> got<00:05:36.090> a<00:05:36.120> lot<00:05:36.389> of<00:05:36.419> weapons

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
outnumbered you've got a lot of weapons

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.330 
outnumbered you've got a lot of weapons
at<00:05:36.990> your<00:05:37.050> disposal<00:05:37.380> so<00:05:37.650> it's<00:05:37.770> not<00:05:37.889> a<00:05:37.950> lost

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
at your disposal so it's not a lost

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
try to avoid it if at all possible so

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.040 
try to avoid it if at all possible so
that's<00:05:44.550> basically<00:05:44.940> it<00:05:45.060> I<00:05:45.180> told<00:05:45.720> you<00:05:45.780> I<00:05:45.870> wanted

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
to try and keep it quick but that's the

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.279 
to try and keep it quick but that's the
first<00:05:47.520> load<00:05:47.760> out<00:05:47.789> here<00:05:48.150> at<00:05:48.330> my<00:05:48.510> coyotes<00:05:49.020> which

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
first load out here at my coyotes which

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:52.430 
first load out here at my coyotes which
I<00:05:49.410> called<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.889> ambush<00:05:50.490> setup<00:05:51.080> and<00:05:52.080> this<00:05:52.320> is

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
I called the ambush setup and this is

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.930 
I called the ambush setup and this is
one<00:05:52.560> I<00:05:52.620> like<00:05:52.830> to<00:05:52.950> use<00:05:53.070> when<00:05:53.190> I'm<00:05:53.310> using<00:05:53.430> coyotes

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
one I like to use when I'm using coyotes

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.640
