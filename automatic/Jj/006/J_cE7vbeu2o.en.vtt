structure of the house the other deck
looked<00:02:48.489> good<00:02:48.730> but<00:02:49.120> up<00:02:49.329> close<00:02:49.659> it<00:02:49.930> was<00:02:50.049> a

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
looked good but up close it was a

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.839 
looked good but up close it was a
different<00:02:50.530> story<00:02:50.769> there<00:02:51.549> are<00:02:51.609> a<00:02:51.670> lot<00:02:51.819> of

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
different story there are a lot of

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.610 
different story there are a lot of
problems<00:02:52.090> with<00:02:52.299> this<00:02:52.480> deck<00:02:52.750> but<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.349> main

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
problems with this deck but the main

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.559 
problems with this deck but the main
problem<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:54.099> that<00:02:54.129> you<00:02:54.819> see<00:02:55.030> missing

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
problem is that you see missing

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.479 
problem is that you see missing
connections<00:02:56.109> you<00:02:56.260> don't<00:02:56.440> see<00:02:56.680> any<00:02:56.920> metal

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
connections you don't see any metal

connections you don't see any metal
underneath<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.389> deck<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:58.989> metal<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.920> what

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
underneath this deck and metal is what

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.460 
underneath this deck and metal is what
ties<00:03:00.549> pieces<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.239> wood<00:03:01.450> together<00:03:01.659> another

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
ties pieces of wood together another

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.129 
ties pieces of wood together another
problem<00:03:02.920> with<00:03:03.430> this<00:03:03.549> deck<00:03:03.849> is<00:03:04.090> cracked<00:03:04.510> wood<00:03:04.870> a

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
problem with this deck is cracked wood a

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.559 
problem with this deck is cracked wood a
rusty<00:03:05.620> nails<00:03:05.859> that's<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.280> bad<00:03:06.489> sign<00:03:06.760> but<00:03:07.420> the

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
rusty nails that's a bad sign but the

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.839 
rusty nails that's a bad sign but the
most<00:03:07.720> crucial<00:03:08.019> flaw<00:03:08.530> was<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.190> ledger<00:03:09.459> board

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
most crucial flaw was the ledger board

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.569 
most crucial flaw was the ledger board
where<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.450> deck<00:03:10.690> attaches<00:03:11.349> to<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.590> house<00:03:11.799> if

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
where the deck attaches to the house if

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.059 
where the deck attaches to the house if
we<00:03:12.639> look<00:03:12.879> up<00:03:13.030> here<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.959> attachment<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.769> made

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
we look up here the attachment is made

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.599 
we look up here the attachment is made
with<00:03:15.849> only<00:03:16.150> nails<00:03:16.659> and<00:03:17.109> that's<00:03:17.769> very<00:03:18.099> unsafe

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
with only nails and that's very unsafe

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.089 
with only nails and that's very unsafe
in<00:03:21.609> this<00:03:21.849> demonstration<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.690> can<00:03:23.079> see<00:03:23.319> if<00:03:23.620> the

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
in this demonstration you can see if the

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.939 
in this demonstration you can see if the
nails<00:03:24.340> come<00:03:24.760> out<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.209> deck<00:03:25.750> can<00:03:26.169> come<00:03:26.349> crashing

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
nails come out a deck can come crashing

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.220 
nails come out a deck can come crashing
down<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.609> know<00:03:28.120> we<00:03:28.449> set<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:28.840> up<00:03:28.900> for

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
down I know we set this up for

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.930 
down I know we set this up for
demonstration<00:03:29.949> but<00:03:30.370> something<00:03:30.639> like<00:03:30.760> this

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
demonstration but something like this

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.809 
demonstration but something like this
this<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.239> common<00:03:31.840> homes<00:03:32.530> across<00:03:32.799> America<00:03:33.400> it's

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
this is common homes across America it's

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.800 
this is common homes across America it's
very<00:03:34.060> common<00:03:35.669> sometimes<00:03:36.669> people<00:03:37.329> don't<00:03:37.540> take

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
very common sometimes people don't take

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.839 
very common sometimes people don't take
deck<00:03:38.109> seriously<00:03:38.680> but<00:03:38.919> it's<00:03:39.040> very<00:03:39.250> important

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
deck seriously but it's very important

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.789 
deck seriously but it's very important
that<00:03:40.030> decks<00:03:40.269> be<00:03:40.449> properly<00:03:40.900> built<00:03:41.230> and

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
that decks be properly built and

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
thought to inspect the deck while on

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.180 
thought to inspect the deck while on
vacation<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:48.459> deck<00:03:48.819> with<00:03:49.329> a<00:03:49.359> hot<00:03:49.569> tub<00:03:50.190> was
