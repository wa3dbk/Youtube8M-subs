oh<00:00:20.030> I<00:00:21.440> like<00:00:22.440> oh<00:00:22.860> well<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.790> got<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.450> talk<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.630> you

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
oh I like oh well I got to talk to you

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.210 
oh I like oh well I got to talk to you
about<00:00:24.930> his<00:00:25.170> bubble<00:00:25.590> thing<00:00:27.830> they<00:00:28.830> said<00:00:29.040> that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
about his bubble thing they said that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.269

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
to solve the problem fossil fuels will

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.950 
to solve the problem fossil fuels will
be<00:02:31.800> around<00:02:31.980> for<00:02:32.220> years<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.580> years<00:02:32.760> as<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.690> found

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
be around for years and years as I found

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.380
