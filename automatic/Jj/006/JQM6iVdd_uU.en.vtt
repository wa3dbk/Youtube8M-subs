00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.750
 let's go another video of mc machines 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:12.090
 now we are going to show you the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:15.750
 motor kawashima 7 hp model gs 701 is a 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.770
 motor starting equipment 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.460
 ok he besides the electric match he has 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.199
 A manual starting system has a 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.199
 system than the choke for the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.340
 operation of the tap 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.340
 fuel 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.570
 Ok that player's spot here is 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.370
 acceleration 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.680
 it is already pre-arranged also for 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.860
 acceleration then it already has the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.290
 fixing system behind you 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.469
 the throttle cable and you already have the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.739
 prompt return on site if applicable 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.960
 his ignition key here and let's go 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.449
 to clear up some doubts people have 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.699
 is to install the battery in it 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.260
 so what happens to an engine with 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.079
 electric start 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.870
 it already has the load coil in the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.900
 inside it what the cargo drink is 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.680
 a coil behind the steering wheel of the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.290
 motor 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.990
 okay it is not visible and when the engine 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.890
 it's working it's generating load 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:21.000
 this load comes through this movie 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.479
 O alone here gelding brown one here 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.619
 black cap but he is pierre is a 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.320
 brown thread 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.390
 he comes this movie comes in. 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.369
 this box here that besides the match 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.790
 she has a network to get pain 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.040
 internal it retards and ends up returning 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.130
 by this white river ac 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.490
 So what happens to this white thread? 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.009
 ac receives load and comes here 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.740
 here it is where we will connect the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.030
 battery cables and automatically with 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.729
 He working, he's going to be there. 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.130
 powering the battery then you 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.000
 got us that g7 engine say 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.880
 for you to put the battery in it you 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.320
 can use a motorcycle battery can 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.410
 be there from six to 18 foot 12 volts 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.599
 Okay, he's already a good size. He's got a 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.590
 less like starting consumption than 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.440
 A motorcycle 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.780
 a battery of death is enough for you 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.599
 will put the positive battery cable 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.569
 here in here the bare edge 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.640
 here comes the positive battery cable you 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.379
 will put a cable here and will connect 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.250
 on battery positive 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.379
 okay, and the negative battery cable 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.209
 you can copy here this year to 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.720
 that the negative at any point 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.549
 engine mass will be giving negative 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.709
 It's the negative you can put here. 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.640
 on the housing here of the starting motor 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.049
 This is a place where you stay well 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.760
 example here would be a good place that you 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.340
 loose here with the little piece should be a 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.530
 8 believe with him he makes a 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.430
 terminal open negative film 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.959
 again and done the call 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:09.180
 positive and negative to start the 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:11.160
 motor battery connector just come here and 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.640
 start the ignition key 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.030
 Ok first stage start 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.590
 so today is 700 is a motor that carries 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.590
 the battery itself at work
