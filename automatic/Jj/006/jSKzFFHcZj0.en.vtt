00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
xbox oh my excellently the diode fell

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.670 
xbox oh my excellently the diode fell
off<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> wire<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.600> fell<00:00:49.559> off

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
off of it like the wire like fell off

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.779 
off of it like the wire like fell off
the<00:00:49.800> diode<00:00:50.100> because<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.399> was<00:00:50.489> kind<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.670> just

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
the diode because it was kind of just

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.290 
the diode because it was kind of just
tied<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.379> um<00:00:53.899> when<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> took<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.350> off

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
of hit the wire back in the diode it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
of hit the wire back in the diode it
kind<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.810> pulled<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.170> right<00:01:13.260> off<00:01:13.320> the
