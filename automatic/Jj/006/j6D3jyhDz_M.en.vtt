have you guys ever wished to create

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.110 
have you guys ever wished to create
origami<00:00:04.990> stars<00:00:05.380> from<00:00:05.859> thin<00:00:06.160> sheets<00:00:06.460> of<00:00:06.730> paper

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.120 
origami stars from thin sheets of paper

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.820 
origami stars from thin sheets of paper
and<00:00:07.660> have<00:00:08.200> them<00:00:08.410> look<00:00:08.590> like<00:00:08.799> this<00:00:09.450> well<00:00:10.830> we're

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
and have them look like this well we're

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.589 
and have them look like this well we're
here<00:00:12.010> to<00:00:12.219> teach<00:00:12.400> you<00:00:12.550> how<00:00:12.580> the<00:00:13.030> first<00:00:13.389> thing

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 
here to teach you how the first thing

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.289 
here to teach you how the first thing
you<00:00:13.719> need<00:00:13.929> is<00:00:14.200> a<00:00:14.230> thin<00:00:14.559> sheet<00:00:14.860> of<00:00:14.950> paper<00:00:15.219> and<00:00:16.119> it

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
you need is a thin sheet of paper and it

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.580 
you need is a thin sheet of paper and it
should<00:00:16.480> look<00:00:16.630> like<00:00:16.689> this

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
should look like this

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.640 
should look like this
but<00:00:18.550> if<00:00:18.789> you<00:00:18.970> don't<00:00:19.210> have<00:00:19.449> any<00:00:19.810> you<00:00:20.199> can<00:00:20.350> just

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
but if you don't have any you can just

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.759 
but if you don't have any you can just
like<00:00:20.949> cut<00:00:21.310> any<00:00:21.730> loose<00:00:22.240> leaf<00:00:22.510> papers<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:23.410> yuta

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:23.769 
like cut any loose leaf papers and yuta

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.380 
like cut any loose leaf papers and yuta
strips<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:26.250> now<00:00:27.250> you'll<00:00:27.670> start<00:00:28.000> off<00:00:28.119> with

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
strips and now you'll start off with

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.810 
strips and now you'll start off with
your<00:00:28.539> star<00:00:28.779> first<00:00:29.230> of<00:00:29.439> all<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.949> first<00:00:30.220> step<00:00:30.519> to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
your star first of all the first step to

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.680 
your star first of all the first step to
this<00:00:31.000> is<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:32.439> having<00:00:33.010> it<00:00:33.430> over<00:00:33.969> like<00:00:34.510> an

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
this is just having it over like an

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.010 
this is just having it over like an
awareness<00:00:35.290> ribbon

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.700 

and<00:00:38.140> then<00:00:38.410> after<00:00:39.070> having<00:00:39.370> that<00:00:39.790> you<00:00:40.350> cool

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
and then after having that you cool

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.980 
and then after having that you cool
you<00:00:42.160> take<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.580> smaller<00:00:42.940> part<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:43.480> you<00:00:43.720> tuck

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
you take the smaller part and you tuck

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.450 
you take the smaller part and you tuck
it<00:00:44.530> in

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.700 

after<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.390> pull<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.020> longer<00:00:49.530> part

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
after that you pull the longer part

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.290 
after that you pull the longer part
through<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.290> tiny<00:00:52.710> knot<00:00:53.300> except

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
through so it's like a tiny knot except

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
through so it's like a tiny knot except
you<00:00:54.480> don't<00:00:54.690> pull<00:00:55.050> really<00:00:55.470> hard<00:00:55.800> because<00:00:56.160> you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
you don't pull really hard because you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.650 
you don't pull really hard because you
want<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.850> Pentagon<00:00:57.570> shape<00:00:58.129> after<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.760> you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
want that Pentagon shape after that you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.530 
want that Pentagon shape after that you
take<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.140> smaller<00:01:01.590> part<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.910> fold<00:01:03.329> it

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
take this smaller part and you fold it

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.740 
take this smaller part and you fold it
over

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.300 

and<00:01:06.870> then<00:01:07.730> after<00:01:08.730> that<00:01:09.470> you<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.920> take<00:01:11.130> this

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and then after that you just take this

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.570 
and then after that you just take this
longer<00:01:11.790> part<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> wrap<00:01:12.630> around<00:01:13.580> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
longer part and you wrap around the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.210 
longer part and you wrap around the
thing<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.330> easier<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.170> me<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.040> hole

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
thing it's easier for me to the hole

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.400 
thing it's easier for me to the hole
just<00:01:17.250> hold<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> side<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.870> just<00:01:19.140> wrap

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
just hold on to the side and just wrap

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.330 
just hold on to the side and just wrap
this<00:01:19.770> part<00:01:20.040> around<00:01:21.080> because<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.950> wouldn't

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
this part around because then I wouldn't

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.430 
this part around because then I wouldn't
be<00:01:23.400> wrapping<00:01:23.940> around<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.600> same<00:01:24.840> thing<00:01:25.200> over

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
be wrapping around the same thing over

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.980 
be wrapping around the same thing over
and<00:01:25.680> over<00:01:25.860> again<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.880> some<00:01:27.330> people<00:01:27.780> when

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
and over again like some people when

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.570 
and over again like some people when
they<00:01:28.170> first<00:01:28.470> start<00:01:28.590> off<00:01:28.890> they<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.340> wrap

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
they first start off they just wrap

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.630 
they first start off they just wrap
around<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.710> end<00:01:32.250> up

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
around like this and you just end up

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.930 
around like this and you just end up
with<00:01:33.120> that<00:01:33.720> that's<00:01:34.680> not<00:01:34.980> what<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.460> want<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
with that that's not what you want you

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.930 
with that that's not what you want you
want<00:01:36.120> it<00:01:36.390> evenly<00:01:36.870> spread<00:01:37.320> out<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.580> just

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
want it evenly spread out so you just

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.460 
want it evenly spread out so you just
hold<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.360> side<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.050> then<00:01:40.350> just

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.660 

like<00:01:44.420> when<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.510> get<00:01:45.690> to<00:01:45.870> the<00:01:45.990> end<00:01:46.260> and<00:01:46.740> like

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
like when you get to the end and like

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.720 
like when you get to the end and like
for<00:01:48.180> me<00:01:48.330> I<00:01:48.630> don't<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.680> much<00:01:49.950> space<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.550> tuck

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
for me I don't have much space to tuck

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.900 
for me I don't have much space to tuck
it<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.600> other<00:01:51.720> side<00:01:52.080> so<00:01:52.410> I<00:01:52.670> take<00:01:53.670> this

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
it in on the other side so I take this

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:04.530 
it in on the other side so I take this
out<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.210> fold<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.080> over<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:57.470> I<00:01:58.470> tuck<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.100> in

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.730 

and<00:02:04.780> then<00:02:05.260> now<00:02:05.680> here<00:02:06.460> comes<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.790> fun<00:02:06.970> part

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
and then now here comes the fun part

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.190 
and then now here comes the fun part
you<00:02:08.740> hold<00:02:09.040> on<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.850> side<00:02:10.150> not<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.869> middle

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
you hold on to the side not the middle

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.470 
you hold on to the side not the middle
the<00:02:11.530> middle<00:02:11.830> would<00:02:12.040> flatten<00:02:12.430> your<00:02:12.700> star<00:02:13.000> you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
the middle would flatten your star you

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.450 
the middle would flatten your star you
hold<00:02:13.660> on<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.140> side<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.830> just<00:02:15.100> pinch

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
hold on to the side and you just pinch

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.800 
hold on to the side and you just pinch
it<00:02:16.080> all<00:02:17.080> around

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
it all around

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.540 
it all around
and<00:02:19.900> you'll<00:02:20.500> end<00:02:20.650> up<00:02:20.860> with<00:02:20.920> your<00:02:21.250> star

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
and you'll end up with your star

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.160 
and you'll end up with your star
these<00:02:24.120> are<00:02:24.270> really<00:02:24.510> easy<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.990> make<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:27.170> they

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
these are really easy to make and they

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.160 
these are really easy to make and they
don't<00:02:28.860> take<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.210> much<00:02:30.210> time<00:02:30.570> like<00:02:30.900> other

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
don't take that much time like other

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.640 
don't take that much time like other
origami<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.690> fun<00:02:33.930> thing<00:02:34.140> about<00:02:34.230> these

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
origami and so the fun thing about these

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.460 
origami and so the fun thing about these
is<00:02:35.040> there's<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.880> claim<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.450> says<00:02:36.900> if<00:02:37.230> you

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
is there's this claim that says if you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.330 
is there's this claim that says if you
create<00:02:38.430> 1,000<00:02:39.150> stars<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:40.020> can<00:02:40.260> actually<00:02:40.710> make

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
create 1,000 stars you can actually make

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.050 
create 1,000 stars you can actually make
a<00:02:41.370> wish<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:43.170> wish<00:02:43.410> could<00:02:44.040> come<00:02:44.340> true<00:02:44.520> but

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
a wish and that wish could come true but

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.980 
a wish and that wish could come true but
I<00:02:45.620> don't<00:02:46.620> think<00:02:46.800> I've<00:02:46.920> ever<00:02:46.950> achieved<00:02:47.670> that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
I don't think I've ever achieved that

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.170 
I don't think I've ever achieved that
but<00:02:48.990> it's<00:02:49.350> always<00:02:49.680> fun<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.070> believe<00:02:50.790> it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
but it's always fun to believe it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.160 
but it's always fun to believe it
so<00:02:51.870> have<00:02:52.800> fun<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:53.130> guys
