looking at a business cycle reason so

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.920 
looking at a business cycle reason so
they're<00:01:46.510> saying<00:01:46.750> I<00:01:46.870> think<00:01:46.930> that<00:01:47.409> gold<00:01:48.130> is<00:01:48.310> on<00:01:48.520> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
they're saying I think that gold is on a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.540 
they're saying I think that gold is on a
bull<00:01:49.930> market<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.500> think<00:01:50.530> shares<00:01:50.979> are<00:01:51.130> in<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.310> bear

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
bull market I think shares are in a bear

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.100 
bull market I think shares are in a bear
market<00:01:51.580> or<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.120> think<00:01:52.240> Real<00:01:52.540> Estate's<00:01:52.870> may<00:01:53.050> be

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
market or I think Real Estate's may be

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.840 
market or I think Real Estate's may be
better<00:01:53.350> or<00:01:53.650> not<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:54.190> so<00:01:54.430> we<00:01:54.580> know<00:01:54.729> these

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
better or not and so we know these

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.060 
better or not and so we know these
things<00:01:55.150> move<00:01:55.360> in<00:01:55.510> cycles<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:56.620> investors

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
things move in cycles so investors

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.320 
things move in cycles so investors
saying<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.370> think<00:01:57.430> precious<00:01:57.850> metals<00:01:58.210> or

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
saying I think precious metals or

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.480 
saying I think precious metals or
commodities<00:01:58.840> are<00:01:58.990> in<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.170> cycle<00:01:59.650> and<00:01:59.890> uptrend

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
commodities are in a cycle and uptrend

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.980

first for non leveraged ways so that

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.280 
first for non leveraged ways so that

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
means that the investment that you buy

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.380 
means that the investment that you buy
moves<00:03:03.950> with<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.280> gold<00:03:04.610> price<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:05.060> gold<00:03:05.270> price

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
moves with the gold price the gold price

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.750 
moves with the gold price the gold price
goes<00:03:05.720> up<00:03:05.900> ten<00:03:06.140> percent<00:03:06.530> your<00:03:06.800> investment<00:03:07.580> goes

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
goes up ten percent your investment goes

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.690 
goes up ten percent your investment goes
up<00:03:07.970> ten<00:03:08.180> percent<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:09.770> last<00:03:10.010> three<00:03:10.490> are

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
up ten percent the last three are

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.860 
up ten percent the last three are
leveraged<00:03:11.510> so<00:03:12.350> they<00:03:13.040> move<00:03:13.580> in<00:03:14.270> a<00:03:14.690> more

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
leveraged so they move in a more

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.600 
leveraged so they move in a more
aggressive<00:03:15.290> fashion<00:03:15.710> so<00:03:16.100> if<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.280> gold<00:03:16.490> price

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
aggressive fashion so if the gold price

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.280 
aggressive fashion so if the gold price
goes<00:03:16.940> up<00:03:16.970> ten<00:03:17.300> percent<00:03:17.690> they<00:03:17.840> may<00:03:18.050> go<00:03:18.230> up

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
goes up ten percent they may go up

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.840 
goes up ten percent they may go up
twenty<00:03:18.739> percent<00:03:19.040> in<00:03:19.220> valuable<00:03:19.550> they<00:03:19.700> may

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
twenty percent in valuable they may

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.310 
twenty percent in valuable they may
decline<00:03:20.209> by<00:03:20.570> twenty<00:03:20.870> percent<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.870> miners

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
decline by twenty percent and so miners

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.680 
decline by twenty percent and so miners

because<00:04:28.940> it<00:04:29.090> means<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.510> it's<00:04:29.810> trackable<00:04:30.230> so

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
because it means that it's trackable so

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.080 
because it means that it's trackable so
if<00:04:30.530> it's<00:04:30.680> stolen<00:04:30.920> they<00:04:31.460> can<00:04:31.640> always<00:04:31.760> say<00:04:31.940> the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
if it's stolen they can always say the

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.550 
if it's stolen they can always say the

police that had these bar numbers on it

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.320 
police that had these bar numbers on it
makes<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:33.920> harder<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.220> resell<00:04:34.760> other

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
makes it harder to resell other

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.790 
makes it harder to resell other
investors<00:04:35.750> don't<00:04:35.900> like<00:04:36.170> numbered<00:04:36.590> bars

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
investors don't like numbered bars

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.250 
investors don't like numbered bars
because<00:04:37.100> they<00:04:37.250> feel<00:04:37.430> it's<00:04:37.460> trackable<00:04:37.960> so<00:04:38.960> they

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
because they feel it's trackable so they

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.870 
because they feel it's trackable so they
don't<00:04:39.410> want<00:04:39.530> anyone<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:39.860> know<00:04:39.920> and<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.760> have

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
don't want anyone to know and to have

I<00:04:43.010> solved<00:04:43.370> these<00:04:43.520> bar<00:04:43.760> numbers<00:04:44.120> to<00:04:44.240> this

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
I solved these bar numbers to this

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.890 
I solved these bar numbers to this
person<00:04:44.600> so<00:04:45.850> take<00:04:46.850> take<00:04:47.240> that<00:04:47.390> depending<00:04:47.780> on

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
person so take take that depending on
