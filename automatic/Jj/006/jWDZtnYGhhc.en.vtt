00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.719
 close your eyes because it is special 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:15.430
 for you because today you will not need 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:19.010
 that will teach you with images because today 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.359
 your mind and your imagination are going to be 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.429
 let them know how you feel sometimes 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.759
 because there are times when it seems that 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:31.490
 nothing makes sense that you would throw it all away 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.540
 overboard and would change is your life of 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.570
 a stroke without caring about anything anymore 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:42.230
 but today I'm going to help you I'm going to 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.340
 explain why you should not put yourself like that 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.250
 day is always worth going ahead 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.730
 because a smile is worth more than my idea 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.110
 grimaces 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.050
 do not open your eyes, let's go back 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.510
 when we were little when nothing 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.340
 worried 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.089
 tell me what you see 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.479
 everything was easier 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.030
 the world if it could be modeled could be 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.119
 our whim we had them that we 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.909
 take care of yourself or worry about us but 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.850
 the reality is different if they had 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.960
 problems but we had who had 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.530
 your hard days for our happiness 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.330
 let's move back to the present to 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.060
 those days that do not let you think with 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.510
 clarity on those nights without light that 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.030
 So much have you liked those moments in 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.250
 those who look at you in the mirror and there's nothing 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.080
 what do you like to say 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.960
 imagine a mirror 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.260
 imagine everything that would change to feel 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:53.500
 to feel better with your complexes 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.500
 I give you a few seconds do it calmly 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.920
 you look 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.099
 you feel better 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.130
 I'll tell you one thing I do not think you can 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.770
 stop seeing you as you are and you know 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.310
 why because there is not one more way 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.180
 Perfect to be yourself admitting your 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.870
 mistakes and assessing your successes 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:28.810
 knowing that for someone you and only 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.569
 you are the most important 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.830
 because if you try to change you will stop 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.300
 be yourself and if you stop being yourself 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.950
 you will have lost 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.440
 you know we all have bad days but that 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.550
 it's because we value good days and 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.920
 we miss them 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.819
 we all want to smile 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.860
 but arriving makes us human and demonstrates 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.700
 that within ourselves there is 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.670
 feelings that I would move on a planet 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.459
 I leave you me if you want I leave you 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.180
 that you get angry if you want you can spend 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.610
 the day regretting you but the only thing 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.459
 you will have achieved is to lose a day 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.970
 wonderful of your life you will only have 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.380
 got hurt yourself and those who 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.640
 they love you 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.340
 because the world goes on its course and you 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.590
 sometimes you feel out of it you have the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.760
 lucky to see it and change it 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.020
 open your eyes 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.819
 and take advantage of every second 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.599
 learn from all this 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.079
 I let you be sad today if you smile 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.079
 morning
