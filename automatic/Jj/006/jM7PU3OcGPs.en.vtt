00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.600 
more to get a really good kind of idea
of<00:01:24.810> how<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.439> play<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.580> is

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
of how it's going to play out and it is

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.249 
of how it's going to play out and it is
only<00:01:26.820> an<00:01:27.030> alpha<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.600> need<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.990> give<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
only an alpha so I need to give it a

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.780 
only an alpha so I need to give it a
chance<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.650> yeah<00:01:28.799> cube<00:01:29.159> world<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.430> awesome<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
chance so yeah cube world is awesome I

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.520 
chance so yeah cube world is awesome I
might<00:01:30.030> make<00:01:30.210> some<00:01:30.420> videos<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.020> really

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
might make some videos on it really

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
might make some videos on it really
there's<00:01:31.920> not<00:01:32.159> too<00:01:32.400> much<00:01:32.549> make<00:01:32.820> videos<00:01:33.119> on

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.280 
there's not too much make videos on
right<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.689> people<00:01:33.960> haven't<00:01:34.259> done
