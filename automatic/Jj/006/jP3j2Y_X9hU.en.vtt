00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 one month in our program the 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.930
 time to talk about nutrition and that's why in 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.130
 these moments is accompanying us 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.200
 our nutritionist margarita 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.090
 fernandez margarita welcome people 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.830
 fitness if you like always giving 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.839
 very good recommendations to all my 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.190
 people ends at the time of feeding 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.539
 to have a very good workout 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.130
 good hello everyone I hope you have them 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.289
 served the feeding kits and of 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.720
 nutrition that we have given and today I come to 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.080
 tell them a little bit louis something that 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.960
 is presenting a lot and it's because of the rhythm 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.469
 of life that we are having come to us 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.170
 of work to train without consumption of 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.030
 food is important to know that the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.620
 training not only depends on the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.750
 you want us to put him but 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.180
 also of good nutrition and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.879
 pre-feeding is not the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.510
 volume of food that we consume is 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.050
 the quality of the food and hopefully one hour 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.270
 Pre- exercise a small bite 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.030
 that we can consume a bar 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.030
 of cereal a yogurt a oatmeal a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.390
 hopefully product of 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.400
 killed or that is low in fat so that 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.530
 do not feel it all the time during the 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.049
 training but it is important that 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.770
 we all realize the importance 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:21.170
 that has not come to us fasting for the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.450
 gym or doing some physical activity 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.180
 in your home that never goes through a process of 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.000
 fasting but it's that I never get anything 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.399
 I never get dizzy but we can not wait to 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.649
 give us a symptom because many 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.440
 Sometimes it's not just the symptom but the 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.270
 organism is already suffering during 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.610
 the training but you are not 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.560
 feeling the symptom is also 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.710
 important to know louis that a fast 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.649
 prolonged implies a greater accumulation 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.780
 of fat because because when we do 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.970
 a prolonged fast we will get to 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.979
 eat the size of hunger we are not going to 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.690
 be able to control the appetite 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.729
 then if you have a fast 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.830
 prolonged out of that they come to do 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.710
 physical activity that increases consumption 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.780
 food you will get to retaliate and 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.729
 lose everything you did macarita 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.160
 when we talk about that prolonged fast 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.840
 then what would be the time for 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.319
 us feeding the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.390
 ok we must have a consumption 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.370
 always of food fractioning the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.250
 feeding in at least 5 meals at 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.290
 day breakfast half morning lunch something 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.420
 and dinner being the most important the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.319
 breakfast because it cuts the longest fast 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.200
 that has the body that from the night 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.319
 and because it's the start let's say it's 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.999
 tank the gasoline car prior to 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.769
 all the activity of a day and it's 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:43.090
 important that we take into account that the 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.969
 mid morning and the something they are are spaces 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.129
 of time that we should take advantage of 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:49.269
 us for the consumption of fruits of 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.060
 yoghurts 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.889
 I wish low in fat and no sugar for 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.700
 consume whole products like 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:59.200
 cereal bars to produce for 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.790
 consume all the foods that we 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.400
 help us in addition to digestion 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.900
 to margarida health to all our 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.689
 elements also come up with an idea 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.699
 going back to the first question we left 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.469
 to work type 6 in the afternoon while 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:13.480
 we have to eat something to 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:15.370
 to be able to train while we perform 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.319
 our exercise routine one hour 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.790
 the hour and a half two hours 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.699
 goal of each person while 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.840
 we arrived at our house we moved 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:24.639
 kind eight and a half nine at night 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.199
 enter the questions that it is too late 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.239
 so I can not eat because the 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:30.069
 nutritionist tells me that type 7 7 and 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.409
 average how would it be like we could handle 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.050
 all that good first thing and it's very 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.090
 important is what I am telling you 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.950
 they see that they do not have time because they go out to 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.380
 six o'clock and they come quickly for the 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.690
 fitness center 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.240
 prepare plan in that feeding 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.430
 previous make the sandwich thirsty 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.340
 sandwich people who want 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.710
 lose fat that is low in fat that does not 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.740
 put mozarella cheeses so doubles 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.780
 creams at that time of the evening that is 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.750
 turkey ham that is from a ham that 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.150
 be low in fat or just be 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.950
 of a tuna in water for people who 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.620
 they want to increase muscle mass hopefully 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.140
 of chicken with a slice of meat 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.300
 smoked as I can but provide us 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.430
 a larger amount of protein and when 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.980
 that comes that implies that it's going to decrease 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.480
 the consumption when you get home and 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.120
 when you get to your house try 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.190
 consume vegetables and white meats that 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.230
 They have greater digestibility and easy 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.020
 margarida digestion we also talk 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.080
 turning us a little bit to that fast at 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.630
 breakfast that many people for time 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.970
 of work also can not train 8 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.250
 6 in the afternoon but if it comes at 5 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.690
 in the morning they take any foolish 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.970
 Sometimes they do not eat anything and come to sit down 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.900
 of espn and do bodybuilding but also 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.000
 you can present some kind of 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.310
 gastritis I do not know good is important 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.580
 know that fasting at any time 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.010
 before the exercise is bad but also 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.660
 we must understand and it has happened to me of 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.730
 soon to louis you too have passed 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.230
 and viewers who do activity 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.690
 physical after a breakfast is very 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.470
 difficult then I suggest you do 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.990
 two things or a drink that is with oats 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.240
 and it does not have to be dairy because 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.540
 Sometimes we fall heavy to come to 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.670
 train or make it a light yogurt 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.560
 completely light with cereals in little 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.820
 amount because we are abusing the 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.380
 louis cereals 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.360
 We believe that the consumption of cereals 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.670
 gives permission to consume the amount that 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.160
 be and the cereal portion by very 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.200
 integral is 30 grams which is 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.940
 almost three quarts small well 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.410
 so if we do from 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.380
 small snack before training 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.600
 perfect or we can consume us a 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.330
 chocolate drink of those in the 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.520
 Market in skimmed milk skimmed 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.220
 that will not involve any 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.050
 no reflux or any previous heaviness 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.730
 to the margarida exercise we hope that 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.990
 all of our viewers have in 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.610
 account for all those recommendations 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.950

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.700
