the<00:01:20.659> back<00:01:20.689> of<00:01:20.840> our<00:01:20.990> mind<00:01:21.259> I'm<00:01:22.159> going<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.430> select

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
the back of our mind I'm going to select

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.690 
the back of our mind I'm going to select
these<00:01:22.939> images<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:23.540> in<00:01:23.900> my<00:01:24.380> thought<00:01:24.979> process<00:01:25.580> I

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
these images and in my thought process I

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.969 
these images and in my thought process I
thought<00:01:25.970> if<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:26.240> exported<00:01:26.900> this<00:01:27.110> collection<00:01:27.560> as

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
thought if I exported this collection as

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.730 
thought if I exported this collection as
a<00:01:28.040> catalog<00:01:28.820> this<00:01:29.450> would<00:01:29.960> be<00:01:30.110> what<00:01:30.290> I<00:01:30.320> would<00:01:30.560> see

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
a catalog this would be what I would see

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.890 
a catalog this would be what I would see
so<00:01:31.159> let's<00:01:31.369> go<00:01:31.520> try<00:01:31.579> it<00:01:31.759> let's<00:01:32.119> go<00:01:32.299> to<00:01:32.360> file<00:01:32.630> and

the one that we've just exported of

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.330 
the one that we've just exported of
course<00:02:29.780> because<00:02:30.020> Lightroom<00:02:30.620> can<00:02:31.010> only<00:02:31.130> have

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
course because Lightroom can only have

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.890 
course because Lightroom can only have
one<00:02:31.460> catalog<00:02:31.820> open<00:02:32.120> at<00:02:32.210> a<00:02:32.300> time<00:02:32.480> it's<00:02:32.690> going<00:02:32.810> to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
one catalog open at a time it's going to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.840 
one catalog open at a time it's going to
close<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.440> original<00:02:33.710> one<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.280> then<00:02:34.730> it's

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
close the original one and then it's

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.450 
close the original one and then it's
going<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.240> launch<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:36.260> one<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.010> again<00:02:37.220> this

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
going to launch this one so again this

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.740 
going to launch this one so again this
would<00:02:37.610> be<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.760> one<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.180> was<00:02:38.270> taking<00:02:38.660> on

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
would be the one that I was taking on

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.140 
would be the one that I was taking on
the<00:02:38.870> road<00:02:39.050> so<00:02:39.950> when<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.100> open<00:02:40.490> this<00:02:40.610> catalog

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
the road so when I open this catalog

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.960 
the road so when I open this catalog
you'll<00:02:42.080> notice<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.740> in<00:02:42.950> my<00:02:43.160> collection<00:02:43.700> area

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
you'll notice that in my collection area

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.930 
you'll notice that in my collection area
I<00:02:44.240> don't<00:02:44.780> just<00:02:45.050> see<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.530> one<00:02:45.830> collection<00:02:46.760> I

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
I don't just see that one collection I

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.540 
I don't just see that one collection I
see<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.780> bunch<00:02:48.050> of<00:02:48.140> collections<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.890> that's

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
see a bunch of collections and that's

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.500 
see a bunch of collections and that's
because<00:02:50.090> if<00:02:50.330> any<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:50.840> those<00:02:51.140> original<00:02:51.920> images

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
because if any of those original images

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.050 
because if any of those original images
were<00:02:53.510> in<00:02:54.010> multiple<00:02:55.010> collections<00:02:55.490> and<00:02:55.730> we<00:02:55.850> saw

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
were in multiple collections and we saw

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.450 
were in multiple collections and we saw
that<00:02:56.240> they<00:02:56.390> were<00:02:57.160> Lightroom<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.280> going<00:02:58.400> to

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
that they were Lightroom is going to

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.510 
that they were Lightroom is going to
bring<00:02:58.730> over<00:02:59.000> all<00:02:59.630> of<00:02:59.870> those<00:02:59.990> collections<00:03:00.520> but

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
bring over all of those collections but

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.450 
bring over all of those collections but
it<00:03:01.730> doesn't<00:03:02.240> bring<00:03:02.510> over<00:03:02.750> all<00:03:03.290> of<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.070> images

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
it doesn't bring over all of the images

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.980 
it doesn't bring over all of the images
in<00:03:04.550> that<00:03:04.670> collection<00:03:04.970> like<00:03:05.390> for<00:03:05.540> example<00:03:05.630> I

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
in that collection like for example I

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.410 
in that collection like for example I
had<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.200> collection<00:03:06.470> called<00:03:06.970> cyclical<00:03:07.970> that

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
had a collection called cyclical that

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.210 
had a collection called cyclical that
had<00:03:08.630> probably<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:09.020> don't<00:03:09.200> know<00:03:09.350> 20<00:03:09.710> images<00:03:09.860> in

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
had probably I don't know 20 images in

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.130 
had probably I don't know 20 images in
it<00:03:10.340> or<00:03:10.430> something<00:03:10.640> but<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:11.270> only<00:03:11.480> brought<00:03:11.870> over

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
it or something but it only brought over

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.770 
it or something but it only brought over
the<00:03:12.590> one<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:12.980> was<00:03:13.490> in<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:14.180> collection<00:03:14.600> so

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
the one that was in that collection so

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.840 
the one that was in that collection so
if<00:03:14.990> we<00:03:15.080> click<00:03:15.290> on<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.680> can<00:03:15.830> see<00:03:15.860> this<00:03:16.490> one

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
if we click on that you can see this one

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.600 
if we click on that you can see this one
is<00:03:16.880> brought<00:03:17.210> over<00:03:17.390> because<00:03:17.840> it's<00:03:18.020> common<00:03:18.710> with

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
is brought over because it's common with

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.390 
is brought over because it's common with
the<00:03:19.910> still-life<00:03:20.480> collection<00:03:21.140> so<00:03:21.740> I<00:03:22.070> just

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
the still-life collection so I just

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.550 
the still-life collection so I just
wanted<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.120> do<00:03:23.240> this<00:03:23.360> quick<00:03:23.630> tip<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.290> show<00:03:24.500> you

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
wanted to do this quick tip to show you

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.770 
wanted to do this quick tip to show you
that<00:03:24.890> this<00:03:25.250> will<00:03:25.670> probably<00:03:25.940> happen<00:03:26.390> to<00:03:26.690> you

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
that this will probably happen to you

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.570 
that this will probably happen to you
and<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.350> can<00:03:27.530> just<00:03:27.680> select<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:28.160> collections

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
and you can just select the collections

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.160 
and you can just select the collections
that<00:03:28.700> you<00:03:28.790> don't<00:03:28.970> want<00:03:29.210> right<00:03:29.870> mouse<00:03:30.140> click

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
that you don't want right mouse click

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.130

like it brought over that whole other
collection<00:03:44.120> just<00:03:44.240> because<00:03:44.570> it<00:03:45.290> shared<00:03:45.620> one

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040
