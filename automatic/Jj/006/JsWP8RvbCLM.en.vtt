there<00:00:25.740> has<00:00:26.070> apparently<00:00:26.430> been<00:00:26.820> at<00:00:27.599> what<00:00:28.019> point

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
there has apparently been at what point

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.040 
there has apparently been at what point
anonymous<00:00:29.250> tip<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:30.210> implies<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.869> there

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
anonymous tip that implies that there

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.290 
anonymous tip that implies that there
was<00:00:31.170> at<00:00:31.289> least<00:00:31.320> one<00:00:31.769> other<00:00:31.920> car<00:00:32.279> at<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.730> scene

was at least one other car at the scene

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.150 
was at least one other car at the scene
and<00:00:33.390> investigators<00:00:34.170> are<00:00:34.440> looking<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
and investigators are looking in the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.830 
and investigators are looking in the
possibility<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:35.969> they<00:00:36.360> were<00:00:36.420> drag<00:00:36.809> racing

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
possibility that they were drag racing

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.260 
possibility that they were drag racing
at<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.440> time<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.980> accident<00:00:38.129> now<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.940> this

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
at the time of the accident now at this

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.330 
at the time of the accident now at this
point<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.719> simply<00:00:40.290> relying<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.219> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
point we are simply relying on what is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.459 
point we are simply relying on what is
as<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.820> said<00:00:42.059> an<00:00:42.210> anonymous<00:00:42.719> tip<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.079> could<00:00:43.230> very

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
as I said an anonymous tip it could very

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.290 
as I said an anonymous tip it could very
well<00:00:43.590> turn<00:00:44.309> out<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> imagine<00:00:45.270> it

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
well turn out to be and I imagine it

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.180 
well turn out to be and I imagine it
will<00:00:45.510> turn<00:00:45.690> out<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:45.960> false<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.100> this

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
will turn out to be false but at this

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.610 
will turn out to be false but at this
point<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.850> being<00:00:48.030> looked<00:00:48.120> into<00:00:48.270> uh<00:00:49.170> Los
