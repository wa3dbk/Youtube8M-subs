and<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.870> used<00:00:43.140> self<00:00:44.129> tappers<00:00:44.640> guys<00:00:45.800> first<00:00:46.800> I

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
and I used self tappers guys first I

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.290 
and I used self tappers guys first I
drilled<00:00:47.399> through<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.670> metal<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.149> use

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
drilled through the metal and then use

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.060 
drilled through the metal and then use
the<00:00:48.450> self<00:00:48.660> tappers<00:00:49.110> because<00:00:49.410> self<00:00:49.710> tappers

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the self tappers because self tappers

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.160 
the self tappers because self tappers
didn't<00:00:50.430> seem<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.969> self<00:00:51.239> tap<00:00:53.690> but<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> was<00:00:54.930> kind

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
didn't seem to self tap but it was kind

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.319 
didn't seem to self tap but it was kind
of<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.320> bitch<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.829> then<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.610> hole<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:56.910> was

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
of a bitch and then this hole that was

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.080 
of a bitch and then this hole that was
from<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.600> previous<00:00:58.140> mounting<00:00:58.829> area<00:00:59.160> that

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
from the previous mounting area that

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.060 
from the previous mounting area that
wasn't<00:01:00.359> lining<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.350> then<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> had<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.829> drill

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
wasn't lining up so then I had to drill

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.090 
wasn't lining up so then I had to drill
another<00:01:02.100> hole<00:01:02.430> which<00:01:03.229> fucking<00:01:04.229> socks<00:01:04.589> because

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
another hole which fucking socks because

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.300 
another hole which fucking socks because
now<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.939> fucking<00:01:06.390> looks<00:01:06.630> shitty

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
now it's fucking looks shitty

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.679 
now it's fucking looks shitty
so<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> guess<00:01:08.549> I'll<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.060> replace<00:01:09.330> it

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
so I guess I'll just have to replace it

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.810 
so I guess I'll just have to replace it
the<00:01:10.260> whole<00:01:10.560> pillar<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.220> just<00:01:11.430> put<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> new

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the whole pillar and just put a new

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.149 
the whole pillar and just put a new
pillar<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:12.570> then<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
pillar in but then that then you have to

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.280 
pillar in but then that then you have to
do<00:01:14.280> everything<00:01:14.490> all<00:01:14.729> over<00:01:14.790> again<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.630> don't

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
do everything all over again so I don't

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.780 
do everything all over again so I don't
know<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.500> I'll<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:17.720> but<00:01:19.729> this<00:01:20.729> is

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
know what I'll do there but this is

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.770 
know what I'll do there but this is
where<00:01:21.119> I'm<00:01:21.240> wiring<00:01:21.600> them<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:24.689> just

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
where I'm wiring them to and it's just

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.340 
where I'm wiring them to and it's just
to<00:01:25.200> my<00:01:25.619> cruise<00:01:26.189> control<00:01:26.549> lights<00:01:27.170> because<00:01:28.170> he's

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
to my cruise control lights because he's

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.050 
to my cruise control lights because he's
got<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> little<00:01:28.710> light<00:01:28.979> power<00:01:29.250> or<00:01:29.490> whatever<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
got a little light power or whatever and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.690 
got a little light power or whatever and
I<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.450> them<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.950> guy<00:01:32.369> already

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
I just have them on that a guy already

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.060 
I just have them on that a guy already
probably<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.210> guess<00:01:33.390> I'm<00:01:34.020> guessing<00:01:34.530> had<00:01:34.770> booze

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
probably I guess I'm guessing had booze

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.920 
probably I guess I'm guessing had booze
gauges<00:01:35.520> or<00:01:35.670> something<00:01:36.030> hooked<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> your<00:01:36.630> he

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
gauges or something hooked up to your he

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.039 
gauges or something hooked up to your he
had<00:01:37.020> two<00:01:37.200> wires<00:01:37.470> teed<00:01:37.860> off<00:01:37.890> these<00:01:38.570> wires<00:01:39.570> here

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
had two wires teed off these wires here

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.399 
had two wires teed off these wires here
so<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.409> used<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.009> black<00:01:41.310> wire<00:01:42.259> there<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:45.409> I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
so I used the black wire there and I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.260 
so I used the black wire there and I
used<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.860> green<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.399> with<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> white<00:01:47.939> stripe

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
used the green one with the white stripe

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.340 
used the green one with the white stripe
here<00:01:48.780> that's<00:01:49.079> power<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.799> ground<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.280> course

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
here that's power and ground of course

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.929 
here that's power and ground of course
he<00:01:52.350> already<00:01:52.500> had<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.740> teeing<00:01:53.159> off<00:01:53.430> here<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.909> I

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
he already had one teeing off here so I

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.880 
he already had one teeing off here so I
just<00:01:54.030> hooked<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.570> into<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.470> used

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
just hooked it into that I just used

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.789 
just hooked it into that I just used
these<00:01:56.070> these<00:01:56.670> nice<00:01:56.969> connectors<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.680> they're

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
these these nice connectors so they're

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.330 
these these nice connectors so they're
pretty<00:01:58.950> much<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.710> pretty<00:02:01.920> much<00:02:02.009> plug

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
pretty much you can pretty much plug

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.670 
pretty much you can pretty much plug
them<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.909> unplug<00:02:03.270> them<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.020> say<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.469> you

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
them in and unplug them so say if you

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.230 
them in and unplug them so say if you
know<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.799> want<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.189> replace<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> pod<00:02:05.850> pillar<00:02:06.119> I

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
know I want to replace the pod pillar I

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.760 
know I want to replace the pod pillar I
can<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:06.689> disconnect<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.439> don't<00:02:07.619> gotta

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
can just disconnect this I don't gotta

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.710 
can just disconnect this I don't gotta
cut<00:02:08.009> wires<00:02:08.250> rewire<00:02:08.879> everything<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.569> just

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720

cut wires rewire everything I can just
cut<00:02:10.349> them<00:02:10.440> plug<00:02:11.310> them<00:02:11.430> back<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:12.000> that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
cut them plug them back in is that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.210 
cut them plug them back in is that
unlike<00:02:12.959> all

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
unlike all

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.090 
unlike all
most<00:02:13.340> everything<00:02:13.640> now<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.500> easiest<00:02:15.830> for

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
most everything now it's the easiest for

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.160 
most everything now it's the easiest for
like<00:02:16.280> say<00:02:16.490> if<00:02:16.610> someone<00:02:17.000> gets<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.660> car<00:02:17.960> in

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
like say if someone gets this car in

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.400 
like say if someone gets this car in
three<00:02:18.410> years<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.770> they<00:02:18.980> don't<00:02:19.160> want<00:02:19.400> the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
three years and they don't want the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.600 
three years and they don't want the
aftermarket<00:02:21.410> gauges<00:02:21.980> or<00:02:22.100> whatever<00:02:22.340> they<00:02:22.550> can

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
aftermarket gauges or whatever they can

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.790 
aftermarket gauges or whatever they can
just<00:02:22.910> look<00:02:23.240> at<00:02:23.390> this<00:02:23.570> stuff<00:02:23.780> pull<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.230> off<00:02:24.410> and

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
just look at this stuff pull it off and

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.770 
just look at this stuff pull it off and
they<00:02:25.160> can<00:02:25.340> leave<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.850> one<00:02:26.060> connector<00:02:26.540> just

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
they can leave the one connector just

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.780 
they can leave the one connector just
lay<00:02:27.170> in<00:02:27.320> there<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.710> just<00:02:27.830> pull<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.280> wires<00:02:28.490> oh

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
lay in there and just pull the wires oh

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.370 
lay in there and just pull the wires oh
and<00:02:29.000> then<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.360> know<00:02:29.690> that's<00:02:29.780> pretty<00:02:29.990> simple

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
and then you know that's pretty simple

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.990 
and then you know that's pretty simple
procedure<00:02:30.820> I<00:02:32.710> went<00:02:33.710> ahead<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:34.190> pushed<00:02:34.490> all<00:02:34.790> my

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
procedure I went ahead and pushed all my

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.100 
procedure I went ahead and pushed all my
wiring<00:02:35.390> down<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:36.680> through<00:02:36.920> here<00:02:37.690> as<00:02:38.690> well<00:02:38.960> as

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
wiring down in through here as well as

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.540 
wiring down in through here as well as
the<00:02:39.350> oil<00:02:39.590> pressure<00:02:39.830> line<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:40.130> everything

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
the oil pressure line and everything

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.270 
the oil pressure line and everything
make<00:02:41.150> sure<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:41.510> put<00:02:41.690> teflon<00:02:41.870> on<00:02:42.410> your<00:02:43.070> oil

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
make sure you put teflon on your oil

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.460 
make sure you put teflon on your oil
pressure<00:02:43.520> line<00:02:44.260> fittings<00:02:47.020> you<00:02:48.020> don't<00:02:48.230> want<00:02:48.380> to

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
pressure line fittings you don't want to

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.530 
pressure line fittings you don't want to
be<00:02:48.790> having<00:02:49.790> oil<00:02:49.850> come<00:02:50.209> all<00:02:50.330> over<00:02:50.360> your<00:02:50.690> car<00:02:52.540> but

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
be having oil come all over your car but

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.090 
be having oil come all over your car but
yeah<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:53.930> far<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:54.500> pretty<00:02:54.709> much<00:02:54.800> almost

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
yeah so far this is pretty much almost

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.010 
yeah so far this is pretty much almost
done<00:02:55.760> all<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.180> gotta<00:02:56.360> do<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.510> hook<00:02:56.750> up<00:02:56.870> my<00:02:56.990> oil

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
done all I gotta do is hook up my oil

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.180 
done all I gotta do is hook up my oil
pressure<00:02:57.470> gauge<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:58.160> my<00:02:58.640> boost<00:02:59.180> hose<00:02:59.390> and<00:03:00.190> go

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
pressure gauge and my boost hose and go

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.130 
pressure gauge and my boost hose and go
be<00:03:01.340> done<00:03:01.490> this<00:03:02.360> is<00:03:02.540> what<00:03:02.780> they<00:03:02.990> are<00:03:03.020> I<00:03:03.500> got

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.470 

the<00:03:07.140> evil<00:03:08.510> whose<00:03:09.510> gauge<00:03:10.820> where<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.030> fuck<00:03:12.270> is<00:03:12.450> a

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
the evil whose gauge where the fuck is a

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.950 
the evil whose gauge where the fuck is a
10-1<00:03:12.810> Muslim

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.340 

I<00:03:21.160> wanted<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.220> go<00:03:22.310> with<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.520> Evo<00:03:22.760> just<00:03:23.000> because

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
I wanted to go with the Evo just because

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.470 
I wanted to go with the Evo just because
it<00:03:24.350> is<00:03:24.530> Evo<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.430> says<00:03:25.610> Evo<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:25.970> it's<00:03:26.330> like

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
it is Evo it says Evo and it's like

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.480 
it is Evo it says Evo and it's like
Mitsubishi<00:03:27.080> but<00:03:27.500> it's<00:03:27.620> not<00:03:27.770> actually<00:03:28.160> made<00:03:28.310> by

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
Mitsubishi but it's not actually made by

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.640 
Mitsubishi but it's not actually made by
Mitsubishi<00:03:29.390> but<00:03:29.570> still<00:03:30.170> thought<00:03:30.320> it<00:03:30.380> was<00:03:30.500> kind

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
Mitsubishi but still thought it was kind

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.380 
Mitsubishi but still thought it was kind
of<00:03:30.680> cool<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:31.190> like<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.520> dialogue<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:32.240> um

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
of cool and I like the dialogue of it um

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.650 
of cool and I like the dialogue of it um
the<00:03:33.320> oil<00:03:33.470> pressures<00:03:33.860> just<00:03:34.390> mechanical<00:03:35.390> oil

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
the oil pressures just mechanical oil

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.250 
the oil pressures just mechanical oil
pressure<00:03:37.240> because<00:03:38.240> you<00:03:38.480> know<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:39.050> want<00:03:39.200> to

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
pressure because you know you want to

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.570 
pressure because you know you want to
use<00:03:39.380> mechanical<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.040> don't<00:03:40.160> really<00:03:40.280> want<00:03:40.520> to

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
use mechanical you don't really want to

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.520 
use mechanical you don't really want to
go<00:03:40.670> with<00:03:40.810> digital<00:03:41.810> because<00:03:41.990> then<00:03:42.290> if<00:03:42.410> your

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
go with digital because then if your

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.140 
go with digital because then if your
sensor<00:03:42.860> fails<00:03:43.100> then<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.370> have<00:03:43.490> no<00:03:43.640> idea<00:03:43.910> what

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
sensor fails then you have no idea what

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.470 
sensor fails then you have no idea what
your<00:03:44.950> oil<00:03:45.950> pressure<00:03:46.160> is<00:03:46.280> at<00:03:46.460> and<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.700> care<00:03:47.360> a<00:03:47.390> lot

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
your oil pressure is at and I care a lot

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.560 
your oil pressure is at and I care a lot
more<00:03:47.810> about<00:03:47.990> my<00:03:48.110> oil<00:03:48.350> pressure<00:03:48.590> than<00:03:48.830> my<00:03:48.920> boost

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
more about my oil pressure than my boost

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.940 
more about my oil pressure than my boost
because<00:03:50.570> I<00:03:50.690> can<00:03:50.840> tell<00:03:51.050> if<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.290> get<00:03:51.440> no<00:03:51.590> booster

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
because I can tell if I get no booster

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.420 
because I can tell if I get no booster
or<00:03:52.040> not<00:03:52.390> all<00:03:53.390> right<00:03:53.420> guys<00:03:53.690> well<00:03:54.340> thanks<00:03:55.340> for

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
watching if you need any info on how to

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.380 
watching if you need any info on how to
do<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:57.500> it's<00:03:58.370> pretty<00:03:58.580> straightforward<00:03:59.150> it's<00:03:59.330> a

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
do it it's pretty straightforward it's a

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.940 
do it it's pretty straightforward it's a
97<00:03:59.660> gsx<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:02.060> does<00:04:02.300> take<00:04:02.540> time<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:06.110> little

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
97 gsx it does take time and a little

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.350 
97 gsx it does take time and a little
bit<00:04:07.040> of<00:04:07.160> wiring<00:04:07.340> skills<00:04:07.760> but<00:04:07.880> other<00:04:08.060> than<00:04:08.180> that

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
bit of wiring skills but other than that

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.030 
bit of wiring skills but other than that
it's<00:04:08.540> just<00:04:08.690> hooking<00:04:08.870> wires<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.530> a<00:04:09.560> positive

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
it's just hooking wires to a positive

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.860 
it's just hooking wires to a positive
and<00:04:10.190> negative<00:04:10.610> and<00:04:10.880> running<00:04:11.300> proper<00:04:11.660> lines

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
and negative and running proper lines

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.990 
and negative and running proper lines
and<00:04:12.230> you<00:04:12.290> do<00:04:12.530> have<00:04:12.740> to<00:04:12.890> drill<00:04:13.100> a<00:04:13.130> hole<00:04:13.430> in<00:04:13.880> your

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
and you do have to drill a hole in your

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.970 
and you do have to drill a hole in your
firewall<00:04:14.480> which<00:04:14.810> seriously<00:04:15.200> sucks<00:04:15.680> but

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
firewall which seriously sucks but

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.110 
firewall which seriously sucks but
there's<00:04:16.790> no<00:04:16.970> other<00:04:17.120> factory<00:04:17.630> holes<00:04:17.840> but<00:04:19.120> hey
