00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.469
 hello welcome to my channel abc today you 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:15.309
 I'm going to teach how to make apples with 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.309
 chamoy let's use a porrito 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.140
 chilli powder 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.680
 an Apple 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.200
 and a stick 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.150
 we'll put the fox in the oven 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.040
 microwave for 10 seconds only 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.410
 so that it softens 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.010
 you can extend it with your hands or what 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.840
 you can do with the tortilla machine 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.620
 with a plastic we are going to add a 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.620
 little bit of water 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.160
 with your hands lenses 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.640
 at that stage 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.649
 and we are going to extend what can be 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.620
 but not so much so that I can also 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.000
 take off what 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.000
 plus 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 two 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.200
 the water is going to help you so that you do not 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.190
 stick both your apple and clean and go 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.190
 to start extending 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.090
 above 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.090
 down 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.770
 so that the little fox can reach us 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.770
 our apple 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.270
 If you see that you start to hit your 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.439
 hands again with water 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.439
 and we do the same 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.880
 try not to see 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.880
 the Apple 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.350
 and we leave the bit where you see our 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.940
 country 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.940
 we are going to extend everything very well 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.780
 and now try to shape it 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.880
 and so we will stay 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.860
 you are going to introduce the stick with 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.860
 watch out 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.410
 and if it was mistreated it again accommodates 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.630
 and taking advantage of that humidity, we're going 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.630
 to sprinkle the chile 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.590
 and so we will be 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.390
 to decorate you can put a coffee 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.069
 or I do not remember what it's called 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.069
 you only make him an ojito 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.170
 and so it could be nothing more 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.270
 you can put in a bag of cellophane 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.770
 and when you close you put a little bow and 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.770
 It would be great for a gift 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.720
 as you can see it is not so difficult is 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.270
 very fast 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.500
 if you liked comments leave me a little finger 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:47.090
