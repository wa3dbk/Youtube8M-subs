00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
but it's a very serious game focusing on

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.200 
but it's a very serious game focusing on
civilians<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.890> happens<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> fictional<00:01:00.030> city

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
background we've made it on a purpose to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.750 
background we've made it on a purpose to
stay<00:01:04.890> away<00:01:05.070> from<00:01:05.129> any<00:01:05.489> political

stay away from any political
connotations<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.840> simply<00:01:07.170> wanted<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.590> show

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
connotations we simply wanted to show

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.280 
connotations we simply wanted to show
how<00:01:08.189> people<00:01:08.340> suffer<00:01:08.790> when<00:01:09.299> when<00:01:09.630> there's<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
how people suffer when when there's a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.910 
how people suffer when when there's a
war<00:01:11.180> surrounding<00:01:12.180> them<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.689> that's<00:01:13.409> why<00:01:13.890> I

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
war surrounding them and that's why I

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.340 
war surrounding them and that's why I
would<00:01:14.250> call<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.729> very<00:01:14.880> serious<00:01:15.180> game<00:01:15.659> so

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
would call it a very serious game so

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.670 
would call it a very serious game so
from<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> very<00:01:16.860> beginning<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.640> had<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.119> be

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
from the very beginning we had to be

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.039 
from the very beginning we had to be
very<00:01:19.680> careful<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:20.850> make<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.119> trivial<00:01:21.810> or

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
very careful to not make it trivial or

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.810 
very careful to not make it trivial or
too<00:01:22.229> shallow<00:01:22.530> because<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> very

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
too shallow because this is a very

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.450 
too shallow because this is a very
serious<00:01:24.000> topic<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.380> had<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:26.159> treated

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
serious topic so it had to be treated

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.330 
serious topic so it had to be treated
with<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> proper<00:01:27.600> respect<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.470> believe<00:01:28.829> we've

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
with a proper respect I believe we've

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
with a proper respect I believe we've
made<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.759> what<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.810> there<00:01:30.960> right

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
made it what we can see in there right

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.870 
made it what we can see in there right
now<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> beginning<00:01:31.740> there<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> three

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880

serious<00:04:22.690> stories<00:04:23.080> in<00:04:23.290> games<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.740> we<00:04:23.950> are

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
serious stories in games and we are

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.700 
serious stories in games and we are
doing<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.180> firmly<00:04:25.540> firmly<00:04:26.290> believe

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
doing it and I firmly firmly believe

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.560 
doing it and I firmly firmly believe
this<00:04:27.280> world<00:04:27.520> of<00:04:27.610> mine<00:04:27.670> is<00:04:27.970> not<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.300> only

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
this world of mine is not the only

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.560 
this world of mine is not the only
example<00:04:28.690> because<00:04:29.560> you<00:04:29.890> have<00:04:30.640> gods<00:04:31.180> will<00:04:31.390> be

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
example because you have gods will be

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.360 
example because you have gods will be
watching<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.110> have<00:04:32.260> that<00:04:32.470> drug<00:04:32.740> on<00:04:32.920> cancer

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
watching you have that drug on cancer

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.670 
watching you have that drug on cancer
you<00:04:33.520> have<00:04:33.900> papers<00:04:34.900> place<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:36.090> entire<00:04:37.680> trend

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
you have papers place and entire trend

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.860 
you have papers place and entire trend
of<00:04:38.920> games<00:04:39.760> tackling<00:04:40.660> different<00:04:41.320> topics<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:43.630> I

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
of games tackling different topics and I

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.080 
of games tackling different topics and I
believe<00:04:44.170> there<00:04:44.350> will<00:04:44.530> be<00:04:44.560> more<00:04:44.950> such<00:04:45.730> such

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
believe there will be more such such

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.870 
believe there will be more such such
games<00:04:46.390> and<00:04:46.720> so<00:04:46.990> it's<00:04:47.230> not<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.440> trend<00:04:48.220> of<00:04:48.430> some

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
games and so it's not a trend of some

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.580 
games and so it's not a trend of some
kind<00:04:49.120> of<00:04:49.240> general<00:04:49.720> I<00:04:49.900> would<00:04:50.080> say<00:04:50.260> it's<00:04:50.440> a

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
kind of general I would say it's a

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.520 
kind of general I would say it's a
process<00:04:51.070> of<00:04:51.220> maturation<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:52.330> happening<00:04:52.990> in

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
process of maturation and happening in

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.380 
process of maturation and happening in
movie<00:04:53.950> industry<00:04:54.520> as<00:04:54.640> well<00:04:54.820> as<00:04:54.880> few<00:04:55.090> decades

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
movie industry as well as few decades

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.090 
movie industry as well as few decades
ago

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
ago

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.310 
ago
so<00:04:57.610> if<00:04:57.760> you<00:04:57.880> think<00:04:58.090> about<00:04:58.270> for<00:04:58.750> example<00:04:58.840> a

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
so if you think about for example a

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.320 
so if you think about for example a
movie<00:04:59.500> let's<00:05:00.130> say<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.460> pianist<00:05:00.970> which<00:05:01.180> is

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
movie let's say the pianist which is

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.230 
movie let's say the pianist which is
actually<00:05:02.170> picturing<00:05:02.710> survival<00:05:03.430> of<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:03.760> guy<00:05:03.940> in

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
actually picturing survival of a guy in

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.550 
actually picturing survival of a guy in
after<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.140> war<00:05:05.350> in<00:05:05.560> war<00:05:06.010> so<00:05:06.310> this<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.270> what<00:05:07.560> one

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
after the war in war so this is what one

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.370 
after the war in war so this is what one
of<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:09.030> topics<00:05:10.030> is<00:05:10.390> one<00:05:10.630> of<00:05:10.720> mine<00:05:10.900> is<00:05:11.050> talking

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
of the topics is one of mine is talking

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.090 
of the topics is one of mine is talking
about<00:05:11.440> is<00:05:11.800> this<00:05:12.310> thing<00:05:12.670> and<00:05:13.530> we<00:05:14.530> are<00:05:14.650> from<00:05:14.890> war

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
about is this thing and we are from war

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.520 
about is this thing and we are from war
so<00:05:15.310> so<00:05:15.520> actually<00:05:15.910> we<00:05:16.060> have<00:05:16.320> grandfathers<00:05:17.320> and

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
so so actually we have grandfathers and

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.590 
so so actually we have grandfathers and
grandmothers<00:05:17.770> who<00:05:18.520> who<00:05:19.000> survived<00:05:19.390> two

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
grandmothers who who survived two

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.290 
grandmothers who who survived two
different<00:05:19.960> conflicts<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.790> they<00:05:21.790> know<00:05:21.970> it<00:05:22.150> and

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
different conflicts and they know it and

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.720 
different conflicts and they know it and
the<00:05:22.450> memory<00:05:22.810> is<00:05:22.960> living<00:05:23.380> so<00:05:23.800> doing<00:05:24.550> the

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
the memory is living so doing the

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.670 
the memory is living so doing the
research<00:05:25.060> it<00:05:25.360> wasn't<00:05:25.750> that<00:05:25.900> difficult<00:05:26.200> to

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
research it wasn't that difficult to

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.850 
research it wasn't that difficult to
find<00:05:26.860> people<00:05:27.160> who<00:05:27.480> who<00:05:28.480> knew<00:05:28.750> what<00:05:29.260> what<00:05:29.680> it

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
find people who who knew what what it

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.050 
find people who who knew what what it
was<00:05:30.100> to<00:05:30.580> survive<00:05:30.940> a<00:05:31.000> war<00:05:31.270> being<00:05:31.660> a<00:05:31.840> civilian

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
was to survive a war being a civilian

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.430 
was to survive a war being a civilian
working<00:05:34.060> just<00:05:34.360> about<00:05:34.540> the<00:05:34.870> goals<00:05:35.050> of<00:05:35.230> the<00:05:35.320> game

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
working just about the goals of the game

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.140 
working just about the goals of the game
I<00:05:35.710> mean<00:05:35.980> it<00:05:36.130> is<00:05:36.250> it<00:05:36.370> simply<00:05:36.610> to<00:05:36.730> survive<00:05:37.000> as

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
I mean it is it simply to survive as

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.020 
I mean it is it simply to survive as
long<00:05:37.180> as<00:05:37.360> possible<00:05:37.950> like<00:05:38.950> in<00:05:39.160> reality<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.790> war

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
long as possible like in reality the war

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.630 
long as possible like in reality the war
will<00:05:40.300> end<00:05:40.480> someday<00:05:40.930> you<00:05:41.530> don't<00:05:41.710> know<00:05:41.860> it<00:05:42.070> so

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
will end someday you don't know it so

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.450 
will end someday you don't know it so
the<00:05:42.850> game<00:05:43.060> randomizes<00:05:44.050> is<00:05:44.230> to<00:05:44.440> some<00:05:44.830> extent<00:05:44.860> it

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
the game randomizes is to some extent it

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.730 
the game randomizes is to some extent it
may<00:05:45.700> be<00:05:45.760> a<00:05:45.880> shorter<00:05:46.300> period<00:05:46.690> maybe<00:05:47.140> a<00:05:47.320> longer

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
may be a shorter period maybe a longer

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:56.490 
may be a shorter period maybe a longer
one<00:05:53.730> but<00:05:54.730> there<00:05:54.910> is<00:05:55.030> the<00:05:55.240> end<00:05:55.390> so<00:05:55.810> your<00:05:56.020> goal<00:05:56.290> is

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
one but there is the end so your goal is

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.100 
one but there is the end so your goal is
to<00:05:56.530> survive<00:05:57.100> the<00:05:57.310> war<00:05:57.460> and<00:05:57.760> that's<00:05:58.150> the<00:05:58.390> end<00:05:58.570> if

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
to survive the war and that's the end if

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.490 
to survive the war and that's the end if
you<00:05:59.170> can<00:05:59.290> make<00:05:59.680> it<00:05:59.890> with<00:06:00.460> everyone<00:06:00.850> that's

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
you can make it with everyone that's

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.390 
you can make it with everyone that's
quite<00:06:02.500> an<00:06:02.710> achievement

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
quite an achievement

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.390 
quite an achievement

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
this is a bit brutal but it's it

this is a bit brutal but it's it
pictures<00:06:17.830> the<00:06:17.860> the<00:06:18.520> game<00:06:18.880> pretty<00:06:19.270> well<00:06:19.390> it<00:06:19.570> is

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
pictures the the game pretty well it is

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.740 
pictures the the game pretty well it is
that<00:06:20.500> it<00:06:20.890> tests<00:06:21.400> your<00:06:21.580> moral<00:06:21.940> compass<00:06:22.150> so

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
that it tests your moral compass so

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.620 
that it tests your moral compass so
sometimes<00:06:23.410> you<00:06:23.680> are<00:06:23.800> forced<00:06:24.190> with<00:06:24.430> the
