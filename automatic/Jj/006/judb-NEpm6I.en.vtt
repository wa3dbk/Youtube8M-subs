that I bought and I bought it

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.220 
that I bought and I bought it
specifically<00:00:47.640> because<00:00:47.970> the<00:00:48.180> chin<00:00:48.480> guard<00:00:48.750> was

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
specifically because the chin guard was

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.180 
specifically because the chin guard was
really<00:00:49.649> thick<00:00:49.949> piece<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.460> foam<00:00:51.470> yeah<00:00:52.470> you<00:00:52.980> see

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
really thick piece of foam yeah you see

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.189 
really thick piece of foam yeah you see
it<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.789> them<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.480> used<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:54.930> further

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
it here like them it used to go further

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.119 
it here like them it used to go further
out<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.769> what<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.739> cut<00:01:00.559> see<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.620> cut

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
out but I what I do is I cut see I cut

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.340 
out but I what I do is I cut see I cut
some<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.030> foam<00:01:03.269> out<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.840> create<00:01:04.289> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
some of the foam out and I create a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.510 
some of the foam out and I create a
sleeve<00:01:04.949> or<00:01:05.339> pocket<00:01:06.300> if<00:01:06.539> you<00:01:06.600> will<00:01:06.929> and<00:01:07.520> then

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
sleeve or pocket if you will and then

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.359 
sleeve or pocket if you will and then
when<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.729> take<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.619> camp<00:01:10.619> when<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.160> take<00:01:11.340> a

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
when you take a camp when you take a

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.800 
when you take a camp when you take a
camera<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.229> it<00:01:13.229> fits<00:01:14.030> into<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> pocket

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
camera like this it fits into the pocket

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.260 
camera like this it fits into the pocket
the<00:01:16.020> trick<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.380> cut<00:01:16.679> the<00:01:16.830> hole<00:01:17.039> a<00:01:17.369> bit

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the trick is to cut the hole a bit

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.490 
the trick is to cut the hole a bit
smaller<00:01:18.960> than<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:20.759> actual<00:01:21.270> camera<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.320> then

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
smaller than the actual camera and then

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.930 
smaller than the actual camera and then
this<00:01:22.710> since<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.220> foam<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.729> kind<00:01:23.880> of

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
this since this is foam you kind of

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.669 
this since this is foam you kind of
force<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.690> and<00:01:24.899> then<00:01:24.989> and<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.530> in

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
force it in and then and then it's in

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:31.940 
force it in and then and then it's in
there<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.220> good<00:01:26.959> catch<00:01:27.959> drop<00:01:28.679> out<00:01:30.770> it's<00:01:31.770> in

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
there it's a good catch drop out it's in

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
there it's a good catch drop out it's in
there<00:01:32.160> and<00:01:32.459> that's<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.789> no<00:01:33.270> velcro<00:01:33.569> know

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
there and that's it no velcro know

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.150 
there and that's it no velcro know
anything<00:01:34.830> just<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.630> cut<00:01:37.410> some<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.979> you
