00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.760
 In 2014, razer released 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.380
 updated version of the famous 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.180
 mechanical keyboard block mind view 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.980
 the highlight of which was the use 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.869
 new mechanical switches 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.760
 today we get to know the model god 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.830
 Mind homo most advanced model 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.240
 ruler distinctive feature which 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.160
 besides using new 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.060
 switches is use 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.060
 rgb backlight 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.730
 the packaging is made in the traditional style 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.949
 raiser contains a traditional set 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.870
 keyboard and documentation with branded 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.460
 Stickers most appearance does not 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.370
 Has undergone changes since the times 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.140
 2013 generation before us already 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.180
 familiar body of chopped forms from 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.949
 matt plastic company razer 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.750
 declares that plastic resists well 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.790
 fingerprints but in practice it 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.290
 very far from reality and 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.089
 the problem is not even so much in the more bones 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.180
 how much difficulty removing prints with 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.180
 surface 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.390
 characteristic of mechanical keyboards 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.610
 high body profile and stepped 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.170
 keystroke immediately makes god chrome look 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.970
 master of the table 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.400
 I want to praise completely monolithic 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.470
 the design however despite the solid 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.880
 weight and a half kilograms of stability 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.110
 the keyboard on the table we have 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.240
 blame for what 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.260
 obviously not enough rubber area 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.510
 keyboard legs 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.310
 classic version layout added 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.080
 five programmable keys on 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.000
 which you can assign any action to 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.010
 including macros and big claims 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.360
 There is a co- keyboard keyboard engraving 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.920
 performed qualitatively however 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.080
 Cyrillic characters are located 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.729
 too close to the latin letters that in 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.950
 combined with certain colors and 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.110
 brightness levels make them difficult to read 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.240
 Here is the highlight is definitely write 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.100
 advantage each key is equipped 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.810
 own rgb diodes to the same 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.030
 the area between the keys is highlighted 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.800
 which looks quite impressive in a raiser 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.900
 have provided incredibly wide 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.790
 opportunities to adjust the color of the animation 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.310
 and backlight settings for each key 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.080
 The chrome sight unit is equipped with an additional 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.250
 usb port and audio connectors for 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.840
 headset connection 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.880
 but their location on the right side 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.769
 causes questions as connected 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.310
 peripherals can interfere with the mouse in case 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.310
 if you are right handed 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.230
 One of the highlights of the keyboard is 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.450
 use of mechanical 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.980
 switches being requested 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.870
 razer own development 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.280
 razer version 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.409
 blackwidow chroma is equipped 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.209
 switches raiser green switch on 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.629
 properties they are very similar to cherry mx 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.760
 blue 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.010
 distinct moment of operation and loud 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.530
 scream but began to move more easily and 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.540
 the sound is above the overall feeling of playing on 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.159
 height and here's a long typing 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.930
 classes are quite tiring and 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.150
 razer declares for its 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.340
 switches increased reliability 60 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:52.299
 million clicks against 50 million y 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:54.250
 mx series for keyboard configuration 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.629
 used synapse 20 allowing 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.879
 assign any action to any 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.950
 key create macros regulate 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.659
 highlighting the widest possible range and 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:08.439
 save these settings to your own 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:09.750
 profiles eventually razer transition to 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:12.400
 own mechanical switches 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.019
 definitely a success it remains to hope that 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.239
 reliability of new mechanics in practice 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.190
 turns out to be the same as on paper to 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.629
 same single keypad worth 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.849
 note the widest possible opportunities 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.799
 on the backlight setting in everything else 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.449
 we get a familiar block mind 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.340
 high quality well-equipped 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.470
 mechanical keyboard with the usual 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.689
 advantages of well-known disadvantages 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.470
 the main of which can be called very 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.470
 high cost
