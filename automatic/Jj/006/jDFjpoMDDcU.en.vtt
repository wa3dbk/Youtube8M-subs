00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
fraction of a where that comes out I'm

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.899 
fraction of a where that comes out I'm
going<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.630> take<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.229> paint<00:01:43.439> off<00:01:43.729> but<00:01:44.729> if

paint face so this is my distressing
phase<00:04:20.530> which<00:04:20.889> I<00:04:21.039> put<00:04:21.400> in<00:04:21.549> in<00:04:21.820> step<00:04:22.120> 2<00:04:22.360> some

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
phase which I put in in step 2 some

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.960 
phase which I put in in step 2 some
people<00:04:23.199> do<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.410> after<00:04:23.680> they<00:04:23.800> wax<00:04:24.039> I<00:04:24.370> find<00:04:24.729> it<00:04:24.880> a

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
people do it after they wax I find it a

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.900 
people do it after they wax I find it a
little<00:04:25.120> bit<00:04:25.360> easier<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:26.410> get<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.919> chalk<00:04:27.639> paint

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
little bit easier to get the chalk paint

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.439 
little bit easier to get the chalk paint
before<00:04:28.389> the<00:04:28.810> wax<00:04:29.050> has<00:04:29.229> kind<00:04:29.560> of<00:04:29.620> sealed<00:04:29.919> it<00:04:30.099> so

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
before the wax has kind of sealed it so

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.900 
before the wax has kind of sealed it so
it's<00:04:31.449> a<00:04:31.509> little<00:04:31.690> bit<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:31.900> a<00:04:32.020> shortcut<00:04:32.440> but<00:04:33.039> it

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
it's a little bit of a shortcut but it

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.700 
it's a little bit of a shortcut but it
works<00:04:34.120> for<00:04:34.360> me<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:37.150> I'll<00:04:37.330> be<00:04:37.479> back<00:04:37.690> when<00:04:38.320> we're

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
works for me so I'll be back when we're

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.029
