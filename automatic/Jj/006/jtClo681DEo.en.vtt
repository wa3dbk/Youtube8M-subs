I think I like this mascara so overall I

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.400 
I think I like this mascara so overall I
think<00:03:49.220> this<00:03:49.610> mascara<00:03:50.000> is<00:03:50.209> actually<00:03:51.020> pretty

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
think this mascara is actually pretty

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.979 
think this mascara is actually pretty
amazing<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:52.239> if<00:03:53.239> you<00:03:53.360> want<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.569> try<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.750> for

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
amazing and if you want to try it for

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.360 
amazing and if you want to try it for
yourself<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.530> recommend<00:03:54.830> going<00:03:55.040> out<00:03:55.220> and

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
yourself I recommend going out and

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.940 
yourself I recommend going out and
buying<00:03:55.489> a<00:03:55.790> land<00:03:56.150> trying<00:03:56.720> it<00:03:56.900> i<00:03:57.110> think<00:03:57.739> is

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
buying a land trying it i think is

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.010 
buying a land trying it i think is
squeezed<00:03:58.670> similar<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.330> their<00:03:59.540> their<00:03:59.690> mascara

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
squeezed similar to their their mascara

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.520 
squeezed similar to their their mascara
but<00:04:00.410> i<00:04:00.470> think<00:04:00.739> this<00:04:00.860> may<00:04:01.190> act<00:04:01.580> be<00:04:02.239> better<00:04:02.690> for

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
but i think this may act be better for

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.199 
but i think this may act be better for
me<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:03.709> particular<00:04:03.800> enemy<00:04:04.430> because<00:04:04.819> i<00:04:04.850> have
