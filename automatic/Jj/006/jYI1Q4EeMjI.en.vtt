00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.470
 Have you ever seen Joe's kinda bs manga night talk of tomorrow ? 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.730
 8 years 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:17.800
 Among them, it is what Natsume two Sansuke has said but it was amazing but 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:20.860
 That's why I think I'll probably find it if I look for it with Niko raw anti or Niko movement etc 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.289
 It 's been a long time ago that it would have been alive or dead tomorrow 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.439
 If you look at the age distribution ahead of you all, you are young 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.900
 I can see that there are people who have never seen such a thing, but 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.349
 Therefore Man 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.739
 There's a thing of the housework that friends do not know in the last scene of Tteyuu 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:40.030
 Tomorrow Joe in is not this happens to another can become a pure white 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:42.690
 In this is also Somehow I at that time I've got a good Kano up Why do not Toka whether the dead 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.070
 Natsume at that time I was saying wow interesting 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.280
 Absolutely Tteyuu of sounds that comics try to write it a little 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:56.010
 In other words, the page progress is like this 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:01.260
 If it opens like this, it starts reading from now and ends reading to here . 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.710
 Whether it is because they wrote many years cartoonist flows absolutely such Fu as a physiological 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.740
 So I will go 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.780
 As for the scene which cries out, the main character turns to this side absolutely 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.340
 Progress to stop say Lotte quit or the wait, on the other hand Rutteru meaning absolute here to see 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.030
 In other words 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:24.400
 The Tteyuu If you are facing here because if the hero is talking facing here 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.400
 Say that if you are facing here in reverse in the What If advance what things 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.370
 It's a case to stop 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:36.530
 This has got attached to the body turned to the other physiological cartoonist 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:41.900
 Since the tension member sense seen of the store say such a thing whether dead or alive tomorrow Joe 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.720
 Organize supervision of cartoonist that was established at the time of the jujube in the say say a word I'm inelegant 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.620
 Do not say Joe tomorrow because it is like this 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.360
 You can see if you look at it, but it will be white at the end, and if it's another one I'll just sit back and sit 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.900
 It is alive that I can tell you 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.700
 I'm going to sit down and look at this, because I'm already coming 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:06.369
 This is the situation Once the dead cartoonist of maintenance and Tomo market say that it is in progress 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.780
 Would change in a physiologically here tree in absolute Kedomo it can be seen by human beings their man is back 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.350
 It is heaven company 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.000
 It's interesting 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.610
 Something 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.810
 What a creator is unexpected and physical thing is in the head what is called kapu 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.430
 Of course there is 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:30.000
 I think it's a loss if you don't see it as a personality either, because it's physical. 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:32.020
 Just because that kind of person is that Miyazaki Hayao's story and that the story of Shigeru Mizuki just before that 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.820
 Such a world to produce 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.940
 There is a reason to say that the expression comes out because it is the mental and physical sense of the person 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.940
 Fit
