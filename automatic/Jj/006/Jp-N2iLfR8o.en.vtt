gameplay<00:04:34.889> using<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.279> controller<00:04:35.669> was<00:04:35.969> pretty

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:36.299 
gameplay using the controller was pretty

00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:38.199 
gameplay using the controller was pretty
good<00:04:36.509> but<00:04:36.719> of<00:04:36.929> course<00:04:37.169> I<00:04:37.289> played<00:04:37.529> really<00:04:37.769> bad

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:38.209 
good but of course I played really bad

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:40.429 
good but of course I played really bad
but<00:04:39.209> then<00:04:39.419> yeah<00:04:39.629> the<00:04:39.809> controller<00:04:40.139> worked

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439 
but then yeah the controller worked

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:42.679 
but then yeah the controller worked
really<00:04:40.679> well<00:04:40.769> and<00:04:41.099> one<00:04:41.639> big<00:04:41.969> advantage<00:04:42.239> of<00:04:42.599> the

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:42.689 
really well and one big advantage of the

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.339 
really well and one big advantage of the
controller<00:04:43.399> using<00:04:44.399> asphalt<00:04:45.389> 7<00:04:45.509> on<00:04:45.719> Windows<00:04:46.109> is

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
controller using asphalt 7 on Windows is

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.279 
controller using asphalt 7 on Windows is
that<00:04:46.679> it<00:04:46.829> has<00:04:46.979> vibration<00:04:47.579> feedback<00:04:48.049> not<00:04:49.049> the

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
that it has vibration feedback not the

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.379 
that it has vibration feedback not the
correct<00:04:49.499> ones<00:04:49.829> though<00:04:50.039> because<00:04:50.219> it<00:04:50.579> vibrates

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
correct ones though because it vibrates

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.509 
correct ones though because it vibrates
only<00:04:51.749> when<00:04:51.929> you<00:04:52.019> hit<00:04:52.199> a<00:04:52.229> vehicle<00:04:52.409> or<00:04:52.889> when<00:04:53.429> you

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:53.519 
only when you hit a vehicle or when you

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:55.939 
only when you hit a vehicle or when you
hit<00:04:53.639> a<00:04:53.669> barrier<00:04:53.939> only<00:04:54.359> when<00:04:54.719> you<00:04:55.589> do<00:04:55.769> those

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
hit a barrier only when you do those

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.699 
hit a barrier only when you do those
things<00:04:56.309> it<00:04:56.549> vibrates<00:04:57.359> but<00:04:57.689> otherwise<00:04:57.959> for

00:04:58.699 --> 00:04:58.709 
things it vibrates but otherwise for

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:00.589 
things it vibrates but otherwise for
nitrous<00:04:59.159> or<00:04:59.369> for<00:04:59.759> breaking<00:05:00.179> it<00:05:00.299> does<00:05:00.449> not

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
nitrous or for breaking it does not

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.019 
nitrous or for breaking it does not
vibrate<00:05:00.839> and<00:05:01.229> the<00:05:01.439> vibration<00:05:01.739> is<00:05:02.009> linear<00:05:02.399> not

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:03.029 
vibrate and the vibration is linear not

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:05.089 
vibrate and the vibration is linear not
pulsating<00:05:03.749> like<00:05:04.079> what<00:05:04.589> you<00:05:04.739> see<00:05:04.919> on<00:05:05.069> the

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
pulsating like what you see on the

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.269 
pulsating like what you see on the
console<00:05:05.749> so<00:05:06.749> yeah<00:05:06.839> that<00:05:07.079> was<00:05:07.289> a<00:05:07.469> quick<00:05:07.919> demo<00:05:08.249> of
