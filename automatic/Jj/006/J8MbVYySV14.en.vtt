and went whoa and as we fact checked

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.410 
and went whoa and as we fact checked
that's<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.230> culprit<00:00:37.489> much<00:00:38.489> longer<00:00:39.149> fetch

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
that's the culprit much longer fetch

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.690 
that's the culprit much longer fetch
much<00:00:39.660> closer<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.140> us<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.829> thanks<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.520> the

pressure gradient between the high and
the<00:00:44.190> low<00:00:44.219> voila<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:46.170> again<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.890> was<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> foot

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the low voila so again it was a foot

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
look at what's on the way now we have

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.979 
look at what's on the way now we have
effects<00:00:59.640> that's<00:00:59.879> actually<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.449> Tasman<00:01:00.960> Sea

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989

swell<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:02.250> might<00:01:02.699> see<00:01:02.910> something<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.539> I've

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
swell that might see something here I've

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.679 
swell that might see something here I've
maybe<00:01:04.409> two<00:01:04.769> feet<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:05.129> Saturday<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.479> better

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
maybe two feet on Saturday it's a better

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.289 
maybe two feet on Saturday it's a better
shot<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.350> guy<00:01:07.560> another<00:01:07.890> long<00:01:08.299> 900-mile

fetch off the east coast of New Zealand
by<00:01:11.340> today<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.930> these<00:01:13.049> winds<00:01:13.740> are<00:01:13.920> verifiable

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
storms are kind of track in East so we

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.160 
storms are kind of track in East so we
don't<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.060> pointing<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.689> our<00:01:18.869> way<00:01:19.110> but

news there we got a much better swell on
the<00:01:34.799> way<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.130> wanted<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> show<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.670> this

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909

the way but I wanted to show you this
guy<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.409> current<00:01:38.040> swell<00:01:38.400> will<00:01:38.640> begin<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
guy so this current swell will begin to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.270 
guy so this current swell will begin to
fade<00:01:39.329> out<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.689> was<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> short<00:01:40.140> termer<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.920> then

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
fade out it was a short termer and then

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.240 
fade out it was a short termer and then
we're<00:01:41.700> down<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.990> while<00:01:43.200> as<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.040> trade
