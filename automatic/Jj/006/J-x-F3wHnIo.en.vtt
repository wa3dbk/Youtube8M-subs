00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.820
 by francesco chietti to the simonetta 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.559
 lamber the opponent in turn the renders 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.750
 bluffs for the first 15 minutes for one 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.330
 balanced challenge that is shown instead 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.640
 of clear Metellian brand 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.109
 the chronicle of the challenge opens with little 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.939
 rhythm between both parties 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.529
 at the eleventh minute dangerous ball 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.930
 under the door of the sells but the answer 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.119

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.800
 feet hitting the crossbar with a 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.090
 poisonous cross that risks 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.309
 mock de luca 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.020
 but the cavese is there and also annoyed by 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.700
 some guest restarts found at 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.190
 twenty-seventh the goal of the advantage 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.960
 the excellent defensive center parisi comes out 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.059
 great from his area and puts in 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.340
 motorcycle captain de rosa brushstroke for the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.320
 panzer borrelli current that bags the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.329
 first goal of the new series championship 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.340
 b the white-blue public rejoices 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.500
 at half an hour the guest reaction is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.250
 very dangerous it opposes the big one 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 de luca 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.899
 after a minute and pisani for cavese a 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.579
 engage the far defender rendese al 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.409
 36th the episode that could 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.570
 complicate life at the cavese 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.520
 the author of the advantage borrelli commits 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.770
 a reaction foul and is ejected 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.570
 the renders, however, do not take advantage of it 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.150
 also a great de luca intervention 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.909
 that the thirty-eighth is opposed to vicars 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.869
 and on the 44th he must capitulate for the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.270
 second time 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.580
 another stroke this time from the corner 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.830
 of de rosa and the defender with the vice 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.829
 of goals manzi heads the head 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.900
 doubling in the resumption the music not 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.240
 change is always the cavese not to be 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.220
 off-key is the conductor the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.200
 usually claudio de rosa in the sixth minute 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.790
 from the right it goes to easy easy 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.799
 as always puts at the center for 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.780
 the incorrent Pisan who creates the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.180
 Dominican triplet all downhill 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.920
 for the Metellians to the eighteenth and the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.170
 captain who engages severely in 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.610
 Greek corner at twenty-first thinks of it 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.549

 26th forces a detour on the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.590
 Greek pole 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.210
 the most delicious and last chance for the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.710
 the flag's goal makes it if the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.470
 get it for half an hour but the ball 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.030
 of asses of feet for Russian was more 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.550
 dedicated mistake it that reiterate it in 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.410
 net sign of fate haunted match 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.690
 for the Calabrians and a great final party 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.970
 for the cavese with the usual hug 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.970
 symbolic under the curve of the team
