receivers<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.909> game<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:55.380> then<00:01:55.950> there's

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
receivers for this game and then there's

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.230 
receivers for this game and then there's
three<00:01:56.280> different<00:01:56.369> areas<00:01:56.880> you're<00:01:57.030> gonna<00:01:57.119> be

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
three different areas you're gonna be

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.499 
three different areas you're gonna be
throwing<00:01:57.479> 10<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.170> 20<00:01:58.579> 20<00:01:59.579> plus<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.149> over<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
throwing 10 to 20 20 plus and over the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.959 
throwing 10 to 20 20 plus and over the
top<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.740> technique<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.460> gonna<00:02:02.670> vary

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
top and the technique is just gonna vary

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.800 
top and the technique is just gonna vary
slightly<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:04.170> each<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.509> 10<00:02:06.689> to

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
slightly with each one so for the 10 to

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.359 
slightly with each one so for the 10 to
20<00:02:06.869> yard<00:02:07.290> range<00:02:07.469> what<00:02:07.710> we're<00:02:07.829> gonna<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.129> is

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
20 yard range what we're gonna do is

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.279 
20 yard range what we're gonna do is
we're<00:02:08.940> gonna<00:02:09.000> precision<00:02:09.599> down<00:02:09.810> them<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
we're gonna precision down them to the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.080 
we're gonna precision down them to the
outside<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> left<00:02:11.640> side<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.940> field

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
outside so on the left side of the field

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.980 
outside so on the left side of the field
you're<00:02:12.239> gonna<00:02:12.360> throw

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
you're gonna throw

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.200 
you're gonna throw
passed<00:02:13.350> down<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:13.920> left<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.460> then<00:02:15.120> you're

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
passed down and left and then you're

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.760 
passed down and left and then you're
gonna<00:02:15.300> take<00:02:15.540> control<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.960> wide<00:02:16.200> receiver<00:02:16.650> as

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
gonna take control of wide receiver as

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.040 
gonna take control of wide receiver as
you<00:02:16.920> can<00:02:17.070> see<00:02:17.250> here<00:02:17.640> you're<00:02:18.210> gonna<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.900> know

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
you can see here you're gonna you know

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.410 
you can see here you're gonna you know
make<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.320> little<00:02:19.620> swig<00:02:19.920> 'l<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.730> inside<00:02:21.120> and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
make a little swig 'l to the inside and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.090 
make a little swig 'l to the inside and
little<00:02:21.660> squiggle<00:02:22.020> back<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.410> outside<00:02:22.590> or

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
little squiggle back to the outside or

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.120 
little squiggle back to the outside or
little<00:02:23.670> cut<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.240> little<00:02:24.450> cut<00:02:24.630> out<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.140> you

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
little cut in a little cut out and you

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.890 
little cut in a little cut out and you
know<00:02:26.250> don't<00:02:26.610> hold<00:02:26.880> turbo<00:02:27.330> while<00:02:27.480> you're<00:02:27.600> doing

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
know don't hold turbo while you're doing

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.540 
know don't hold turbo while you're doing
this<00:02:28.050> i<00:02:28.230> have<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.440> stress<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:28.890> because<00:02:29.400> you

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
this i have to stress this because you

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.040 
this i have to stress this because you
get<00:02:29.640> much<00:02:29.910> better<00:02:30.120> animations<00:02:30.750> when<00:02:30.960> you

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
get much better animations when you

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.760 
get much better animations when you
don't<00:02:31.290> hold<00:02:31.530> turbo<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:33.440> hold<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.590> catch

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
don't hold turbo and hold the catch

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.980 
don't hold turbo and hold the catch
animation<00:02:35.400> now<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> point<00:02:36.480> when<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.690> want<00:02:36.930> to

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
animation now the point when you want to

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.420 
animation now the point when you want to
throw<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.350> ball<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.740> when<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.010> defender

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
throw the ball is when the defender

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.400 
throw the ball is when the defender
turns<00:02:38.670> its<00:02:38.880> back<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.270> because<00:02:39.600> if<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.900> hasn't

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
turns its back to because if it hasn't

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.020 
turns its back to because if it hasn't
turned<00:02:40.530> its<00:02:40.740> back<00:02:40.770> there's<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.610> good<00:02:41.790> chance

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
turned its back there's a good chance

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.090 
turned its back there's a good chance
it's<00:02:42.240> going<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.480> get<00:02:42.540> picked<00:02:42.810> off<00:02:43.050> or<00:02:43.320> SWAT<00:02:43.620> so

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
it's going to get picked off or SWAT so

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.490 
it's going to get picked off or SWAT so
you<00:02:44.700> have<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.060> watch<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.480> defender<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.110> only

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
you have to watch the defender and only

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.170 
you have to watch the defender and only
throw<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.830> if<00:02:46.980> they<00:02:47.160> have<00:02:47.340> their<00:02:47.520> back<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.940> your

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
throw it if they have their back to your

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.240 
throw it if they have their back to your
wide<00:02:48.330> receiver<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.680> all<00:02:49.920> cases

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
wide receiver and this is in all cases

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.800 
wide receiver and this is in all cases
with<00:02:51.090> all<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.510> face<00:02:51.690> throws<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:53.540> it's<00:02:54.540> best

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
with all the face throws and it's best

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.240 
with all the face throws and it's best
against<00:02:55.110> one-on-one<00:02:55.620> coverage<00:02:55.890> but

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
against one-on-one coverage but

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.650 
against one-on-one coverage but
sometimes<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.820> can<00:02:57.000> get<00:02:57.120> our<00:02:57.360> double

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
sometimes you can get our double

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.070 
sometimes you can get our double
coverage<00:02:57.900> as<00:02:58.050> well<00:02:58.230> now<00:02:59.390> for<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.480> 20-plus

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080

yardarm<00:03:01.800> face<00:03:02.130> throw<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.910> only<00:03:03.150> difference

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
yardarm face throw the only difference

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.270 
yardarm face throw the only difference
between<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.410> 10<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.710> 20<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.130> you're

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
between this and the 10 to 20 is you're

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.790 
between this and the 10 to 20 is you're
gonna<00:03:05.370> want<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.700> precision<00:03:06.060> up<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:07.680> know<00:03:07.770> a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
gonna want to precision up you know a

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.230 
gonna want to precision up you know a
lot<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.070> guys<00:03:08.280> don't<00:03:08.520> know<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.820> difference

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
lot of guys don't know the difference

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.240 
lot of guys don't know the difference
but<00:03:09.510> if<00:03:10.020> you<00:03:10.170> precision<00:03:10.620> down<00:03:10.830> into<00:03:11.130> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
but if you precision down into the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.040 
but if you precision down into the
outside<00:03:11.580> on<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.120> deeper<00:03:12.510> ones<00:03:12.720> there's<00:03:12.990> a

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
outside on the deeper ones there's a

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.750 
outside on the deeper ones there's a
good<00:03:13.230> chance<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.530> get<00:03:13.800> swatted<00:03:14.130> or<00:03:14.340> picked<00:03:14.550> off

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
good chance to get swatted or picked off

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.390 
good chance to get swatted or picked off
so<00:03:15.660> when<00:03:15.990> you're<00:03:16.140> throwing<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.560> 20<00:03:16.860> plus<00:03:16.980> yard

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
so when you're throwing the 20 plus yard

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.880 
so when you're throwing the 20 plus yard
one<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:18.510> know<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.690> can<00:03:18.930> make<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.290> precision

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
one you know you can make the precision

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.150

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
catch now over the top is just a little

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.610 
catch now over the top is just a little
bit<00:03:32.250> different<00:03:32.670> it's<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:33.420> lot<00:03:33.570> easier<00:03:33.780> all<00:03:34.350> you

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
bit different it's a lot easier all you

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.760 
bit different it's a lot easier all you
have<00:03:34.710> to<00:03:34.830> do<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.100> throw<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.340> precision<00:03:35.790> pass<00:03:36.150> up

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770

face throw tutorials will be going over

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.330 
face throw tutorials will be going over
three<00:04:16.570> routes<00:04:16.840> today<00:04:17.290> and<00:04:17.859> this<00:04:18.010> would<00:04:18.130> be<00:04:18.220> the

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
three routes today and this would be the

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.250 
three routes today and this would be the
last<00:04:18.519> of<00:04:18.850> it<00:04:19.000> first<00:04:19.540> route<00:04:19.810> is<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:19.959> post

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
last of it first route is the post

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.170 
last of it first route is the post
corner<00:04:20.680> route<00:04:20.859> that's<00:04:21.549> where<00:04:21.699> you<00:04:21.790> gotta<00:04:21.970> take

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
corner route that's where you gotta take

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.030 
corner route that's where you gotta take
some<00:04:22.330> step<00:04:22.540> in<00:04:22.720> and<00:04:22.870> out<00:04:22.990> there'll<00:04:23.889> be<00:04:23.919> a

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
some step in and out there'll be a

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.330 
some step in and out there'll be a
little<00:04:24.419> diagram<00:04:25.419> of<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:25.900> on<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.290> next<00:04:26.560> clip<00:04:26.680> as

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
little diagram of it on the next clip as

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.860 
little diagram of it on the next clip as
you<00:04:27.520> can<00:04:27.639> see<00:04:27.820> on<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.030> right<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:28.539> you<00:04:28.720> can

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
you can see on the right and you can

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.320 
you can see on the right and you can
find<00:04:29.110> that<00:04:29.289> route<00:04:29.560> on<00:04:29.740> various<00:04:30.370> plays<00:04:30.669> you're

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
find that route on various plays you're

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.390 
find that route on various plays you're
gonna<00:04:31.449> precision<00:04:31.990> up<00:04:32.169> in<00:04:32.440> bullet<00:04:32.770> pass<00:04:32.979> and

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
gonna precision up in bullet pass and

really practice this want to get it down
because<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.520> does<00:05:00.699> take<00:05:00.910> a<00:05:00.970> little<00:05:01.180> bit<00:05:01.419> of

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
because it does take a little bit of

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.719 
because it does take a little bit of
timing<00:05:01.750> moreso<00:05:02.320> than<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:02.860> other<00:05:03.160> ones<00:05:03.460> but

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
timing moreso than the other ones but

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.460 
timing moreso than the other ones but
it's<00:05:04.240> really<00:05:04.600> worth<00:05:04.900> it<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:05.199> really

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
it's really worth it and really

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.800 
it's really worth it and really
effective<00:05:05.889> with<00:05:06.039> the<00:05:06.130> big<00:05:06.310> target<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:07.570> next

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
effective with the big target the next

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.060 
effective with the big target the next
part<00:05:07.960> we're<00:05:08.050> gonna<00:05:08.139> look<00:05:08.380> at<00:05:08.560> is<00:05:08.680> tight<00:05:08.889> end

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
part we're gonna look at is tight end

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.950 
part we're gonna look at is tight end
streaks<00:05:09.430> and<00:05:09.610> you<00:05:09.699> want<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:09.970> have<00:05:10.150> big<00:05:10.750> guys

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
streaks and you want to have big guys

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.990 
streaks and you want to have big guys
usually<00:05:11.289> like<00:05:11.740> gates<00:05:12.039> or<00:05:12.220> somebody<00:05:12.610> but<00:05:12.699> it

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
usually like gates or somebody but it

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.850 
usually like gates or somebody but it
does<00:05:13.180> work<00:05:13.389> with<00:05:13.570> any<00:05:13.840> tight<00:05:14.139> end<00:05:14.500> it's<00:05:14.620> just

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
does work with any tight end it's just

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.920 
does work with any tight end it's just
especially<00:05:15.039> nice<00:05:15.550> with<00:05:15.760> gates<00:05:16.000> because<00:05:16.780> if

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
especially nice with gates because if

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.810 
especially nice with gates because if
he's<00:05:17.110> on<00:05:17.229> top<00:05:17.500> of<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.740> defender<00:05:18.070> you<00:05:18.639> don't

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
he's on top of the defender you don't

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.750 
he's on top of the defender you don't
have<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.120> make<00:05:19.240> any<00:05:19.479> adjustments<00:05:20.020> as<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.110> user

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
have to make any adjustments as a user

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.150 
have to make any adjustments as a user
what<00:05:21.760> if<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:22.000> defender<00:05:22.389> is<00:05:22.419> on<00:05:22.570> top<00:05:22.750> of<00:05:22.780> him

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
what if the defender is on top of him

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.680 
what if the defender is on top of him
what<00:05:24.160> I<00:05:24.190> like<00:05:24.400> to<00:05:24.520> do<00:05:24.669> is<00:05:24.789> make<00:05:24.970> a<00:05:25.000> little<00:05:25.330> cut

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
what I like to do is make a little cut

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.629 
what I like to do is make a little cut
towards<00:05:26.229> the<00:05:26.289> outside<00:05:26.650> so<00:05:27.220> if<00:05:27.370> you're<00:05:27.520> on<00:05:27.580> the

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
towards the outside so if you're on the

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.700 
towards the outside so if you're on the
right<00:05:27.760> side<00:05:28.000> of<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.180> field<00:05:28.389> a<00:05:28.630> little<00:05:29.410> cut<00:05:29.590> to

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
right side of the field a little cut to

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.240 
right side of the field a little cut to
the<00:05:29.830> right

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
the right

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.790 
the right
they<00:05:30.460> found<00:05:30.760> the<00:05:30.820> left<00:05:31.000> side<00:05:31.150> of<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:31.330> field

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
they found the left side of the field

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.310 
they found the left side of the field
respectively<00:05:32.800> a<00:05:33.039> little<00:05:33.669> cut<00:05:33.820> to<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.060> left<00:05:34.320> it

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
respectively a little cut to the left it

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.260 
respectively a little cut to the left it
just<00:05:35.380> makes<00:05:35.830> it<00:05:36.039> have<00:05:36.639> him<00:05:36.910> have<00:05:37.150> a<00:05:37.180> better

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
just makes it have him have a better

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.270 
just makes it have him have a better
animation<00:05:38.050> but<00:05:38.500> as<00:05:38.620> you<00:05:38.740> can<00:05:38.830> see<00:05:38.889> when<00:05:39.160> he's

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
animation but as you can see when he's

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.089 
animation but as you can see when he's
on<00:05:39.400> top<00:05:39.669> of<00:05:39.699> the<00:05:39.880> quad<00:05:40.500> defender<00:05:41.500> you<00:05:41.919> don't

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099 
on top of the quad defender you don't

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:43.860 
on top of the quad defender you don't
have<00:05:42.250> to<00:05:42.370> make<00:05:42.490> that<00:05:42.729> cut<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.210> you<00:05:43.300> can<00:05:43.660> treat

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
have to make that cut and you can treat

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.930 
have to make that cut and you can treat
it<00:05:44.020> just<00:05:44.139> like<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.470> over-the-top

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
it just like the over-the-top

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.480 
it just like the over-the-top
pass<00:05:46.510> from<00:05:46.780> the<00:05:46.900> last<00:05:47.110> tutorial<00:05:47.320> but<00:05:48.250> when<00:05:48.400> the

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
pass from the last tutorial but when the

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.740 
pass from the last tutorial but when the
defender<00:05:48.880> is<00:05:48.940> in<00:05:49.000> front<00:05:49.210> of<00:05:49.330> them<00:05:49.449> you<00:05:49.539> want<00:05:49.630> to

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
defender is in front of them you want to

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.469 
defender is in front of them you want to
make<00:05:49.990> that<00:05:50.110> little<00:05:50.680> step<00:05:51.430> to<00:05:51.639> the<00:05:51.729> outside<00:05:52.180> and

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
make that little step to the outside and

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.270 
make that little step to the outside and
that's<00:05:52.570> gonna<00:05:52.810> make<00:05:53.410> it<00:05:53.560> difficult<00:05:53.740> for<00:05:54.039> him

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
that's gonna make it difficult for him

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.100 
that's gonna make it difficult for him
to<00:05:54.370> defend<00:05:54.490> that<00:05:54.820> ball<00:05:55.000> swatted<00:05:55.539> down<00:05:55.690> and<00:05:55.960> on

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
to defend that ball swatted down and on

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.800 
to defend that ball swatted down and on
and/or<00:05:56.530> picket<00:05:56.979> now<00:05:57.760> the<00:05:57.820> streak<00:05:58.330> angle

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
and/or picket now the streak angle

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.180 
and/or picket now the streak angle
routes<00:05:58.960> is<00:05:59.139> the<00:05:59.260> next<00:05:59.560> routes<00:05:59.770> these<00:06:00.039> are

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
routes is the next routes these are

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.920 
routes is the next routes these are
slightly<00:06:00.580> different<00:06:00.820> than<00:06:01.120> regular<00:06:01.330> streaks

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
slightly different than regular streaks

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.020 
slightly different than regular streaks
because<00:06:02.139> they're<00:06:02.889> slightly<00:06:03.190> angled<00:06:03.760> towards

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
because they're slightly angled towards

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.330 
because they're slightly angled towards
the<00:06:04.090> sideline<00:06:04.539> and<00:06:04.780> you're<00:06:05.650> always<00:06:06.099> been<00:06:06.310> a

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
the sideline and you're always been a

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.189 
the sideline and you're always been a
precision<00:06:06.760> up<00:06:07.060> bullet<00:06:07.330> pass<00:06:07.479> these<00:06:07.750> no<00:06:07.990> matter

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
precision up bullet pass these no matter

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.290 
precision up bullet pass these no matter
the<00:06:08.380> distance<00:06:08.590> there's<00:06:09.130> no<00:06:09.310> three<00:06:10.000> different

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
the distance there's no three different

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.189 
the distance there's no three different
distances<00:06:10.780> and<00:06:11.460> when<00:06:12.460> you<00:06:13.300> do<00:06:13.479> these<00:06:13.690> you<00:06:14.020> want

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
distances and when you do these you want

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.379 
distances and when you do these you want
to<00:06:14.260> cut<00:06:14.470> in<00:06:14.740> just<00:06:14.770> slightly<00:06:15.280> with<00:06:16.120> the<00:06:16.150> wide

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
to cut in just slightly with the wide

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:18.000 
to cut in just slightly with the wide
receiver<00:06:16.750> and<00:06:16.960> then<00:06:17.229> go<00:06:17.409> ahead<00:06:17.500> and<00:06:17.650> make<00:06:17.860> the

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
receiver and then go ahead and make the

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.029 
receiver and then go ahead and make the
grab<00:06:18.220> similar<00:06:19.210> to<00:06:19.360> the<00:06:19.510> tight<00:06:19.900> end<00:06:19.930> from<00:06:20.889> the

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
grab similar to the tight end from the

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.279 
grab similar to the tight end from the
previous<00:06:21.430> example<00:06:21.969> is<00:06:22.090> just<00:06:22.240> a<00:06:22.419> small<00:06:22.780> step<00:06:22.960> in

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
previous example is just a small step in

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.020 
previous example is just a small step in
you<00:06:23.530> don't<00:06:23.620> have<00:06:23.770> to<00:06:24.010> take<00:06:24.190> the<00:06:24.400> step<00:06:24.639> back<00:06:24.820> out

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
you don't have to take the step back out

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.860 
you don't have to take the step back out
you<00:06:25.180> just<00:06:25.389> take<00:06:25.539> this

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
you just take this

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.960 
you just take this
small<00:06:26.110> step<00:06:26.440> towards<00:06:27.010> the<00:06:27.100> inside<00:06:27.430> and<00:06:27.760> make

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
small step towards the inside and make

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.360 
small step towards the inside and make
the<00:06:28.030> grab<00:06:28.330> on<00:06:28.930> the<00:06:29.260> right<00:06:29.410> side<00:06:29.650> you<00:06:29.860> cut<00:06:30.070> in<00:06:30.190> to

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
the grab on the right side you cut in to

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.010 
the grab on the right side you cut in to
the<00:06:30.490> left<00:06:30.700> on<00:06:31.000> the<00:06:31.120> left<00:06:31.150> side<00:06:31.540> of<00:06:31.690> the<00:06:31.780> field

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
the left on the left side of the field
