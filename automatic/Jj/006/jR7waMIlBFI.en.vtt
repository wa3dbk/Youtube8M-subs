00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.359
 It's like a kind of bullfighter 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.400
 a weapon always to the body clean but 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.890
 has its part of sport has its part 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.730
 of the gladiator has its artistic part 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.730
 Of course 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.399
 art is what you want 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.440
 express in conformity you live it you go 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.950
 to convey to the people I want to tell you 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.730
 if you are of 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.450
 the quiet one and he makes that cut of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.650
 quiet way what are you going to 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.050
 reflect well to the public is not very 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.910
 difficult to explain but it is the sensation 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.310
 that you have inside you are going to express 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.110
 outside and I think there are moments in the 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.590
 clipping despite being something very ephemeral 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.740
 There are times when you can reach 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.810
 show 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 I've seen bulls that have reduced 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.390
 onslaught with the starting leg 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.729
 seen to have reduced the onslaught and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.960
 has created a magical moment let's say what 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.400
 good that people have risen the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.450
 seat and that means that there are 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.450
 there is something special 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.049
 my grandfather was the white my father is the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.049
 white my relatives are not 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.810
 trimmers but they have in the first 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.759
 contest that I signed up 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.950
 They asked me names and surnames and ID 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.319
 obviously and they told me some pseudonym 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.079
 and I thought and said look at the white and the 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:49.530
 white has remained is also a nickname 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.899
 of many bullfighters also above all 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.960
 banderilleros was the great blanket and 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.659
 well I liked it there and I've used it 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.349
 the white is a friend the white is a 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.590
 good person the white is an uncle 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:07.850
 wanted by the fans of albo al carrer 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.819
 of the world of popular festivities 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.640
 and maybe maybe the reference is the 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.120
 Quoted reference cutout 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.120
 Valencian 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.109
 the gladiator because I think that 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.450
 especially the moments that we are in 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.939
 the horse yard before leaving in 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.400
 the presentation and such I think it's 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:35.209
 good that there the fear behind the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.060
 ancient roman people in the stands 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.829
 with desire for strong emotions and you are 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.970
 the protagonist who has to do 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:47.060
 those emotions and that is complicate lives 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.230
 give yourself a feeling 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.230
 of gladiator not 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:04.430
 the face of your relatives and suffering 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:06.740
 be about to have exact that is 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.480
 something more serious and good are the 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.819
 harder times where worse is happening 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.640
 is that it is the hardest part of the party how 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.709
 one of that has come out because it is very 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.810
 complicated you have to start over 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.580
 is you have fallen you have to go back to 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.170
 lift you have to mentalize yourself that of 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.299
 you can really convince a 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.769
 yourself that you can follow the 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.510
 problem is when it happens again not 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.010
 it seems to happen to you once and it's a 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.379
 Roulette and it says good until I get back 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.590
 to touch but it's not a danger and it's there 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.989
 and you have to keep it in mind and about 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.810
 therefore all have confidence in oneself 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.810
 what can you do with it? 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.519
 late 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.750
