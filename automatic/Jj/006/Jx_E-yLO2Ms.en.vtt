00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
when I was in need of a fish finder

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.410 
when I was in need of a fish finder
mounting<00:00:10.510> solution<00:00:10.750> I<00:00:11.790> called<00:00:12.790> my<00:00:12.940> friend<00:00:13.210> way

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
mounting solution I called my friend way

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.280 
mounting solution I called my friend way
to<00:00:13.480> float<00:00:13.990> to<00:00:14.020> fanatics<00:00:14.770> and<00:00:15.390> I<00:00:16.390> think<00:00:16.750> we<00:00:17.080> have

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.290 
to float to fanatics and I think we have

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.400 
to float to fanatics and I think we have
the<00:00:17.440> solution

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:43.800 

you

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:51.220 

strap<00:00:44.810> on<00:00:45.140> each<00:00:46.480> screws<00:00:47.480> for<00:00:49.750> weight<00:00:50.750> has<00:00:51.020> got

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
strap on each screws for weight has got

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.110 
strap on each screws for weight has got
this<00:00:51.380> totally<00:00:52.040> dialed<00:00:52.250> in<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:52.730> figured<00:00:52.970> out

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
this totally dialed in and figured out

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.180 
this totally dialed in and figured out
this<00:00:53.600> is<00:00:53.900> where<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.380> straps<00:00:54.739> going<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.070> go

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
this is where the straps going to go

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.850 
this is where the straps going to go
through<00:00:55.430> see<00:00:55.610> see<00:00:55.940> those<00:00:56.090> slits<00:00:56.860> transducer

first things first using the four screws
that<00:01:25.759> came<00:01:25.970> with<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.570> system<00:01:27.310> we're<00:01:28.310> going<00:01:28.520> to

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
that came with the system we're going to

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.870 
that came with the system we're going to
attach<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:30.200> mounting<00:01:30.770> plate<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.369> came<00:01:31.579> with

the depth finder

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.279 
the depth finder
this<00:01:34.399> is<00:01:34.579> way<00:01:34.789> too<00:01:34.820> simple<00:01:35.390> these<00:01:35.539> holes<00:01:35.990> line

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
this is way too simple these holes line

trolling motor is going to mount here to
balance<00:01:54.590> things<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:55.069> little<00:01:55.190> better<00:01:55.490> I'm<00:01:55.670> going

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
balance things a little better I'm going

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.510 
balance things a little better I'm going
to<00:01:55.819> put<00:01:56.000> my<00:01:56.149> battery<00:01:56.659> box<00:01:57.020> actually<00:01:57.619> my<00:01:57.860> power

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
to put my battery box actually my power

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.200 
to put my battery box actually my power
center<00:01:59.149> on<00:01:59.750> this<00:02:00.140> side

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.990 

right<00:02:05.210> now<00:02:05.450> we<00:02:05.840> have<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.080> hot<00:02:06.530> system<00:02:07.070> okay<00:02:07.880> of

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
right now we have a hot system okay of

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.550 
right now we have a hot system okay of
course<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.360> can<00:02:08.509> decide<00:02:08.780> wherever<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:09.320> want

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
course you can decide wherever you want

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.710 
course you can decide wherever you want
if<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:09.890> want<00:02:10.160> your<00:02:10.430> depth<00:02:10.790> finder<00:02:11.210> on<00:02:11.360> this

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
if you want your depth finder on this

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.350 
if you want your depth finder on this
side<00:02:12.020> or<00:02:12.770> this<00:02:12.890> side<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.880> doesn't<00:02:14.150> make<00:02:14.240> any

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
side or this side it doesn't make any

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.820 
side or this side it doesn't make any
difference<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:14.960> then<00:02:15.140> mount<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.650> meet

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
difference and then mount it to meet

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:25.600 
difference and then mount it to meet
your<00:02:16.040> craft<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.700> how<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.210> want<00:02:17.570> it<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:25.460> you

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
your craft and how you want it and you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.790 
your craft and how you want it and you
can<00:02:25.760> adjust<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.240> thing<00:02:26.440> anytime<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:27.590> want

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
can adjust this thing anytime you want

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.470 
can adjust this thing anytime you want
to<00:02:27.950> but<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:28.550> real<00:02:28.820> simple<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.330> make

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
to but it's real simple to make

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.200 
to but it's real simple to make
adjustment<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.200> like<00:02:30.950> my<00:02:31.190> transducer<00:02:31.970> on<00:02:32.000> the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
adjustment I like my transducer on the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.890 
adjustment I like my transducer on the
inside<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.230> put-upon<00:02:33.530> 10<00:02:34.300> way<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.330> can<00:02:35.600> fold

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
inside of the put-upon 10 way I can fold

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:46.480 
inside of the put-upon 10 way I can fold
the<00:02:36.080> transducer<00:02:36.709> up<00:02:36.890> one<00:02:37.070> on<00:02:37.190> traveling<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:46.310> as

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
the transducer up one on traveling so as

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.760 
the transducer up one on traveling so as
you<00:02:46.610> can<00:02:46.730> see<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.900> transducer<00:02:48.590> will

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
you can see that the transducer will

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.220 
you can see that the transducer will
adjust<00:02:49.070> up<00:02:49.370> or<00:02:49.850> down<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:50.840> way

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
adjust up or down this way

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.800 
adjust up or down this way
as<00:02:51.290> well<00:02:51.770> it's<00:02:52.220> up<00:02:52.610> or<00:02:53.390> down<00:02:53.690> this<00:02:53.959> way<00:02:55.810> that

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
as well it's up or down this way that

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.860 
as well it's up or down this way that
right<00:02:57.230> there<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.209> when<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.420> stuck<00:02:59.660> the

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
right there so that when it stuck the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.000 
right there so that when it stuck the
transducer<00:03:00.470> will<00:03:00.620> be<00:03:00.740> below<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.220> waterline

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
transducer will be below the waterline

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.280 
transducer will be below the waterline
it<00:03:04.010> looks<00:03:04.340> about<00:03:04.520> right<00:03:04.880> that's<00:03:05.840> probably

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
it looks about right that's probably

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.740 
it looks about right that's probably
going<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.530> be<00:03:06.590> okay<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.250> can<00:03:08.000> move<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.300> up<00:03:08.420> and

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
going to be okay you can move it up and

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.240 
going to be okay you can move it up and
then<00:03:08.989> tighten<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.380> back<00:03:09.530> down<00:03:09.590> while<00:03:10.070> you're

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
then tighten it back down while you're

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.030 
then tighten it back down while you're
traveling<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:10.910> when<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:11.750> get<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.110> loosen<00:03:12.980> it

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040
