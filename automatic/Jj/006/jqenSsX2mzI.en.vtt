well<00:03:51.980> usually<00:03:52.879> it's<00:03:53.180> breathing<00:03:53.569> and<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:53.720> would

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
well usually it's breathing and I would

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.720 
well usually it's breathing and I would
breathe<00:03:54.049> way<00:03:54.230> too<00:03:54.290> much<00:03:54.530> on<00:03:54.709> that<00:03:54.739> so<00:03:55.069> I

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
breathe way too much on that so I

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.030 
breathe way too much on that so I
definitely<00:03:56.090> got<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.360> work<00:03:56.480> on<00:03:56.629> that<00:03:56.690> but<00:03:57.040> my
