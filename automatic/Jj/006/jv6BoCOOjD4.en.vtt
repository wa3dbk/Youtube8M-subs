00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:15.437
 The war started. 

00:00:17.582 --> 00:00:19.891
 And at best, we're out of ammo. 

00:00:24.477 --> 00:00:26.520
 Director Fury, I think it's time. 

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:32.678
 Are you here with a mission, sir? 

00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:34.541
 Trying to bring me back to the world? 

00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:35.767
 Trying to save him. 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.524
 Doctor, I need you to come with me. 

00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:41.569
 What if I say no? 

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:44.968
 I'll convince you. 

00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:48.462
 What are you asking me to do? 

00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:54.316
 It's called the Avengers Project. 

00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:59.118
 I thought I was not qualified. 

00:00:59.849 --> 00:01:01.160
 Apparently I am ... 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.031
 ... how was it? Volatile, narcissistic and do not work well in a group. 

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:11.024
 I think they need some time. 

00:01:16.592 --> 00:01:18.132
 How desperate are you? 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.613
 Summoning such lost creatures to defend him. 

00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:28.799
 You've made me pretty desperate. 

00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:32.551
 We are not a team. 

00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:35.468
 We are a time bomb. 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.414
 This is unlike any training you have had. 

00:02:14.763 --> 00:02:18.241
 Guys, I'm bringing the party for you.
