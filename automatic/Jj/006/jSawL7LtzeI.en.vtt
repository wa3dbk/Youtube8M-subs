00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
might be blowing and now so we're going

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.740 
might be blowing and now so we're going
to<00:02:52.920> go<00:02:53.069> ahead<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.400> take<00:02:53.550> off<00:02:53.760> before<00:02:53.940> that

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
to go ahead and take off before that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.259 
to go ahead and take off before that
