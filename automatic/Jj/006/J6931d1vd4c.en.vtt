00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 the night time another thing to talk about 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.429
 and eat the guide a few times in sanaa 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.400
 enter just that fast 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.870
 in that period it is for example to think I will 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.030
 start doing it because it does not count 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.560
 have breakfast for lunch or dinner 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.560
 breakfast at seven in the morning, I go 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.480
 lunch only one thirty in the afternoon will 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.420
 dinner at eight thirty in the evening and stay 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.060
 six hours fast but just not 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.429
 prolonged fasting for a long time 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.390
 that happens online beyond the explanation 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.050
 that I gave 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.450
 is the problem is the following ours 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.890
 The ideal organism is the people consuming 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.760
 an average of five to six meals per 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.710
 day 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.899
 in number of every three hours our 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.219
 brain has no great reservations 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.469
 power 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.300
 he needs one of a kind people 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.340
 need to consume energy every three 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.949
 More or less hours, because otherwise 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.940
 brain really ends up generating it 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.149
 a weakness hypoglycemia collapsed 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.940
 drowsiness is of attention deficit of 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.470
 even concentration and mental disposition 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.600
 is totally compromised then who 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.030
 works at least part mental stays 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.340
 very committed and also to 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.390
 weight loss is not cool because it 's too 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.909
 fasting period 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.369
 You end up losing that lean mass. 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.900
 because the lack of glucose consumption 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.030
 We have a lot of psychosis 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.650
 little roni that glucose cell 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 quickly consumed 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.689
 when the glucose gel on substrates 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.070
 the main energy substrate for the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.850
 brain work 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.350
 ends up booking the body will produce 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.720
 from another substrate that the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.000
 muscle mass that day and then you end up 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.380
 losing we go there that cycle loses 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.380
 muscle mass 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.240
 The more our story you lose 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.979
 This muscle of ours has not played for some 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.990
 years deep to form glucose 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.880
 to keep my tasy to keep the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.500
 brain works properly 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.409
 only that the less muscle mass the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.479
 people have less to stay active 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.920
 metabolism because the subject is a tissue 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.070
 is basically active 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.659
 so eating few times is not 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.270
 interesting to eat several times 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.399
 We did not move forward in that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.590
 that for lunch and dinner 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.500
 desperately running the other goal 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.620
 thing too I said that a lot of people 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.590
 Does this take water in fasting there is 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.540
 enough people, that's what I feel 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.810
 that this guy is going to lose weight 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.209
 is actually joining water is key 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.810
 for our organism is our body is 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.489
 70% of water formed in the middle right only then 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.500
 you get an idea the active ball in 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.329
 resins it is good for our 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.349
 metabolism by water does not destroy cells 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:43.409
 fat not water who will see that the 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.389
 River levels because it is not our pro 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.840
 metabolism is interesting but not 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:50.909
 sluggish lose lose fat break 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.799
 your compliment direct salmon not 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.510
 now it is possible to lose weight or withdraw 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.849
 carbohydrate feed 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.079
 a lot of people do it in the 100 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:05.069
 there was the following carbohydrate 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:07.139
 has is the first is that thing everything that 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.870
 is carbohydrate is practical about that 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:13.949
 Cookie season in a bag is already 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.650
 another point takes work is cookie already 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:18.569
 have a cookie in all light portion 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.099
 put in the drawer recommends 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.720
 that person has just been well in charge 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.190
 it was all that ends date in excess goes 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.230
 accumulate fat 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.840
 Only his lack is also very bad. 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.190
 for our health roni including the 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.359
 carbohydrate it helps the training and 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.709
 antonin that helps to soften the 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.949
 anxiety 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.780
 so it's very complicated, it 's very 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:39.060
 complicated people take carbohydrate from 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.680
 power supply it has to be 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.030
 composed of all the macro and 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.060
 micronutrients only has to be of 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.909
 balanced listening to generate carbohydrate 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.370
 or coming exactly can cause 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.199
 You're fattening the other way around. 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.389
 in the future 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.430
 why why happens if you lose 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.220
 you take carbohydrate where carmen 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.079
 where ringworm will be produced in our 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.979
 book from which substrate through 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.650
 of muscle 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:06.329
 you 're like general ended up booking 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.930
 organism will produce from a 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.220
 substrate that are the deals on muscle 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.769
 metabolism getting slower and slower 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.180
 because there is a loss of muscle mass 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.250
 consequently you get fat 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.049
 because it also has that 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.400
 compensation you stop eating 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.900
 carbohydrate 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.000
 when you come back for food 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.840
 Barbosa wants to eat compulsively 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.969
 what he missed and at night he ate a 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.430
 carbohydrate at night then at night where 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:36.120
 that's the idea is the following at night 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.710
 you eat nothing excessive because our 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.570
 body is programmed to sleep 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.560
 then on the table and it's getting more 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.300
 slow on the carlos carlos does not play is 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.940
 important such a dinner is a meal 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.000
 important but will not dinner 10 11 da 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.349
 Night eats early as well as by 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.740
 example a good quality carbohydrate 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:57.419
 a parent better source of fiber like rice 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.479
 integral carbohydrate that also has the 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.760
 see our how he did this type of 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.680
 project is interesting even in excess 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.240
 Yes a balanced meal but not a 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.180
 is cutting carb night 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.599
 required the integral on Sundays 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.389
 that white is not the same thing 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.590
 which will change the nutritional quality 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.270
 have more fiber plus one customer 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.310
 but it's cooler too that I leave you 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.229
 much prettier and will leave you more 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.969
 also that it satiates much more than the 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.450
 white bread running for us wins 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:29.940
 time here miracle diets your diet 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.669
 of carbohydrates I do not know what diet says 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.000
 beverly hills diet moon diet 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.760
 pineapple diet and web the earring xix no 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.639
 It's straight from shaq, not me. 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.949
 that is slimming and fattening know the 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.949
 local this worked ibrahim if option 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.349
 for it is not to lose weight and to 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:52.380
 lose weight but water based weight loss 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:56.159
 muscle and not fat because what 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.469
 happens is the brain of the person who posed tcd 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:00.870
 as a survival fabric of 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:03.300
 survival power guarantee 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.520
 so if you eat a feed 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.669
 much less than their need to 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.440
 calorie and micronutrients 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.060
 macronutrients organism stop loss 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.979
 fat is not 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.539
 who ends up losing more muscle and water 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.349
 and consequently the metabolism is 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.880
 slower 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:20.580
 a question that we ask that I have 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.339
 answered that they did not actually perform 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.430
 went up to breakfast is stupid 

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:28.590
 that even worth commenting are a 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.150
 item that has scientific reports 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.280
 showing that people who do not 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.080
 nothing in the morning has ever gotten any worse 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.370
 and has a higher incidence of diabetes 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.910
 cardiovascular diseases obesity 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.470
 resolved that the 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.389
 last question protein not fattening 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.370
 So why do people diet? 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.740
 of the protein now roni and 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.260
 all that is consumed in excess in 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.480
 ball well allocate the fat hydrate 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.530
 fattening does not matter none exists 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.510
 miracle 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:59.280
 today you will have the privilege of saying 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.910
