00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:12.790
 paccheri stuffed with pesto and wafer of 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.600
 very well scamorza 200 g of paccheri 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.269
 write it all is 100 g of ricotta 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.850
 dry a sprig of basil 30 g of 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:24.810
 peeled pine nuts 50 g of Parmesan cheese 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:29.410
 grated 8 thin slices of scamorza cheese 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.600
 a clove of garlic 3 eggs then in the 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.809
 breadcrumbs now all it takes is 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.880
 peanut seed oil for flour 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.760
 fry or if you want to do with for 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.750
 segalin lard to fry then oil 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.460
 extra virgin olive oil salt and for 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.170
 the extra virgin oil is used for pesto serve 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.880
 for the text exactly the first thing 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.290
 let's get away we throw the next one 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.120
 yes also because you know paccheri 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.090
 they need time to cook too 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.460
 if you used to tell me you don't cook them 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.840
 completely I will leave but also because there 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.090
 you have to cool 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.989
 then I'm grating some ricotta 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.969
 salt 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.090
 you can also use ricotta 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.490
 normal as long as it is dry me 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.260
 I recommend a good dry because not 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.290
 must have water inside 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.940
 in this case I make ricotta time 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.799
 of mascarpone the water of the paccheri 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.799
 we salted which part it certainly is 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:24.189
 was then spell mass I mix these 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:28.479
 two cheeses here and I put in it too 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.280
 a real grinding of pepper then we prepare 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.259
 the text is the text is the one with the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.060
 brazil I work with some exact 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.470
 Parmesan also makes it invented 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.570
 even garlic wo n't put it all 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.820
 because a handsome clove big but 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.220
 in short metals half spicchietto ce ce 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.500
 I put that aspect that we look at then 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.330
 partners that are 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.160
 no i'm out back so i know too 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.810
 the daniele salt no no i was in a 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.850
 moment 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.159
 never put rose in weight this 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.520
 case it must be perfect frank 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.320
 he looked very well, that's fine 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.149
 the over we're in. I wo n't pay it 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.680
 all I am put between pollio is fine 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:07.250
 in now it's fine so that's fine 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.869
 here we work it well 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.840
 in the meantime I have to do the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.700
 scamorza waffle that does not fry 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.340
 life this never stops in the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.489
 This pan is made in the oven so I have 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.260
 already in the oven almost because in the 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.790
 you make one pan at a time in black 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.450
 in the oven instead if you have two or three 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.420
 canvas to make in a single batch 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.209
 so just cut slices like this 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.120
 you scamorza we put it on paper from 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.220
 oven 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.080
 I go into the oven they were quite tall 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.299
 so about 200 degrees ventilated and better 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:50.150
 what was then while we also prepare 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:53.930
 the beaten eggs and so we will do then 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.750
 flour eggs and bread the usual breading 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.440
 in short, beautiful or drained i 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.120
 paccheri are still a little bit hard 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.060
 we must leave them for a moment longer 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.769
 however it goes well us for needs of 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.200
 television watch rizzi so yes 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.329
 filled it succeeds in families it becomes like 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.000
 the breaded flour flour eggs in wool 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:17.900
 wait until we are there 45 before 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.590
 get our hands dirty find out if it is 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.180
 ready the oil goes so that for me it is 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.370
 a signature ready 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:31.069
 then take the sheet I put you on 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.900
 a pacchero 2 this tiny we there 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.000
 is a small packet matteini 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:41.720
 let's extend the barbie camper out here 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.850
 the others we do three you come that I put you 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.920
 also these two 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.530
 meanwhile let's take a look also at the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.819
 scamorza because it must really that 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.980
 it is not only good to obstinacy 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.520
 merge yes because it actually does 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.470
 scamorza and soft so as you must 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.720
 people then have to leave it in the oven 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.920
 all right you have to leave them in the oven 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.200
 now 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.850
 we learn that these senses are enough 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:14.340
 via ready now I'm going to see 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:16.709
 wafer in the oven and then we begin 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.419
 implant them looks frank 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.370
 here are the hard ones you have to leave alone 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.870
 instant destiny and even sermons begins 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.830
 to solidify so you can do all 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.000
 these beautiful scamorza sails 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.950
 interspersed with paccheri, you want to test them 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.830
 1 rizzi if I would like to taste 1 min koo 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:37.760
 reese meta and we make methane healthcare goes 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.760
 well it really intrigues me
