00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.779 
here with the hose right now it's
outside<00:00:45.450> all<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.660> time<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:47.489> be<00:00:47.579> quite

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
outside all the time and to be quite

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.340 
outside all the time and to be quite
honest<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.480> seem<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:48.840> quite<00:00:48.989> tough

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
honest they seem to be quite tough

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.160 
honest they seem to be quite tough
because<00:00:50.070> one<00:00:50.430> day<00:00:52.670> this<00:00:53.670> spring<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.390> left<00:00:55.020> it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
because one day this spring I left it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.709 
because one day this spring I left it
outside<00:00:55.289> almost<00:00:56.250> all<00:00:56.699> night<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.360> believe

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
outside almost all night and I believe

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.180 
outside almost all night and I believe
the<00:00:57.960> temperature<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.500> down<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.680> four<00:00:59.039> degrees

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the temperature got down to four degrees

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.240 
the temperature got down to four degrees
Celsius<00:00:59.879> which<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.239> close<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> freezing<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.469> I

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
Celsius which is close to freezing and I

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.579 
Celsius which is close to freezing and I
I<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:02.969> terrified<00:01:03.420> absolutely<00:01:03.809> terrified<00:01:04.229> I

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
I was terrified absolutely terrified I

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.710 
I was terrified absolutely terrified I
thought<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.280> had<00:01:05.460> lost<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> is

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
thought that I had lost it because it is

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.240 
thought that I had lost it because it is
a<00:01:06.750> tropical<00:01:06.990> plant<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.710> they<00:01:07.830> really<00:01:08.100> do

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
a tropical plant and they really do

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.899 
a tropical plant and they really do
require<00:01:08.810> warmer<00:01:09.810> conditions<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.830> thought<00:01:11.580> that

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
require warmer conditions I thought that

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.880 
require warmer conditions I thought that
I<00:01:11.939> would<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.330> yellowing<00:01:12.900> leaves<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.470> there

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
I would get yellowing leaves and there

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.429 
I would get yellowing leaves and there
was<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> little<00:01:14.250> bit<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.520> yellowing<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.439> no

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
was a little bit of yellowing but no

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.749 
was a little bit of yellowing but no
browning<00:01:17.070> no<00:01:17.340> no<00:01:17.970> real<00:01:18.330> sign<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.750> displeasure

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
browning no no real sign of displeasure

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.460 
browning no no real sign of displeasure
it<00:01:20.759> seems<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.689> come<00:01:21.900> through<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.259> just

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
it seems to have come through it just

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.390 
it seems to have come through it just
fine<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.460> I'm<00:01:23.790> very<00:01:23.820> happy<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:25.560> say<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
that they're a lot harder than I once

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.679 
that they're a lot harder than I once
thought<00:01:28.979> I'm<00:01:29.400> not<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.240> again<00:01:30.479> or

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
thought I'm not going to do it again or

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.780 
thought I'm not going to do it again or

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.710 
at least I don't intend on doing it
again

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
again

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.890 
again
but<00:01:34.170> yeah<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.070> doing<00:01:35.340> really<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.610> well

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
but yeah it's doing really really well

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.350 
but yeah it's doing really really well
as<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:36.960> know<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.130> planted<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:41.360> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
as you know I have it planted in the the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.380 
as you know I have it planted in the the
hydrogen<00:01:42.840> beads<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:44.689> let<00:01:45.689> me<00:01:45.810> see<00:01:45.990> here<00:01:46.290> those

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
hydrogen beads the let me see here those

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.440 
hydrogen beads the let me see here those
those<00:01:48.390> terracotta<00:01:49.020> balls<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:51.030> some

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
those terracotta balls and and some

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.469 
those terracotta balls and and some
Spagna<00:01:51.899> moss<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.729> mix<00:01:54.030> because

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
Spagna moss so I like that mix because

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.230 
Spagna moss so I like that mix because
it<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.439> drains<00:01:55.950> really<00:01:56.310> free<00:01:56.549> freely<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
it it drains really free freely and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.490 
it it drains really free freely and
vanda's<00:02:00.240> don't<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:00.780> wet<00:02:00.990> feet<00:02:01.259> it's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
vanda's don't like to have wet feet it's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.830 
vanda's don't like to have wet feet it's
it<00:02:01.740> they're<00:02:02.340> really<00:02:02.490> weird<00:02:02.909> plant<00:02:03.479> they<00:02:03.689> need

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
it they're really weird plant they need

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.580 
it they're really weird plant they need
to<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.710> good<00:02:05.040> good<00:02:05.369> airflow<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.270> roots

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
to have a good good airflow to the roots

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.440 
to have a good good airflow to the roots
if<00:02:07.590> they<00:02:08.039> don't<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.459> good<00:02:08.670> airflow<00:02:08.700> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
if they don't have good airflow and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.410 
if they don't have good airflow and
there's<00:02:09.750> too<00:02:09.899> much<00:02:10.050> moisture<00:02:10.259> they<00:02:10.770> will<00:02:10.950> rot

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
there's too much moisture they will rot

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.640 
there's too much moisture they will rot
but<00:02:12.420> they<00:02:12.690> need<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.900> be<00:02:13.020> watered<00:02:13.230> like

really funny to me
most<00:02:22.409> people<00:02:22.709> will<00:02:22.799> grow<00:02:22.980> them<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.430> hanging

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
most people will grow them just hanging

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.390 
most people will grow them just hanging
and<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:24.569> roots<00:02:24.810> will<00:02:25.080> be<00:02:25.110> draping<00:02:25.830> down<00:02:25.860> and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
and the roots will be draping down and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.460 
and the roots will be draping down and
there'll<00:02:26.819> be<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.970> few<00:02:27.420> feet<00:02:27.629> long<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.290> and

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
there'll be a few feet long and and

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.130 
there'll be a few feet long and and
they're<00:02:29.099> just<00:02:29.310> uh<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.060> crazy<00:02:30.510> mass<00:02:30.870> of

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
they're just uh this a crazy mass of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.250 
they're just uh this a crazy mass of
roots<00:02:31.319> it's<00:02:31.620> kind<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.720> draw<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.079> whole

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
roots it's kind of the draw to the whole

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.280 
roots it's kind of the draw to the whole
plant<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:36.180> best<00:02:36.360> way<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.569> water<00:02:36.840> these<00:02:37.049> is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
plant the best way to water these is

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.259 
plant the best way to water these is
actually<00:02:37.500> dump<00:02:38.250> them<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.519> bucket<00:02:38.730> for<00:02:39.060> about

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
actually dump them in a bucket for about

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.059 
actually dump them in a bucket for about
ten<00:02:39.510> minutes<00:02:39.629> and<00:02:39.930> then<00:02:40.200> just<00:02:40.230> lift<00:02:40.769> them<00:02:40.920> up

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
ten minutes and then just lift them up

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.530 
ten minutes and then just lift them up
and<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:42.510> hang<00:02:42.900> them<00:02:43.079> to<00:02:43.110> dry<00:02:43.349> again<00:02:43.909> this<00:02:44.909> here

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
and and hang them to dry again this here

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.559 
and and hang them to dry again this here
the<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.049> roots<00:02:46.290> are<00:02:46.500> silver<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.299> they<00:02:48.299> should

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
the the roots are silver and they should

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.270 
the the roots are silver and they should
be<00:02:48.750> green<00:02:49.049> when<00:02:49.319> they're<00:02:49.470> well<00:02:49.620> watered<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.250> I

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
be green when they're well watered so I

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.119 
be green when they're well watered so I
usually<00:02:50.670> take<00:02:50.879> my<00:02:50.940> my<00:02:51.450> hose<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.310> on<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.579> mist

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
usually take my my hose and on the mist

setting very often I do the mist and I
just<00:03:00.599> go<00:03:00.780> around<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.640> mist<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.790> plant<00:03:03.060> and

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
just go around and mist the plant and

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.490 
just go around and mist the plant and
it's<00:03:03.900> amazing<00:03:04.440> how<00:03:04.620> quickly<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:07.230> roots

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
it's amazing how quickly the the roots

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.319 
it's amazing how quickly the the roots
will<00:03:07.739> turn<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.129> a<00:03:08.159> green<00:03:08.519> color<00:03:08.760> I'm<00:03:09.000> not<00:03:09.150> even

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
will turn to a green color I'm not even

doing this on frame as you can see here
now<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.519> roots<00:03:15.180> are<00:03:15.420> really<00:03:15.659> starting<00:03:15.900> to

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
now the roots are really starting to

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.009 
now the roots are really starting to
turn<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:17.010> nice<00:03:17.250> green<00:03:17.639> color<00:03:17.669> I'll<00:03:18.599> do<00:03:18.810> this

maybe this year if not this year then
for<00:03:41.340> sure<00:03:41.370> next<00:03:41.879> because<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.299> plant<00:03:42.510> has<00:03:42.629> just

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
for sure next because the plant has just

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.409 
for sure next because the plant has just
now<00:03:43.169> started<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.829> to<00:03:44.340> really<00:03:44.519> come<00:03:45.180> into<00:03:45.329> its

own and get some size and the roots are

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.819 
own and get some size and the roots are
now<00:03:47.609> developing<00:03:48.269> at<00:03:48.449> a<00:03:48.480> at<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.139> much<00:03:49.349> heftier

girth and the plant itself is looking

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.849 
girth and the plant itself is looking
much<00:03:53.730> more<00:03:53.970> substantial<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:55.290> other<00:03:55.410> one<00:03:55.620> here

takes<00:04:06.150> similar<00:04:06.540> care<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.769> believe<00:04:08.609> they<00:04:08.910> take<00:04:09.120> a

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
takes similar care I believe they take a

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.539 
takes similar care I believe they take a
little<00:04:09.480> less<00:04:09.720> light<00:04:10.049> but<00:04:10.709> still<00:04:11.040> they<00:04:11.220> like<00:04:11.400> to

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
little less light but still they like to

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.839 
little less light but still they like to
be<00:04:11.669> in<00:04:11.699> bright<00:04:12.199> situation<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:14.310> flowers<00:04:14.669> are

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
be in bright situation the flowers are

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.479 
be in bright situation the flowers are
really<00:04:15.120> cool<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.440> growth<00:04:16.859> habit<00:04:17.190> is<00:04:17.310> very

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
really cool the the growth habit is very

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.270 
really cool the the growth habit is very
similar<00:04:17.789> to<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.180> Vanda<00:04:18.660> except<00:04:19.500> this<00:04:19.590> one<00:04:19.829> has<00:04:19.859> a

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
similar to a Vanda except this one has a

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.099 
similar to a Vanda except this one has a
more<00:04:20.489> interesting<00:04:20.820> leaf<00:04:21.239> this<00:04:21.750> one<00:04:21.900> has<00:04:22.079> a

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
more interesting leaf this one has a

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.290 
more interesting leaf this one has a
much<00:04:22.349> fatter<00:04:22.680> leaf<00:04:23.010> but<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.909> leaf<00:04:24.090> has

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
much fatter leaf but the the leaf has

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.149 
much fatter leaf but the the leaf has
like<00:04:24.719> a<00:04:24.750> yellow<00:04:25.020> veining<00:04:25.560> so<00:04:25.710> it's<00:04:25.860> kind<00:04:26.099> of

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
like a yellow veining so it's kind of

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.700 
like a yellow veining so it's kind of
like<00:04:26.340> a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
like a

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.150 
like a
it's<00:04:27.340> really<00:04:27.580> really<00:04:27.759> cool<00:04:28.930> again<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.860> roots

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
it's really really cool again the roots

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:37.730 
it's really really cool again the roots
like<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:30.550> be<00:04:31.320> exposed<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:33.340> something<00:04:34.210> like<00:04:34.360> a

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.010 

either<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.919> net<00:04:39.160> pot<00:04:39.460> or<00:04:39.759> one<00:04:40.360> of<00:04:40.449> those<00:04:40.570> wooden

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
either a net pot or one of those wooden

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.920 
either a net pot or one of those wooden
slat<00:04:41.410> pots<00:04:41.800> would<00:04:42.520> be<00:04:42.669> a<00:04:42.699> good<00:04:43.240> option<00:04:43.509> for

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
slat pots would be a good option for

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.320 
slat pots would be a good option for
this<00:04:44.190> this<00:04:45.190> one<00:04:45.430> was<00:04:45.610> also<00:04:45.789> left<00:04:46.120> outside

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
this this one was also left outside

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.629 
this this one was also left outside
during<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.110> cold<00:04:47.470> night<00:04:47.710> that<00:04:48.130> I<00:04:48.160> forgot<00:04:48.460> the

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
during that cold night that I forgot the

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.600 
during that cold night that I forgot the
Vanda<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.180> this<00:04:49.660> one's<00:04:49.840> doing<00:04:50.139> well<00:04:50.520> except<00:04:51.520> I

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
Vanda and this one's doing well except I

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.460 
Vanda and this one's doing well except I
did<00:04:51.820> notice<00:04:52.060> here<00:04:52.930> I<00:04:53.110> don't<00:04:53.259> know<00:04:53.320> whether

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
did notice here I don't know whether

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.749 
did notice here I don't know whether
you're<00:04:53.590> able<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.830> see<00:04:53.979> it<00:04:54.100> it's<00:04:54.250> it's<00:04:54.550> pretty

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
you're able to see it it's it's pretty

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.950 
you're able to see it it's it's pretty
bright<00:04:55.360> against<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:57.389> leaves<00:04:58.389> I<00:04:58.539> can't<00:04:58.780> speak

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
bright against the leaves I can't speak

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.740 
bright against the leaves I can't speak
right<00:04:59.169> now<00:04:59.199> but<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.940> has<00:05:01.210> a<00:05:01.240> little<00:05:01.510> bit<00:05:01.630> of<00:05:01.690> a

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
right now but it has a little bit of a

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.580 
right now but it has a little bit of a
brown<00:05:01.960> damage<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:02.949> hopefully<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:03.580> that

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
brown damage so hopefully that that

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.200 
brown damage so hopefully that that
won't<00:05:05.590> go<00:05:05.770> away<00:05:05.800> but<00:05:06.340> hopefully<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:06.940> rest<00:05:07.060> of

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
won't go away but hopefully the rest of

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.900 
won't go away but hopefully the rest of
the<00:05:07.270> plant<00:05:07.510> doesn't<00:05:07.949> suffer<00:05:08.949> from<00:05:09.130> that<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.669> I

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
the plant doesn't suffer from that and I

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.490 
the plant doesn't suffer from that and I
do<00:05:09.970> have<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.330> new<00:05:10.570> leaf<00:05:10.780> growing<00:05:11.199> I<00:05:11.289> don't<00:05:11.440> know

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
do have a new leaf growing I don't know

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.860 
do have a new leaf growing I don't know
whether<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:11.710> can<00:05:11.800> see<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.160> in<00:05:12.539> the<00:05:13.539> center

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
whether you can see it in the center

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.290 
whether you can see it in the center
there<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.340> this<00:05:15.340> plant<00:05:15.669> eventually<00:05:16.180> we're

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
there and this plant eventually we're

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.140 
there and this plant eventually we're
gonna<00:05:16.389> pull<00:05:16.660> it<00:05:16.750> into<00:05:16.870> a<00:05:17.710> wooden<00:05:18.220> lattice<00:05:18.729> pot

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
gonna pull it into a wooden lattice pot

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.300 
gonna pull it into a wooden lattice pot
I<00:05:19.479> do<00:05:19.870> have<00:05:20.169> them<00:05:20.349> downstairs<00:05:20.770> I'm<00:05:21.010> just<00:05:21.190> too

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
I do have them downstairs I'm just too

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.189 
I do have them downstairs I'm just too
lazy<00:05:21.340> right<00:05:21.789> now<00:05:21.940> too<00:05:22.000> I<00:05:22.449> had<00:05:22.599> to<00:05:22.750> pawn<00:05:22.930> it<00:05:22.960> up

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
lazy right now too I had to pawn it up

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.350 
lazy right now too I had to pawn it up
I've<00:05:23.349> had<00:05:23.530> them<00:05:23.740> since<00:05:24.729> last<00:05:24.940> summer

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
I've had them since last summer

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.170 
I've had them since last summer
haha<00:05:26.229> story<00:05:27.220> of<00:05:27.340> my<00:05:27.460> life<00:05:27.610> I'm<00:05:27.849> really<00:05:27.970> really

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
haha story of my life I'm really really

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.560 
haha story of my life I'm really really
lazy<00:05:28.419> so<00:05:29.699> again<00:05:30.699> I<00:05:30.849> go<00:05:31.000> around<00:05:31.240> and<00:05:31.389> try<00:05:31.510> to

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
lazy so again I go around and try to

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.850 
lazy so again I go around and try to
water<00:05:31.810> these<00:05:32.050> once<00:05:32.349> a<00:05:32.470> day<00:05:34.380> making<00:05:35.380> sure<00:05:35.530> that

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
water these once a day making sure that

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.379 
water these once a day making sure that
the<00:05:36.010> roots<00:05:36.280> are<00:05:36.430> nice<00:05:36.550> and<00:05:36.760> green<00:05:36.940> and<00:05:37.210> then

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
the roots are nice and green and then

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.080 
the roots are nice and green and then
occasionally<00:05:38.020> I<00:05:38.050> will<00:05:38.520> plunk<00:05:39.520> them<00:05:39.639> down<00:05:39.849> in<00:05:40.000> a

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
occasionally I will plunk them down in a

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.000 
occasionally I will plunk them down in a
bucket<00:05:40.389> of<00:05:40.449> water<00:05:40.510> and<00:05:40.900> it's<00:05:41.470> nice<00:05:41.650> to<00:05:41.830> put<00:05:41.949> a

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
bucket of water and it's nice to put a

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.649 
bucket of water and it's nice to put a
little<00:05:42.220> bit<00:05:42.340> of<00:05:42.430> fertilizer<00:05:42.580> in<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:43.360> water

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
little bit of fertilizer in the water

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.140 
little bit of fertilizer in the water
when<00:05:43.930> you<00:05:43.960> dunk<00:05:44.260> it<00:05:44.349> down<00:05:44.530> I<00:05:45.159> usually<00:05:45.970> do<00:05:46.120> like

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
when you dunk it down I usually do like

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.820 
when you dunk it down I usually do like
1/2<00:05:46.539> strength<00:05:46.900> or<00:05:47.050> 1/4<00:05:47.380> strength<00:05:47.650> fertilizer

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
1/2 strength or 1/4 strength fertilizer

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.589 
1/2 strength or 1/4 strength fertilizer
it's<00:05:48.580> better<00:05:48.760> to<00:05:48.909> be<00:05:49.030> on<00:05:49.150> the<00:05:49.270> lighter<00:05:49.479> side

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
it's better to be on the lighter side

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.659 
it's better to be on the lighter side
with<00:05:49.930> fertilizer<00:05:50.380> than<00:05:50.919> burning<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:51.460> roots

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
with fertilizer than burning the roots

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.430 
with fertilizer than burning the roots
because<00:05:52.090> you<00:05:52.270> can't<00:05:52.479> go<00:05:52.599> back<00:05:52.750> from<00:05:52.780> burn<00:05:53.169> but

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
because you can't go back from burn but

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.629 
because you can't go back from burn but
you<00:05:53.530> can<00:05:53.650> always<00:05:53.770> fertilize<00:05:54.220> a<00:05:54.250> little<00:05:54.520> bit

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
you can always fertilize a little bit

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.770 
you can always fertilize a little bit
more<00:05:55.020> so<00:05:56.020> anyway<00:05:57.150> this<00:05:58.150> is<00:05:58.389> an<00:05:58.479> update<00:05:58.750> on

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780
