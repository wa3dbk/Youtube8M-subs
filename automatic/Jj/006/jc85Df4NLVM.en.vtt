00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.160 

paper<00:01:18.010> goes<00:01:18.280> inside<00:01:18.640> row

paper goes inside row

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:33.340 
paper goes inside row
finding<00:01:20.590> job<00:01:20.799> starts<00:01:21.250> right<00:01:21.549> now

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.560 

this<00:01:33.740> trying<00:01:34.010> to<00:01:34.189> zoom<00:01:34.390> okay<00:01:35.390> it's<00:01:35.509> unlocking

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
this trying to zoom okay it's unlocking

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.750 
this trying to zoom okay it's unlocking
it<00:01:37.900> has<00:01:38.110> started<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.680> food

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
it has started the food

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.510 
it has started the food
and<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:40.720> think<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:41.260> print<00:01:41.560> job<00:01:41.800> is<00:01:41.980> going<00:01:42.190> very

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
and I think the print job is going very

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.749 
and I think the print job is going very
well

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.430 

waiting<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:50.000> see<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.479> first<00:01:50.780> output

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
waiting to see the first output

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.340 
waiting to see the first output
to<00:01:52.500> make<00:01:52.710> sure

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.770 

it's<00:01:59.920> taking<00:02:00.340> wrong<00:02:00.520> time<00:02:00.790> we<00:02:00.910> couldn't<00:02:01.240> get<00:02:01.750> a

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
it's taking wrong time we couldn't get a

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:13.670 
it's taking wrong time we couldn't get a
preview<00:02:02.110> of<00:02:02.320> it

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.880 

so<00:02:13.920> we<00:02:14.250> will<00:02:14.400> not

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.960 

okay<00:02:19.850> it's<00:02:20.210> coming

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.930 

and<00:02:23.330> it's<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:24.440> think<00:02:24.770> it's<00:02:24.890> amazing

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:36.010 

very<00:02:28.540> curious

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.930 

Oh

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.400 

it's<00:02:39.720> perfect<00:02:40.380> underneath

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
it's perfect underneath

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:50.589 
it's perfect underneath
to<00:02:41.710> be<00:02:41.830> perfect

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:03:13.440 

it's<00:02:50.870> good<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.739> think

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.590 

I<00:03:13.480> think<00:03:14.020> it's<00:03:14.200> really<00:03:14.800> doing<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.340> good<00:03:15.490> job

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
I think it's really doing a good job

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.330 
I think it's really doing a good job
while<00:03:16.600> I'm<00:03:16.720> not<00:03:16.870> sure<00:03:17.170> how<00:03:17.410> wish<00:03:17.650> in<00:03:17.890> think

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
while I'm not sure how wish in think

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.449 
while I'm not sure how wish in think
it's<00:03:18.610> going<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:18.970> consume<00:03:19.390> over<00:03:19.750> this<00:03:20.130> but<00:03:21.130> the

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
it's going to consume over this but the

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:30.130 
it's going to consume over this but the
missile<00:03:21.880> seems<00:03:22.300> to<00:03:22.540> be<00:03:22.720> pretty<00:03:23.110> nice

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.460 

it's<00:03:31.010> going<00:03:31.400> good<00:03:31.580> I<00:03:31.850> think<00:03:32.600> you<00:03:32.870> can<00:03:33.050> see<00:03:33.260> that

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
it's going good I think you can see that

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.150 
it's going good I think you can see that
what's<00:03:33.740> happening<00:03:34.100> there<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:35.980> think<00:03:36.980> it's<00:03:37.069> the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
what's happening there I think it's the

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.840 
what's happening there I think it's the
last<00:03:37.400> pot<00:03:37.760> bringing<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.750> grass<00:03:39.020> or<00:03:39.260> something

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
last pot bringing the grass or something

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.770 
last pot bringing the grass or something
you<00:03:40.850> can<00:03:40.970> see<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.270> picture<00:03:41.540> on<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.750> right

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
you can see the picture on the right

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.490 
you can see the picture on the right
side<00:03:42.170> on<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.590> my<00:03:43.580> laptop

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.640 

okay<00:03:50.070> I<00:03:50.310> love<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.790> giggles<00:03:51.180> because<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.440> could

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
okay I love the giggles because I could

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.280 
okay I love the giggles because I could
spot<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.610> little<00:03:53.940> vegans<00:03:54.390> which<00:03:54.690> the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
spot the little vegans which the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.140 
spot the little vegans which the
printers<00:03:55.850> God<00:03:56.850> is<00:03:57.030> there<00:03:57.330> I<00:03:58.130> think<00:03:59.130> it's<00:03:59.370> way

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
printers God is there I think it's way

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.500 
printers God is there I think it's way
better<00:04:00.210> than<00:04:00.450> what<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.960> has<00:04:01.110> printed<00:04:01.680> here<00:04:02.510> in

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
better than what it has printed here in

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.390 
better than what it has printed here in
this<00:04:03.660> piece<00:04:03.960> of<00:04:03.990> paper<00:04:04.260> it's<00:04:04.830> very<00:04:05.130> little
