00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
a while and I i was getting much more

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
a while and I i was getting much more
stable<00:01:40.829> frame<00:01:41.250> rates<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.820> they<00:01:42.060> were<00:01:42.180> much

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
stable frame rates and they were much

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.789 
stable frame rates and they were much
they're<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> little<00:01:42.840> bit<00:01:43.020> fast<00:01:43.259> or<00:01:43.470> too<00:01:43.500> i<00:01:43.619> was

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
they're a little bit fast or too i was

they're a little bit fast or too i was
getting<00:01:43.979> about<00:01:44.130> four<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.520> five<00:01:44.549> frames<00:01:45.360> per

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
getting about four to five frames per

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.770 
getting about four to five frames per
second<00:01:46.049> higher<00:01:46.430> playing<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.820> window<00:01:48.180> and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
second higher playing it in a window and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.139 
second higher playing it in a window and
I<00:01:49.649> was<00:01:49.770> getting<00:01:50.009> fewer<00:01:50.280> friendly<00:01:50.729> drops<00:01:51.000> I

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
I was getting fewer friendly drops I

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.389 
I was getting fewer friendly drops I
would<00:01:51.270> still<00:01:51.509> get<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:52.110> every<00:01:52.470> word<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.130> every

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
would still get one every word to every

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.539 
would still get one every word to every
game<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:55.049> was<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> lot<00:01:55.409> fewer<00:01:55.619> than<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.250> was

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
game but it was a lot fewer than I was

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.240 
game but it was a lot fewer than I was
getting<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:58.409> higher<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.950> smaller

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
getting and the higher the smaller

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.219 
getting and the higher the smaller
increase<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.270> frame<00:02:00.509> rate<00:02:00.719> was<00:02:00.869> definitely

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
increase in frame rate was definitely

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.889 
increase in frame rate was definitely
noticeable<00:02:01.619> as<00:02:01.799> well<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.329> guys<00:02:03.479> are

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
noticeable as well so if you guys are

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.289 
noticeable as well so if you guys are
kind<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.530> boat<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:06.060> you're<00:02:06.180> getting

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
kind of in that boat and you're getting

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.050 
kind of in that boat and you're getting
random<00:02:06.659> framerate<00:02:07.079> drop<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.710> maybe

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
random framerate drop so you maybe

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.760 
random framerate drop so you maybe
you're<00:02:09.060> close<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.420> being<00:02:09.690> at<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.140> FPS<00:02:10.619> that

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
you're close to being at the FPS that

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.210 
you're close to being at the FPS that
you<00:02:10.890> want<00:02:11.160> but<00:02:11.910> you're<00:02:12.030> not<00:02:12.180> quite<00:02:12.360> there

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
you want but you're not quite there

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.220 
you want but you're not quite there
playing<00:02:13.460> it<00:02:13.580> in<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.760> window<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.780> does<00:02:14.960> take<00:02:15.200> a

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
playing it in a window it does take a

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.600 
playing it in a window it does take a
little<00:02:15.380> bit<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.650> get<00:02:15.770> used<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:16.220> do<00:02:16.340> have<00:02:16.520> to

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
little bit to get used to you do have to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.120 
little bit to get used to you do have to
kind<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.960> squint<00:02:17.960> or<00:02:18.140> me<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:18.410> squint<00:02:18.800> be<00:02:18.920> do<00:02:19.040> it

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
kind of squint or me I squint be do it

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.710 
kind of squint or me I squint be do it
to<00:02:19.220> focus<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.730> little<00:02:19.820> more<00:02:20.000> for<00:02:20.390> playing<00:02:20.600> on<00:02:20.690> a

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
to focus a little more for playing on a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.390 
to focus a little more for playing on a
bigger<00:02:20.960> monitor<00:02:21.200> it's<00:02:21.590> not<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:22.040> big<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.280> a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
bigger monitor it's not that big of a

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.810 
bigger monitor it's not that big of a
deal<00:02:22.550> on<00:02:22.730> ma<00:02:22.970> 22<00:02:23.510> inch<00:02:23.690> i<00:02:23.960> believe<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.640> the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
deal on ma 22 inch i believe so the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.230 
deal on ma 22 inch i believe so the
window<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:26.390> maybe<00:02:26.600> you<00:02:27.500> know<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.940> good<00:02:28.940> part<00:02:29.210> of

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
window is maybe you know a good part of

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.270 
window is maybe you know a good part of
the<00:02:29.360> screen<00:02:29.600> still<00:02:29.930> but<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:30.950> does<00:02:31.100> take<00:02:31.220> a

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
the screen still but it does take a

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.770 
the screen still but it does take a
little<00:02:31.370> bit<00:02:31.520> two<00:02:31.610> games<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.600> was<00:02:32.720> a

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
game not quite used to the long-range

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.280 
graphic settings just make sure you
check<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.770> box<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.220> says<00:02:52.340> play<00:02:53.270> in<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.870> window

that the exact text of that is make sure

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.600 
that the exact text of that is make sure
that<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.750> do<00:03:00.020> that<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.770> could<00:03:01.010> give<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.400> a

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
that you do that you could give it a a

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.550 
that you do that you could give it a a
game<00:03:02.030> or<00:03:02.209> two<00:03:02.240> maybe<00:03:02.630> three<00:03:02.990> games<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.410> get

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
game or two maybe three games to get

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.750 
game or two maybe three games to get
used<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:03.980> fact<00:03:04.130> that<00:03:04.250> you're<00:03:04.370> playing<00:03:04.640> on

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
used to the fact that you're playing on

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.540 
used to the fact that you're playing on
it<00:03:04.910> what<00:03:05.060> is<00:03:05.180> essentially<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.690> smaller<00:03:06.050> monitor

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
it what is essentially a smaller monitor

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.890 
it what is essentially a smaller monitor
but<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:07.790> should<00:03:08.120> give<00:03:08.330> you<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.600> little<00:03:08.750> bit

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
but it should give you a little bit

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.600 
but it should give you a little bit
increase<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.410> performance<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.190> little<00:03:10.490> bit

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
increase in performance and a little bit

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.920 
increase in performance and a little bit
more<00:03:10.730> stability<00:03:10.940> hopefully<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.810> guys

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
more stability hopefully you guys

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.160 
more stability hopefully you guys
enjoyed<00:03:12.260> this<00:03:12.760> until<00:03:13.760> next<00:03:13.910> time<00:03:14.170> happy
